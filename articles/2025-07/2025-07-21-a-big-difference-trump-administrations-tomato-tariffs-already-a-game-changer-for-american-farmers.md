title: "\u201CA Big Difference\u201D: Trump Administration\u2019s Tomato Tariffs Already\
  \ a Game Changer for American Farmers"
---
 
In a decisive move to protect American agriculture and restore fairness,
the Trump Administration’s
[tariffs](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-imposes-tariff-fresh-mexican-tomatoes/)
on fresh Mexican tomato imports are already boosting American farmers,
growers, and business owners.

**Here’s what they’re saying:**

-   [**Chad Smith, Smith Tomato Farm (Steele,
    AL)**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1947286508408287290)**:**
    “It’s only been two days now, and we actually have a lot more calls
    of people having interest in doing business — and the price hasn’t
    even changed.”
-   [**Matt Rudd, Rudd Family Farm (Browns Summit,
    NC)**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1947292988951978355)**:**
    “What you see in the grocery store now, instead of all those
    tomatoes from Mexico and everywhere else, it should be more local
    and United States-grown — where we can compete with those prices.”
-   [**Rich Troccio, Bloomfield Groceria (Pittsburgh,
    PA)**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1947346717457662364)**:**
    “It will not bother me if he put a 50% tariff on Mexico. It wouldn’t
    bother me because I don’t buy from there. It’s just the way I am. As
    long as it’s something grown here, this is where I want to buy my
    product.”
-   [**Sam Newell, Fruit Fair (Chicopee,
    MA)**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1947347389691351385)**:**
    “It’s a win-win for the community and us. Having tariffs on imported
    goods gives us a more level playing field.”
-   [**Mark Reuben, Gilcrease Orchard (Las Vegas,
    NV)**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1947303220205817892)**:**
    “We won’t raise our price, so it will stay $1.50/pound, which is
    what we charge.”
-   [**Logan Duvall, Me and McGee Market (Little Rock,
    AR)**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1947322357221032157)**:**
    “I can’t see how the tariffs are going to be negative on us at all.
    Being as tomatoes are a massive part of what we do, and we see the
    impact when that money goes directly to our farmers in our community
    versus a multinational conglomerate — it’s a big difference.”
-   [**Steve Longmire, Tennessee Homegrown Tomatoes (Rutledge,
    TN)**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1947329061698568459)**:**
    “In the fall and wintertime, we have to count on — and, you know,
    the nation does — tomatoes in the warmer climates, so that’s where
    it’s going to be a good thing for the farmer. Hopefully more of
    their tomatoes are going to sell at a little bit better price
    because of the tariff on the imports.”
-   [**Patty Morgan, Grainger County (TN) Tomato
    Festival**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1947329061698568459):
    “It’s a huge industry in our county.”
