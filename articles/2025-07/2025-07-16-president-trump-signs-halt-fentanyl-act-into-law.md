title: President Trump Signs HALT Fentanyl Act into Law
---
 
Today, surrounded by families who have lost loved ones to the scourge of
fentanyl, President Donald J. Trump [officially
signed](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1945570398436839886) the
[HALT Fentanyl
Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/27) into
law — permanently classifying fentanyl-related substances as a Schedule
I drug under the Controlled Substances Act.

As President Trump
[said](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1945567662211227826), the
legislation is “delivering another defeat for the savage drug smugglers
and criminals and the cartels” — and is just one of the many historic
actions the Trump Administration has taken to end the carnage wrought by
foreign drug cartels in our communities.

**President Trump was joined by a few of the millions of Americans whose
lives have been permanently changed by the fentanyl epidemic:**

-   **Greg Swan, who lost his son to fentanyl:** “I would just like to
    say, thank you, Mr. President, for stopping the border crossings —
    full stop, mic drop … It was amazing what you did. We were being
    gaslit — and you came and lit a fire to that story, and we’re a lot
    safer for of it.”

-   **Anne Fundner, who lost her son to fentanyl:** “In the last four
    years, fentanyl became the number one killer to Americans ages 15 to
    48 … President Trump, for four years we felt ignored, but you’ve
    changed that … It is a lifeline for families across America in
    keeping our families safe … Thank you for keeping America safe for
    our children. This is what we voted for.”

    overdoses:** “Mr. President, it’s an honor to be here today on
    behalf of our family … for this important signing.”
