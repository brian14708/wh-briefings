title: President Trump Delivers on MAHA Push
---
 
President Donald J. Trump took office promising to confront the chronic
health crisis plaguing Americans — and six months later, he is
delivering on that promise by removing harmful chemicals from our food
supply.

Today, the Trump Administration announced that dozens of ice cream
companies — representing more than 90% of the ice cream volume sold in
the U.S. — have pledged to eliminate the use of certified artificial
colors in their ice cream and frozen dairy products.

**They join a growing group of leading companies that have taken steps
