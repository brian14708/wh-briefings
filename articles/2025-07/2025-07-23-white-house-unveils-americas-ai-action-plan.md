WASHINGTON, DC – The White House today released [“Winning the AI Race:
America’s AI Action
Plan”](https://webdevelopmentgroup.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6821469cd180710d53bfc94d1&id=fb58ad6a8c&e=f395826b19),
in accordance with President Trump’s January executive order on
[Removing Barriers to American Leadership in
AI](https://webdevelopmentgroup.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6821469cd180710d53bfc94d1&id=e9298b3abc&e=f395826b19).
Winning the AI race will usher in a new golden age of human flourishing,
economic competitiveness, and national security for the American
people.  
  
The Plan identifies over 90 Federal policy actions across three pillars
– Accelerating Innovation, Building American AI Infrastructure, and
Leading in International Diplomacy and Security – that the Trump
Administration will take in the coming weeks and months.  
  
Key policies in the AI Action Plan include:

-   **Exporting American AI:** The Commerce and State Departments will
    partner with industry to deliver secure, full-stack AI export
    packages – including hardware, models, software, applications, and
    standards – to America’s friends and allies around the world.
-   **Promoting Rapid Buildout of Data Centers:** Expediting and
    modernizing permits for data centers and semiconductor fabs, as well
    as creating new national initiatives to increase high-demand
    occupations like electricians and HVAC technicians.
-   **Enabling Innovation and Adoption:** Removing onerous Federal
    regulations that hinder AI development and deployment, and seek
    private sector input on rules to remove.
-   **Upholding Free Speech in Frontier Models:** Updating Federal
    procurement guidelines to ensure that the government only contracts
    with frontier large language model developers who ensure that their
    systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias.

“America’s AI Action Plan charts a decisive course to cement U.S.
dominance in artificial intelligence. President Trump has prioritized AI
as a cornerstone of American innovation, powering a new age of American
leadership in science, technology, and global influence. This plan
galvanizes Federal efforts to turbocharge our innovation capacity, build
cutting-edge infrastructure, and lead globally, ensuring that American
workers and families thrive in the AI era. We are moving with urgency to
make this vision a reality,” **said White House Office of Science and
Technology Policy Director Michael Kratsios.**  
  
“Artificial intelligence is a revolutionary technology with the
potential to transform the global economy and alter the balance of power
in the world. To remain the leading economic and military power, the
United States must win the AI race. Recognizing this, President Trump
directed us to produce this Action Plan. To win the AI race, the U.S.
must lead in innovation, infrastructure, and global partnerships. At the
same time, we must center American workers and avoid Orwellian uses of
AI. This Action Plan provides a roadmap for doing that,” **said AI and
Crypto Czar David Sacks.**  
  
“Winning the AI Race is non-negotiable. America must continue to be the
dominant force in artificial intelligence to promote prosperity and
protect our economic and national security. President Trump recognized
this at the beginning of his administration and took decisive action by
commissioning this AI Action Plan. These clear-cut policy goals set
expectations for the Federal Government to ensure America sets the
technological gold standard worldwide, and that the world continues to
run on American technology,” **said Secretary of State and Acting
National Security Advisor Marco Rubio.**
