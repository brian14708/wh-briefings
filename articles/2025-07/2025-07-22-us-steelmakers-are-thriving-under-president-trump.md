title: American Steelmakers Are Thriving Under President Trump
---
 
**The U.S. steel industry is back under President Donald J. Trump.**
After languishing under a Biden-era stranglehold — plagued by unfair
foreign competition, job losses, and weakened national security as
imports flooded the market and domestic production stalled — the steel
industry is quickly roaring back to life.

**U.S. steelmakers are proving that strong leadership and protective
tariffs are the keys to revitalizing American manufacturing.**

        “Cliffs is a major supplier of steel to the automotive
        manufacturers, and the Trump Administration continues to show
        strong support to both the domestic steel and the domestic
        automotive sectors. We have started to see the positive impact
        that tariffs have on domestic manufacturing, protecting domestic
        jobs and national security. We expect this trend to continue,
        promoting the resurgence of the American automotive industry
        supported by a thriving domestic steel industry.”
