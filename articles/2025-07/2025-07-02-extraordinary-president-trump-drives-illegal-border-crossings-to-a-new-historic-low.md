title: "\u201CEXTRAORDINARY\u201D: President Trump Drives Illegal Border Crossings\
  \ to a New Historic Low"
---
 
Border Patrol encountered [just 6,070 illegal
immigrants](https://x.com/RealTomHoman/status/1940156659084796257) at
the southern border in June — another record-setting low (15% lower than
the previous record set in March) that underscores the effectiveness of
President Donald J. Trump’s robust border enforcement policies and
aggressive deportation measures.

It’s a stark contrast to the Biden Administration, when [approximately
10,000 unvetted
migrants](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/unlawful-crossings-along-southern-border-reach-new-historic-low/#:~:text=At%20their%20peak%20in%20late%202023%2C%20daily%20illegal%20crossings%20at%20the%20southern%20border%20topped%2010%2C000%20on%20some%20days.)
were illegally crossing the southern border every day at the peak of the
invasion — most of whom were
[released](https://nypost.com/2024/01/09/news/dhs-secretary-admits-over-85-of-migrants-being-allowed-into-us-report/)
into the country with little or no oversight.

**Here’s what you need to know:**

-   Nationwide illegal immigrant encounters over the month were the
    lowest on record.
-   For the second straight month, no illegal immigrants were released
    into the country’s interior.
-   On June 28, Border Patrol hit a single-day record low number of
    illegal immigrant encounters at the southern border (just 137).
-   The number of “gotaways” — illegal immigrants who escaped into the
    country undetected — was 90% lower compared to the same month last
    year.
-   This fiscal year is on track to see the fewest illegal immigrant
    encounters in five decades.

Now, Congress has a chance to fortify this progress by sending the One
Big Beautiful Bill to President Trump’s desk — which includes funding to
finish the border wall, hire thousands of new border personnel, expand
detention capabilities, and fund at least one million deportations per
year.
