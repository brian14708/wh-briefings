title: "Economic Growth Shatters Expectations as President Trump Fuels America\u2019\
  s Golden Age"

> *“Today, GDP growth came in above market expectations, and yesterday,
> consumer confidence rose. Americans trust in President Trump’s America
> First economic agenda that continues to prove the so-called ‘experts’
> wrong. President Trump has reduced America’s reliance on foreign
> products, boosted investment in the US, and created thousands of jobs
> — delivering on his promise to Make America Wealthy Again. The data is
> clear, and there are no more excuses — now is the time for ‘too late’
> Powell to cut the rates!”* — Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt

### **Here’s what you need to know:**

-   **The so-called “experts” were wrong (again).** The U.S. economy
    grew at a [3.0%
    pace](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/30/gdp-q2-2025-.html) in Q2,
    shattering economists’ expectations — with nearly three-fourths of
    the economists surveyed by Bloomberg getting it wrong.  
      
-   **Consumer spending growth accelerated as inflation remains right on
    track.**
    -   <span style="letter-spacing: 0.2px">Real consumer spending
        growth rose from Q1 (+0.5%) to Q2 (+1.4%).</span>
    -   <span style="letter-spacing: 0.2px">The Personal Consumption
        Expenditures Price Index (PCE) — the Fed’s preferred measure of
        inflation — rose by just 2.1% in Q2, down from 3.7% last quarter
        — while core PCE rose by 2.5%, down from 3.5% last
        quarter.</span>
    -   Americans’ total real disposable income rose at a strong 3.0% in
        Q2 after a similarly strong 2.5% increase in the first
        quarter.  
          
-   **Growth is being driven by the private sector — not the
    government.** Federal government spending fell for the second
    straight quarter, while real business fixed investment rose by 1.9%
    following its first quarter surge.
    -   In the final two quarters of the Biden Administration, real
        business fixed investment rose at an average pace of just 0.5% —
        compared to 6.1% in the first two quarters of the Trump
        Administration.  
          
-   **President Trump’s Made in America agenda is working.** President
    Trump is reducing our reliance on foreign products, boosting U.S.
    investment, and creating jobs as he secures the biggest [trade
    deals](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/07/fact-sheet-the-united-states-and-european-union-reach-massive-trade-deal/)
    in history.
    -   <span style="letter-spacing: 0.2px">Auto output rose at a 35.5%
        annual rate — the biggest increase since 2020 — as President
        Trump revitalizes the American auto industry and encourages
        domestic production.</span>
    -   <span style="letter-spacing: 0.2px">Manufacturing output has
        surged 1.8% in the first five months of President Trump’s second
        term after a -0.7% decline in the final five months before
        President Trump’s inauguration.</span>  
          
-   **Economic momentum continues to build, defying expectations at
    every turn.**
    -   For five straight months, core inflation has come in below
        market expectations and remains right in line with the Fed’s
        inflation target.
