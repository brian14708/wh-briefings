title: Inflation Remains Right on Target Under President Trump
---
 
*“Every month since President Trump took office, core inflation — the
best measure of inflation — has beat or matched expectations. The data
proves that President Trump is stabilizing inflation and the Panicans
continue to be wrong about tariffs raising prices.”* — White House Press
Secretary Karoline Leavitt

Under President Donald J. Trump, America continues to beat back
inflation after years of Biden-induced price hikes.

**Here’s what you need to know from the latest Consumer Price Index:**

-   **June data confirms inflation is right on track.** The annualized
    rate of inflation is below the year-earlier pace, showing that
    prices are right on track.
-   **Core inflation beat expectations for another month.** Since
    President Trump took office, core inflation has tracked at just 2.1%
    — levels not seen since the first Trump Administration, when prices
    were low and stable — and has come in below or at economists’
    expectations every single month.
-   **Wage growth remains strong under President Trump.** Real wages for
    production and nonsupervisory workers are up 1.3% over last year.
-   **Prices for everyday Americans continue to fall.** Prices for new
    and used vehicles and airfares fell last month, while annualized
    shelter inflation dropped to its lowest in nearly four years — with
    prices for gas, fuel oil, energy commodities, hotels, airfare,
    public transportation, and fresh vegetables all

    over last year.

**Here’s what they’re saying:**

-   [**CNBC’s Rick
    Santelli**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1945106850493448379)**:**
    “Inflation is going to ebb and flow. If we want to really isolate it
    in terms of what this Administration is doing or Liberation Day, I
    would benchmark it to the beginning of the year. January and
    February reads being warmer gives you a lot of information that some
    of the policies have not been detrimental in boosting inflation.”
-   [**CNBC’s Rick
    Santelli**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1945107173006070117)**:**
    “The death of the labor market has been greatly exaggerated based on
    recent data, and I think that all in all, the inflation numbers —
    they’re pretty respectable here.”
-   [**Fox Business Network’s Maria
    Bartiromo**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1945106403472875825)**:**
    “You’ve got to look at this report as another victory for President
    Trump, who has focused on reigning in inflation — and that’s what
    we’re seeing from this report again.”
