title: This Newspaper Continues to Run Shameful Interference for Illegal Immigrants
---
 
*The Minnesota Star Tribune*
[reports](https://x.com/StarTribune/status/1949953231401943477): “ICE
wants to deport Wisconsin driver charged with being drunk, causing crash
that killed 2 Minnesota teens.”

That “Wisconsin driver” is an [illegal
immigrant](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/07/27/ice-lodges-arrest-detainer-illegal-alien-who-killed-two-teens-while-intoxicated)
from Honduras who drove drunk, on a revoked license and with open booze
containers, down the wrong way of the highway, killing two [innocent
teenagers](https://www.foxnews.com/us/dhs-two-wisconsin-teens-would-still-alive-not-sanctuary-policies-protecting-illegal-immigrant)
from Minnesota — and yes, the Trump Administration “wants to deport”
her.

**Why are media outlets like the *Star Tribune* so obsessed with running
cover for the criminal illegal immigrants putting our communities at
risk?**

In recent months, the newspaper has
[defended](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1947635153603317938)
criminal illegal immigrant sex offenders whose photos and sex
convictions were “flaunted” online,
[sympathized](https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1943053156054597966) with
criminal illegals convicted of sex crimes —
[including](https://x.com/HSISaintPaul/status/1931408728642707796)
sexual abuse of a minor — as merely a “cultural misunderstanding,” and
[suggested](https://www.startribune.com/tolkkinen-we-will-all-pay-the-price-for-trumps-immigration-policy-and-we-should/601201545)
citizens “pay the price” for deporting dangerous criminal illegals out
of our communities.

Of course, they’re taking their cues from serial illegal immigrant
defender [Tim
Walz](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/07/democrats-inspire-vicious-escalating-attacks-on-ice/#:~:text=Gov.%20Tim%20Walz%20smeared%20ICE%20agents%20as%20the%20%E2%80%9Cmodern%2Dday%20Gestapo.%E2%80%9D)
and the [state’s other pro-“sanctuary”
politicians](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/02/sick-politicians-want-killers-rapists-roaming-our-streets/)
who would rather see killers, rapists, and gangbangers left on the
streets than sent back where they belong.

**Meanwhile, the Trump Administration will keep doing everything it can
to prevent these unspeakable, unnecessary tragedies from happening
again.**
