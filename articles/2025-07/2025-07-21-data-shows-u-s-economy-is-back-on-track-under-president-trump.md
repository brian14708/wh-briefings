Even the media
[admits](https://www.wsj.com/economy/the-u-s-economy-is-regaining-its-swagger-922623e3?mod=hp_lead_pos1)
the U.S. economy is “regaining its swagger” under President Donald J.
Trump — and you need not look further than the banner economic news from
the past week for proof.

-   Core inflation [beat market
    expectations](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/07/inflation-remains-right-on-target-under-president-trump/)
    for the fifth straight month — every full month since President
    Trump took office.
    -   Since President Trump took office, core inflation has tracked at
        just 2.1% — levels not seen since the first Trump
        Administration, when prices were low and stable — and right in
        line with the Fed’s inflation target.
-   Wholesale prices came in [completely
    flat](https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/07/16/producer-prices-there-was-no-inflation-at-all-in-june/),
    below market expectations and underscoring the tremendous progress
    made on taming the Biden-era inflation crisis.
-   Industrial production
    [bested](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-industrial-production-climbs-03-june-more-expected)
    market expectations with a higher-than-expected climb, showing that
    inflation is falling as domestic production surges.
    -   Manufacturing output has surged by 1.8% in the first five months
        of President Trump’s second term, compared to a -0.7% decline in
        the final five months preceding President Trump’s inauguration.
-   Customs and tariff revenues have totaled $120 billion since
    President Trump took office — topping $100 billion in a fiscal year
    for the [first time
    ever](https://www.reuters.com/business/trumps-tariff-collections-expected-grow-june-us-budget-data-2025-07-11/)
    — including $7 billion in the last week alone, fueling the first
    June budget surplus in nearly a decade.
-   Advance retail sales [smashed
    expectations](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/us-retail-sales-growth-steady-job-market-bolster-feds-rate-cut-delay-2025-07-17/)
    in June, showing that consumers are confident and spending thanks to
    low inflation and strong wage gains.
-   Consumer sentiment [shot
    up](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-18/us-consumer-sentiment-rises-as-inflation-expectations-improve)
    in July, beating market expectations yet again as inflation
    expectations for the next year dropped sharply.
-   Initial claims for unemployment benefits
    [fell](https://apnews.com/article/unemployment-benefits-jobless-claims-layoffs-labor-4e99a3614f01c8f850d651d99a36dbae)
    for the fifth straight week, confirming the [strong jobs
    report](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/07/june-boom-jobs-report-shows-the-economy-continues-to-soar-under-president-trump/).
