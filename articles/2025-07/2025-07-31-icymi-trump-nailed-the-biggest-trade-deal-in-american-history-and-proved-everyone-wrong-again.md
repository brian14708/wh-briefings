President Donald J. Trump’s [trade
deal](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/07/fact-sheet-the-united-states-and-european-union-reach-massive-trade-deal/)
with the European Union has been
[hailed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/07/what-they-are-saying-landmark-u-s-eu-trade-deal-is-another-big-win-for-americans/)
as among the most consequential trade deals in history — securing
massive investments, finally addressing the [lopsided trade
deficit](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1949809461922578934), [securing

**It’s just the latest example of just how wrong President Trump’s

economic doom and gloom, ever since the self-proclaimed Tariff Man
declared April 2 as ‘Liberation Day,’ fulfilling his long-held personal
theory that tariffs are key to economic wealth.*

*Trade war! Recession! Stagflation! Skyrocketing inflation! Stock market
crash!*

*You name it, they predicted Trump’s tariffs would sink the economy.*

*Trump was defying economic orthodoxy, so he just had to be wrong.*

*But it’s turned out that the lofty group-thinkers were wrong, not that
most of them will admit it.”*
