title: Senate Democrats Just Voted Against Lower Taxes, Higher Pay, National Security,
  and More

The One Big Beautiful Bill just
[PASSED](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1940079817686413712) the
U.S. Senate, moving the landmark legislation one step closer to
President Donald J. Trump’s desk — and once again, it was done without
the support of a single Democrat.

**This is what Democrats just unanimously opposed:**

-   **Lower taxes and bigger paychecks.** This means [bigger
    paychecks](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Preserving-and-Expanding-Low-Tax-Rates-to-Create-American-Economic-Prosperity.pdf)
    with the [largest tax
    cut](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/x-23-25.pdf)
    in history for middle- and working-class Americans — plus No Tax on
    Tips, No Tax on Overtime, [No Tax on Social
    Security](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/07/no-tax-on-social-security-is-a-reality-in-the-one-big-beautiful-bill/),
    an expanded child tax credit, and a tax break on car loans for
    American-made vehicles.
-   **Strong border security.** This fortifies President Trump’s
    unprecedented border enforcement action — which includes funding to
    deport one million illegal immigrants per year, finish the border
    wall, and hire 10,000 new ICE officers, 5,000 new Customs officers,
    and 3,000 new Border Patrol agents.
-   **Protecting Medicaid for American citizens who need it.** This
    strengthens Medicaid for Americans who rely on it — like pregnant
    women, children, seniors, people with disabilities, and low-income
    families — while eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse.
-   **Modernizing air traffic control.** This allows President Trump to

    [overhaul](https://transportation.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=408584)
    and improve the systems that keep Americans flying safely and
    efficiently.
-   **Revolutionizing the nation’s defense.** This funds President
    Trump’s [Golden
    Dome](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/the-iron-dome-for-america/)
    missile defense shield, restocks America’s arsenal, delivers the
    largest Coast Guard upgrade since WWII, and improves our military
    readiness.
-   **Protecting family farmers.** The bill prevents punitive double
    taxation from hitting two million family farms.
-   **Unleashing American energy dominance.** This finally ends Biden’s
    war on American energy and drives down energy costs — making America
    less dependent on foreign adversaries.
-   **Reversing runaway spending.** This slashes deficits by over $2
    trillion and rescinds billions of dollars in wasteful funding for
    Biden’s Green New Scam.
