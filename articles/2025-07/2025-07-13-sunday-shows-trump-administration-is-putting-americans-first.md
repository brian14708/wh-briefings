title: 'SUNDAY SHOWS: Trump Administration is Putting Americans First'
---
 
This morning, officials joined the Sunday shows to discuss the historic
steps the Trump Administration is taking to ensure the safety and
security of the American people — including the government-wide response
to the devastating Texas flooding, unprecedented action to secure the
homeland, and protecting our national security through supply chain
resiliency.

**Here’s what you missed:**

#### **Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem**

-   “Within just an hour or two after the flooding, we had resources
    from the Department of Homeland Security there helping those
    individuals in Texas … This is the fastest, I believe, in years,
    maybe decades, that FEMA has been deployed to help individuals in
    this type of a situation.”

-   “This is what I think is really unfortunate is that we have a
    situation where so many individuals are playing politics with what
    happened to Texas.”

-   “This week, we’ve got murderers off the street, rapists, child
    pedophiles. If you look at that marijuana grow facility that we
    recently just did an operation on, over 319 individuals were brought
    into custody — and 14 unaccompanied children.”

#### **Border Czar Tom Homan**

-   “If you’re in the country legally, you shouldn’t fear ICE — but what
    you should fear is the criminal aliens walking the communities in
    sanctuary cities.”

-   “You didn’t see \[Democrats\] complaining about, under the Biden
    Administration, people being held in a Border Patrol parking lot
    surrounded by a fence in the sweltering heat. Not a word. You didn’t
    a word about half a million children being trafficked into the
    country and them not being able to locate 300,000 … They ignored
    four years of open borders, historic migrant death, historic
    Americans dying from fentanyl, historic numbers of women and
    children being sex trafficked, historic number of people on the
    terrorist watchlist coming across the border. Silence.”

#### **National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett**

-   “Tariff revenue over the next ten years — which will help reduce the
    deficit and secure our entitlement programs — it’s $3 trillion, and
    consumers haven’t seen that.”
    [*Watch*](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1944404865980977448)
-   “We’re trying to put America First … This is about America getting
    itself ready for the Golden Age by getting our house in order, by
    getting our tariff and trade policy and tax policy exactly where it
    needs to be for a Golden Age.”
    [*Watch*](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1944406667187089892)
-   “If there is a time of war, we need to have the metals that we need
    to produce American weapons, and copper is a key component in many
    American weapons. As we look forward to the threats that America
    faces, the President decided that we have plenty of copper in the
    U.S., but not enough copper production — and that’s why he has taken
    this strong step.”
