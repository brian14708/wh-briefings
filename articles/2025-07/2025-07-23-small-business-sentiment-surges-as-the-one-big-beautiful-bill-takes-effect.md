“Small business owners are matching the market with increased
confidence,” [CNBC
reports](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/22/main-street-business-confidence-rises-trump-tariffs-economy.html)
in their latest [Small Business
Survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/cnbcsurveymonkey-small-business-index-q3-2025/?utm_source=cnbc_2025)
— which shows a renewed sense of economic optimism as President Donald
J. Trump’s policies deliver results and as the landmark One Big
Beautiful Bill takes effect.

**Here’s what you need to know:**

-   Nearly half of small business owners rate the economy as “excellent”
    or “good” — up from 30% in the previous quarter.
-   More than half of small business owners expect revenue to increase
    over the next year — up 10% from last quarter — and more describe
    their business conditions as “good.”
-   Fewer small business owners “have been, or expect to be impacted by
    tariffs.”
-   There has been a sharp decline in the number of small business
    owners who expect government regulations, tax policy, and trade
    policy to negatively impact their operations.
-   Confidence in President Trump has spiked, with nearly six-in-ten
    small business owners approving of his job performance — improving
    sentiment shared “across the political spectrum.”

        about business conditions compared with the previous quarter.”
