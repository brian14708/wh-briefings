title: "Taxpayer-Funded Benefits Are for American Citizens \u2014 Not Illegals"
---
 
**Today, at the direction of President Donald J. Trump, the
Administration is taking the biggest step in more than 30 years to
protect taxpayer-funded benefits for American citizens — NOT illegal
aliens.** The move, which preserves roughly $40 billion in benefits for
American citizens, overturns decades of bureaucratic defiance and builds
on President Trump’s [executive
order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/ending-taxpayer-subsidization-of-open-borders/)
directing an END to the subsidization of open borders.

**Under President Trump, hardworking Americans will no longer be forced
to front the cost of benefits for illegals:**

-   The **Department of Health and Human Services** is
    [restricting](https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/prwora-hhs-bans-illegal-aliens-accessing-taxpayer-funded-programs.html)
    illegal aliens from 13 additional public programs, including Head
    Start, health workforce scholarships and loans, mental health and
    substance abuse support, family planning, and more.
-   The **Department of Education** is
    [ending](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-ends-taxpayer-subsidization-of-postsecondary-education-illegal-aliens)
    free tuition for illegal aliens at post-secondary career and
    technical education programs.
-   The **Department of Agriculture** is
    [restricting](https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/07/10/secretary-rollins-prevents-illegal-aliens-receiving-taxpayer-funded-snap-benefits)
    illegal aliens from federally funded food assistance programs.
-   The **Department of Labor** is
    [barring](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osec/osec20250710)
    illegal aliens from accessing federal workforce development
    resources and grants.
-   The **Department of Justice** is closing longstanding loopholes that
    have allowed illegal aliens to access taxpayer-funded benefits.
