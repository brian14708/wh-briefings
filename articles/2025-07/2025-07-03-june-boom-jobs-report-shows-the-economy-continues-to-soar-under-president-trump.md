title: 'June Boom: Jobs Report Shows the Economy Continues to Soar Under President
  Trump'
---
 
*“For the FOURTH month in a row, jobs numbers have beat market
expectations with nearly 150,000 good jobs created in June.
American-born workers have accounted for ALL of the job gains since
President Trump took office and wages continue to rise. The economy is
booming again and it will only get better when the One, Big, Beautiful
Bill is passed and implemented.” —White House Press Secretary Karoline
Leavitt*

Under President Donald J. Trump’s leadership, the economy had another
stellar month — with wage increases for hardworking Americans, a falling
unemployment rate, and a labor market that’s once again benefitting
American citizens.

-   In June, the
    U.S. [added](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1940757426627924168) 147,000
    jobs — beating expectations for the [fourth straight
    month](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/06/trump-effect-higher-pay-for-american-workers/). 
-   The April and May numbers were revised 16,000 HIGHER. 
-   The unemployment
    rate [fell](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1940759175283495256) to
    4.1% — also beating expectations. 
-   Native-born workers now account
    for [ALL](https://x.com/jackikotkiewicz/status/1940758003319492908) job
    gains since January.
    -   Foreign-born employment has fallen -543,000 since January, while
        native-born employment has increased by 2,079,000.
    -   For the same months last year, foreign-born workers accounted
        for roughly 48% of new jobs.
-   Wages for working Americans continue to rise — with average
    hourly [earnings](https://x.com/SenatorBanks/status/1940757443602202706) up
    by close to 4% over the past year.

**Here’s what they’re saying:**

-   [Fox Business Network’s Cheryl
    Casone](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1940761392602402836):
    “You do have a strong employment picture … we have NOT seen
    inflation rise. In fact, inflation has been going down and going
    down and going down … prices are lower than they were for July 4th
    last year.”
-   [Job Creators Network CEO Alfredo
    Ortiz](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1940759992749212147):
    “Hats off to President Trump because this three-legged stool of his
    has really been powerful: The trade, taxes, and regulations
    together. It’s all about Jobs! Jobs! Jobs!”
-   [CNN’s Matt
    E](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1940758377921155552)[gan](https://whitehouse.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dace49741569f7585670378b3&id=260daf9154&e=40024b103d):
    “This jobs market is like the Energizer Bunny. Every single time we
    expect it to run out of steam, it just keeps going and going.”
-   [Bloomberg’s Jonathan
    Ferro](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1940759175283495256):
    “This is good news; much better than expected. An upside surprise on
    headline payrolls … jobless claims — MUCH LOWER than expected.
    Across the board here in the labor market, this is a pretty solid
    read!”
