**Ken Langone, co-founder of The Home Depot, says he has “never been
more excited about the future of America” than he is under President
Donald J. Trump.** In an
[interview](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/07/15/ken-langone-gop-bills-efforts-to-trigger-economic-growth-has-merit.html)
on CNBC, Langone praised President Trump’s economic policies,
leadership, and return of the American spirit.

**Here’s what you missed:**

-   [**On
    optimism**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1945152287296376950)**:**
    “If I told you how bullish I was, you wouldn’t believe it. I have
    never been more excited about the future of America than I am right
    now, right this minute, for a lot of reasons. Number one, like it or
    not, this guy is getting things done … He’s acting presidential. I’m
    impressed with the people he’s got around him.”
-   [**On his past
    reluctance**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1945155615153659984):
    “I am sold on Trump … I think he’s got a good shot at going down in
    history as one of our best presidents ever … What I’m seeing
    happening is absolutely nothing short of a great thing. People are
    walking with more bounce in their \[step\] — it’s all around … When
    you made a mistake, admit it.”
-   [**On
    tariffs**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1945154273320280505):
    “Initially, my concern was I don’t like tariffs; I like free trade.
    However, I think — damn it, give Trump credit. His instincts are
    good. Some of these things need to be fixed.”
-   [**On the One Big Beautiful
    Bill**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1945153373419794895)**:**
    “I was worried about inflation and I was worried about the deficit.
    I think there’s a lot of merit to the notion that it’s going to
    trigger such significant economic growth that we might see tax
    revenues going up through the profitability bracket.”
-   [**On foreign
    policy**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1945152287296376950):
    “The world is a mess, but I think it’s coming more in our direction
    than it was. I think that strike in Iran had significant symbolic
    meaning for the world that America is here and when our interests
    are at risk, we’re going to do something about it.”
