title: Democrats Inspire Vicious, Escalating Attacks on ICE
---
 
As ICE agents risk their lives to secure our borders and protect our
communities, they’re facing a [700%
surge](https://www.foxnews.com/us/dhs-assaults-ice-now-up-nearly-700-over-same-time-last-year)
in assaults — a direct consequence of dangerous, inflammatory rhetoric
from Democrat politicians.

**The attacks have only gotten more brazen in recent days:**

-   **On July 4, 11 leftist criminals**
    [**ambushed**](https://www.fox4news.com/news/texas-ice-detention-center-attack-alvarado)
    **officers at an ICE facility in Alvarado, Texas.** After defacing
    vehicles with anti-ICE graffiti — including “ICE pig” and “F— you
    pigs” — the assailants lured officers out of the building and opened
    fire, shooting one officer in the neck.

    **federal agents at an ICE facility in Portland, Oregon.** Officers
    were kicked, punched, and targeted with an “incendiary device.”
-   **On July 7, a man**

    **a barrage of gunfire at a Border Patrol facility in McAllen,
    Texas.** The attack, which saw dozens of rounds fired at the
    building and agents inside, sent two police officers and a Border
    Patrol employee to the hospital.
