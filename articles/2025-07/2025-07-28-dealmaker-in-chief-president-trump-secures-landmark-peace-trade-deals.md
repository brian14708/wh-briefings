President Donald J. Trump never stops working for the American people —
and that was on full display this weekend in Scotland, where President
Trump secured two major victories in his relentless pursuit of peace and
prosperity.

### **President Trump negotiates a landmark trade deal with the European Union.**

In Scotland, President Trump
[announced](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1949527667478319115) a
monumental trade deal with the European Union — finally addressing the
[enormous trade
deficit](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1949809461922578934),
[securing new market
access](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1949531486421737695),
clinching hundreds of billions of dollars in new U.S. investment, and
much more.

The move was immediately hailed — both
[internationally](https://www.reuters.com/business/view-reaction-us-eu-trade-deal-2025-07-27/)
and
[domestically](https://nypost.com/2025/07/27/us-news/trump-european-union-commission-president-give-50-50-chance-of-striking-trade-deal/#:~:text=Republican%20lawmakers%20back%20home%20quickly%20heralded%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20deal%20with%20the%20Europeans%20a%20significant%20victory.%C2%A0)
— as a “[big
win](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/27/us/politics/trump-europe-trade-deal.html)”
and
“[victory](https://www.ft.com/content/d4605098-0961-4ef7-b91f-2a5f8a5fe8d8)”
for the Trump Administration and the U.S.

They said it couldn’t be done — and President Trump did it.

### **President Trump brokers peace between Cambodia and Thailand.**

After President Trump spoke with leaders of

and
[Cambodia](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114920456511077924),
the two countries
[announced](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-28/thailand-cambodia-start-ceasefire-talks-amid-trump-trade-threat)
an “immediate and unconditional ceasefire” — leveraging their trade
relationships with the U.S. as incentive to do so.

It’s only the latest instance of the Trump Administration’s pursuit of
peace around the world after similar efforts brokered peace between
[Israel and
Iran](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114734934153569653),
[Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the
Congo](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1938695621893914797), [India
and Pakistan](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1921927350876332136),
[Egypt and Ethiopia](https://trumpstruth.org/statuses/31509), along with
the historic peace agreements from his first term — including with
[Serbia and
Kosovo](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114717932061341718)
and the [Abraham
Accords](https://2017-2021.state.gov/the-abraham-accords/).
