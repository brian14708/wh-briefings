During his campaign, President Donald J. Trump
[repeatedly](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-america-first-policy-gala-mar-a-lago-november-14-2024/#48:~:text=We%27re%20going%20to%20clean,not%20going%20to%20happen.)

to end the irreversible chemical and surgical mutilation of our
children: “We are not going to allow child sexual mutilation.”

**For years, politicians have promised to end the barbaric,
pseudoscientific practice — but President Trump is the only one who has
actually delivered.**

Center

they are ending their so-called “gender-affirming care services.” They
join a growing list of health systems across the country following
