SUBJECT: Reciprocal Trade and Tariffs

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.  The United
States has one of the most open economies and has among the lowest
average weighted tariff rates in the world.  The United States imposes
fewer barriers to imports than other major world economies, including
those with similar political and economic systems.  For many years, the
United States has been treated unfairly by trading partners, both friend
and foe.  This lack of reciprocity is one source of our country’s large
and persistent annual trade deficit in goods — closed markets abroad
reduce United States exports and open markets at home result in
significant imports.    
  
     Our workers and industries bear the brunt of unfair practices and
limited access to foreign markets.  As noted in the Presidential
Memorandum of January 20, 2025 (America First Trade Policy Memorandum),
this situation is untenable.  The trade deficit of the United States
threatens our economic and national security, has hollowed out our
industrial base, has reduced our overall national competitiveness, and
has made our Nation dependent on other countries to meet our key
security needs.  By making trade more reciprocal and balanced, we can
reduce the trade deficit; grow the United States economy; and improve
our trade relationships with trading partners to the benefit of American
workers, manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, entrepreneurs, and
businesses.    
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of the United States to reduce our large and persistent annual
trade deficit in goods and to address other unfair and unbalanced
aspects of our trade with foreign trading partners.  In pursuit of this
policy, I will introduce the “Fair and Reciprocal Plan”(Plan).  Under
the Plan, my Administration will work strenuously to counter
non-reciprocal trading arrangements with trading partners by determining
the equivalent of a reciprocal tariff with respect to each foreign
trading partner.  This approach will be of comprehensive scope,
examining non-reciprocal trade relationships with all United States
trading partners, including any:   
  
     (a)  tariffs imposed on United States products;   
  
     (b)  unfair, discriminatory, or extraterritorial taxes imposed by
our trading partners on United States businesses, workers, and
consumers, including a value-added tax;   
  
     (c)  costs to United States businesses, workers, and consumers
arising from nontariff barriers or measures and unfair or harmful acts,
policies, or practices, including subsidies, and burdensome regulatory
requirements on United States businesses operating in other
countries;   
  
     (d)  policies and practices that cause exchange rates to deviate
from their market value, to the detriment of Americans; wage
suppression; and other mercantilist policies that make United States
businesses and workers less competitive; and    
  
     (e)  any other practice that, in the judgment of the United States
Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary of the
Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Senior Counselor to the
President for Trade and Manufacturing, imposes any unfair limitation on
market access or any structural impediment to fair competition with the
market economy of the United States.   
  
     The Plan shall ensure comprehensive fairness and balance across the
international trading system by factoring in losses as a result of
measures that disadvantage the United States as applied, regardless of
what they are called or whether they are written or unwritten.    
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Taking Action</span>.  (a)
 After the submission of the specified agency reports due under the
America First Trade Policy Memorandum, the Secretary of Commerce and the
United States Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary
of the Treasury, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Assistant to
the President for Economic Policy, the Senior Counselor to the President
for Trade and Manufacturing, and the heads of such other executive
departments and agencies as the Secretary of Commerce and the United
States Trade Representative deem relevant, shall initiate, pursuant to
their respective legal authorities, all necessary actions to investigate
the harm to the United States from any non-reciprocal trade arrangements
adopted by any trading partners.  Upon completion of such necessary
actions, they shall submit to me a report detailing proposed remedies in
pursuit of reciprocal trade relations with each trading partner.  
  
     (b)  Within 180 days of the date of this memorandum, the Director
of the Office of Management and Budget shall assess all fiscal impacts
on the Federal Government and the impacts of any information collection
requests on the public, and shall deliver an assessment in writing to
the President.
