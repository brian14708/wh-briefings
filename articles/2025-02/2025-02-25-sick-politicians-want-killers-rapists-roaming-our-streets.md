title: Sick Politicians Want Killers, Rapists Roaming Our Streets
---
 
President Donald J. Trump is removing illegal immigrant killers,
rapists, and drug dealers from our streets and sending them back where
they belong — but if politicians in so-called “sanctuary” locales had it
their way, these vicious criminals would still be free to roam our
streets.

**Here is a tiny sample of the illegal immigrant criminals arrested in
“sanctuary” destinations under President Trump:**

-   **In Saint Paul, Minnesota,** ICE has arrested a Sudanese national
    convicted of rape of a victim under 13, a Mexican national convicted
    of criminal sexual conduct against a victim under 14, and a Laotian
    national convicted of child endangerment and criminal sexual conduct
    against a victim under 13.

        detainers” and

        protecting communities from violent illegal immigrant criminals
        is “not our job.”
