The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) — the
[brainchild](https://dailycaller.com/2021/09/30/rohit-chopra-cfpb-elizabeth-warren-joe-biden/)
of Sen. Elizabeth Warren — has long functioned as another woke,
weaponized arm of the bureaucracy that leverages its power against
certain industries and individuals disfavored by so-called “elites.”

For example:

Under the administration of President Donald J. Trump, the weaponization
ends right now.
