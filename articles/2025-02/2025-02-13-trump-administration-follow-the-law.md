title: 'Trump Administration: Follow the Law'
---
 
President Donald J. Trump and his administration have a simple message:
follow the law. Since taking office, the Trump Administration has wasted
no time taking action against states and entities which have opted for
defiance.

**Here are only a few examples:**

-   **The Department of Education** has
    [launched](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-launches-title-ix-investigations-two-athletic-associations)
    investigations into the California Interscholastic Federation and
    the Minnesota State High School League over their
    [failures](https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-high-school-league-under-federal-investigation-over-transgender-executive-order/601221147)
    to comply with President Trump’s [executive
    order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/keeping-men-out-of-womens-sports/)
    protecting girls in sports. The department has also
    [announced](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-probes-cases-of-antisemitism-five-universities)
    probes into the widespread anti-Semitic harassment at five public
    universities across the country.
-   **The Department of Justice (DOJ)** has
    [sued](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1889800647631114344) the
    State of New York and its top officials
    [over](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1889800647631114344)
    their willful failure to comply with federal immigration laws. The
    DOJ has also [filed
    lawsuits](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/trump-administration-sues-illinois-chicago-sanctuary-city-policies-rcna191079)
    against the State of Illinois and the City of Chicago over their
    dangerous and illegal so-called “sanctuary” policies.
-   **The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA)** has
    [announced](https://x.com/epaleezeldin/status/1889840040622321778)
    referrals to the Office of Inspector General and the DOJ over a
    scheme by outgoing Biden EPA staffers to bury billions of dollars in
    federal funding at an outside financial institution in an effort to
    shield the funds from oversight and accountability.
-   **The Federal Communications Commission (FCC)** has
    [opened](https://x.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1889752017150812321) an
    investigation into discriminatory DEI policies at Comcast — an
    entity which it regulates — following President Trump’s [executive
    order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/)
    ending such policies. The FCC has also [taken
    action](https://www.foxnews.com/media/fcc-chair-says-its-really-concerning-soros-backed-radio-station-exposed-undercover-ice-agents)
    against a Soros-backed, San Francisco-based radio station after the
    station broadcasted the locations of undercover federal immigration
    authorities conducting dangerous operations in the area, and has
    [launched](https://freebeacon.com/media/has-brendan-carr-finally-figured-out-how-to-stop-npr/)
    [an
    investigation](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/30/nx-s1-5281162/fcc-npr-pbs-investigation)
    into NPR and PBS over potential violations of federal laws.
-   **The Department of Homeland Security** has [“clawed
    back”](https://x.com/Sec_Noem/status/1889745682631721051) tens of
    millions of dollars in funds paid by rogue FEMA officials to house
    illegal aliens in luxury New York City hotels.
