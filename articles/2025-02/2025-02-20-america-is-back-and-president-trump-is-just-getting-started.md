    since President Trump took office.
-   The Department of Energy postponed burdensome Biden-era efficiency
    standard rules for the following appliances, saving American
    consumers large sums:
    -   Central air conditioners: Biden rules were slated to
        [make](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/consumer-group-exposes-costs-biden-admins-war-home-appliances)
        air conditioners $1,100 more expensive, according to Alliance

    By
    [requiring](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-launches-massive-10-to-1-deregulation-initiative/)
    agencies to identify at least ten existing rules, regulations, or
    guidance documents to be repealed for every one rule they
    promulgate, President Trump has put the U.S. on track to severely
    reduce regulatory costs for everyday Americans.
    -   The National Associations of Manufacturers
        [found](https://nam.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Regulations-Exec-Summary.pdf)

        “[estimates](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26309/w26309.pdf)
        that a one-mpg increase in CAFE standards costs consumers of all
        income levels approximately 0.5% of their income in the first
        year of the increase. By the 10th year following the increase,
        however, this cost becomes regressive, as the increase drives up
        the price of used cars. A one-mpg increase in CAFE standards
        costs consumers earning less than $25,000 per year 1.12% of
        their income, but only costs consumers earning more than $75,000
        per year 0.41% of their income.”
