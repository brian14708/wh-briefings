  \ Than a Trade Battle\u201D"

In today’s *USA TODAY*, White House Senior Counselor for Trade and
Manufacturing Peter Navarro
[outlined](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2025/02/28/trump-tariffs-aluminum-steel-canada-mexico-economy/80694166007/)
why President Donald J. Trump’s tariffs on aluminum imports are about
far more than just trade — they’re a fight for the survival of an
essential American industry.

President Trump is now writing a new story for the United States. With
one stroke of Trump’s pen, the Biden era of idled smelters and declining
capacity utilization will come to an end as a golden age of American
aluminum production regains its rightful place as a pillar of national
security and economic strength.

This is far more than a trade battle. It’s a fight for the survival of
an essential American industry.
