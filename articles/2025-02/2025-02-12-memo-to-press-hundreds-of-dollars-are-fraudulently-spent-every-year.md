title: 'Memo to Press: Hundreds of Dollars are Fraudulently Spent Every Year'
---
 
The New York Times
erroneously [wrote](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/trump-musk-oval-office.html) that
there is no “proof” for “sweeping claims” of “fraud” in federal
government spending.  
   
Apparently, the Times and other like-minded outlets lack access to a
newfangled research tool called Google.  
   
The [Government Accountability
Office](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-105833) released a report
just last year finding “No area of the federal government is immune to
fraud. We estimated that the federal government could lose between $233
billion and $521 billion annually to fraud.”  
   
President Donald J. Trump is determined to be a good steward of taxpayer
dollars and put an end to fraudulent and wasteful spending.
