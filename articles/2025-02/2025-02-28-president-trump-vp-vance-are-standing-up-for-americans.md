title: President Trump, VP Vance Are Standing Up for Americans
---
 
President Donald J. Trump and Vice President JD Vance will always stand
up for the interests of the American people and those who respect the
United States’ position in the world — and will never allow the American
people to be taken advantage of.

[**President
Trump**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1895528201713283105)**:**
**“Let me tell you, you don’t have the cards. With us, you have the
cards — but without us, you don’t have any cards.”**

-   More than half (52%) of Ukrainians want a quick end to the war and
    believe Ukraine “should be open to ceding some territory in exchange
    for peace,” [according to a November Gallup
    poll](https://news.gallup.com/poll/653495/half-ukrainians-quick-negotiated-end-war.aspx).
-   Since martial law was declared in Ukraine, 1,000,050 Ukrainians have
    been
    [drafted](https://kyivindependent.com/160-000-people-planned-to-be-drafted-into-ukrainian-forces-nsdc-secretary-says/)
    into military service. In October 2024, Ukraine announced it would
    be drafting another 160,000 — bringing the total number of
    conscripted Ukrainians to 1,160,050.
    -   The average [age](https://archive.ph/25Ljf) of Ukrainian troops
        is 43 years old.
    -   “Even if the West did come through with all the weapons they
        have pledged, ‘we don’t have the men to use them,’ one of
        Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky’s close aides
        [told](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/average-age-ukrainian-soldiers-past-40-and-could-be-problem)
        Time’s Simon Shuster, revealing that the average age of a
        Ukrainian soldier has already reached 43.”
-   One of Zelenskyy’s closest aides
    [told](https://time.com/6329188/ukraine-volodymyr-zelensky-interview/)
    TIME in 2023 that he is “\[deluding\] himself … We’re out of
    options. We’re not winning. But try telling him that.”
-   The Ukrainian army is [facing rising
    desertions](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-army-war-attrition/)
    as “ill-trained and exhausted soldiers \[go\] AWOL,” with the
    military further strained by struggles in recruiting and the
    “arrests of respected and popular combat officers.”

[**President
Trump**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1895527936939487722)**:
“You’re gambling with World War III.”**

-   Zelesnkyy himself has
    [acknowledged](https://time.com/6329188/ukraine-volodymyr-zelensky-interview/)
    that the situation in Ukraine could lead to WWIII, and that without
    U.S. aid, they would lose: “A third world war could start in
    Ukraine, continue in Israel, and move on from there to Asia, and
    then explode somewhere else.”

[**President
Trump**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1895528201713283105)**: “I
gave you the javelins to take out all those tanks. Obama gave you
sheets.”**

-   President Trump
    [gave](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-admin-approves-sale-anti-tank-weapons-ukraine/story?id=65989898)
    anti-tank javelin missiles to Ukraine, while Obama
    [gave](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/292600/pillows-and-sheets-vs-tank-busters-the-military-aid-trump-and-obama-sent-to-ukraine/#:~:text=The%20United%20States,Times%20in%202015.)
    non-lethal aid only,
    [including](https://www.euractiv.com/section/europe-s-east/news/poroshenko-asks-obama-for-weapons-obtains-blankets/)
    blankets.

[**Vice President
Vance**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1895527936939487722)**:
“You went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in
October.”**

-   Zelenskyy was called out for
    [campaigning](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4897284-zelensky-vance-pennsylvania-republicans-criticize/)
    against President Trump in Pennsylvania.
    -   “Zelenskyy was flown to Pennsylvania in an Air Force C-17
        plane.”
