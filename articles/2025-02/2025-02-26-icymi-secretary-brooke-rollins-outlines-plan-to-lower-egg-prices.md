title: 'ICYMI: Secretary Brooke Rollins Outlines Plan to Lower Egg Prices'
---
 
In today’s *Wall Street Journal*, Secretary of Agriculture Brooke
Rollins [lays
out](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/agriculture-secretary-brooke-rollins-my-plan-to-lower-egg-prices-6be0f881) the
Trump Administration’s comprehensive plan to bring down the price of
eggs.  
  
*“The Biden administration did little to address the repeated outbreaks
and high egg prices that followed. By contrast, the Trump administration
is taking the issue seriously. To that end, today I am announcing a
comprehensive strategy to combat avian influenza. The Agriculture
Department will invest up to $1 billion to curb this crisis and make
eggs affordable again. We are working with the Department of Government
Efficiency to cut hundreds of millions of dollars of wasteful spending.
We will repurpose some of those dollars by investing in long-term
solutions to avian flu, which has resulted in about 166 million laying
hens being culled since 2022.”*
