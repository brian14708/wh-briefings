According to [newly released
data](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/southwest-land-border-encounters)
from Customs and Border Protection (CBP), just 61,465 illegal aliens
were apprehended at the southern border during the entire month of
January — a 36% decline from the previous month. That number includes
29,116 apprehended along the border — [the lowest since May
2020](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-border-patrol-arrested-29000-migrants-illegally-crossing-mexico-border-2025-02-18/)
— and 32,349 at ports of entry.

**After President Trump took office, apprehensions** [**declined even
more
rapidly**](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/apprehensions-southwestern-border-plummeted-january-cbp/story?id=118908684#:~:text=From%20Jan.%2021%20through%20Jan.%2031%2C%20the%20number%20of%20U.S.%20Border%20Patrol%20apprehensions%20along%20the%20southwest%20border%20dropped%2085%25%20from%20the%20same%20period%20in%202024%2C%20according%20to%20data%20obtained%20by%20ABC%20News.%20In%20the%2011%20days%20after%20Jan.%2020%2C%20migrants%20apprehended%20at%20ports%20of%20entry%20declined%20by%2093%25.)**:**
*“From Jan. 21 through Jan. 31, the number of U.S. Border Patrol
apprehensions along the southwest border dropped 85% from the same
period in 2024, according to data obtained by ABC News. In the 11 days
after Jan. 20, migrants apprehended at ports of entry declined by 93%.”*

During the previous administration, the average number of illegal aliens
encountered at the southern border in January was 141,710 — the result
of dangerous policies that ferried illegal aliens directly into our
communities, where they were allowed to stay indefinitely.

Now, under President Trump, illegal border crossings are at [record
lows](https://nypost.com/2025/02/13/us-news/illegal-border-crossings-hit-record-lows-could-be-on-track-for-levels-not-seen-for-60-years/)
as illegal aliens are promptly
[arrested](https://x.com/RealTomHoman/status/1891592453897191690) and
[sent
home](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/deportation-flights-begin-trump-sends-strong-clear-message-white-house).
