title: President Donald J. Trump Secures Release of Another American Held Hostage
---
 
An American citizen held hostage in Belarus has been released thanks to
the leadership of President Donald J. Trump and his administration — the
second American released from captivity abroad in the past 24 hours and
the eleventh since President Trump took office.

**The remarkable success in freeing American citizens comes as the
United States displays a renewed strength under President Trump.** In
the [words of Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs Adam
Boehler](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1889737340513403371),
President Trump “has made bringing Americans home a top priority and
people respond to that.”

-   [**Secretary of State Marco
    Rubio:**](https://www.state.gov/welcoming-the-release-of-u-s-citizen-and-political-prisoners-from-captivity-in-belarus/)
    “President Trump’s strong leadership has led to the release of an
    American unjustly detained in Belarus and two political prisoners …
    We remain committed to the release of other U.S. citizens in Belarus
    and elsewhere.”
-   [**Press Secretary Karoline
    Leavitt:**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1889748654807773459)
    “It speaks to President Trump’s dealmaking ability … It’s a
    remarkable victory on the heels of Marc Fogel returning to America
    last night.”
-   [**Special Envoy Adam
    Boehler:**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1889738046465073560)
    “It’s happening now because the President of the United States has
    made it a top priority — and he leads through strength.”
-   [**Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Chris
    Smith:**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1889736748621599004)
    “A huge win — and a response to President Trump’s Peace through
    Strength agenda … We’re going to keep working until we get all
    Americans out.”
-   [**U.S. Ambassador to Lithuania Kara
    McDonald:**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1889736748621599004)
    “It is a big day for Team America, for the President, for the
    Secretary of State…”

**Promises made, promises kept.**
