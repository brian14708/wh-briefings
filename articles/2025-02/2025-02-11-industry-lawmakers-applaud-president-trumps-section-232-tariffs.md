Yesterday, President Donald J. Trump
[took](https://whitehouse.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dace49741569f7585670378b3&id=cfc30a2569&e=19eb8827a7)
decisive action to protect critical American industries by restoring a
25% tariff on steel imports and elevating the tariff to 25% on aluminum
imports — building on the [successful
tariffs](https://whitehouse.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dace49741569f7585670378b3&id=62aa1c6af5&e=19eb8827a7)
from his first term, which have since been undermined by loopholes and
exemptions.  
   
**The moves were quickly met with praise from industry, unions, and
lawmakers:**  
   
**Steel Manufacturers Association President Philip K. Bell:** “The steel
industry in America faces serious threats from foreign actors that seek
to destroy domestic production. China and other countries routinely
violate trade laws and dump heavily subsidized steel products into the
United States at the expense of American workers. By imposing a 25
percent tariff on steel imports, President Trump is leveling the playing
field for American manufacturers and workers and helping America defeat
direct threats to our jobs.”  
   
**United Steelworkers President David McCall:** “Our union welcomes
President Donald Trump’s efforts to contain the global overcapacity that
has for too long enabled bad actors like China to flood the global
market with its unfairly traded products, resulting in surging imports
into the United States, especially from Mexico.”  
   
[**Aluminum Association President Charles
Johnson:**](https://whitehouse.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dace49741569f7585670378b3&id=217fe77d98&e=19eb8827a7)
“We appreciate President Trump’s continued focus on strong trade actions
to support the aluminum industry in the United States. During his first
term the president was early to recognize the genuine threat that
non-market actors pose to U.S. manufacturing industries like ours …
Today, there is not enough smelting capacity in the United States to
supply the growing aluminum industry with the input materials it
needs.”  
   
[**American Iron and Steel Institute President Kevin
Dempsey:**](https://whitehouse.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dace49741569f7585670378b3&id=1014480e23&e=19eb8827a7)
“We look forward to working closely with the President and his
administration to implement a robust and reinvigorated trade agenda to
address the many foreign market-distorting policies and practices that
create an unlevel playing field for American steelmakers.”  
   
[**American Primary Aluminum Association President Mark
Duffy:**](https://whitehouse.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dace49741569f7585670378b3&id=4991b1e461&e=19eb8827a7)
“Today is a great day for the U.S. aluminum industry. Unfair trade
practices have devastated the domestic aluminum industry and President
Trump’s actions today will protect thousands of American workers and
their families.”  
   
**Coalition for a Prosperous America Chairman Zach Mottl:** “President
Trump’s decision to implement global tariffs is a critical step toward
restoring stability to American industry, safeguarding domestic
production, and ensuring these critical sectors are not harmed by a
surge of imports. The only way to rebuild domestic industrial capacity
is through strong and enforceable trade policies, and these tariffs are
a major step in the right direction.”  
   
**Nucor Corporation President Leon Topalian:** “Nucor strongly commends
the actions taken today by President Trump to reimpose tariffs on all
steel imports. America’s national security depends on a robust and
healthy American steel industry, which continues to be harmed by massive
global steel overcapacity and the resulting surge of illegally dumped
and subsidized imports from around the world. Many of our trading
partners have taken advantage of our open market for far too long and
have intentionally circumvented our trade laws or allowed other bad
actors to transship illegally dumped and subsidized steel. The
President’s actions will help level the playing field for American steel
producers.”  
   
**Energy Fair Trade Coalition Executive Director Bret Manley:**
“President Trump’s bold leadership will strengthen the backbone of
America – our steel and aluminum industry. E-FTC is proud to support
initiatives that will level the playing field, foster domestic job
growth, and promote fair reciprocal trade.”  
   
[**Century Aluminum Company CEO Jesse
Gary:**](https://whitehouse.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dace49741569f7585670378b3&id=436e0214d1&e=19eb8827a7)
“We strongly support today’s Executive Order from President Donald J.
Trump imposing a 25% tariff to stop the flood of aluminum imports into
the United States. President Trump’s decisive action will protect
national security and help level the playing field for America’s
aluminum workers. On behalf of our employees, I thank President Trump
for putting America first and strengthening the Section 232 tariffs,
which will help drive the resurgence of domestic aluminum production.”  
   
[**Lowell Iron and Steel Company President Dennis
Scanell:**](https://whitehouse.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dace49741569f7585670378b3&id=cccdb443a5&e=19eb8827a7)
“The tariffs, thank God they’re coming … Maybe this evens the playing
field for us, but this hits right at home. There’s no way we can compete
with Canada.”  
   
**America First Works:** “President Trump promised to put America First
and make our nation wealthy again; that is exactly what tariffs do. In
his first term, President Trump’s bold trade policies created over 4,000
new American jobs and higher wages for hardworking patriots. Foreign
nations will no longer be able to take advantage of the United States.
If they don’t like the tariffs, they can come to the table and make a
deal. In fact, that is what President Trump does best. China will no
longer exploit trade loopholes to undermine American workers. Now is the
time to stand strong, fight for fair trade, and put America FIRST where
it belongs!”

granted. That hurts our workers and disrespects our history.”

“If you have a high tariff on our product, and we have a low tariff on
your product, we ought to level them out. That just seems fair to me.”

(R-KS):**](https://whitehouse.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dace49741569f7585670378b3&id=c9f0c6e558&e=19eb8827a7)
“President Trump is a leader who brokers deals that put AMERICAN workers
first. The days of unfair, one-sided trade deals that let foreigners
take advantage of our country are over. The sky is not falling. @POTUS
is protecting our Steel and Aluminum industry workers — and in the end,
America will have the upper hand. As it should be.”

“President Trump’s approach to tariffs is designed with the long-term
benefits of American consumers and national security in mind. By
prioritizing fair trade policies and a balanced approach to tariffs,
we’ll secure the economic prosperity of American workers across the
country.”

“The media is in full meltdown mode after President Trump imposed duties
and retaliatory tariffs this week on countries who have been ripping us
off for decades. Both aluminum and steel are critical to our national
security — and we make some of the best in the world right here at home.
President Trump’s strategic tariffs will strengthen and revitalize our
nation’s economy by making sure our trade deals are fair to taxpayers
and the American worker.”

(R-MN):**](https://whitehouse.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dace49741569f7585670378b3&id=a413b9b171&e=19eb8827a7)
“President @realDonaldTrump is a master negotiator, especially when it
comes to tariffs. Don’t just take my word for it — even Biden’s own
commerce secretary admitted that the tariffs President Trump placed on
foreign steel and aluminum during his first term were effective.”  
   
[**Chairwoman Lisa McClain
(R-MI):**](https://whitehouse.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dace49741569f7585670378b3&id=b7fa96b262&e=19eb8827a7)

fairly, or pay the price.”

“President Trump is wasting no time moving forward with his America
First trade policy. The days of the United States allowing our trading
partners to steam roll us are over. President Trump successfully used
tariffs in the past to grow our economy and protect American jobs. He
imposed steel and aluminum tariffs in 2018, and now he is eliminating
exceptions countries like China have used to circumvent them. I look
forward to continuing to work with @POTUS to put America First and hold
our trading partners accountable.”

“Unfair trade practices have led to our nation being on the wrong end of
too many bad deals. That’s coming to an end. President Trump is taking
action to protect America’s steel and aluminum industries with his
latest executive order, continuing to put America first.”

“President @realDonaldTrump is taking action to protect the American
steel industry by closing loopholes that allow other countries to bypass
U.S. tariffs through Mexico and Canada. This move will strengthen
domestic production and encourage critical investment in U.S. Steel.”
