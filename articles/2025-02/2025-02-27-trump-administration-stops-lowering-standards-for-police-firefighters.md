title: Trump Administration Stops Lowering Standards for Police, Firefighters
---
 
President Donald J. Trump
[declared](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/)
[an
end](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-illegal-discrimination-and-restoring-merit-based-opportunity/)
to lower standards in the name of discriminatory “diversity, equity, and
inclusion” initiatives — and the Trump Administration continues to make
good on that commitment to prioritize merit, not divisive race-based
obsessions, in hiring.  
  
Yesterday, Attorney General Pam Bondi
[announced](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-pam-bondi-dismisses-dei-lawsuits-involving-police-officers-and-firefighters)
the Department of Justice (DOJ) dismissed several Biden-era lawsuits
against police and fire departments who used race-neutral mechanisms —
such as standard aptitude tests, physical exams, and credit checks — in
their hiring processes, the result of which lowered standards and
endangered public safety.

-   **DISMISSED:** *United States v. City of Durham (North Carolina)*
    -   The Biden DOJ
        [alleged](https://www.justice.gov/crt/case/united-states-v-durham-fire-department-mdnc)
        discrimination because entry-level firefighter applicants were
        required to pass a written exam. The city was required to
        provide compensation and preferential hiring to applicants who
        were not hired.

    -   The Biden DOJ
        [alleged](https://www.justice.gov/crt/case/united-states-v-maryland-department-state-police)
        discrimination because applicants were required to pass a
        written exam and basic physical exam. The agency was required to
        provide compensation and retroactive seniority to applicants who
        were not hired.

        [alleged](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-secures-agreement-cobb-county-georgia-resolve-allegations-race)
        discrimination because firefighter applicants were required to
        complete a written exam and credit check. The county was
        required to provide compensation and preferential hiring to
        applicants who were not hired.
-   **DISMISSED:** *United States v. City of South Bend (Indiana)*
    -   The Biden DOJ
        [alleged](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-south-bend-indiana-discriminating-against-black-and-female-police)
        discrimination because police applicants were required to pass a
        written exam and basic physical exam.

Americans deserve the best of the best keeping them safe — and in the
Trump Administration, anything less is unacceptable.
