title: When There Are No Illegal Immigrants, There Is No Need for Shelters
---
 
Two years ago, U.S. Border Patrol agents encountered 1,500 illegal
immigrants every day in the El Paso sector alone — now, they’re
[seeing](https://www.borderreport.com/hot-topics/border-report-live/border-report-live-where-are-the-migrants/)
roughly 80 per day amid President Donald J. Trump’s unprecedented effort
to secure the homeland.

Now, organizations that once facilitated the invasion of illegal
immigrants are finding out that sheltering them is no longer necessary:
**“It’s because migrants are not coming across the border right now,”**
[one local reporter
said](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1892981316464873632).

    [says](https://www.borderreport.com/hot-topics/border-report-live/border-report-live-where-are-the-migrants/)
    they see only “zero to three families” at their McAllen, Texas,
    shelter and cut staff in Dallas due to the lack of need.
-   A Brownsville, Texas, facility [shut its
    doors](https://www.borderreport.com/hot-topics/border-report-live/border-report-live-where-are-the-migrants/)
    due to the “sudden decrease in asylum seekers” over the past month.
-   A migrant shelter network in El Paso, Texas,
    [says](https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/migrant-shelters-empty-texas-border/)
    just one or two of its 20 shelters will remain open.

    two migrant shelters due to the lack of demand in the aftermath of
    President Trump’s inauguration.
-   In San Diego, California, a shelter “has not [had a single
    migrant](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1891512958053724323)
    walk through its doors since President Trump took office” and has
    since closed altogether.
-   In New York City, a network of shelters that once housed thousands
    of illegal immigrants have been
    [closed](https://www.westsiderag.com/2025/02/11/as-trump-enforcement-begins-upper-west-side-migrant-shelters-are-now-almost-empty).
-   In northern Mexico, local news
    [reports](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/activists-mexico-flow-migrants-enormously-decreased-one-month-trump-admin)
    the flow of illegal immigrants seeking to enter the United States
    has “decreased enormously” — with facilities that once held
    thousands of illegals now seeing [just a tiny
    fraction](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1892968118995001525).
