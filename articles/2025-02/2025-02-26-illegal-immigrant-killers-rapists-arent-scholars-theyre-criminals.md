In a strong contender for dumbest statement of the year, disgraced
“filmmaker” Michael Moore
[lamented](https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/media/michael-moore-says-deported-migrants-could-have-cured-cancer/)
illegal immigrant criminals being apprehended because they might’ve
“discovered the cure for cancer” or “stopped that asteroid.” The only
thing more foolish than that statement are the [politicians who
oppose](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/02/sick-politicians-want-killers-rapists-roaming-our-streets/)

**White House Deputy Press Secretary Kush Desai:  **“Michael Moore is
free to visit the quantum computing and particle physics labs that
MS-13, TDA, and the cartels are now going to have to set up back home in
El Salvador, Venezuela, and Mexico. The Trump Administration will remain
focused on putting our own citizens first by mass deporting illegal
migrant rapists, murderers, and other criminals out of American
communities.”
