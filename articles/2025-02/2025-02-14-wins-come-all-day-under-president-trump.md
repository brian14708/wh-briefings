    detained in Belarus — the tenth and eleventh hostages freed since he
    took office.
    -   Michael McFaul, U.S. Ambassador to Russia under President Obama,
        reacted to Marc Fogel’s release and

        energy and economic security.”

        “The Brazilian tariff on U.S. ethanol now stands at 18 percent
        and has virtually eliminated all market access for U.S. ethanol
        producers. We thank President Trump for taking this action and
