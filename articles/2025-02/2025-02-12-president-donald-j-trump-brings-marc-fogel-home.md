title: President Donald J. Trump Brings Marc Fogel Home
---
 
After years of being wrongfully detained in a Russian prison, U.S.
citizen Marc Fogel is [finally
home](https://x.com/POTUS/status/1889526448945307901) thanks to the
relentless efforts by President Donald Trump and his administration to
[secure](https://x.com/MikeWaltz47/status/1889380548784615774) his
release — [making good on a
promise](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1889396835158020569)
President Donald Trump made to Fogel’s 95-year-old mother, Malphine.  
   
Fogel [said it
best](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1889521780005503240):
*“President Trump is a hero … I will forever be indebted to President
Trump, to Steve \[Witkoff\] over there — what a dynamic man this guy is.
When I met him, the energy, the can-do attitude just exudes from his
body.”*  
   
**His release was met with immediate praise from Fogel’s family and a
bipartisan group of officials and lawmakers:**  
   
[**The Fogel
Family:**](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/marc-fogel-released-russia-trump/#:~:text=%22We%20are%20beyond,begin%20to%20heal.%22)
“We are beyond grateful, relieved, and overwhelmed that after more than
three years of detention, our father, husband, and son, Marc Fogel, is
finally coming home … Thanks to the unwavering leadership of President
Trump, Marc will soon be back on American soil, free where he belongs.
This has been the darkest and most painful period of our lives, but
today, we begin to heal.”  
   
[**Malphine
Fogel:**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1889396835158020569) “I
would like to thank \[President Trump\] profusely. He promised me he
would get him out — and he kept his promise, and I can’t thank him
enough.”  
   
[**Anne
Fogel:**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1889670715521016011)
“\[President Trump\] was true to his word. It’s amazing. It’s just such
a different relationship and I’m just so incredibly grateful to the
president.”

Smith:**](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/marc-fogel-released-russia-trump/#:~:text=%22Marc%20Fogel%27s%20release,bring%20Marc%20home.%22)
“Marc Fogel’s release is historic, long overdue, and a testament to the
power of strong leadership. After years of bureaucratic inaction
including consistent refusals to designate Marc as wrongfully detained,
President Trump secured Marc’s release in just a few weeks, wasting no
time in taking decisive action to bring Marc home.”  
   
[**Gov. Josh Shapiro
(D-PA):**](https://x.com/GovernorShapiro/status/1889392315032281242)
“After more than 3 years in Russian captivity, I join his family, our
federal partners, and all of his fellow Pennsylvanians in welcoming Marc
Fogel home — exactly where he belongs. Thank you to those at the
@WhiteHouse who made his release possible, and to his wife Jane, mom,
siblings, and kids here in Pennsylvania who never, ever gave up.”  
   
[**Sen. John Fetterman
(D-PA):**](https://x.com/SenFettermanPA/status/1889386838999101507)
“Marc Fogel’s return home is long overdue—and I know all of
Pennsylvania, especially his family, will be welcoming him back with
open arms. I want to thank @POTUS and @SteveWitkoff for their efforts in
finally bringing Marc home.”  
   
[**Sen. Dave McCormick
(R-PA):**](https://x.com/SenMcCormickPA/status/1889535203376247114)
“Thank you @POTUS for bringing Marc home! All of Pennsylvania is happy
he is back safely, especially his amazing 95 year old mom, Mafa, who
never stopped fighting for his release. Dina and I were honored to
witness this emotional and historic moment tonight at the White
House.”  
   
[**Rep. Mike Kelly
(R-PA):**](https://x.com/MikeKellyPA/status/1889388136003936742) “When
President Trump met with Marc Fogel’s mother, Malphine, in Butler on
July 13, 2024, he pledged to do everything he could to bring Marc home
safely. Today, President Trump, Secretary Rubio, and the Trump
administration have fulfilled this promise. I want to thank President
Trump for successfully securing Marc’s release and for reuniting the
Fogel family.”

“After more than three and a half long years of detention, Marc Fogel is
finally on his way home from Russia. Thank you to President Trump,
Secretary Rubio, and the President’s Special Envoy Steve Witkoff for
their urgency and dedication to bringing Marc home.”  
   
[**Former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael
McFaul:**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1889391541137056147)
“Hallelujah! Fantastic news! Praise be to President Donald Trump … This
is just fantastic news for anybody who cares about patriotic
Americans.”  
   
[**Secretary of State Marco
Rubio:**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1889512989125968193)
“None of this is possible without President Trump. This is the tenth
America that’s come home after being detained somewhere overseas — in
just three weeks in the White House.”

  
[**Special Envoy Steve
Witkoff:**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1889675732663607305)
“The president’s policy on Americans that are held abroad is that we
leave nobody behind. It’s very similar to the military credo … I think
that you’ll see a President who is extraordinarily proactive in seeking
all hostages to be released.”
