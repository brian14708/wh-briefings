title: 'Monday Morning Wins: Historic Investment, Border Security'
---
 
There’s nothing better than starting the week with a pair of major
victories for the American people — all made possible by the leadership
of President Donald J. Trump.

**Apple’s $500 billion investment:** Apple CEO Tim Cook
[announced](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/)
today that the company will invest $500 billion in the United States
over the next four years amid President Trump’s tariffs push. The
historic venture, which comes following Cook’s
[meeting](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1893048920047018379) with
President Trump last week, will
[result](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-24/apple-says-it-will-add-20-000-jobs-spend-500-billion-produce-ai-servers-in-us)
in 20,000 new U.S.-based jobs and was immediately
[hailed](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1894004915862655363) as a
“landmark” step in bringing back U.S. manufacturing.

It’s another watershed moment in President Trump’s commitment to usher
in the new Golden Age of America. In just over a month, President Trump
has

a $500 billion private sector investment for the largest artificial
intelligence infrastructure project in history, a
[commitment](https://apnews.com/article/saudi-arabia-us-investment-trump-6730a89f93b44ed8d705638f95700cbb)
by Saudi Arabia to invest $600 billion in the U.S. over the next four
years, a [$20 billion
investment](https://dailycaller.com/2025/01/07/trump-announces-20-billion-investment-in-u-s-data-centers/)
by DAMAC Properties to build new U.S.-based data centers, a
[pledge](https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-president-tariffs-semiconductors-trump-616f3fbdb20b017c2d19bd1c18a570f1)
by Taiwan to boost U.S.-based investment, and a [major
investment](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-considering-allowing-sale-of-u-s-steel-to-nippon-steel/)
by Nippon Steel. Mercedes-Benz also
[announced](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/mercedes-benz-ceo-signals-potential-more-us-investment)
plans to
“[grow](https://www.motor1.com/news/751309/mercedes-c-e-class-us-production/)”
its vehicle production in the U.S.

**Illegal immigrants turn around:** [New
reporting](https://apnews.com/article/panama-united-states-migration-trump-beb125ce0ecbebb2895ea9dd18c4c53b)
says would-be illegal border crossers have “given up” and are returning
to their own countries — citing the Trump Administration’s unprecedented
crackdown on illegal immigration, including the
[shutdown](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/cbp-removes-scheduling-functionality-cbp-one-app)
of the “CBP One” app, as the driving factor.

It’s a victory for national security after four years of open borders.
In President Trump’s first month back in office, illegal border
crossings hit [lows not seen in
decades](https://nypost.com/2025/02/13/us-news/illegal-border-crossings-hit-record-lows-could-be-on-track-for-levels-not-seen-for-60-years/)
— [down 94% over last
year](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1892771191787508153), while
[interior arrests are up
134%](https://x.com/TriciaOhio/status/1891631396214493594).

Promises made, promises kept.
