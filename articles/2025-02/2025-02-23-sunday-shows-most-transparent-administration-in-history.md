of President Trump’s second term.

**Here’s what you missed:**

-   [On negotiations to end the war in
    Ukraine](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1893669321634697248):
    “Deals only work, Jake, when they’re good for all the parties — and
    that’s the pathway we’re on here.”
-   [On securing a rare earth minerals agreement with
    Ukraine](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1893670753574256879):

-   [On bringing peace to
    Europe](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1893669966160814423):

-   [On mortgage
    rates](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1893688261865791775):

    “We’re just doing what they’re doing and then adding in these other
    factors. If they remediate those … the tariffs could drop. If they

    go up until they are willing to negotiate.”

    is headed under President Trump.”
-   [On ending the war in
    Ukraine](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1893674079590170940):
