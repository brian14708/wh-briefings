### **Here’s what they’re saying:**

[New York Post Editorial
Board](https://nypost.com/2026/02/25/opinion/trumps-home-run-state-of-the-union-2026-showed-exactly-how-crazy-the-democrats-are/):
“President Trump hit it out of the park (again) with his 2026 State of
the Union address, perhaps his most remarkable speech yet. The event was
an unabashed celebration of America in its 250th year, hailing heroes
from the Olympic hockey champions to 100-year-old veterans — and with a
close reiteration why the nation’s best days are yet to come. He was the
happy warrior we’d asked him to be, with a strong, clear message
untainted by grievance — even as he expressed his disappointment with
last week’s Supreme Court ruling on tariffs and drew clear distinctions
between his program and the opposition’s.”

[CBS News host Tony
Dokoupil](https://www.mediaite.com/media/news/cbss-tony-dokoupil-calls-trumps-speech-extraordinary-and-vintage-trump/):
“It was an extraordinary speech — the longest to a joint session in
history, the longest State of the Union in history. In some ways,
vintage Trump: combative, populist. Historic for other reasons, as
well.”

[*USA Today* columnist Ingrid
Jacques](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2026/02/24/trump-state-of-the-union-prices-economy-border/88822596007/):
“Ahead of President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address, he
promised he’d discuss how we are a country ‘that’s now doing well with
the greatest economy we’ve ever had.’ That’s what he needed to do, and
overall, he did.”

[Fox News host Laura
Ingraham](https://x.com/IngrahamAngle/status/2026501370660958336): “When
future historians want to understand how Trump dominated American
politics for 12 years, they should watch and read this speech.”

[Commentator Marc
Thiessen](https://x.com/marcthiessen/status/2026507882544394264?s=20):
“Truly one of the best SOTUs ever. The way he weaves the stories of
ordinary Americans into his policy narrative is unmatched.”

[Fox Business Network Senior Correspondent Charles
Gasparino](https://x.com/CGasparino/status/2026506684454031395): “Trump
is a colossus; an amazingly patriotic speech”

[The Federalist’s Sean
Davis](https://x.com/seanmdav/status/2026508071179010443?s=20): “Home
run, from beginning to end. What a fantastic speech.”

[OutKick founder Clay
Travis](https://x.com/ClayTravis/status/2026486159719727552): “This is
an incredibly positive pro-America speech. I legit don’t know how anyone
could disagree with a single thing Trump has said so far. It’s all basic
common sense — lower crime, secure borders — and a celebration of
American excellence through sports and military service.”

[Breitbart News Washington Bureau Chief Matthew
Boyle](https://x.com/mboyle1/status/2026509315914244299): “This speech
was Trump at his absolute finest and may have been his best speech yet —
he’s definitely given some bangers over the years though. Exactly the
right tone and message he needed ahead of the midterms.”

[NewsNation host Katie
Pavlich](https://x.com/KatiePavlich/status/2026515955875020898):
“President Trump weaving stories of real Americans – tragic and
triumphant – throughout the entirety of his speech was phenomenal.”

[Former Clinton advisor Mark
Penn](https://x.com/Mark_Penn/status/2026535176830931180?s=20): “SOTU
How times have changed. Trump gave an artful and moving speech
illustrating his policies with a parade of hero Americans from all walks
of life. Probably his best speech framing his domestic and foreign
policies. In contrast the Democrats were reduced to cat calls and
slogans with curse words inappropriate for kids. They looked silly and
small while Trump hit big, lofty goals and evoked emotion though the
stories of real people.”

[The Blaze founder Glenn
Beck](https://x.com/glennbeck/status/2026502901867094496): “Tonight, you
are seeing a different @potus at the \#stateoftheunion .    He is not
cocky or a ‘big talker’ which is a hallmark and the funniest part of
Trump.  Tonight however, he has been funny in different ways, but he is
not arrogant, he is confident, he knows who he is, and now WHAT HE HAS
DONE.   His track record in this last year doesn’t need any boasting.  
It speaks for itself.  Time will tell, but my guess is that in 100
years, it will be George Washington, Father of our country, Lincoln, the
savior of the Union and Trump, the REFOUNDING Father of the US.   Thank
you @realDonaldTrump”

[National Border Patrol Council President Paul
Perez](https://x.com/BPUnion/status/2026623242744857000): “You saw a
President who wants to make it a point to ensure that Americans don’t
become the minority in America.”

[ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan
Karl](https://x.com/WarMachineRR/status/2026523763412520967?s=20): “I
would say overall, in terms of the speech, I mean, this had the makings
of a, you know — they had real high moments of patriotism, great stories
he told…”

[Commentator Scott
Jennings](https://x.com/ScottJenningsKY/status/2026494195737706773):
“Moment of the night: Democrats refusing to stand to affirm their
allegiance to American citizens over illegal aliens. Will be signature
moment of this speech. Trump nailed them.”

[The Blaze host Steve
Deace](https://x.com/theblaze/status/2026514976039452942): “I thought it
was Trump’s best State of the Union speech yet.”

[Fox News contributor Ben
Domenech](https://www.dailywire.com/news/trump-delivers-a-show-at-state-of-the-union):
“Fortunately for Republicans, Trump is very good at this.”

[The Federalist Editor-in-Chief Mollie
Hemingway](https://x.com/MZHemingway/status/2026493958935761000): “Trump
asks people to stand if they agree that the first duty of the American
government is to protect American citizens and not illegal aliens. No
Democrats stand. Trump pauses, understanding the significance of the
moment heading into midterms.”

[NewsNation host Batya
Ungar-Sargon](https://x.com/bungarsargon/status/2026505479594152158):
“The showmanship, the stage direction, the surprise guest reveals, it’s
truly off the charts tonight!”

[The Callahan Show host Gerry
Callahan](https://x.com/GerryCallahan/status/2026508481453346992):
“A-plus. Trump’s best State of the Union, maybe his best speech ever.
Wonderfully defiant, combative and unapologetic. Just relentlessly
pro-American.  Exactly what we voted for.”

[Mark Levin](https://x.com/marklevinshow/status/2026503298786771275):
“It’s not just an excellent speech, it’s mostly POTUS himself.  He’s a
truly historic leader.  I know it drives DC nuts. Who cares.”

[Journalist Matt
Taibbi](https://x.com/RNCResearch/status/2026533331941073219): “For
Donald Trump I think that was a very successful speech.”

[Buck Sexton](https://x.com/BuckSexton/status/2026505959250510208):
“This is the best State of the Union Address I’ve ever seen\[,\] Not
just by Trump. By any President.”

[Allie Beth
Stuckey](https://x.com/conservmillen/status/2026509336646742199):
“Overall, Trump’s speech was strong and painted an unapologetically
America First picture of our future while highlighting the deadly
failures of progressive policies. It made all of the right people mad.”

[The Daily Signal Politics Editor Bradley
Devlin](https://x.com/bradleydevlin/status/2026532737964761240):
“President Donald Trump delivered a brilliant speech tonight. He gave
the GOP the roadmap to victory in the midterms. It was an aggressive,
America First vision for the country, and he put pressure on Republicans
in Congress to deliver.”

[Washington Free Beacon Editor-in-Chief Eliana
Johnson](https://x.com/RNCResearch/status/2026528848930537709?s=20): “He
bookended the speech with things that left me, and I think all
Americans… feeling positive and good about the country.”

[Patrick
Bet-David](https://x.com/patrickbetdavid/status/2026496583617905026?s=20):
“This is going to be used in campaign videos for mid terms. What
American voter would choose a candidate that defends illegal aliens over
Americans? Who? Another 80/20 issue that democrats get wrong.  It might
even be a 90/10 issue. Double dumb.”

[Former top Obama advisor David
Axelrod](https://x.com/CollinRugg/status/2026512337885344181): “I think
\[President Trump\] did well … He used the gallery very skillfully.”

[CNN’s Abby
Phillip](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2026519930359701988?s=20):
“I thought President Trump actually delivered a higher energy speech
than, I think, even his speech last year… Big moments, emotional
moments.”

[Former White House Press Secretary Ari
Fleischer](https://x.com/AriFleischer/status/2026495247685988555?s=20):
“This stretch of the speech about immigration and voter ID has been very
powerful.”

[Former Sen. Jim
DeMint](https://dcjournal.com/republicans-should-support-president-trumps-healthcare-vision/):
“At the State of the Union address, President Donald Trump laid out a
vision to transform healthcare in the United States: his Great American
Health Plan, which would give subsidies directly to people rather than
to the big insurance companies. Republicans in Congress need to turn
this vision into a reality so that it can start to make healthcare more
affordable ahead of the midterms.”

[Former Rep. Patrick
McHenry](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2026518823571173859?s=20):
“He nailed the Republican base.”

[Former White House Deputy Counsel Gene
Hamilton](https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/state-of-the-union-2026-president-donald-trump#:~:text=Gene%20Hamilton%2C%20a%20former%20deputy%20White%20House%20counsel%20who%20has%20written%20speeches%2C%20told%20Fox%20News%20Digital%20that%20Trump%20delivered%20a%20%22resounding%20speech%22%20and%20%22could%20not%20have%20been%20more%20clear%20about%20the%20current%20state%20of%20our%20great%20nation.%22):
“Could not have been more clear about the current state of our great
nation.”

[Fox News Chief Political Analyst Brit
Hume](https://x.com/WarMachineRR/status/2026510488289300621): “It was,
in a way, uplifting, I think. I think it probably did him — in the
short-term, at least — some political good, for sure.”

[Georgetown University College Republicans President Shae
McInnis](https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/state-of-the-union-2026-president-donald-trump#:~:text=The%20president%20laid%20out%20an%20economic%20miracle%2C%E2%80%9D%20added%20Shae%20McInnis%2C%20the%20president%20of%20the%20Georgetown%20University%20College%20Republicans.%C2%A0):
“The President laid out an economic miracle. His economic agenda is so
particularly tailored to my generation — my generation that has anxiety
about finding jobs and starting families. And from his vital tariffs to
his tax cuts to even his policies on housing and health care, this
President is fighting for my generation.”

[Commentator Priya
Patel](https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/state-of-the-union-2026-president-donald-trump#:~:text=Political%20commentator%20Priya%20Patel%20weighed%20in%20on%20President%20Donald%20Trump%27s%20appeal%20to%20Gen%20Z%20during%20his%20State%20of%20the%20Union%20speech%2C%20saying%20during%20a%20%22Fox%20News%20%40%20Night%22%20panel%20that%20their%20concerns%20are%20%E2%80%9Ctop%20priorities%E2%80%9D%20for%20Trump.%C2%A0):
“President Trump’s State of the Union tonight was really for the
American people, and again, like we said, specifically for Gen Z. We’ve
been facing an affordability crisis and job scarcity for an incredibly
long time… These are top priorities for the President, and he made that
evidently clear in tonight’s address.”

[Buzz
Patterson](https://x.com/BuzzPatterson/status/2026516357895041437):
“This is the best State of the Union I’ve ever seen!”

[Grant
Cardone](https://x.com/GrantCardone/status/2026498722943623616?s=20):
“Trump calls out Democrats for not standing to end the transitioning of
children, ‘These people are crazy.’ Most authentic President in
history.  Tonight’s SOTU speech could swing the midterms!”

[Kevin Sorbo](https://x.com/ksorbs/status/2026489133569335301?s=20):
“Great success!”

[Great American Health Alliance President Keith
Nahigian](https://x.com/GreatAmerHealth/status/2026512722100195765?s=20):
“The Health Alliance stands with President Trump in his fight to put
patients back in control of American healthcare by moving federal health
dollars out of bureaucracy and into the hands of the people.”

[Faith & Freedom
Coalition](https://x.com/FaithandFreedom/status/2026677844466696541):
“@POTUS delivered a speech for the ages, and we are so proud of the hard
work done by Americans of faith to ensure that their values had the
biggest microphone in Washington!”

[Associated Builders and Contractors President and CEO Michael
Bellaman](https://www.abc.org/News-Media/News-Releases/abc-statement-on-president-trumps-2026-state-of-the-union-address):
“ABC appreciates the president’s continued focus on the economy,
expanding opportunity for American workers and addressing affordability.
These priorities align with the principles that have guided ABC and its
67 chapters for more than 75 years and continue to drive success across
the construction industry, which employs more than 8.3 million people
and contributes more than $2 trillion annually to the U.S. economy… “The
president’s broader pro-growth agenda is delivering tangible benefits.
The historic Working Families Tax Cuts legislation, also known as the
One Big Beautiful Bill Act, allows hardworking Americans to keep more of
their paychecks and invest in their businesses. Meanwhile, progress on
permitting reform is helping critical projects move forward more
efficiently, while a more predictable and balanced approach to the
Waters of the United States rule is reducing regulatory uncertainty for
construction employers nationwide. Further, the new majority on the
National Labor Relations Board will bring a more balanced approach to
labor law and end regulatory overreach that threatens workers and job
creators alike.”

[Americans for Prosperity CEO Emily
Seidel](https://americansforprosperity.org/press-release/momentum-matters-now-lets-deliver-the-lower-cost-of-living-americans-are-asking-for/):
“This evening, President Trump outlined a number of significant
accomplishments that have helped to change the trajectory of our
country, slow inflation, and put more money in Americans’ pockets. We
were proud to do our part to help advance The Working Families Tax Cut
to the President’s desk. That historic piece of legislation was
essential, and we will continue to connect people to its benefits. We
were also glad to hear that the President isn’t ready to stop productive
policy-making this year. The American people have been clear: they want
Congress to act urgently to drive solutions, continue to bring down
costs, and advance reforms that provide both immediate relief and
long-term benefits.”

[Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council President and CEO Karen

“President Trump’s focus on America’s economic momentum and the
remaining work ahead to build on his policies to strengthen growth and
opportunity spoke to the priorities and pain points of entrepreneurs and
small business owners. The President reviewed important policy wins that
are directly impacting America’s small businesses, and our latest Small
Business Check Up Survey confirms that these policies are making a
measurable difference… SBE Council appreciates the Trump
Administration’s engagement, and willingness to listen and respond to
the ideas and concerns of entrepreneurs. We look forward to working with
the President and his team in the days ahead to broaden and strengthen
the gains already secured through pro-growth policies.”

strong.”

“The Republican agenda is helping Arkansans keep more of their
hard-earned paychecks while bolstering national security and protecting
communities from dangerous threats including crime and drugs. We are
working closely with the Trump administration, delivering on these
priorities through the Working Families Tax Cuts and other policies that
reduce burdensome regulations, unleash domestic energy and support those
defending us at home and abroad. Importantly, the president’s leadership
secured a once-in-a-generation investment for the families who feed,
fuel and clothe the world, and we will continue our efforts to ensure a
bright and strong future for rural America. I’m grateful for our
partnership and appreciate his firm dedication to Arkansas’s and our

“Tonight, President Trump delivered a forward-looking message
highlighting the incredible progress achieved during his first year in
office, while outlining a determined vision to build on that momentum
and continue moving the country forward. Framing his remarks around the
250th anniversary of our nation’s founding, he emphasized the historic
significance of this milestone and called on Americans to seize this
milestone as an opportunity to shape the next chapter in our nation’s
story. More importantly, families in West Virginia and around our
country who felt neglected by the policies of the previous
administration are no longer forgotten, and there is a renewed sense of
optimism that is evident across our state and our nation.”

[Sen. Bill
Cassidy](https://x.com/SenBillCassidy/status/2026514583557492995): “Just
wrapped up the State of the Union Address. I’ve worked with President

[Sen. Kevin
Cramer](https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-cramer-statement-on-president-trumps-state-of-the-union-address):
“I just thought the president was fantastic tonight. He talks about so
many things, it’s hard to boil it down to highlights. But what I really
appreciated was he reiterated in very plain language without dwelling on
any one thing. He articulated the victories of the last year, and
particularly in the economy part of it. And of course, talking about the
growth of American oil production and of course, the Venezuelan oil, the
bringing down of gas prices and energy dominance. He was solid on that
as he always is. Of course, reminding the people of just how overrun our
nation was by illegal criminals, tens of millions of illegal aliens
coming into our country. And the havoc they wreaked on us especially in
certain cities and sanctuary cities especially. I just thought it was
really good for him to remind us of how awful it was and then remind us
of how good it is now with a border that’s not only no longer wide open,
but it’s completely closed.”

[Sen. Ted Cruz](https://x.com/tedcruz/status/2026524091193164207?s=20):

done, Mr. President. America is back.”

[Sen. John
Hoeven](https://x.com/SenJohnHoeven/status/2026513904067571928):
“President Trump’s address celebrated the 250th anniversary of our great
nation and highlighted people and policies that make our country better
and stronger. The President showed the real impact of the tax relief we
passed last year in enabling Americans to keep more of their hard-earned
dollars and our continued work to make life more affordable for families
across the nation. That includes supporting our farmers and ranchers to
ensure we continue to have the highest-quality, lowest cost food supply
in the nation, and unleashing energy production in North Dakota and
across the nation to fuel our economy and bring down costs. The
President outlined work to make our nation safer here at home by
securing our borders and stopping drug and human trafficking.
Additionally, by promoting ‘peace through strength’ and supporting our
men and women in uniform, we are making our nation more secure while
keeping our adversaries in check. The address acknowledged the
tremendous feats of Americans – from gold medal winners to U.S.
servicemembers to a 100-year-old war veteran – and the people that make
our nation great. We look forward to continuing to work with President
Trump and his administration to keep our nation strong and prosperous
for the next 250 years.”

[Sen. Ron
Johnson](https://x.com/SenRonJohnson/status/2026524187636990145?s=20):

Democrats’ craven ideology and policies. Unbelievable that Democrats
would not stand to reaffirm the American government’s first duty is to
American citizens, NOT illegal aliens.”

[Sen. Jim
Justice](https://www.justice.senate.gov/press-releases/senator-justice-applauds-president-trumps-state-of-the-union-address/):

President Trump has accomplished since taking office. Under President
Trump’s leadership, America is back on the right track. We’ve secured
the border, stood with our men and women of law enforcement, cut
wasteful spending in Washington, built a stronger economy for our
hardworking families, supported our vital energy sector, and put the
American Dream back in reach for Americans across the board. Hats off to
President Trump, because we’ve moved mountains, and we have a whole lot

[Sen. Dave
McCormick](https://x.com/SenMcCormickPA/status/2026518155921703031):
“@POTUS is delivering on the promises he made: peace through strength on
the world stage, secure borders, safer communities, historic
deregulation and tax relief, falling inflation, and greater economic
opportunity. Pennsylvania is already seeing the results. With President
Trump’s support, we secured $92 billion in new investments for the
Commonwealth—in energy infrastructure, AI, and workforce development.
The U.S. Steel–Nippon deal is strengthening American steel manufacturing
and protecting good-paying jobs. And the Working Families Tax Cuts Act
is now law, with benefits already being felt by hardworking families
across our Commonwealth and the nation. The bottom line: the president
is keeping his word. There has been lots of progress, but there’s still
more work to do. I’m proud to stand with him and continue delivering
real, meaningful results for the people of Pennsylvania.”

[Sen. Jim Risch](https://x.com/SenatorRisch/status/2026513944572056046):
“Under Republican leadership, Idahoans have more opportunity, more
freedom, and more money in their pockets. In 2025 alone, we secured the
border, delivered record tax relief for working families, killed the
Lava Ridge project, eliminated excessive federal regulations, and reined
in the wasteful federal spending that fueled inflation. President
Trump’s first year back in the White House produced significant
victories for Idaho, but our work is not over. I am committed to
achieving even more for Idaho in the year ahead by partnering with my
Senate colleagues to lower costs, ensure election integrity, and unleash
American nuclear energy.”

[Sen. Mike

prices are at a four-year low, we delivered historic tax cuts that saved
Georgia taxpayers from a 24% hike, average tax refunds are nearly 11%
higher this year, we’ve had nine straight months of no illegal immigrant

House Republicans are working overtime to restore American prosperity,
strength, and freedom. With the best yet to come, I look forward to
delivering continued progress and victories for hardworking Georgians in
the 12th District.”

[Rep. Jim
Baird](https://x.com/RepJimBaird/status/2026510179018096701?s=20):
“Under President Trump, the state of the Union is strong. President
Biden did colossal harm to our nation, plunging us into crisis after
crisis. President Trump has worked tirelessly to restore American
prosperity from the Biden administration’s numerous catastrophes. I
worked with President Trump to pass historic wins for Hoosier families
and our farmers through the Working Families Tax Cuts. Under President
Trump, the border is closed, and illegal immigration has plummeted to
record lows. Americans are much safer now under President Trump’s
leadership. There is always work to be done to create a more perfect
Union. As we approach America’s 250th birthday, I look forward to
working alongside the President to ensure Hoosiers can continue to
prosper in the greatest country the world has ever seen.”

hardworking Americans are paying less in taxes—keeping more of what they

working families. Our borders are secured and crime rates are dropping
by double digits in cities across the country. And after four years of
Joe Biden’s failed foreign policy, America’s might is respected by the
world again. But this speech wasn’t just about what’s been accomplished;
it was about what comes next. The President called on Congress to keep
driving down costs, expand access to affordable healthcare and
prescription drugs, reopen the doors to homeownership, and restore the
people’s trust in our elections. Let’s turn the page to another
successful year to come.”

“Tonight, President Trump made one thing clear: the American Dream is
alive and making a comeback. As we approach our nation’s 250th
anniversary, the state of the union is strong and getting stronger
because we are putting working families first. Republicans’ Working
Families Tax Cuts are already delivering real relief for Floridians. Tax
refunds are rising, families are keeping more of their hard-earned
paychecks and seniors are seeing historic tax relief. Workers are no
longer taxed on tips or overtime, the Child Tax Credit has been
strengthened and small businesses finally have the certainty they need
to grow. Working together, President Trump and House Republicans are
rebuilding opportunity, strengthening families and renewing confidence
in our future. We are lowering health care costs by investing in rural
communities and advancing a prevention-focused approach that empowers
Americans to be the CEOs of their own health. We have secured the
border, strengthened public safety and refocused government on serving
the American people. Promises made, promises kept. The American Dream is

just over a year, Republicans are delivering a more affordable future
with a stronger low-income housing tax credit, a record high Child Tax
Credit, and more money in the pockets of Ohio families. The President
was clear that Republicans delivered on our promises of lower taxes,
safer communities, and a brighter future for our nation. As we celebrate

optimism. I will continue partnering with the President on our historic

President Trump, the state of our union is stronger and better than ever

heroes who put their lives on the line for others, to highlighting the
grieving family members of those we lost to violent crimes. The
President also talked about the many accomplishments and progress we
have made in just one year coming off the last administration’s highest
inflation and worst border crisis this century.  Our border is secure,
hard working Americans are keeping more of what they earned, and our
military is stronger than ever.  We still have more work to do and he
also laid out a clear vision on how to keep advancing. The American
people are resilient, determined, and full of hope.”

shied from them. Thanks to strong direction in the White House, we’ve

Crawford](https://x.com/RepRickCrawford/status/2026532003491852620):
“This evening, President Trump delivered an important message to all
Americans, meeting them where they are, on the issues important to them.
After four years of witnessing the collapse of law and orderand the
placing of U.S. national security on the back burner, the United States
of America has been ushered into a new age. The President didn’t just
take stock in all we have accomplished thus far in his term, but more
importantly, he laid out all the work still ahead for us to fulfill our
promises to Americans.”

[Rep. Monica De La
Cruz](https://x.com/RepMonicaDLC/status/2026523940437307631?s=20):

[Rep. Scott
DesJarlais](https://x.com/DesJarlaisTN04/status/2026512547306766517?s=20):
“Just two days ago there was a third attempt to take President Trump’s
life, yet tonight President Trump stood unafraid and showed true
strength delivering his best State of the Union speech thus far. Tonight
was a celebration of so many of the many accomplishments his
administration has achieved so far. There have been zero illegal migrant
crossings in the last nine months—a stark contrast compared to four
years of open borders under Biden. Our borders are the strongest they’ve
ever been in our nation’s lifetime. Our military and federal law
enforcement recruitment rates are at record highs, ensuring our citizens
sleep safely at night. Gas prices and inflation are down and wages are
up, a testament to Trump’s commitment to create a booming economy and
help Americans who have been struggling. President Trump said it best,
this past year was a ‘turn around for the ages.’ I look forward to
continuing to work with him to advance legislation that puts America
first!”

[Rep. Mario

[Rep. Troy
Downing](https://x.com/RepTroyDowning/status/2026509394179981782):
“President Trump has accomplished more in one year than the previous
administration could in four. I’m proud to have worked alongside him
with my Republican colleagues to deliver historic tax relief for
families, workers, and businesses, secure our border, beat back
inflation, and make everyday life more affordable for central and
eastern Montanans. Here’s to three more years of the Golden Age.”

[Rep. Mike
Ezell](https://ezell.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2023):
“Tonight, the President highlighted priorities that matter to families
and workers across Mississippi — lowering taxes, rewarding hard work,
and strengthening our nation’s security. Eliminating taxes on tips and
overtime pay puts more money back into the pockets of hardworking
Americans, while securing our borders helps protect our communities from
crime, drugs, and human trafficking… The people of Mississippi’s Fourth
District want safe communities, economic opportunity, and responsible
leadership, and I remain committed to helping the Trump Administration
delivering results on those priorities.”

[Rep. Pat
Fallon](https://x.com/RepPatFallon/status/2026669948114788478): “In his
State of the Union Address, President Trump rightly made the case for
how his America First agenda is firing on all fronts to better the lives
of our nation’s citizens. In the past year alone under his leadership,
rampant inflation is down to 2.4 percent from its Biden era 9 percent
peak, crime is at its lowest in 125 years, and zero illegal aliens have
been admitted into the US. These are real facts and figures that are
driving the economy and keeping America’s streets safe. On the world
stage, President Trump’s time-tested modicum of “peace through strength”
has restored deterrence towards our adversaries. Our military is strong,
and our men and women in uniform once again have a Commander in Chief
who has their back. Our hemisphere is secure, and we have demonstrated
the supreme capabilities of our armed forces when it comes to advancing
US interests and security abroad. Last night was a turning point in
history, and we are incredibly fortunate to have a President who truly
loves our country and the values it was founded upon. As the United
States celebrates its 250th birthday this year, we can rest assured that
America’s best days are yet ahead.”

[Rep. Randy
Feenstra](https://x.com/RepFeenstra/status/2026720536416420122): “Iowa

the results of an America First agenda: historic tax relief for our
families, a secured border, and an economy that is working for the
people of Western Minnesota again. The state of our union is strong, but
our work is not done. I am ready to keep fighting alongside President
Trump to protect our rural way of life and ensure the next generation of
Minnesotans has every opportunity to thrive!”

New Golden Age for America! The BEST is yet to come!”

[Rep. Scott
Franklin](https://x.com/RepFranklin/status/2026527632058147131):
“President Trump outlined a vision centered on peace through strength,
economic growth, and renewed opportunity for the American people. In
Florida, we understand peace through strength is not just a slogan. It
means supporting our servicemembers, strengthening our military
readiness, and ensuring our defense industrial base remains second to
none. A strong America deters conflict and protects our freedoms at home
and abroad. The president’s commitment to tax relief and pro-growth
policies is also critical for Florida families, small businesses,
farmers, and retirees. Lower taxes and a stronger economy mean more
opportunity, more jobs, and greater security for hardworking Floridians.
There is more work to do, and I remain committed to advancing policies
that keep Florida safe, grow our economy, support our farmers and expand
opportunity across our communities.”

[Rep. Russ

State of the Union address. We have accomplished a great deal in the
last 365 days—a secure border, historic tax cuts, the re-shoring of
American jobs, record energy production, and restored respect on the
world stage. America is the greatest nation on earth and tonight
affirmed her best days are ahead!”

[Rep. Vince
Fong](https://fong.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-fong-statement-sotu-american-comeback-full-swing):
“After four years of decline at the hands of the Biden-Harris
Administration, the American Dream is within reach once again with
families across the country already seeing real results from policies
that put our economy, workers, and safety first. Under President Trump’s
leadership these past 13 months, we have taken decisive action to tame
inflation, secure our borders, boost wages, grow jobs, unleash American
energy, restore peace through strength, and enact historic tax cuts for
families and businesses. Our Central Valley deserves relief and
opportunity, and with President Trump in office that is what they are
seeing… Tonight’s speech was a reminder of how great America is and all
that we have accomplished together as a nation. There is still much work
to be done, but the state of our Union is undoubtedly strong.”

[Rep. Lance
Gooden](https://x.com/Lancegooden/status/2026512975671001324): “Tonight,
President @realDonaldTrump delivered a powerful message. Our economy is
roaring back, the border is secure, energy has been unleashed, and peace
through strength is restoring stability abroad. America’s comeback will
only get STRONGER.”

[Rep. Brett

“Tonight, @POTUS highlighted the historic successes of our country over
the past year and outlined the clear next steps that need to be taken on
the path toward continued American exceptionalism. From transforming our
economy, to securing the border, to unburdening businesses from bloated
government mandates, @POTUS demonstrated that America’s best moments
truly are ahead!”

[Rep. Mark
Harris](https://x.com/RepMarkHarrisNC/status/2026739840969064880): “The

America Act. We must keep America great always.”

[Rep. Kevin
Hern](https://x.com/repkevinhern/status/2026515647392330094): “Tonight,

At an unprecedented pace, he’s reversed the damage caused by four years
of reckless Biden-era policies that sent our nation down the wrong path.
Families are now seeing historic tax relief, lower inflation, a secure
border, and peace around the world – this is only the beginning. I’m
proud to stand alongside President Trump as we continue our work to
lower costs, put more money in Americans’ pockets, and strengthen the
American Dream for families across the country.”

[Rep. French
Hill](https://hill.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=9803):
“President Trump inherited a sputtering economy weighed down by years of
reckless spending, excessive regulation, and policies that made life
more expensive for hardworking Arkansans. Tonight, he made clear that we
are turning the corner, with Republican leadership delivering
commonsense solutions to get our economy back on track and restore the
American Dream for families across our country. But the job is far from
finished. I look forward to working with President Trump and my
colleagues in Congress to build on this momentum and fight for policies
that expand access to affordable housing and investment opportunities,
support our small businesses, and deliver bigger paychecks and lower
prices for Arkansas families. I also appreciate the President
highlighting America’s upcoming 250th anniversary. This is something
every American can take pride in, regardless of party. It is a chance to
come together, reflect on how far we have come, and recommit ourselves
to ensuring the next chapter of our history is even stronger and more
prosperous.”

I am proud to stand alongside him as we keep fighting to make sure every
working family in this country has a shot at the American Dream.”

thought it was the best… Frankly, you didn’t have to say it much in the
room or in the chamber. You just felt it. You felt it when the hockey
team came in. You felt it when Melania put that around that guy who was

all throughout the chamber. So, special night tonight. I would say this
was the best one that I’ve been a part of.”

“Last night, President Trump highlighted the wins of his administration
and the Republican-led Congress for the American people. When President
Trump was chosen to lead our country again, he promised to deliver a
secure border, economic growth, and eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse
from our government. Over the past year, the President and Congress have
delivered on those promises, securing critical tax cuts for working
families across the country, stopping the flow of deadly drugs like
fentanyl across our southern border, and cutting bureaucratic red tape
to unleash energy production, bolster housing supply, and increase
military readiness.  While I am proud of our accomplishments, my
colleagues and I know that there is still more work to be done. We must
continue to prioritize lowering the cost of living and ensuring that the
American Dream is attainable for all our citizens. While the previous
administration’s policies slowed growth and set our country back, I am
filled with hope and determined to continue this positive momentum from
President Trump’s first year in office.”

Jersey can keep more of what they earn and feel greater financial
security.”

[Rep. Mike

just his first year back in the White House, President Trump and his
America First agenda have restored American greatness both at home and
abroad. I was honored to work with the President to craft common sense,
pro-growth tax policy in the Working Families Tax Cuts, which are now
delivering historic returns for hardworking Pennsylvania families. 
America is stronger, more prosperous, and more respected around the
world than it was just one year ago. As we look forward to our Nation’s

Republican agenda is delivering real results. The Working Families Tax
Cuts created a fairer, more efficient tax system, and families are

families. While we have made meaningful progress, there is more work to
do to ensure growth reaches every household and that the momentum
continues. For families across Florida’s 15th Congressional District in
the Tampa Bay area, I remain focused on building on that
progress—lowering costs, supporting small businesses, unleashing
American energy, securing our border, and restoring fiscal
responsibility in Washington. When we prioritize pro-growth policies,
protect our freedoms, and keep public safety at the forefront, we create
an environment where hardworking families can thrive. I am committed to

domestic manufacturing that’s returning, and trillions of dollars in

borders, restored its energy independence, strengthened its supply
chains, and renewed its promise to the next generation. Iowa’s voice and
leadership have been at the center of that progress. We’ve led the
charge to restore the American Dream of homeownership, deliver certainty
for homegrown energy, put more dollars back in working families’
pockets, and hold Washington accountable to Iowa.”

[Rep. Andy
Ogles](https://x.com/RepOgles/status/2026513395210436823?s=20): “The
State of the Union is STRONG!”

[Rep. Bob Onder](https://x.com/RepBobOnder/status/2026511204559061375):
“Tonight’s address was a powerful reminder of how blessed we are to live
in a nation defined by strength, resilience, and freedom. I am deeply
grateful to have witnessed this historic moment firsthand. @POTUS
captured what it truly means to put America first, reaffirming his
enduring commitment to lead our country into its next historic chapter.”

[Rep. Gary
Palmer](https://palmer.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/palmer-applauds-trumps-state-union-speech-america-strong-and-getting):
“Last night’s speech displayed to the American people that, thanks to
President Trump’s leadership, America is strong and getting stronger.
The American people are seeing the impacts of Republican policies in
real time. Seniors are receiving a historic tax cut, Americans are
saving roughly $1,500 annually by not paying taxes on tips or overtime,
our border is closed and our communities are safer, energy costs are
lower, and inflation is going down. The reversal of the Democrats’
regulatory agenda is saving Americans on home appliances and other goods
and services. With implementation of the Working Families Tax Cuts,
fraud in federal programs is being addressed, Medicaid reforms are
ensuring the program is protected for those who truly need it, and the
Rural Health Transformation Fund is making historic improvements in
meeting the healthcare needs of Americans in rural areas. And the
President’s Great American Healthcare Plan is emphasizing price
transparency, which will make major strides toward lowering the price of
healthcare. Additionally, America is once again respected on the world
stage because of President Trump’s commitment to ‘peace through
strength.’ As America celebrates the 250th anniversary of our
Declaration of Independence, we are also celebrating America’s comeback.
At 250 years old, our nation is strong, prosperous, and protected, and I
pray it remains this way for the next 250 years.”

[Rep. August
Pfluger](https://x.com/RepPfluger/status/2026521167633215795): “Tonight,
President Trump delivered a powerful address to the nation as America
celebrates its 250th year. Our country is stronger than ever before, and
that strength is showing up in results. President Trump did what
Washington said was impossible, what the media said would never happen,
and what radical Democrats prayed he couldn’t do. We have a military
that is feared and respected again, a border that is secure again, and
families who are finally starting to see relief after years of being
crushed by 4 years of Democrat-driven inflation. This is halftime, and
the second half is where we finish the job. House conservatives are
ready, the agenda is clear, and we are not done fighting for the
families who sent us here.”

[Rep. Mike
Rogers](https://x.com/RepMikeRogersAL/status/2026516247995703382?s=20):
“As President Trump made clear tonight, America is safer because of the
work he has done to strengthen our national defense and modernize our
military. As the threats from our adversaries continue to evolve and
intensify, it’s never been more important to fulfill his vision of Peace
through Strength. I look forward to working with him to meet his goal of
increasing defense spending to $1.5 trillion. Americans can rest easier
knowing that the state of our union is strong with President Trump in
charge. It has never been more obvious that he cares about everyday
Americans, and he cares about making our nation strong. The President is
ready to make America even greater, and I am ready to help him!”

[Rep. David
Rouzer](https://x.com/RepDavidRouzer/status/2026511099474977277?s=20):
“Tonight, President Trump reaffirmed his bold, visionary agenda for a
stronger, more prosperous union. The pro-growth tax, regulatory, and
energy policies we have put in place have lowered gas prices and
stabilized the cost of living – which had been driven by the rampant
inflation stoked by wasteful COVID-era spending. Investment and jobs are
returning to America from overseas. We are cutting wasteful spending and
rebuilding our military. After four years of open border policies which
allowed drug dealers and criminals to enter the United States at their
pleasure, our border is finally now secure. But there is more to be done
to get our country back on track. I look forward to continuing to
deliver on President Trump’s promises to restore American greatness.”

[Rep. Chip
Roy](https://x.com/RepChipRoy/status/2026512040190202003?s=20): “The
main message here was the stark contrast between the optimism of
President Trump, the direction we want to take the country, and
Democrats sitting in their seats refusing to stand up and celebrate this
great country. I think it was a clear contrast. President Trump
delivered a home run of a message tonight.”

[Rep. Mike
Rulli](https://x.com/RepMichaelRulli/status/2026509836544782592?s=20):
“Tonight’s State of the Union made one thing clear: America is back.
Lower inflation. Lower gas prices. Tax relief for working families. A
secure border. Strength restored at home and abroad. The State of our
Union is strong and getting stronger.”

[Rep. Maria Elvira
Salazar](https://x.com/RepMariaSalazar/status/2026511742465905024):
“Under Biden, families were squeezed by soaring gas prices and the worst
inflation in 40 years. With President Trump and Republican economic
policies back in place, gas is at a four-year low and inflation has
dropped to its lowest level in years. Now the economy is regaining
strength and Americans are finally breathing again.”

[Rep. Derek
Schmidt](https://x.com/RepDerekSchmidt/status/2026726690634829922): “It
was an honor last night to attend @POTUS’s State of the Union address to
a joint session of Congress. From securing the border, to lower crime
rates, to lower taxes for working families and seniors and small
businesses, to rolling back overregulation, to getting key parts of the
Farm Bill done after years stalled, to enacting 11 of the 12 annual
appropriation bills for the first time in 30 years, to reaching new
trade agreements with half a dozen trading partners after four years of
none, to meeting recruitment targets early for each branch of military
service, to providing unprecedented funding for transformative
improvements to rural healthcare, to adding reasonable work requirements
for able-bodied recipients and squeezing abuse out of public benefits
programs…America has come a long way in the right direction in a short
time. So much more needs done, but what a difference a year makes!”

[Rep. Keith
Self](https://x.com/RepKeithSelf/status/2026511173542138289?s=20):
“President Trump’s State of the Union was a masterclass. Our President
stands firm in support of our veterans, children, and hard-working
Americans alike. The State of the Union is STRONG, and getting STRONGER.
GOD BLESS AMERICA.”

[Rep. Jefferson
Shreve](https://x.com/RepShreve/status/2026516858967364065): “Tonight’s
State of the Union made one thing clear: America is getting back on
track. Inflation is down, jobs are up, and border crossings have fallen
— proof that prioritizing growth and American families works.”

[Rep. Adrian
Smith](https://x.com/RepAdrianSmith/status/2026512185711530001?s=20):
“Under President Trump’s leadership, Republicans passed the Working
Families Tax Cuts, delivering meaningful tax relief for hardworking
Americans across the country. We have seen robust engagement with key
trading partners, helping to level the playing field for American
farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and workers. Americans have seen lower
gas prices, decreased inflation, secure borders, and mortgage rates
reach a three-year low. While our work is far from over, I am encouraged
by the progress we have made and the direction our nation is headed. I
remain committed to working in Congress to build on this progress and
ensure that Nebraska’s families, small businesses, and agricultural
producers can continue to thrive. Together, we can make the Good Life
even better for all Nebraskans.”

[Rep. Jason
Smith](https://x.com/RepJasonSmith/status/2026683137858662816?s=20):
“Last night, President Trump delivered the strongest State of the Union
Address I’ve attended. His bold vision for our nation fosters
patriotism, defends American citizens, and will deliver another year of
historic results.”

[Rep. Lloyd
Smucker](https://smucker.house.gov/media/press-releases/smucker-responds-state-union-address-0):
“Tonight, President Trump made clear that the state of our Union is
strong and growing stronger. Republican policies are putting Americans
back in the driver’s seat of their futures, finances, and freedoms.
We’re securing our borders, putting more money back in the pockets of
hardworking families, and reigniting an economy that suffered under
Biden-era failures.”

[Rep. Pete
Stauber](https://x.com/RepPeteStauber/status/2026492029702721705):
“President Trump is protecting hardworking taxpayers from their dollars
being stolen by fraudsters. We should ALL cheer on President Trump as he
takes actions to stop these criminals. \#SOTU2026”

[Rep. Elise
Stefanik](https://x.com/RepStefanik/status/2026510687971795269): “It was
an honor to attend President Trump’s State of the Union where he
highlighted the significant results that he has worked with Congress to
deliver to the American people including the largest tax cut in history,
a secure border, and a peace through strength national security agenda
that supports our men and women in uniform. As always, the incredible
stories that President Trump shared about the American heroes seated
with the First Lady were inspiring. As Co-Chair of the Bipartisan
Olympic Caucus and the Representative of Lake Placid where the famed
Miracle on Ice took place 46 years ago, my favorite part was honoring
the incredible Team USA hockey gold medalists – they are American icons
and heroes. America couldn’t be prouder of them. They have continued the
extraordinary legacy of the 1980 Miracle team and inspired a nation and
a new generation.”

[Rep. Bryan
Steil](https://x.com/RepBryanSteil/status/2026507661554933818?s=20):
“Tonight, President Trump highlighted a year of promises made, promises
kept — securing our border, unleashing American energy, and making life
more affordable. We’ve made progress, but there’s more work ahead. I’ll
continue advancing commonsense policies that deliver real results for
working families and seniors.”

[Rep. Greg
Steube](https://x.com/RepGregSteube/status/2026506934048759817?s=20):
“Honored to stand with the greatest President in the history of our
country. Thanks to @realDonaldTrump, America is back.”

[Rep. Marlin
Stutzman](https://x.com/RepStutzman/status/2026488057407356953):
“President Trump is leading the American comeback… His strategic tariffs
protect jobs, strengthen our economy, and reduce reliance on countries
like China and Mexico. Supporting @POTUS’s tariff policy is supporting
American workers and families!”

[Rep. Dave
Taylor](https://x.com/RepDaveTaylor/status/2026512337004314795?s=20):
“Buckeye families know all too well how expensive everyday life can get,
and in the past year President Trump has put them first by keeping
hard-earned money in their pockets and bringing down the cost of living.
With the largest tax cuts for working families our nation has ever seen,
a historic investment in health care through the $15 billion Rural
Health Health Transformation Program, and the elimination of Biden-era
regulations that drove up energy bills and restricted American
enterprise, President Trump is making the American Dream affordable
again. As our nation celebrates 250 years, there is no better leader
than President Trump to lead us toward a safer, more prosperous, and
America-First future.”

[Rep. Claudia
Tenney](https://tenney.house.gov/media/press-releases/congresswoman-tenneys-statement-president-trumps-state-union-address):
“President Trump’s State of the Union made it unmistakably clear:
America is back on track and the state of our Union is strong. After
years of reckless spending, soaring inflation, open borders, and weak
leadership, we are finally restoring strength, stability, and common
sense. Inflation has come down dramatically from the Biden-era 40-year
high to 2.4 percent, gas prices have fallen to a four-year low, and
mortgage rates are easing. Under President Trump, private sector job
creation is booming by growing real opportunity for American workers.”

[Rep. Glenn ‘GT’
Thompson](https://x.com/CongressmanGT/status/2026509226973995037?s=20):
“Tonight, President Trump reaffirmed the strength of our great country.
From securing our borders, to passing sweeping tax reforms for all
Americans, the President has delivered on his promises.”

[Rep. William
Timmons](https://timmons.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=296):
“As America approaches the 250th anniversary of our founding, President
Trump made clear tonight that our nation is stronger, more prosperous,
and more respected because Washington is once again focused on
delivering real results for the hardworking men and women who keep this
country running.”

[Rep. David
Valadao](https://valadao.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=3563):
“I was honored to attend President Trump’s State of the Union Address to
a Joint Session of Congress. The President spoke about many issues that
are critical to families across the country—from lowering costs and
strengthening our health care system to expanding economic opportunity
for the next generation and protecting our national security. These
priorities are especially important to my constituents in the Central
Valley, and I look forward to continuing to work with the Administration
to meet these goals.”

[Rep. Derrick Van
Orden](https://x.com/derrickvanorden/status/2026518574630633887?s=20):
“Holy Bean Bags. @realDonaldTrump just delivered a SOTU for the ages. I
am so proud to be an American.”

[Rep. Tim
Walberg](https://walberg.house.gov/media/press-releases/walberg-responds-president-trumps-state-union-address):
“Tonight, I heard an important message from President Donald Trump. Our
country is reversing course from the failed policies of the previous
administration by reining in wasteful spending and costly regulations to
offer vital economic relief to Michigan families. We have made
unprecedented progress over the past year, including by increasing
take-home pay, offering historic tax relief, and unleashing domestic
energy production to alleviate the pain at the pump and allow Americans
to keep more of their hard-earned dollars. We must continue to deliver
and focus our efforts on growing our economy and reducing costs for
Michiganders so they can achieve their own American dream.”

[Rep. Randy
Weber](https://x.com/TXRandy14/status/2026509008001982505?s=20):
“Tonight, President Trump laid out a clear vision for the future of our
nation. It was a vision grounded in strength, security, affordability,
and a revival of American patriotism. What we are witnessing is America
reclaiming her strength after years of instability at home and weakness
abroad. We are once again prioritizing secure borders, energy dominance,
economic growth, and affordable living for all Americans. The President
reaffirmed his commitment to rebuilding our military, revitalizing
American manufacturing, protecting workers’ wages, and expanding
opportunity so families can keep more of what they earn. That commitment
matters deeply in Texas’ 14th Congressional District, where energy
production, industry, and national security drive both our local economy
and our national strength. When the economy is sound, jobs grow and
families feel relief at the kitchen table. The State of the Union is
strong because of the American people. Resilient workers, small business
owners, first responders, and service members power this country forward
every day. The work continues, but the path ahead is clear. I remain
committed to working alongside President Trump and my colleagues in
Congress to ensure Southeast Texas continues to grow, prosper, and
lead.”

[Rep. Daniel
Webster](https://x.com/RepWebster/status/2026510091533369641?s=20): “250
years ago, America was founded on the principles of faith, freedom and
liberty. Tonight, @POTUS reminded us that America remains the greatest
nation on earth. The state of our union is strong, and only getting
stronger.”

[Rep. Bruce
Westerman](https://x.com/RepWesterman/status/2026684307603915168?s=20):
“Over the past year, the Republican trifecta has delivered commonsense
solutions to ease the burdens everyday Arkansans are facing, and we are
just getting started. Good governance means focusing on dinner table
issues that matter most: cutting burdensome federal regulations,
lowering the cost of living, creating stronger borders, and building a
thriving economy. Tonight, while President Trump reaffirmed that vision,
it is clear that there is still more work to do. I look forward to
continuing to work with the Administration and my colleagues in the
House and Senate to champion commonsense legislation that prioritizes
American families, workers, and values.”

[Rep. Tony
Wied](https://x.com/RepTonyWied/status/2026508488176709652?s=20): “If
you watched the speech tonight, you know that President Trump has
ignited the Great American Comeback. And we’re just getting started.”

[Rep. Roger
Williams](https://x.com/RepRWilliams/status/2026510156847095864?s=20):
“As a border state, Texas has seen the devastation caused by fentanyl
and cartels. Thank you, @POTUS, for securing our border and stopping the
deadly flow of drugs into our country.”

[Rep. Steve
Womack](https://womack.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=410552):
“In the past year, President Trump has achieved measurable progress in
securing the border, reducing the flow of lethal drugs into our
communities, expanding American energy production, strengthening
national security and global leadership, growing our economy and labor
market, and easing inflation. There is still work to be done to address
years of weak leadership and misguided policy, but if the past year is
any indication, we can expect continued transformational efforts aimed
at improving the lives of all Americans now and in the years ahead.”

[Rep. Rudy
Yakym](https://x.com/RepRudyYakym/status/2026514009755644176): “An
incredible speech from @POTUS tonight. Proud of the progress we’ve made
and excited to keep delivering results for hardworking Hoosiers”

[Rep. Ryan
Zinke](https://x.com/RepRyanZinke/status/2026507710749954318?s=20):
“After years of rising prices and stagnant wages, the economy is moving
forward. Inflation is down 2 percent, GDP is up 5 percent, retirement
accounts are growing, and American families are keeping more of their
hard-earned paychecks. Gas prices dropped to $2.25 a gallon in Montana.
The border is secure after years of chaos, with law enforcement
empowered to do their jobs and keep our communities safe. The Trump
doctrine is in full effect, our enemies once again fear us, and our
allies understand we all must bear the burden in the fight for freedom.
In just one year, President Donald Trump and the Republican Congress
have restored energy independence, strengthened our military, secured
our borders, and put more money back in your pocket. Tonight, POTUS laid
out why America is back, and we are just getting started.”
