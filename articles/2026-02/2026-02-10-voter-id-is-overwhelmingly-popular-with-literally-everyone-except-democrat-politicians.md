**President Donald J. Trump has been unequivocal: Nothing is more
fundamental than the integrity and security of our elections.** That’s
why the Trump Administration

the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/saveamerica/" id="35320">SAVE
America Act</a> — commonsense legislation that requires voters to
present photo ID and implements other critical measures to protect
federal elections from fraud and abuse.

Yet, despite overwhelming popular support across every demographic,
Radical Left Democrat politicians continue to block these reforms,
placing partisan politics above the clear will of the American people —
including their own voters — and above the basic security of our
elections.

### **FACT: Voter ID is extremely popular with Americans.**

Polling has consistently shown [strong
majorities](https://x.com/ForecasterEnten/status/2018727149050741020) —
including among Democrats, independents, Whites, Blacks, and Latinos —
support voter ID requirements.

    and [The Center

    consistently show extraordinary support for voter ID.
-   [**CNN reporter Harry
    Enten**](https://x.com/ForecasterEnten/status/2018727149050741020)**:**
    “The bottom line is this: Voter ID is NOT controversial in this
    country. A photo ID to vote is NOT controversial in this country. It
    is not controversial by party and it is not controversial by race.
    The vast majority of Americans agree.”
-   [**NBC Nightly News anchor Tom
    Llamas**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2020992620076355910)**:**
    “Voter ID rules do have wide public support, but the vast majority
    of Democrats on Capitol Hill oppose them.”

**This isn’t a close call.** It’s time for Congress to act — and for
Democrat politicians to stop standing in the way of election security.
