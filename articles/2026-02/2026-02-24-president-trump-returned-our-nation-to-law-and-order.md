title: President Trump Returned Our Nation to Law and Order
---
 
After years of chaos, skyrocketing crime, and soft-on-crime policies
under Biden plunged the nation’s biggest cities into anarchy and
disorder, President Donald J. Trump took office on a promise to restore
public safety — and one year later, it is clear that he has delivered.

**Under President Trump, America is safer, stronger, and winning again —
and the era of Democrat-inspired lawlessness is over:**

-   The murder rate in the nation’s biggest cities
    has [fallen](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/22/murder-rate-century-low) to
    its lowest level in at least 125 years — marking the [largest
    single-year
    drop](https://www.axios.com/2025/12/24/us-trump-murder-data-killing-crime-national-guard)
    in recorded history.
-   In 2025, the nation saw [steep
    declines](https://www.axios.com/2026/02/11/violent-crime-homicides-falls-major-cities-trump)
    across every major violent crime category compared to the prior
    year, with overall murders down 19%, robberies down 20%, and
    aggravated assaults down nearly 10%.
    -   [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2026/02/11/violent-crime-homicides-falls-major-cities-trump):
        “Violent crime dropped sharply across America’s biggest cities
        in 2025.”
-   The nation also saw [dramatic
    reductions](https://majorcitieschiefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MCCA-Violent-Crime-Report-2025-and-2024-January-to-September.pdf) in
    rapes, robberies, aggravated assaults, shooting deaths
    ([fewest](https://www.thetrace.org/2025/12/data-shooting-stats-gun-violence-america/) since
    2015), [on-duty law enforcement officer

    low](https://nleomf.org/2025-year-end-officer-fatalities-report/)), [traffic

    and [overdose](https://www.drugtopics.com/view/opioid-overdose-deaths-fall-by-34-in-2025-ashp-midyear-2025) [deaths](https://www.aha.org/news/headline/2026-01-15-overdose-deaths-fell-nearly-21-2025).
-   The Trump Administration captured a [record
    number](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/fbi-director-kash-patel-we-have-made-america-safer-just-one-year)
    of criminals on the FBI’s Most Wanted List — outpacing the number
    captured under Biden in just one year.
-   The results are especially pronounced in Democrat-run jurisdictions
    where the Trump Administration conducted mass deportation and
    enhanced law enforcement operations.

While Democrats fight to sabotage these gains and drag us back to the
chaos of open borders, skyrocketing costs, and rampant crime, President
Trump remains unwavering in his commitment to delivering the security,
prosperity, and safety the American people deserve.
