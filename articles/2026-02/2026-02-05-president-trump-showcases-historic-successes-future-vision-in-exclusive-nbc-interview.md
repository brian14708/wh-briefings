## **Here are some key moments:**

-   **On his motivations for public service:** “I only do this for one
    reason: Make America Great Again, and that’s what we’re doing. We’re
    making America great again — greater than ever before.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2019196773105811856))
-   **On the Trump Administration’s highly successful immigration
    enforcement:** “We are totally focused on criminals — really bad
    criminals… We have 11,888 murderers that Biden and his group let
    into our country. We’ve captured a lot of them… We are after those
    people. We’re after the drug dealers… We’re getting them out.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2019204125737546014))
-   **On the unprecedented success of his first year back in office:**
    “You know, I’ve done a great job as President. They say I’ve had the
    best first year of any President in history — and I think I have. If
    you look, I settled eight wars, biggest tax cuts ever… I think I had
    the greatest first year that we’ve had.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2019217004570505711))
-   **On voter ID:** “Why don’t the Democrats want voter ID? You know
    who does want voter ID? Democrat voters want it — but Democrat
    politicians don’t. Why don’t they want it?  Because they want to
    cheat on elections… If they don’t want voter ID, that means they
    want to cheat. We can’t allow cheating in elections.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2019196190647095317))
-   **On the massive fraud scandals plaguing Minnesota and other
    Democrat-run states:** “Minnesota and these other states, we have
    massive investigations going into fraud. Do you know if we captured
    50% of the fraud of this country right now, we would have better
    than a balanced budget?… Minnesota: $19 billion in fraud that we
    know about.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2019208942769860922))
-   **On the honor of serving as President:** “All I know is this: It’s
    such an honor. I’m walking down and everyone’s screaming, ‘GOAT!
    GOAT!’ I said, ‘What are they talking about?’ I hope they’re right —
    not for me, but for the country. Because if I do a great job that
    means the country is doing well.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2019212957842907383))
-   **On recent shootings in Minneapolis:** “I’m not happy with the two
    incidents… ICE wasn’t happy, either, but I’m going to always be with
    our great people of law enforcement. ICE, police, we have to back
    them. If we don’t back them, we don’t have a country.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2019194653921219054))
-   **On his confidence in Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem:**
    “She was in charge of the border. The border is closed… We have the
    best crime numbers that we’ve had in 125 years. I think she’s doing
    a very good job… She’s not getting credit for the job that she
    does.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2019204918167343167))
-   **On Artificial Intelligence:** “AI is a big deal. AI is going to be
    maybe the biggest thing — bigger than the Internet, bigger than
    anything else. We are leading China by a lot. We are leading
    everybody by a lot.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2019208061890482593))
-   **On his health:** “I feel great. I mean, physically and mentally, I
    feel like I did 50 years ago. It’s crazy. Now, there’ll be a time
    when I won’t be able to give you that answer — but that time hasn’t
    come yet.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2019213804186321317))
-   **On top Administration officials:** “JD \[Vance\] is fantastic and
    Marco \[Rubio\] is fantastic. They’re both doing a great job… One is
    slightly more diplomatic than the other. I think they’re both of
    very high intelligence… They’re both very capable.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2019197646276292738))
-   **On corruption in Democrat-run cities:** “There are some areas in
    our country that are extremely corrupt. They have very corrupt
    elections. Take a look at Detroit. Take a look at Philadelphia. Take
    a look at Atlanta. There are some areas that are unbelievably
    corrupt. I could give you plenty more, too. I say that we cannot
    have corrupt elections.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2019196190647095317))
-   **On Cuba:** “We are talking to Cuba… We have tens of thousands of
    people that were forced out of there… Maybe they want to go back
    because they’re going to have that choice. For years, they’ve been
    talking about this happening. Now, it’s happening. We are talking to
    Cuba. We want to open it up to those people that want to visit.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2019214332085649427))
-   **On Chinese President Xi Jinping:** “We have a very good
    relationship — and, you know, it’s important that I have a good
    relationship and, for him, that he has a good relationship with me.
    These are the two most powerful countries in the world and we have a
    very good relationship… China is paying a lot of tariffs. In the
    past, they didn’t.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2019206036616306720))
-   **On constructing a triumphal arch in Washington, D.C., to
    commemorate America’s 250th birthday:** “We’re doing one that will
    be more magnificent and larger than the Arc de Triomphe in Paris…
    It’s incredible. We’re going to do one that’s going to top it.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2019213547473887679))
-   **On his safety in the aftermath of two assassination attempts:** “I
    worry about it, but you have to put it out of your mind otherwise
    you wouldn’t be able to do your job.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2019214237512409456))
-   **On his predecessor:** “Biden was a bad thing for old people. He’s
    the worst thing that ever happened to old people because he
    obviously didn’t have it — and one of the things that’s so
    depressing about the press is the press refused to report the
    obvious.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2019216020830081280))
