title: President Trump Launches TrumpRx.gov, Delivering Massive, Immediate Savings
  to Millions of Americans
---
 
**Last night, President Donald J. Trump officially unveiled**
[**TrumpRx.gov**](https://trumprx.gov/)**, a transformative new
government platform that gives Americans direct access to dramatically
lower prices on dozens of common, high-cost brand-name prescription
drugs.** Secured through landmark
[Most-Favored-Nation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/delivering-most-favored-nation-prescription-drug-pricing-to-american-patients/)
pricing agreements with leading pharmaceutical manufacturers, these
deals ensure Americans pay prices aligned with the lowest in other
developed nations, ending decades of overpayment and delivering
immediate relief.

Starting today, American patients — especially the millions who face
high out-of-pocket costs for medications not fully covered by insurance
— can access [substantially
lower](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2019780799663325209) prices
on dozens of essential drugs via [TrumpRx.gov](https://trumprx.gov/). As
the Trump Administration pursues the best possible deals for the
American people, additional high-cost medications will be added on a
rolling basis.

## **Key examples of the savings include:**

**GLP-1 medications — among the highest-spend drugs in the U.S. — have
dramatic price reductions on TrumpRx.gov.**

-   The monthly prices of [Ozempic®](https://trumprx.gov/p/ozempic) and
    injectable [Wegovy®](https://trumprx.gov/p/wegovy) drop from $1,028

    depending on dosage.

## **This launch marks only the beginning.**

The Trump Administration will be onboarding additional companies that
have Most-Favored-Nation agreements and is aggressively pursuing
additional agreements to expand the platform — ultimately driving even
greater savings for Americans on prescription drugs.

**For Americans who obtain their prescriptions through insurance,
President Trump calls on Congress to swiftly pass his** [**Great
Healthcare Plan**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/greathealthcare/)**.**
This comprehensive reform would codify the savings from the
Most-Favored-Nation initiative, lower insurance premiums, hold big
insurance companies accountable, maximize price transparency, and enable
coverage of TrumpRx.gov purchases under health plans — ensuring every
American benefits from these historic reductions in drug costs.
