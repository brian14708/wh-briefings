title: American Energy Dominance Is Back Under President Trump
---
 
President Donald J. Trump has delivered on his promise to unleash
American energy, putting an end to years of burdensome regulations,
job-killing mandates, and foreign-dependent policies. Through decisive
action, the United States has reclaimed its position as the world’s
leading energy producer and exporter, driving economic growth, lowering
costs for families, and enhancing national security.

-   **Record-Breaking LNG Exports**: In 2025, the United States [set a
    historic new
    record](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2008179697298121083) by
    exporting more than 100 million metric tons of liquefied natural gas
    (LNG) in a single year — the first country ever to achieve this
    milestone.

        that natural gas production will continue reaching record highs
        in 2026 and 2027, fueled by President Trump’s “Drill Baby Drill”
        agenda.

    of acres for oil, gas, and coal production, reversing prior
    restrictions and prioritizing American resources.
-   **Surge in Drilling Permits:** The Trump Administration’s has
    [approved](https://www.eenews.net/articles/oil-and-gas-drilling-permits-surge-55-under-trump/)
    nearly 6,000 applications for permits to drill on federal lands — a
    55% increase compared to the same period in 2024-2025 — accelerating
    domestic energy development and creating jobs.

    [committed](https://www.energy.gov/articles/energy-department-announces-625-million-investment-reinvigorate-and-expand-americas-coal)

    excessive regulations, President Trump has restored choice for
    American consumers in everyday products — including vehicles,
    straws, showerheads, toilets, washing machines, lightbulbs, stoves,
    and dishwashers —

    the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accord and dozens of other Radical

    in the coming year, bolstering clean, reliable baseload power.
-   **Historic Deregulation:** The Environmental Protection Agency
    [rescinded](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/president-trump-and-administrator-zeldin-deliver-single-largest-deregulatory-action-us)
    the Obama-era Endangerment Finding, eliminating [over $1.3

    in regulatory costs that had stifled innovation and raised prices.
    The Trump Administration also [rolled

    Biden-era Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, averting
    a $1,000 increase in the average cost of a new vehicle and
    preserving affordable options for American drivers.
-   **Ending the EV Mandate:** President Trump
    [halted](https://www.energy.gov/articles/energy-department-announces-termination-223-projects-saving-over-75-billion)
    the wasteful Biden-era electric vehicle push, including the $7.5
    billion federal EV charger program that had delivered [only
    eight](https://www.autoweek.com/news/a60702457/federal-funds-yield-only-8-ev-charging-stations/)
    charging stations as of May 2024, redirecting resources toward
    practical, consumer-driven energy solutions.

These actions reflect President Trump’s unwavering commitment to energy
independence, economic prosperity, and putting America First — and as he
speaks to the nation tonight, the results are clear: American energy
dominance is delivering real benefits to hardworking families across the
country.
