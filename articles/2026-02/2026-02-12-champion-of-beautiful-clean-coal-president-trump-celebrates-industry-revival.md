**Yesterday, President Donald J. Trump**
[**welcomed**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2021700356120395789?s=20)
**lawmakers, industry leaders, and hardworking miners from across the
country to the White House “Champion of Coal” event.** There, he signed
an [Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2026/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-strengthens-united-states-national-defense-with-americas-beautiful-clean-coal-power-generation-fleet/)
directing the Department of War to purchase coal power,
[celebrated](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2021701974207431094?s=20)
the Tennessee Valley Authority’s recommitment to coal, and was
[honored](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2021713744129294532?s=20)
by coal miners as the “Undisputed Champion of Beautiful, Clean Coal” for
his tireless leadership in ending the Radical Left’s war on the
industry.

This event underscored President Trump’s unwavering support for
beautiful, clean coal — supporting workers, delivering affordable and
dependable energy to Americans, creating high-paying jobs in rural
communities, and enhancing our national security through American energy
dominance.

### **Here’s what they’re saying:**

-   [Peabody Energy CEO James
    Grech](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2021713020452303356?s=20):
    “We stand here today representing the thousands of coal miners
    across the country to express our deep gratitude, sir, for the
    actions you’ve taken to support our industry. Your leadership and
    decisive actions have sent a powerful message: We have a President
    who, more than any other, deeply understands the importance of coal
    in supporting the future of this nation.”
-   [Indiana coal worker Kayla
    Blackford](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2021703749840892055?s=20):
    “We are real people under these hard hats. On behalf of America’s
    coal miners, thank you, Mr. President, for recognizing the value of
    coal and the value of the power who power this industry.”
-   [American Coal Council CEO Emily
    Arthun](https://x.com/AmericanCoal/status/2021904138452578690):
    “Grateful to President Trump and his Administration for their
    continued support of the U.S. coal industry. Honored to witness him
    receive the ‘Undisputed Champion of Beautiful Clean Coal’ award from
    the Washington Coal Club. A meaningful moment for coal communities
    across America.”
-   [West Virginia Gov. Patrick
    Morrisey](https://x.com/wvgovernor/status/2021731721046118407): “I
    applaud President Trump and @SecretaryWright for taking decisive
    action to strengthen America’s energy security and support the
    communities that have long powered this nation. This investment to
    modernize coal-fired power plants is a major win for West Virginia
    workers, West Virginia communities, and every American who depends
    on affordable, reliable electricity… For too long, misguided
    policies targeted coal and the families who rely on it. That
    approach weakened grid reliability and drove up costs. Today’s
    announcement of this investment, alongside the executive order
    directing the @DeptofWar to pursue power purchasing agreements with
    coal plants, reflects a return to common-sense energy policy that
    values reliability, affordability, and American jobs.”
-   [West Virginia State Senator Chris
    Rose](https://x.com/ChrisRoseWV/status/2021737937495326817):
    “Honored to be at the White House today with President Trump as he
    signed the executive order directing the Pentagon to buy power from
    coal plants—a massive boost for WV miners & energy independence!
    Proud to see him honored as Undisputed Champion of Coal.”
-   [Secretary of the Interior Doug
    Burgum](https://x.com/SecretaryBurgum/status/2021722191717384393?s=20):
    “@POTUS is unlocking America’s energy potential by strengthening
    coal production. Coal powers our grid, drives innovation, and
    supports thousands of hardworking Americans. With smarter, cleaner,
    more responsible mining, we’re advancing U.S. energy and jobs like
    never before!”
-   [EPA Administrator Lee
    Zeldin](https://x.com/epaleezeldin/status/2021972564021850591?s=20):
    “President Trump has SAVED America’s clean, beautiful coal industry
    that has kept our nation’s families warm and safe during recent
    weeks of freezing cold.”
-   [Senate Majority Whip John
    Barrasso](https://x.com/SenJohnBarrasso/status/2021701519477711076):
    “It’s great to be at the @WhiteHouse today. What a difference a new
    administration makes. America is no longer apologizing for using our
    God-given resources. Thanks to @POTUS and Republicans, WY coal
    miners are powering the nation with affordable, available, reliable
    coal.”
-   [Sen. Jim
    Banks](https://x.com/SenatorBanks/status/2021959470176227721?s=20):
    “Thank you President Trump for fighting for Indiana coal workers”
-   [Sen. Marsha
    Blackburn](https://x.com/marshablackburn/status/2021745421068964096?s=46):
    “It was great to be at the White House today as President Trump
    signed an executive order to ensure Americans have the energy they
    need. Clean coal keeps the lights on and drives down the cost of
    electricity across the country.”
-   [Sen. Ted
    Budd](https://x.com/SenTedBuddNC/status/2021733285173272869?s=20):
    “Attended the Champion of Coal event, where @POTUS announced new
    resources & efforts to extend the life of coal plants in NC & across
    the country. It reminded me of Amy Kate’s granddad, a hardworking
    coal miner in WV, & the importance of delivering affordable,
    reliable energy to our communities.”
-   [Sen. Shelley Moore
    Capito](https://x.com/SenCapito/status/2021716147985387822?s=20):
    “Honored to join @potus today at the @WhiteHouse for an event
    celebrating the coal industry and the hard work these men and women
    do every day to keep the lights on in WV and across our country. It
    was also great to see President Trump recognized for his efforts to
    prioritize the coal industry— America’s most reliable and affordable
    energy source.”
-   [Sen. Bill
    Hagerty](https://x.com/SenatorHagerty/status/2021707333806555304): “@POTUS doing
    a great job and TVA is heeding the call to preserve and expand
    capacity, focusing on American competitiveness.”
-   [Sen. Jim
    Justice](https://x.com/JimJustice_WV/status/2021736183479365814?s=20)
    “Proud to join @POTUS in a room full of hard-working American miners
    at the @WhiteHouse to send a clear message—COAL IS HERE TO STAY.
    West Virginia is blessed with an abundance of beautiful, clean coal,
    and we’ll continue to unleash it in every single way!”
-   [Sen. Cynthia
    Lummis](https://x.com/SenLummis/status/2021953826752753923):
    “America’s coal workers keep the lights on and our nation running
    strong. I am grateful for the men and women who power this country.
    We are living in the Golden Age of American Energy.”
-   [Sen. Mitch
    McConnell](https://x.com/SenMcConnell/status/2021733805011112066):
    “After years of the Obama-Biden War on Coal, the Trump
    Administration is rolling back regulatory overreach that targeted
    affordable and reliable American energy. The actions of the
    Obama-Biden Administrations forced miners into early retirement,
    hurt rural communities, raised energy prices, and weakened our
    national security—while China, our top strategic competitor, made
    massive investments in expanding coal production. Instead of closing
    coal-fired power plants, we should be focused on preserving
    good-paying jobs and ensuring the availability of reliable,
    affordable energy for American families. Coupled with Tennessee
    Valley Authority’s efforts to support coal’s comeback in Kentucky,
    today’s announcement by the President is welcome news to the
    communities and thousands of workers whose livelihoods depend on the
    coal industry.”
-   [Senate Committee on Energy and Natural
    Resources](https://x.com/EnergyGOP/status/2021703763094855778):
    “Coal is critical to our national security and vital to everything
    from steel production to shipbuilding to artificial intelligence.
    Coal keeps the lights on.”
-   [Rep. Andy
    Barr](https://x.com/RepAndyBarr/status/2021726255465254976?s=20):
    “Kentucky coal is BACK — and it’s because President Trump fights for
    American energy. Proud to be at the White House today as the
    President signs an Executive Order for the @DeptofWar to purchase
    more American coal. God bless our miners. God bless KY. God bless
    the USA.”
-   [Rep. Troy
    Downing](https://x.com/RepTroyDowning/status/2021705892396253653?s=20):
    “National security and energy security go hand in hand. Thank you
    for your commitment to coal-fired energy, @POTUS. Montana is ready
    to lead.”
-   [Rep. Chuck
    Fleischmann](https://x.com/RepChuck/status/2021690526756409611): “This
    is BIG news for @TVAnews and the entire Southeast United States! TVA
    is one of our best energy assets, and we must utilize all of TVA’s
    resources to keep energy costs low and power abundant. President
    Trump is making TVA Great Again and ensuring American Energy
    Dominance!”
-   [Rep. Morgan
    Griffith](https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=405602):
    “Coal communities, like those in Virginia’s Ninth District, have
    abundant American energy resources in their backyards. We can meet
    domestic electricity and industrial energy demands with American
    energy, all while implementing emission reduction technologies. It
    is essential that federal policies support and protect coal
    communities, not ignore or diminish them! As long as I am in
    Congress, I will continue advocating for American coal. Coal can be
    used to generate electricity in order to keep our factories,
    hospitals and schools open. It can also be used as a means to
    support American steelmaking. Further, as we continue to develop the
    best pollution control measures in the world, we can export those
    pollution control technologies overseas to countries that will use
    coal no matter what happens in the United States. Thus, we help
    deliver reliable, affordable energy solutions for American families
    and the world.”
-   [Rep. Mike
    Kelly](https://kelly.house.gov/media/press-releases/kelly-joins-president-trump-white-house-tout-clean-american-coal):
    “This executive order is a big win for Pennsylvania’s coal industry
    and our hardworking coal miners. From day one, President Trump has
    committed to common sense energy policy and to expanding American
    energy production. This executive order delivers on that promise.”
-   [Rep. Dan
    Meuser](https://x.com/RepMeuser/status/2021734607687754187): “Today,
    I joined @POTUS, several of my @HouseGOP colleagues, coal industry
    leaders, and the hardworking men and women who power America’s coal
    industry at the @WhiteHouse for the “Big, Beautiful, Coal” event,
    where President Trump signed an executive order directing the
    @DeptofWar to work directly with America’s coal plants to purchase
    power. This strengthens our national defense, secures the electric
    grid, and reinforces American energy independence. Beautiful, clean
    American coal keeps the lights on, lowers electricity costs, and
    supports thousands of good-paying jobs, especially in Pennsylvania’s
    Ninth District. President Trump is restoring American energy
    dominance by boosting coal production, keeping power plants online,
    and reversing Joe Biden’s failed energy policies. That means
    reliable power for our military, affordable energy for families, and
    a stronger, more secure nation.”
-   [Rep. Carol
    Miller](https://x.com/RepCarolMiller/status/2021742280919458160):
    “It was wonderful to be at the White House this evening to celebrate
    our coal industry. Our miners work tirelessly to keep our homes
    heated and ensure a reliable energy grid. Thank you, President
    Trump, for your commitment to our state and for always being a
    champion of coal!”
-   [Rep. Riley
    Moore](https://x.com/RepRileyMoore/status/2021757446222406127):
    “Great to be at the White House today to celebrate @POTUS being
    named a Champion of Coal alongside Senator Zack
    Maynard, @SpeakerHanshaw, and @DelegateRiley. It’s great to have a
    President who has fought for BEAUTIFUL, CLEAN COAL since his first
    day in office. Today just built on the President’s great legacy as
    he signed a major Executive Order directing the DOD to purchase
    power from coal-fired power plants, and he announced that he is
    going to invest in critical coal power plants to keep the fire
    burning for American energy dominance. Thank you, President Trump,
    for making beautiful clean coal great again!”
-   [Rep. Hal
    Rogers](https://x.com/RepHalRogers/status/2021967957929124101?s=20):
    “President Trump, thank you for being a champion for coal!
    Energizing our national security with coal-fired power will make
    America stronger.”
-   [Rep. Matt Van
    Epps](https://x.com/repvanepps/status/2021753175200436359): “This is
    momentous for Tennessee! Thank you, @POTUS!”
