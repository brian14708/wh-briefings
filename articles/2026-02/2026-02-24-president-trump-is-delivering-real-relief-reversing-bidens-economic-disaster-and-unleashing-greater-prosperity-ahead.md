title: "President Trump Is Delivering Real Relief \u2014 Reversing Biden\u2019s Economic\
  \ Disaster and Unleashing Greater Prosperity Ahead"
---
 
Since returning to office, President Donald J. Trump has moved swiftly
to restore affordability and rebuild the American Dream for hardworking
Americans. Through bold America First policies — unleashing American
energy dominance, cutting crippling red tape, securing massive tax
relief, and putting American workers first — President Trump is swiftly
undoing the Biden-era catastrophe of soaring prices, stagnant wages, and
lost opportunities.

**Everyday costs are finally falling, wages are rising faster than
inflation, and private sector jobs are surging while government
bureaucracy shrinks.** Relief is hitting wallets now — and even bigger
gains are coming as President Trump’s pro-growth agenda fully unleashes
a new golden age of American prosperity.

### **Everyday Prices Are Easing — With More Relief Coming**

-   **Gas prices** are dropping sharply, hitting new [multi-year
    lows](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2026/01/big-wins-for-american-families-as-gas-prices-mortgage-rates-plummet/#:~:text=Gas%20drops%20its%20lowest%20price%20in%20years%20%E2%80%94%20again.)

    nationally for the first time [since
    2020](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gas-price-2026-lowest-since-2020/)
    — thanks to American energy dominance.

        two decades.
-   **Beef, eggs, and coffee prices** all
    [declined](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.t02.htm) in January
    while overall inflation has cooled to 2.4% — a dramatic turnaround
    from Biden’s runaway highs and a clear sign of relief from President
    Trump’s pro-growth, anti-inflation agenda.
-   **Prescription drugs** are becoming [more
    affordable](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CUUR0000SEMF01?output_view=pct_12mths)
    thanks to President Trump’s Most Favored Nation reforms and direct
    savings delivered to patients through

    Americans’ wallets.
-   **Mortgage rates** have dropped to their lowest levels [since
    2022](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/23/mortgage-rates-below-6percent-lowest-in-4-years.html),
    making homeownership more achievable for millions of families
    chasing the American Dream.
-   **Apartment rents** have declined for [six straight
    months](https://www.apartmentlist.com/research/national-rent-data),
    dipping to their [lowest
    level](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/29/apartment-rents-just-dropped-to-the-lowest-level-in-4-years.html)
    in four years, with median asking rents down year-over-year in major
    markets and vacancy rates rising to renter-friendly levels as supply
    catches up after years of shortages.

### **Wages Are Rising Fast — Outpacing Inflation and Restoring Purchasing Power**

Under Biden, American workers
[lost](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/americans-have-lost-4200-income-under-biden-wiping-out-trump-gains-heritage#:~:text=Consumer%20prices%20have%20risen%2012.7%25%20since%20January%202021%2C%20much%20faster%20than%20wages%2C%20which%20Heritage%20analysts%20say%20has%20cost%20the%20average%20American%20worker%20%243%2C000%20in%20annual%20purchasing%20power.%C2%A0)
nearly $3,000 in purchasing power as inflation outpaced wage growth.
**In President Trump’s second term:**

-   Private sector workers have seen strong real wage gains,
    [growing](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2026/02/13/white-house-real-wages-grew-by-1400-in-private-sector-in-trumps-first-year/)
    nearly $1,400 in just one year — decisively beating inflation.
    -   Blue-collar workers are
        [winning](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2026/02/13/white-house-real-wages-grew-by-1400-in-private-sector-in-trumps-first-year/)
        biggest: mining workers up ~$2,400, construction workers up
        ~$2,100, and manufacturing workers up ~$1,700 in real terms.
-   Average hourly earnings are
    [up](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2026/02/president-trump-delivers-another-inflation-win-real-wages-surge-price-relief-reaches-americans/#:~:text=Wages%20are%20growing,producing%20workers%3A%20%2B%241%2C700)
    solidly, with weekly earnings growing faster than prices—putting
    real money back in family pockets.

### **Private Sector Boom: Jobs for American Workers, Not Bureaucrats**

-   President Trump has delivered over
    [615,000](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES0500000001?output_view=net_12mths)
    net private sector jobs in his second term, with federal employment
    falling to its lowest level since 1966 — the lowest level in
    recorded history as a share of the total workforce.
-   All [job
    growth](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2026/02/this-is-the-trump-economy-job-growth-crushes-expectations-as-more-americans-work-for-higher-wages/#:~:text=January%27s%20130%2C000%20new%20nonfarm%20jobs,Articles)
    is going to American workers in the private sector — not government
    expansion or illegal aliens.

### **Historic Tax Relief Is Putting Thousands More Dollars Back in Pockets**

-   Thanks to President Trump’s landmark [Working Families Tax Cuts
    Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/obbb/) — opposed by every single
    Democrat — Americans are seeing significantly larger tax refunds
    this season.
    -   Average refunds are up by nearly [15% per
        filer](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/yourmoney/article-15584055/irs-tax-refund-rise-trump-obba.html)
        — with total tax savings [exceeding
        $2,400](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/yourmoney/article-15584055/irs-tax-refund-rise-trump-obba.html)
        for many taxpayers through game-changing provisions like No Tax
        on Tips, No Tax on Overtime, No Tax on Social Security, auto
        loan interest deductions for American-made vehicles, and [much
        more](http://wh.gov/obbb).

### **Deregulation Is Slashing Costs and Unleashing Growth**

-   By rolling back Biden’s expensive and unworkable fuel efficiency
    mandates, the Trump Administration is saving families [$109
    billion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/12/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-announces-the-reset-of-corporate-average-fuel-economy-cafe-standards/)
    over the next five years on vehicles.
-   Eliminating the flawed Obama-era “Endangerment Finding” — endlessly
    exploited by Radical Left activists and bureaucrats — has removed
    the legal foundation for over [$1.3
    trillion](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/president-trump-and-administrator-zeldin-deliver-single-largest-deregulatory-action-us)
    in crushing regulations on American families and businesses.
-   Overall, deregulation efforts in 2025 are projected to save
    Americans a collective [$212
    billion](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaEO14192) — roughly
    $2,500 per family of four. 

### **Economic Strength Is Surging Back**

-   Since President Trump took office, companies
    have [poured](https://www.whitehouse.gov/investments/) trillion of
    dollars of new investment into U.S.-based operations — onshoring
    jobs and fueling investment booms in manufacturing, energy, and
    technology.
-   President Trump is securing fair deals that protect American
    industries, expand markets, and reduce the trade deficit ([down
    17%](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-11/us-budget-gap-shrinks-17-for-first-third-of-2026-fiscal-year)
    thanks to tariff revenues and growth).

**President Trump is delivering real results today, reversing the damage
of Democrat policies to put workers and families first.** After years of
hardship under Biden — soaring costs, eroding wages, and lost
opportunities — American families are finally experiencing real
turnaround: wages climbing, prices easing, and jobs expanding.

**And President Trump is just getting started.** More relief is coming —
and even greater prosperity awaits — as the Trump Administration’s
policies continue to unleash the full potential of the American economy.

**A new era of strength, abundance, and golden prosperity is underway.**
