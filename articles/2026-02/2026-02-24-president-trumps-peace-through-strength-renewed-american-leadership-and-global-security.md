  \ and Global Security"

President Donald J. Trump will always put the American people first —
and that includes his unwavering commitment to an America First foreign
policy. Through bold actions rooted in Peace Through Strength, President
Trump has ended conflicts, dismantled threats, and rebuilt U.S. military
dominance, making the world safer for Americans and restoring respect
for the United States on the global stage.
