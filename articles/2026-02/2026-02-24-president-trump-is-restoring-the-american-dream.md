title: President Trump Is Restoring the American Dream

President Donald J. Trump is delivering real progress in making
homeownership and housing affordable again so all families can realize
the American Dream of homeownership — and much more relief is on the
way.

**Since taking office, the Trump Administration’s whole-of-government
approach has driven positive momentum in lowering housing costs:**

-   Mortgage rates have fallen to their [lowest

    since 2022 under President Trump, underscoring the Administration’s
    ongoing commitment to lowering costs for hardworking Americans.
