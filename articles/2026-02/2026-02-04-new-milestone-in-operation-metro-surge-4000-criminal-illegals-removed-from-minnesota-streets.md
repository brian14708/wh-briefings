title: 'New Milestone in Operation Metro Surge: 4,000+ Criminal Illegals Removed from
  Minnesota Streets'

> **“President Trump’s commonsense immigration enforcement policies are

> President Trump is reversing that horrific damage and removing these

> commitment to draw down forces in Minneapolis today follows these

> local officials in Minnesota. Commitments like these from elected

**in Minnesota since President Donald J. Trump launched Operation Metro
Surge.** This landmark achievement marks another decisive step forward
in the Trump Administration’s relentless drive to dismantle the
devastating effects of the Radical Left’s open border policies and
deliver his promise to restore law and order to our communities.

**the unprecedented level of cooperation now emerging from local
officials — compelled by the Trump Administration’s sustained, resolute
enforcement:**

-   “We currently have an unprecedented number of counties communicating
    with us now and allowing ICE to take custody of illegal aliens
    BEFORE they hit the streets.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2019052612121719012))
-   “For those who are not a national security threat or public safety
    risk, you are NOT exempt from immigration enforcement actions. If
    you’re in the country illegally, you are NOT off the table… Let me
    be clear: President Trump fully intends to achieve mass deportations
    during this Administration.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2019053966433149052))
-   “We are NOT surrendering the President’s mission on a mass
    deportation operation. If you are in the country illegally, if we
    find you, we’ll deport you.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2019059074491424990))
-   “We’ve got special agents on detail here doing the fraud
    investigation. They’re not going anywhere. They’re going to finish
    their job.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2019057127180976456))
-   “We moved immediately to prioritize full body cam deployment in this
    city… The plan is to deploy them nationwide.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2019053484515930314))
-   “\[The goal\] is to achieve a complete drawdown and end this surge
    as soon as we can, but that is largely contingent upon the end of
    the illegal and threatening activities against ICE and its federal
    partners that we’re seeing in the community. We will not draw down
    on personnel providing security for our officers.” 
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2019054337620586985))
-   “President Trump and I would like to thank the men and women of ICE,
    Border Patrol, and other federal agencies on the ground here for
    your dedication to the oath you swore to enforce the federal laws
    and promote public safety through the work you do.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2019055487094792420))
-   “I’d like to thank President Trump for his steadfast leadership and
    commitment to law enforcement, public safety, and prosperity… I’ve
    worked for six Presidents in ten Administrations. When it comes to
    public safety, border security, immigration enforcement — no one’s
    done it better than President Trump. His success is unprecedented.”
