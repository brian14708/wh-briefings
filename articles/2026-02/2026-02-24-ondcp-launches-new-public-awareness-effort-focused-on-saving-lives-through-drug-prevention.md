title: ONDCP Launches New Public Awareness Effort Focused on Saving Lives Through
  Drug Prevention
---
 
**Washington, D.C.** – The White House Office of National Drug Control
Policy (ONDCP) has released a new video on Facebook and Instagram to
raise public awareness for the grave threat that illicit drugs pose to
human life. This video message features several parents who have
suffered the unthinkable tragedy of losing their children to drugs,
including fentanyl. These parents understand the horrific impact of the
illicit drug crisis on families and communities nationwide.

“Preventing illicit drug use and protecting families remain ONDCP’s core
mission,” said Director Sara Carter. “Traffickers exploit online
platforms to sell illicit drugs that can be deadly when laced with
illicit substances, such as fentanyl. We must continue to teach our
children about the dangers of drugs and protect them from those who seek
to do irreparable harm.”

This video will be shared on Facebook and Instagram with the support of
Meta, which is partnering with ONDCP to help extend the reach of this
prevention message. Through partnering with families, communities, and
the private-sector, ONDCP hopes to take historic action that will
continue to decrease drug-related deaths and end drug use before it
starts.
