title: President Trump Delivers Biggest Regulatory Relief in History
---
 
**This week, President Donald J. Trump
[announced](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2022018893825692007)
the [single largest deregulatory
action](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/president-trump-and-administrator-zeldin-deliver-single-largest-deregulatory-action-us)
in American history: the full revocation of the disastrous Obama-era
“Endangerment Finding” and the consumer mandates that depended on it.**
This decisive action dismantles the flawed 2009 determination that
Democrats weaponized to justify over $1.3 trillion in burdensome
regulations on American families, businesses, and consumers.

**This historic step clears the path for lower prices, greater consumer
choice, and a thriving economy.** American families will save an average
of over $2,400 on new cars, SUVs, and trucks. Transportation and
trucking costs will drop, helping bring down the price of everyday
goods. Drivers will no longer be forced into unnecessary, unpopular
features that limit choice and jack up costs.

President Trump is proving once again that strong leadership delivers
real results: lower prices, more freedom, and a stronger economy for
every American.

### **Here’s what they’re saying:**

[America’s Power President and CEO Michelle
Bloodworth](https://americaspower.org/press_release/americas-power-statement-on-epas-decision-to-repeal-the-mobile-source-endangerment-finding/):
“EPA’s Endangerment Finding has been used as the basis for regulations
that threaten the reliability of our nation’s electric grid.  These
regulations, such as President Obama’s Clean Power Plan and President
Biden’s Clean Power Plan 2.0, were designed to force the premature
retirement of coal power plants across the U.S. and increase our
nation’s reliance on electricity sources that are not as reliable as
coal.  … Forcing the retirement of America’s coal fleet and jeopardizing
our electricity supply makes no sense because the U.S. coal fleet is
responsible for just 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions while China
and India’s emissions account for nearly 40%. The U.S. must take
advantage of our coal assets, just as our global competitors are relying
on coal to fuel their own economic growth.”

[America First Policy Institute Energy and Environment Director Jason
Hayes](https://www.americafirstpolicy.com/issues/afpi-applauds-epa-decision-to-rescind-2009-endangerment-finding):
“This is a critical step toward restoring common sense in climate
policy. The rule had become a weapon for sweeping and burdensome
regulation, such as electric vehicle mandates, that was driven by a
radical environmental agenda. The United States has shown time and again
that we can achieve a cleaner environment, including clear skies and
waters, without aggressive climate catastrophist mandates. By using an
America First approach to fossil fuels, we can build a country that
balances the need for safety and environmental care with economic
growth. The Endangerment Finding was unlawful, unscientific, and
unnecessary to provide the clean and productive environment that
Americans desire and deserve.”

[American Energy Alliance President Tom
Pyle](https://www.americanenergyalliance.org/2026/02/historic-victory-president-trump-rescinds-2009-ghg-endangerment-finding/):
“Thank you, President Trump and Administrator Zeldin, for this historic
victory for American energy freedom, economic prosperity, and
commonsense policymaking that serves the interests of American workers,
families, and businesses. Since its inception, the Endangerment Finding
has been weaponized against projects and goods that deliver affordable,
reliable energy to the American people. It has affected investment and
infrastructure decisions in ways that have harmed U.S. competitiveness,
purely to advance a political ideology.”

[American Free Enterprise Chamber of Commerce CEO Gentry
Collins](https://amfreechamber.com/press-release/amfree-chamber-applauds-trump-administration-repeal-of-endangerment-finding/):
“This bold decision by the Trump Administration removes the foundation
for the failed experiment of mandating electric vehicles and restores
common-sense limits on Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) authority
to regulate greenhouse gases only where Congress clearly gave the agency
that task. The rule published dismantles burdensome electrification
mandates that have stifled innovation, raised costs for ordinary
Americans and businesses, and hollowed out our industrial base by making
us dependent on China. We applaud the Trump Administration for its
decisive leadership, and we intend to aggressively combat any ensuing
legal challenge to this historic rulemaking.”

[Americans for Prosperity Energy Policy Fellow Faith
Burns](https://americansforprosperity.org/press-release/americans-for-prosperity-supports-epas-major-deregulatory-action/):
“An agency must operate within the framework of its statutory authority.
With today’s action, EPA is doing just that. EPA decisions impact our
economy significantly. Today’s decision will have a positive impact not
only on energy production, but on our economy.”

[Americans for Tax Reform President Grover
Norquist](https://x.com/GroverNorquist/status/2022152954057314566):
“Thank you @POTUS and @epaleezeldin for delivering historic deregulation
by rescinding the Obama Endangerment Finding. This is how the Left
weaponized the EPA to kill new projects, strangle investment and
threaten whole industries. This is a major win for affordable energy.”

[Competitive Enterprise Institute Center for Energy & Environment
Director Daren
Bakst](https://cei.org/news_releases/trump-epa-revokes-endangerment-finding-big-win-for-the-american-people-cei-analysis/):
“Today, the EPA took a big step in ensuring that the agency sticks to
its statutory mission of environmental protection instead of being an
economic central planner reshaping the economy and dictating how
Americans live their lives. Greenhouse gas regulation is a tool that can
be used as the basis for some of the most egregious examples of
government abuse. We have already seen this with the Biden EPA’s efforts
to try and kill off gas-powered cars and reliable electricity
generation. Climate extremists will inevitably blast the EPA’s actions,
but most Americans realize government policies that drive up prices,
restrict freedom, and ignore the rule of law are devastating for the
well-being of our nation.”

[CO2 Coalition Executive Director Gregory
Wrightstone](https://co2coalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-10-Endangerment-Finding-Statement-2.pdf):
“The repeal of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Endangerment
Finding by Administrator Lee Zeldin is cause for celebration. The basis
of this wrongheaded climate regulation put ideology ahead of science.
The rule has been an impediment to economic growth, a cause of rising
energy costs and a destroyer of many thousands of jobs at power plants,
coal mines and manufacturing facilities. Since the 2009 enactment of the
Endangerment Finding, its scientific underpinnings have been found to be
even weaker than previously believed and contradicted by empirical data,
peer-reviewed studies and research.”

[Committee for a Constructive
Tomorrow](https://x.com/CFACT/status/2022019220859752506): “Thank you
@POTUS and @epaleezeldin for repealing the Endangerment Finding, a rule
that negatively impacted American lives and our economy. America is
freer and more prosperous thanks to you.”

[Energy Capital Economic Development Executive Director Rusty
Bell](https://cowboystatedaily.com/2026/02/12/wyoming-cheers-end-of-obama-era-epa-climate-change-rule/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBoth%20of%20these,affordable%20reliable%20electricity.%E2%80%9D):
“Both of these policies by President Trump are very good for Wyoming
coal and energy sustainability and reliability into the future for the
United States. Energy is the most important piece to America’s
prosperity and security. We should be looking to add all types of
generation to the grid, including significant addition of coal fired
generation for that affordable reliable electricity.”

[Ford Motor Company spokesman Dave
Tovar](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2026/02/12/trump-climate-regulation/88640954007/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20appreciate%20the,American%20job%20growth.%22):
“We appreciate the work of President Trump and Administrator Zeldin to
address the imbalance between current emissions standards and customer
choice. Ford has consistently advocated for a single, stable national
standard that aligns with customer choice, the market, societal benefit,
and American job growth.”

[Heritage Foundation Executive Vice President Derrick
Morgan](https://www.heritage.org/press/heritage-praises-trump-administration-rollback-endangerment-finding#:~:text=Derrick%20Morgan%2C%20executive%20vice%20president%20of%20Heritage%2C%C2%A0stated%3A%C2%A0):
“President Trump’s rescission of the Obama administration’s 2009
Endangerment Finding is on solid legal, economic, and scientific
grounds. The Clean Air Act simply does not give EPA the power of a
central planner for the economy, as Obama and Biden’s greenhouse gas
regulations envisioned. Catastrophic global warming claims relied on
models that systematically overstated the warming and extreme weather
events that have occurred since, while the impact of eliminating U.S.
vehicle GHGs is so vanishingly small that it wouldn’t even be
measurable. Combined with needed permitting reform, this action can pave
the way for the energy abundance and affordability that America’s
working families need and deserve while bringing to bear our plentiful
energy resources to compete with China.”

[Independent Women’s Center for Energy and Conservation Director
Gabriella
Hoffman](https://www.independentwomen.com/2026/02/12/trump-administration-to-repeal-endangerment-finding-and-advance-historic-deregulation/):
“It’s long overdue to repeal the 2009 endangerment finding that labels
carbon dioxide as a pollutant. The Obama EPA exceeded its authority
regulating CO2 as harmful to human health under the Clean Air Act. For
16 years, this regulation tethered our economy to unsustainable, costly
net-zero climate policies that failed to deliver lower emissions. The
shale boom and energy innovation—not heavy-handed government—are
responsible for lower emissions today.  Carbon dioxide is only 0.04% of
the atmosphere and is essential for plant life. Energy deregulation
won’t lead to decimation of the environment, either. This is a necessary
course correction, and returns power back to Congress. Independent
Women’s Center for Energy and Conservation applauds the Trump
administration for repealing this flawed rule and putting science—not
politics—first.”

[Life:Powered](https://x.com/Life_Powered_/status/2022034589901074770):
“The Endangerment Finding triggered regulations across mining,
manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and energy — imposing
billions in costs on American families and businesses. After years of
fighting this flawed rule, Life:Powered applauds the EPA’s decision.”

[Petroleum Alliance of Oklahoma President Brook A.
Simmons](https://www.thepetroleumalliance.com/simmons-epas-repeal-of-the-endangerment-finding-returns-agency-to-common-sense-policies/):
“The announcement that the EPA has repealed the endangerment finding
marks an important shift in federal policy, and I applaud the Trump
administration’s efforts to return the agency to the rule of law and
common-sense policies. Sound public policy must balance environmental
stewardship with economic opportunity while encouraging energy
abundance. Removing a regulatory foundation that has been weaponized to
increase costs for consumers, harm the oil and natural gas industry, and
undermine U.S. energy security is an important step toward regulatory
certainty and competitive energy markets. The future of energy in the
United States depends on innovation, not litigation, and on a regulatory
framework that ensures affordable, reliable energy for families and
businesses alike.”

[Specialty Equipment Market Association/Performance Racing Industry CEO
Mike
Spagnola](https://www.performanceracing.com/magazine/industry-news/02-12-2026/pri-sema-applaud-repeal-greenhouse-gas-endangerment-finding#:~:text=%22This%20is%20a,our%20nation%E2%80%99s%C2%A0prosperity.%22):
“This is a tremendous decision by the EPA to course-correct after nearly
two decades of abuses by previous administrations at the federal and
state levels, and instead return sanity to our nation’s environmental
policies. It was with great trepidation that SEMA/PRI watched our
nation’s leaders demonize and ban the very motor vehicles that serve as
the bedrock upon which the American people–families, small businesses,
and automotive enthusiasts–rely to live their best, most prosperous
lives. It was even more infuriating to watch these policymakers brazenly
justify their actions with a dubious policy position that now rightly
goes away, to be replaced with a common-sense, free-market view of what
drives our nation’s prosperity.”

[Stellantis](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2026/02/12/trump-climate-regulation/88640954007/#:~:text=%22Stellantis%20welcomes%20today%E2%80%99s,freedom%20of%20choice%2C%22):
“Stellantis welcomes today’s decision, because it enables us to continue
offering Americans a broad range of cars, trucks and SUVs — including
BEVs, REEVs, hybrids and efficient internal combustion engines — that
they want, need and can afford. We remain supportive of a rational,
achievable approach on fuel economy standards that preserves our
customers’ freedom of choice.”

[Taxpayers Protection Alliance President David
Williams](https://www.protectingtaxpayers.org/environmental-protection-agency/tpa-praises-white-house-for-epa-regulatory-rollback/):
“After 16 long years of overregulation and unconstitutional overreach,
President Trump is absolutely right to finally end the endangerment
finding. The determination had given bureaucrats a blank check to enact
heavy-handed regulations that impact everything from vehicle
manufacturing to oil and natural gas refining and processing. It shifted
enormous policymaking power from Congress to unelected officials.
Today’s decision restores accountability and signals that lawmakers, not
unelected bureaucrats, are in the driver’s seat… TPA applauds President
Trump for putting taxpayers and consumers ahead of reckless and
unaccountable bureaucrats. There is plenty more red tape to cut, and we
look forward to more free-market reforms from the White House.”

[The American Consumer Institute Senior Policy Analyst and Manager for
Energy Kristen
Walker](https://www.theamericanconsumer.org/2026/02/statement-regarding-the-trump-administrations-decision-to-rescind-the-2009-endangerment-finding/):
“I applaud the Trump administration’s decision to rescind the 2009
Endangerment Finding (EF) which has been used to justify heavy-handed
legislation and mandates for greenhouse gas regulation. The EF delegated
sweeping legislative power to the executive branch, enabling agencies to
reshape the energy and industrial sectors without direct congressional
authority… Rescinding the EF will lower costs, uphold statutory limits,
and usher in a more common sense and democratically accountable approach
to energy policy.”

[The Heartland Institute Arthur B. Robinson Center for Climate and
Environmental Policy Director H. Sterling
Burnett](https://coloradosun.com/2026/02/13/trump-endangerment-colorado-impact/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThis%20action%20is,plants%20as%20well.%E2%80%9D):
“This action is long overdue and good for the American people, freeing
up the auto industry to make the vehicles people want unburdened by
unnecessary emission restrictions or money-losing electric vehicle
mandates. Today is a win for car and truck buyers and Trump should be
applauded for taking this action. The endangerment finding was never
justified by either science or law. Now it’s time to strike another blow
for affordability, and strike while the iron is hot, to rescind
endangerment for power plants as well.”

[Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Studies Chief Economist and Acting
Director E.J.
Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/press/heritage-praises-trump-administration-rollback-endangerment-finding#:~:text=Dr.%20E.J.%20Antoni%2C%20chief%20economist%20and%20acting%20director%20of%20the%20Thomas%20A.%20Roe%C2%A0Institute%20for%20Economic%20Studies%C2%A0added%3A%C2%A0%C2%A0):
“Rescinding this failed bureaucratic overreach is tremendous news for
the American people and American business. The empirical evidence is
quite clear: this reduction in burdensome, inefficient regulation will
save consumers, workers, and employers well over $1 trillion. It’s
welcome news that, under the Trump administration, the American people
come first once again, not radical political ideology.”

[Indiana Attorney General Todd
Rokita](https://x.com/AGToddRokita/status/2022316649567732145):
“President @realDonaldTrump has officially rescinded a 2009
“endangerment finding” concocted to justify trillions of dollars in
burdensome regulations of carbon emissions under the Clean Air Act. This
is the single, largest deregulatory action in U.S. history, saving
taxpayers over $1.3 trillion and is a massive VICTORY!”

[West Virginia Attorney General J.B.
McCuskey](https://ago.wv.gov/article/attorney-general-mccuskey-praises-rollback-costly-epa-over-regulation):
“I am enormously excited for this announcement. The Trump administration
promised to deregulate, and repealing the unconstitutional Obama-era
‘endangerment finding’ is the single most impactful deregulatory action
in American history. This rule was the first salvo of a war against
working class Americans. It adopted a radical agenda based on
pseudoscience, and it raised the price of every single American product.
The endangerment finding’s impact can’t be overstated. It has cost
American families over a trillion dollars since its adoption in 2009.
So, EPA’s repeal efforts will save American families money and make
vehicles—and every good transported by them—more affordable. The Obama
administration designed this rule to force gas cars to go the way of the
8-track. But American consumers have spoken… Repealing the endangerment
finding is long overdue.”

[Senate Majority Whip John
Barrasso](https://x.com/SenJohnBarrasso/status/2022037552409039270):
“The endangerment finding was based on political expediency – not
scientific standards. The Biden and Obama administrations routinely
abused this finding as an excuse to roll out red tape that destroyed
jobs across America. I applaud the Trump administration for reversing
this harmful action and restoring commonsense at the @EPA.”

[Senate Republican Conference Chair Tom
Cotton](https://x.com/SenTomCotton/status/2022028867087872380?s=20):
“For far too long, Arkansans have paid the price of the disastrous Green
New Deal. That ended today. I’m thankful President Trump and
@epaleezeldin have cut unnecessary bureaucratic red tape which will
lower prices for all consumers.”

[Sen. Shelley Moore
Capito](https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2026/2/capito-applauds-trump-epa-s-repeal-of-greenhouse-gas-vehicle-standards):
“I applaud this groundbreaking effort from the Trump EPA to further roll
back costly regulations from the Obama and Biden administrations that
have placed economic hardship on hardworking Americans. This repeal will
have a transformational impact on my home state of West Virginia, as
these efforts reverse the harmful Democrat attacks on affordable,
gas-powered vehicles that West Virginians have endured for far too long.
This action represents a key win for affordability, job creation and
consumer choice, and I congratulate President Trump and Administrator
Zeldin for their continued success in producing visible results for the
American people.”

[Sen. John Cornyn](https://x.com/JohnCornyn/status/2022316662997856610):
“As the Trump EPA repeals Obama’s so-called endangerment finding,
progressives fear they won’t be able to dictate the energy supplies,
cars and appliances that Americans can buy.”

[Sen. Kevin
Cramer](https://x.com/SenKevinCramer/status/2022071237556781247): “The
endangerment finding is the definition of inventing authority out of
thin air to justify bureaucratic creep. It’s been used as a cudgel
against American manufacturers and producers when Congress never
included it in the Clean Air Act. I’m grateful to @epaleezeldin and
@POTUS for repealing this heavy-handed endangerment finding.”

[Sen. Cynthia
Lummis](https://x.com/SenLummis/status/2022023724858564789?s=20): “I’m
thrilled @POTUS & @epaleezeldin are rescinding the imbecilic Obama-era
rule used to expand federal overreach. It never received proper
congressional debate or approval, yet fueled a decades-long campaign
against our fossil fuel industry in the name of climate change.”

[Rep. Brian
Babin](https://science.house.gov/press-releases?id=C2495D60-D3EC-4C52-ABD2-427B14F8E061):
“Rescinding the 2009 Endangerment Finding is a long-overdue step toward
restoring the proper limits of federal regulatory authority. For years,
this finding has been used to justify sweeping greenhouse gas
regulations that have raised costs for American families, restricted
domestic energy production, and placed heavy burdens on manufacturers,
workers, and consumers. The Clean Air Act was never intended to serve as
a vehicle for such broad regulatory authority, and stretching the law
beyond its original purpose has created uncertainty and undermined
American competitiveness. I commend EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and the
Trump Administration for taking action to ensure environmental policy is
grounded in strong legal footing and realistic assessments. This
decision will help protect consumer choice, support a strong and
reliable energy sector, and reinforce the principle that major national
policy decisions should be made by Congress—not imposed through
regulatory overreach.”

[Rep. Jim
Baird](https://x.com/RepJimBaird/status/2022065255786958899?s=20):
“Today, @POTUS and @epaleezeldin announced the largest deregulatory
action in American history and rolled back the costly Obama-era
Endangerment Finding! Since 2009, the Endangerment Finding has cost
Americans over one trillion dollars and paved the way for burdensome
vehicle emission mandates. I was honored to join @epaleezeldin and
@SecretaryWright as they unveiled their proposal to rescind this rule in
July of last year. I’m grateful the Trump Administration is taking
action to stand up for our automakers and lower costs for Hoosier
families.”

[Rep. Kat
Cammack](https://x.com/RepKatCammack/status/2022041622775504940?s=20):
“‘GREEN NEW SCAM’ up in smoke. The climate crowd said killing Obama-era
emissions rules would wreck America. Instead? Cheaper cars. More energy.
Less bureaucratic chokehold. America builds again.”

[Rep. Ben Cline](https://x.com/RepBenCline/status/2022365692687695946):
“This Obama-era emissions rule drove up costs by thousands and piled on
outrageous regulations that ultimately hit consumers’ wallets.
@epaleezeldin and @POTUS are championing affordability by nixing this
ridiculous regulation, thereby driving down the prices of vehicles.”

[Rep. Michael
Cloud](https://x.com/RepMichaelCloud/status/2022059838985892124): “No
more pretending plant food is a public health crisis. No more
weaponizing EPA against American cars, trucks, jobs, and families.”

[Rep. Harriet
Hageman](https://x.com/RepHageman/status/2022084568560578843):
“Rescinding the 2009 Endangerment Finding is a necessary step to stop
regulatory overreach that targeted American energy, raised costs, and
threatened Wyoming jobs. This authority belongs with Congress and the
American people, not unelected bureaucrats.”

[Rep. Richard
Hudson](https://x.com/RepRichHudson/status/2022059570643054723): “Today,
President Trump and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin delivered the largest
deregulatory action in American history. The Obama-era Endangerment
Finding, which drove years of costly vehicle mandates, is gone. That
includes eliminating the ridiculous start-stop feature that shuts your
engine off at every red light. This action saves Americans $1.3
trillion, lowers vehicle costs by an average of $2,400, and restores
real consumer choice. We’re cutting red tape, lowering costs, and
putting families back in the driver’s seat.”

[Rep. Barry
Moore](https://x.com/RepBarryMoore/status/2022100312816050176):
“Washington bureaucrats shouldn’t dictate what you drive or how much you
pay for it. The Trump Administration is cutting red tape, scrapping
costly mandates, and putting Americans back in the driver’s seat –
saving families trillions and restoring common sense.”

[Rep. Riley
Moore](https://x.com/RepRileyMoore/status/2022080987010941203): “By
rolling back the Obama-era Endangerment Finding, the Trump
Administration has delivered the largest deregulatory action in U.S.
history—undoing the climate crisis hoax that drove up prices and cost
hard-working West Virginian coal miners their jobs. A massive win for
American families, American workers, and American energy dominance.
President Trump is putting the American Dream back within reach.”

[Rep. Pete
Stauber](https://x.com/RepPeteStauber/status/2022063898627911906?s=20):
“Today, @POTUS and @epaleezeldin announced the largest deregulatory
action in U.S. history: the repeal of the Obama-era Endangerment
Finding. This move will save American taxpayers over 1.3 TRILLION and
save American families over $2,400 for a new vehicle!”

[Rep. Tim
Walberg](https://x.com/RepWalberg/status/2022026052932186542?s=20): “I
applaud @POTUS and @epaleezeldin for repealing this burdensome Obama-era

must continue to remove costly regulations.”

[Rep. Daniel
Webster](https://x.com/RepWebster/status/2022022735451623460?s=20):
“Americans should be able to purchase vehicles that best for their
needs, not those of unelected Washington bureaucrats. Today, @POTUS and
@epaleezeldin are delivering historic deregulation that restores
consumer choice and lowers costs for Americans.”
