**Under President Donald J. Trump’s leadership, this Administration is
smashing through the chaos and destruction left by Democrats and
unleashing the most aggressive pursuit of the America First agenda in
history.** While the Fake News and Radical Left collude to distract,
depress, and divide, they’re simply lying to mask the undeniable truth:
America is safer, stronger, richer, and more secure than at any point in
decades.

**Don’t take the bait.** New victories pour in daily as President Trump
delivers on his promises and rebuilds the foundation for long-term
success in the greatest nation on Earth.

**Here are a few things to celebrate from just the past few days:**

### **Stock Market Explodes and Retirement Accounts Soar**

The Dow Jones Industrial Average just
[shattered](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2019855937863872713)
50,000 for the first time ever. With the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also
smashing
[records](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1981856726258270527),
Americans’ 401(k)s and retirement savings are booming under President
Trump’s pro-growth policies, proving that the economy is roaring back
stronger than ever.

### **ICE Hammers Criminal Illegals**

In just the past week, ICE
[arrested](https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/ice-arrests-650-illegal-aliens-west-virginia)
650 illegals in West Virginia — including a convicted child sex abuser,
drug pushers, burglars, and fraudsters. Nationwide, ICE continues
removing

and scores of other dangerous criminal illegals. In Minnesota, Operation
Metro Surge has already taken over [4,000 criminal
illegals](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2026/02/new-milestone-in-operation-metro-surge-4000-criminal-illegals-removed-from-minnesota-streets/)
off the streets — and it’s [not
stopping](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2020303294824890613).

### **Ending the Barbaric Mutilation of Kids**

Minnesota’s largest children’s hospital just
[halted](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2019443915703648642)
prescriptions of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones for minors,
joining a [growing
list](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/07/president-trump-promised-to-end-child-sexual-mutilation-and-he-delivered/)
of institutions finally backing down amid the Trump Administration’s
relentless pressure. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons [came out
in
opposition](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2026/02/03/plastic-surgeons-youth-gender-surgeries-guidance/)
to gender mutilation surgeries for children — becoming the first major
medical group to do so.

### **Court Victory Locks in Tough Immigration Enforcement**

A federal appeals court just
[upheld](https://apnews.com/article/fifth-circuit-immigrant-detainees-denied-bond-f5265ecf771d1f8e9f20d48bddfb1a25)
the Trump Administration’s policy of detaining illegal aliens —
validating the strong measures that have driven illegal crossings to
historic lows and sent a crystal-clear message: Under President Trump,
if you enter illegally, you will be detained and removed.

### **Crime Drops to New Record Lows**

After record high crime across the country under Biden’s defund the
police era, the murder rate has plunged to a [125-year
low](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/22/murder-rate-century-low) as crime
[falls](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2026/01/icymi-murder-rate-plunges-to-125-year-low-as-president-trump-restores-law-and-order/#:~:text=This%20monumental%20turnaround,%C2%A0deaths.)
across the board, according to new data. After the Trump Administration
surged federal resources into crime-plagued Washington, D.C., the
District went [three weeks into the new
year](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2026/02/01/crime-dc-homicides-january/)
before recording its first homicide — the first time the nation’s
capital had gone more than ten days into a new year without a murder in
at least three decades.

### **Everyday Costs Continue Moderating**

National median rents have
[fallen](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/29/apartment-rents-just-dropped-to-the-lowest-level-in-4-years.html)
to a four-year low following
[six](https://www.apartmentlist.com/research/national-rent-data)
consecutive monthly declines, while mortgage affordability has
[surged](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/mortgage-rates-refinance-2026/)
to a four-year high following President Trump’s bold action to make
homeownership affordable again. PepsiCo
[announced](https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/pepsico-to-cut-prices-for-doritos-and-other-snacks-96a7f353?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqfFC3xu5vkek69qt9Ns3GIdfzSJMG2RSsPPLD3dsUf0oH4ep6rZaU-s&gaa_ts=6984a9ae&gaa_sig=00pvwFk3mqgmn0-YW_d5Oxvmaoyj5nQiKwsofhx7QA32AJKdjImOdFKiJBY-gpaiJG2J-1WnrMRSldwgxqL3Hw%3D%3D)
price cuts of up to 15% on core brands. And President Trump
[launched](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2026/02/president-trump-launches-trumprx-gov-delivering-massive-immediate-savings-to-millions-of-americans/)
TrumpRx.gov, a transformative new government platform that gives
Americans direct access to dramatically lower prices on common,
high-cost prescription drugs. There’s a reason consumer sentiment has
[spiked](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-06/us-consumer-sentiment-unexpectedly-rises-to-a-six-month-high)
to a six-month high.

### **Border Remains Sealed Up**

For an unprecedented ninth straight month, there were ZERO illegal
border crossings at the southern border — an achievement
[unparalleled](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/historic-9th-straight-month-zero-releases-border)
in modern history.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

These wins aren’t happening by accident — they come after President
Trump lodged the [most productive first
year](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2026/01/365-wins-in-365-days-president-trumps-return-marks-new-era-of-success-prosperity/)
of a presidential term in modern history — and aren’t happening by
accident. President Trump promised to Make America Great Again, and he’s
delivering bigger, faster, and harder than ever before.

**The momentum is unstoppable.** Don’t be a Panican; America is winning
again — and more victories are coming.
