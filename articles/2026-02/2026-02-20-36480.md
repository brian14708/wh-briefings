  Drug Trafficking on Social Media Platforms

*ONDCP Leads Collaboration Between Representatives from the Social Media
Industry, DOS, HHS, DEA, HUD, HSI, USPIS and ATF.*

On Wednesday, February 18th, Drug Czar Sara Carter brought together
Trump Administration officials and representatives from social media
companies, including Meta, TikTok, X, YouTube, and Internet Works, for a
roundtable focused on ending the sale of illicit drugs via social media
platforms. In a rapidly evolving digital age, drug dealers and
traffickers abuse platforms that are meant to foster connection—even to
the point of targeting children. The roundtable participants provided
their perspectives on best practices for keeping children safe from drug
traffickers who seek to exploit them online.

“Throughout my career, I have spoken to countless families who lost a
child or loved one to drugs purchased through social media,” said
Director Carter. “In many of these cases, the victim thought they were
purchasing a safe pill, which actually contained a lethal dose of
illicit fentanyl.In order to prevent this senseless loss of life, ONDCP
will need full-scale cooperation from social media companies, law
enforcement, and the whole-of-government. Most importantly, we as
parents need to educate our children about the dangers of drugs and
monitor their social media use to protect them from those who seek to do
irreparable harm.”

The participants committed to enhance coordination between law
enforcement and social media companies in the digital drug trafficking
space to prevent illicit drug activity and the abuse of social media
platforms.
