title: Ninth Meeting of the North American Drug Dialogue
---
 
On January 27 and 28, 2026, the Government of Canada hosted the
Governments of Mexico and the United States in Ottawa for the Ninth
Meeting of the North American Drug Dialogue (NADD). The annual NADD
meeting brings together the three countries’ counternarcotics policy
makers, law enforcement leaders, and public health experts to
collaborate on strategies to counter the grave threat posed by the
manufacturing, trading, and misuse of fentanyl and other illicit drugs.

Amid a rapidly evolving illegal drug and counternarcotics
landscape—including President Trump’s designations of cartels as Foreign
Terrorist Organizations and fentanyl as a weapon of mass
destruction—participants discussed emerging threats, current drug
trafficking and substance use trends, and coordinated approaches to
counter illegal drug trafficking in North America. Participants reviewed
progress on the previous year’s five priority areas: drug trafficking
modes and methods; current and emerging synthetic drugs; drug demand and
public health efforts to counter this demand; illicit financial flows
related to illegal drug trafficking; and firearms trafficking as an
enabler of drug trafficking. The significant progress on these fronts is
contributing to a safer, healthier North America.

Building on last year’s progress, the three countries reaffirmed their
steadfast commitment to reduce the harm to public safety caused by the
use and trafficking of illegal drugs in North America. To advance this
goal, the countries agreed to coordinate efforts over the next three
years under three strategic priorities: (1) securing the global supply
chain and related institutions against drug trafficking; (2)
strengthening effective drug policy implementation and law enforcement;
and (3) reducing overdose deaths, mitigating harm and increasing
long-term recovery. Participants will advance these priorities by
enhancing border and postal security; stopping firearms trafficking
networks that support the drug trade; closing financial systems to
criminal networks; and deploying wastewater testing and early drug
warning capabilities.

Canada, Mexico, and the United States discussed the historic commitment
President Trump secured from China in relation to the control of
precursor chemical exports to North America.  The three countries agreed
to utilize the NADD to track improvements in closing gaps in the global
supply chain.

The NADD was established in July 2016. By fostering transparency and the
sharing of concrete implementation strategies, best practices, and data,
Canada, Mexico, and the United States aim to improve understandings of
the challenges to North America posed by the illicit drug trade and
substance use and promote coordinated, enduring solutions.
