title: 'President Trump Is Securing Our Homeland: Ending the Invasion, Deporting Criminals,
  and Protecting Our Communities'
---
 
President Donald J. Trump’s relentless commitment to securing our
homeland has delivered a seismic turnaround that stopped the flood of
illegal crossings, deadly cartels, and national security threats dead in
their tracks — and the work remains ongoing.

-   **Historic Reductions in Illegal Immigration:** Illegal border
    crossings have plummeted to their lowest level since the
    [1970s](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/illegal-crossings-immigration-us-mexico-southern-border-lowest-level-1970-trump-dhs/),
    with migrant encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border dropping
    dramatically in 2025. The U.S. achieved [negative net
    migration](https://abcnews.go.com/US/us-1st-time-50-years-experienced-negative-net/story?id=129175522)
    in 2025 — the first time in over 50 years — reversing decades of
    unchecked migration and restoring control over our sovereignty.
-   **Mass Removals and Deterrence:** Nearly [three
    million](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2026/01/20/dhs-sets-stage-another-historic-record-breaking-year-under-president-trump)
    illegal aliens have left the U.S., including over 675,000
    deportations — [more than
    400,000](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2009630131053105350?s=20)
    of whom were illegal aliens charged with or convicted of crimes —
    and 2.2 million self-deportations.
-   **Zero Releases and Strong Deterrence:** No illegal aliens have been
    released into the interior for [nine straight
    months](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2026/02/04/historic-9th-straight-month-zero-releases-border#:~:text=Nine%20straight%20months%20of%20zero,unmatched%20in%20modern%20border%20history.)
    — finally ending catch-and-release policies nationwide and achieving
    a [99.9%
    reduction](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/apr/21/trump-border-catch-release-dropped-9999-worst-biden-month/)
    in interior releases compared to the prior Administration.
-   **Crushing Fentanyl and Cartel Threats:** In 2025, fentanyl
    trafficking at the southern border was [cut by
    56%](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/09/30/cbp-reports-drug-seizures-surge-again-august)

    individuals](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-blocks-10k-narcoterrorists-terror-watchlist-swells-85k-2025)
