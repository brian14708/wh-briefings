title: U.S. Promotes AI Adoption, Sovereignty, and Exports at India AI Impact Summit
---
 
**WASHINGTON –** Today at the [India AI Impact Summit
2026](https://impact.indiaai.gov.in/), the United States laid out its
bold vision for empowering global allies with cutting-edge and sovereign
AI technologies. 

Assistant to the President and Director of the White House Office of
Science and Technology Policy Michael Kratsios led the U.S. delegation
to the Summit, joined by Under Secretary of State Jacob Helberg, Under
Secretary of Commerce William Kimmitt, and Ambassador Sergio Gor,
alongside global heads of state, foreign ministers, and business
leaders.

Director Kratsios gave
[remarks ](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2026/02/remarks-by-director-michael-kratsios-at-the-india-ai-impact-summit/)on
America’s AI leadership and international AI adoption, the rejection
of global governance for the pursuit of real AI sovereignty, and
the opportunity of nations to join the U.S. as partners to build the AI
future for their peoples with components of the American AI stack.

**“Real AI sovereignty means owning and using best-in-class technology
for the benefit of your people, and charting your national destiny in
the midst of global transformations.”** Director Kratsios said. He urged
nations to focus on strategic autonomy alongside rapid
AI adoption rather than aiming for full self-sufficiency. 

**“We believe that independent partners are critical to unlocking the
prosperity AI adoption can open to all of us. That is why the President
launched the American AI Exports Program.”** Working with the American
AI stack means nations can build on top of the best technologies in the
world and keep sensitive data within their borders.

He also called for firmly rejecting attempts at global governance of
AI.**“We believe AI adoption cannot lead to a brighter future if it is
subject to bureaucracies and centralized control.”**

The Director spoke in his remarks to the growing chasm on AI adoption
between developed and developing economies. **“The pace of adoption and
sophistication of deployment continues to stratify. Developing countries
are falling behind developed economies at a fundamental inflection
point,”** he said. He urged developing countries to prioritize the
adoption of AI technologies especially across health care, education,
energy infrastructure, agriculture, and citizen-facing government
services to deliver concrete benefits for their respective peoples.

Finally, Director Kratsios unveiled new U.S. initiatives to accelerate
global adoption of the American AI stack through the American AI Exports
Program, including:

-   **The American AI Exports Program’s National Champions Initiative:**
    The Commerce Department will incorporate partner nations’ leading AI
    companies into their customized [American AI
    Export](https://aiexports.gov/) stacks, demonstrating that American
    technology directly strengthens and builds domestic AI capabilities.
-   **The U.S.** **Tech Corps**: A new initiative of the Peace Corps,
    the [U.S. Tech
    Corps](https://www.peacecorps.gov/ways-to-serve/tech-corps/) will
    provide volunteer technical talent with import partners to provide
    last-mile support in deploying powerful AI applications for enhanced
    public services.
-   **New International Financing:** The Treasury Department is
    launching a new fund at the World Bank to help countries overcome AI
    adoption barriers, in addition to new financing programs launched at
    the Export-Import Bank, the U.S. International Development Finance
    Corporation, the State Department, and the Small Business
    Administration.
-   **NIST/CAISI’s AI Agent Standards Initiative:** The Commerce
    Department’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
    [announced](https://www.nist.gov/caisi/ai-agent-standards-initiative)
    it will facilitate the development of interoperable and secure
    standards for agentic AI, giving the public confidence in this
    next-generation technology.

As the Trump Administration unveils a whole-of-government strategy to
promote American AI exports, it brings to the India AI Impact Summit a
clear message: American AI is the gold standard, and we are sharing it
with our partners to secure our shared future.
