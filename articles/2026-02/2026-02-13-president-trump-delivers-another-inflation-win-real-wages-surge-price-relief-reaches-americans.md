> real wages grew by $1,400 in President Trump’s first year in office.
> Housing inflation notably continues to cool, while prescription drug
> prices actually fell in 2025 — with even more price relief ahead for
> American patients thanks to President Trump’s Most Favored Nation drug
> pricing deals and the Great Healthcare Plan. With inflation now low
> and stable, America’s economy is set to turbocharge even further
> through long-overdue interest rate cuts from the Fed.”*
