**Tonight, President Donald J. Trump delivered a historic State of the
Union address before a joint session of Congress — proudly declaring the
dawn of a new Golden Age after just one year of transformative
leadership in his second term.** In a powerful speech, President Trump
highlighted unprecedented accomplishments: a fully secure border,
plummeting inflation, falling gas prices and crime rates, surging stock
markets and 401(k)s, massive tax relief for working Americans, and bold
actions to restore peace through strength abroad.

**This was a speech of renewal and resolve — yet congressional
Democrats, consumed by delusional hatred and obstruction, refused to
join in celebrating these victories for the American people.**

**Tonight, Democrats refused to applaud:**

-   Reaffirming “the first duty of the American government is to protect
    American citizens, not illegal aliens.”
-   The grieving families of innocent American women and children
    murdered by criminal illegal aliens — including the mother of Iryna
    Zarutska, a North Carolina woman savagely killed on public transit
    by an illegal alien monster.
-   Securing our homeland and finally ending the invasion of savage
    criminal illegal aliens — killers, rapists, gang members, and
    traffickers — with the strongest, most secure border in American
    history.
-   Prioritizing American citizens over illegal aliens.
-   Unifying against political violence.
-   Inflation finally subsiding after years of Democrat-driven price
    shocks that crushed working families.
-   Keeping violent criminals locked up.
-   Lower prescription drug prices for millions of Americans.
-   The decisive military action that brought indicted narcoterrorist
    Nicolás Maduro to justice, crippling drug cartels and liberating our
    hemisphere from vicious narcotrafficking terrorists.
-   Protecting minor children from the horrors of irreversible sex
    changes.
-   Gas prices dropping to multi-year lows, putting money back in
    Americans’ pockets.
-   Law enforcement officers being respected once again after years of
    vilification.
-   The financial futures of millions of American newborns through Trump
    Accounts.
-   Protecting the integrity of our elections by preventing illegal
    aliens from undermining our democracy.
-   Banning large corporations from scooping up single-family homes,
    ensuring they remain available for working Americans.
-   Ending widespread fraud schemes — like the $19 billion Somali fraud
    scandal that burdened Minnesota taxpayers.
-   Warrior Dividends for our great military heroes.
-   Reducing the flow of deadly fentanyl across our border by a record
    56% in one year.
-   The single largest drop in the murder rate in 125 years, making our
    streets safer.
-   Explosive growth in retirement accounts and 401(k)s for millions of
    hardworking Americans.
-   Landmark tax relief through the Working Families Tax Cuts Act: No
    Tax on Tips, No Tax on Overtime, No Tax on Social Security, and more
    historic savings.
-   A World War II hero who helped liberate the largest internment camp
    in the Philippines.
-   Ending eight wars and delivering peace through unmatched American
    strength.
-   America’s military might restoring respect and fear among our
    adversaries.
-   Massive economic growth.
-   Total victory over terrorists abroad.

**President Trump has proven what is possible when America puts its own
citizens first.**
