title: 'President Trump Returns to Georgia: Delivering Real Relief for Families, With
  Much More on the Way'
---
 
**As President Donald J. Trump visits Georgia today, he returns to a
state that is seeing real recovery, safer communities, and renewed
strength under his leadership — as more work remains to fully reverse
the economic damage of the Biden era.** These are meaningful victories
for Georgia families and workers, yet President Trump is resolute: He
will not rest until every Georgian enjoys lower prices, higher wages,
secure communities, and prosperity that reaches every corner of the
state.

### **Lower energy costs are putting money back in Georgians’ pockets.**

-   Georgia’s average gas price stands at [$2.71 per
    gallon](https://gasprices.aaa.com/?state=GA) — down 40% from its
    [all-time
    record](https://www.11alive.com/article/traffic/gas-prices/gas-prices-georgia/85-0b0966e4-05f6-42b1-ab2c-8939168d90a3)
    [Biden-era high](https://gasprices.aaa.com/?state=GA) and even
    greater savings on the horizon.

### **Tax relief is boosting take-home pay for working families.**

-   Thanks to President Trump’s and Republicans’ Working Families Tax
    Cuts Act, the average Georgia family is [saving
    $3,086](https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/federal/obbba-average-tax-cuts-impact-map/#:~:text=%24%2D4%2C051-,Georgia,-%2D%243%2C086) on
    their taxes this year.
-   Georgians stand to see wages rise by [up to
    $6,700](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Georgia-WH-OBBB-Savings-by-State.pdf) per
    person over the next several years.
-   Tax reforms will protect [204,000 Georgia

    rural health care thanks to Republicans — strengthening communities
    across the state.

### **The Trump Administration’s ICE has taken **[**scores of criminal illegal aliens**](https://www.dhs.gov/wow?combine=&field_country_of_origin_target_id=All&field_state_value=Georgia) **— including killers, rapists, and drug dealers — off Georgia’s streets.**

communities, and renewed economic energy mean Georgia families are
winning again under President Trump — and the best is yet to come.**
Republican leadership is building a brighter, more prosperous future for
all Georgians — and today’s visit underscores President Trump’s
unrelenting commitment to finishing the job.
