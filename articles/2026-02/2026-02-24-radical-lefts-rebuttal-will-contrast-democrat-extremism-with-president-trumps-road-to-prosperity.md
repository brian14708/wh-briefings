title: "Radical Left\u2019s Rebuttal Will Contrast Democrat Extremism with President\
  \ Trump\u2019s Road to Prosperity"
---
 
**Abigail Spanberger will deliver the Democrat response to President
Donald J. Trump’s State of the Union tonight.** Spanberger, like the
rest of the Radical Left lunatics in her party, is fully against
President Trump’s agenda of lowering costs, bringing back manufacturing,
and securing our borders — instead favoring a return to the Biden-era
carnage she was
“[proud](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=3924516401136115)” to
support.

Spanberger has a long history of supporting open borders, soft-on-crime
policies, reckless spending, tax hikes, radical climate mandates,
extreme gender ideology, and woke DEI initiatives — positions that
endanger American families and underscore the catastrophe Democrats will
once again unleash if given the chance.

### **Spanberger prioritizes criminal illegal aliens over Americans:**

-   Weeks after becoming Governor, she swiftly
    [terminated](https://virginiamercury.com/2026/02/04/spanberger-ends-ice-agreement-involving-virginia-state-police-and-corrections-officers/)
    Virginia’s agreement with ICE, halting state law enforcement
    cooperation with federal immigration enforcement — giving criminal
    illegal alien killers, rapists, and gangbangers a pass.
-   During her time in Congress, she repeatedly undermined border
    security by [voting against](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2023209)
    the Secure the Border Act,
    [supporting](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202191) a [pathway to
    citizenship](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/daca-immigration-reform-farmworkers-citizenship-house-passes-bills/)
    for more than two million illegal aliens,
    [co-sponsoring](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1603/cosponsors)
    an amnesty bill for millions of illegals, and
    [twice](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/201994)
    [voting](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2019127) to terminate
    President Trump’s national emergency declaration at the southern
    border.

### **Spanberger undermines law enforcement at every turn:**

-   She [refused](https://clerk.house.gov/evs/2023/roll119.xml) to
    condemn an extreme D.C. crime bill that reduced penalties for
    violent criminals and put millions of citizens and visitors to the
    nation’s capital at risk.
-   She has consistently supported defunding the police efforts,
    [accepting](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/?data_type=processed&committee_id=C00649913&contributor_name=Planned+Parenthood&contributor_name=courage+to+change&contributor_name=sierra+club)
    tens of thousands in campaign contributions from groups advocating
    defunding and
    [marching](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/04/22/vulnerable-virginia-democrat-abigail-spanberger-tries-to-erase-her-anti-law-enforcement-record/)
    with a group that claimed “law enforcement doesn’t protect or save
    our lives.”

### **Spanberger’s support for reckless spending fueled record inflation and higher costs for families:**

-   She enthusiastically
    [supported](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202172) Biden’s
    multi-trillion-dollar tax-and-spending spree — ignoring
    [warnings](https://oversight.house.gov/release/hearing-wrap-up-biden-admin-ignored-warnings-that-trillions-in-spending-would-damage-the-economy-and-spur-inflation%EF%BF%BC/#:~:text=Despite%20warnings%20from,half%20a%20century.)
    about skyrocketing inflation.
-   She opposed President Trump’s landmark 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,
    which [cut
    taxes](https://www.cato.org/blog/frequently-asked-questions-about-tax-cuts-jobs-act)
    for 80% of taxpayers — [calling](https://archive.ph/o6Wqu) it
    “irresponsible” — and
    [also](https://abigailspanberger.com/fox-5-big-beautiful-bill-leaders-react-to-passage-of-trumps-controversial-legislation/)
    [opposed](https://virginiamercury.com/2025/09/15/big-beautiful-bill-fallout-at-forum-spanberger-and-earle-sears-clash-over-medicaid/)
    the [Working Families Tax
    Cut](https://www.whitehouse.gov/priorities/economic-growth/), which
    delivered unprecedented tax relief to nearly every American.
-   Her party proposed [over 50 new
    taxes](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/virginia-democrats-seek-dozens-new-tax-hikes-dog-walking-dry-cleaning)
    on Virginians just weeks after taking office.

### **Spanberger embraces Radical Left climate extremism that drives up energy costs:**

-   In January 2026, she proudly
    [announced](https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/22/spanberger-democratic-lawmakers-are-pressing-for-virginia-to-rejoin-rggi-heres-how-it-would-work/)
    Virginia’s rejoining of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative,
    imposing costly regulations on energy producers that raise
    electricity bills for families and businesses.
-   She
    [cheered](https://www.facebook.com/RepSpanberger/posts/the-climate-crisis-poses-a-serious-national-security-threat-exacerbates-conflict/872700683480007/)
    Biden’s reentry into the Paris Climate Agreement, a scam
    [projected](https://www.heritage.org/environment/report/consequences-paris-protocol-devastating-economic-costs-essentially-zero#:~:text=Heritage%20economists%20estimate,author%20Nick%20Loris.)
    to cost American families over $20,000 in lost income, eliminate
    hundreds of thousands of jobs, and inflict trillions in economic
    damage.

### **Spanberger pushes extreme gender ideology that undermines fairness and safety:**

-   She [voted](https://www.congress.gov/votes/house/118-1/192) against
    passage of the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act, which
    would
    [bar](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/734)
    biological males from competing in women’s and girls’ sports.
-   She [voted](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2019217)
    [twice](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202139) to
    [allow](https://transequality.org/news/equality-act-what-transgender-people-need-know)
    men in women’s bathrooms, locker rooms, and changing rooms.
-   She
    [advocated](https://equality.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/equality.house.gov/files/Letter%20Opposing%20Anti-LGBTQI+%20Appropriations%20Riders-compressed.pdf)
    against commonsense restrictions on radical gender-affirming care
    for minors, prioritizing ideology over parental rights and child
    welfare.

### **Spanberger advances woke DEI and divisive ideologies:**

-   Her cabinet
    [includes](https://www.governor.virginia.gov/cabinet/name-1081472-en.html/)
    a “Chief Diversity Officer” who
    [thinks](https://youtu.be/mzrQ2G5_sC0?t=648) the U.S. Constitution
    should be dismantled and
    [claimed](https://www.facebook.com/reel/1491737374768802) DEI is a
    “constitutional mandate.”
-   She has
    [ties](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/?data_type=processed&committee_id=C00649913&contributor_name=C00003251)
    to extremist organizations
    [pushing](https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/teachers-unions-vow-to-defend-members-in-critical-race-theory-fight/2021/07)
    so-called “Critical Race Theory.”

### **Spanberger backs a Democrat takeover of federal elections:**

-   She
    [cosponsored](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1/cosponsors)
    and [voted for](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202162) a bill to take
    away control of elections from state governments — [making
    it](https://www.heritage.org/election-integrity/heritage-explains-if-hr-1-passes)
    “easier to cheat and easier to manipulate election results.”

Tonight, while President Trump highlights the successes of his America
First agenda in slashing costs, revitalizing manufacturing, securing our
borders, and delivering real relief — Spanberger’s response will only
underscore her party’s commitment to the failed lunacy Americans
rejected.

Americans deserve better than the Radical Left’s vision of higher taxes,
weaker borders, and divisive ideology. While Spanberger and Democrats
stand firmly in opposition to prosperity, President Trump is delivering
real results for all Americans.
