### **Prices and inflation are way down.**

**President Trump’s decisive economic policies are delivering real
relief to American families by slashing inflation, restoring
affordability, and increasing take-home pay — paving the way for a
Golden Era of prosperity.**

-   Core inflation — the best measure of inflation — has dropped to
    its [lowest
    level](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CUUR0000SA0L1E?output_view=pct_12mths) in
    nearly five years, underscoring the sustained progress made in the
    Trump Economy.
-   In President Trump’s first year back in office, real earnings for
    private-sector workers have significantly outpaced inflation,
    putting nearly $1,400 more in workers’ pockets and beginning to
    reverse the nearly $3,000 they lost under Biden.

**President Trump is also fulfilling his promise to lower costs for
hardworking Americans. Key prices dropped in January and over the past
year:**

-   The prices of staple food items like beef, eggs, and coffee are
    declining, reflecting the success of President Trump’s pro-growth,
    anti-inflation agenda and targeted efforts to tackle high costs in
    essential areas.
-   Energy prices fell last month, while gasoline prices reaching some
    of the lowest levels in years.
-   Prescription drug prices are down over the past year — with even
    greater savings on the horizon from President Trump’s landmark [drug
    pricing reforms](https://trumprx.gov/) and the [Great Healthcare
    Plan](https://greathealthcare.gov/).

### **The stock market and 401(k)s are way up.**

**The stock market has rebounded strongly under President Trump’s
leadership — with each of the major stock market indices hitting record
high after record high, creating trillions in new wealth for American
families.**

-   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq have all
    shattered multiple all-time highs, with the S&P surging nearly 40%
    from its early-year low and the Dow surpassing 50,000 for the first
    time ever.
-   401(k) balances for millions of workers have grown substantially,
    delivering the largest gains in history and securing brighter
    retirements for hardworking Americans.

### **Our military is strong and powerful.**

**President Trump has rebuilt and strengthened the U.S. military,
ensuring it remains the most powerful and respected fighting force in
the world — ready to deter threats and protect American interests.**

-   Defense spending has hit record levels, fueling modernization, a
    revitalized industrial base, and the strongest force in American
    history — with recruitment surging to record highs.
-   Renewed leadership and emphasis on strengthening the American
    warfighter has allowed the Trump Administration to conduct
    remarkable military actions, including destroying Iran’s nuclear
    weapons capability and the capture of narcoterrorist Nicolas Maduro
    in Venezuela.

### **Our law enforcement is great.**

**Our brave law enforcement officers are backed like never before — with
resources, respect, and tools to keep our communities safe.**

-   President Trump’s pro-law enforcement agenda has empowered police to
    pursue criminals without fear, driving down crime across the nation.
-   Federal partnerships with state and local forces have driven crime
    rates in Democrat-run cities to historic lows.

### **Our border is 100% secure.**

**Thanks to President Trump’s bold actions — including declaring a
national emergency, deploying military support, ending
catch-and-release, and aggressive enforcement—the southern border is
more secure than at any time in modern history.**

-   U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions have plunged to historic lows, with
    January seeing apprehensions along the Southwest border plummet to
    93% below historical averages, and zero releases into the interior
    for nine straight months.
-   Nationwide encounters remain at record lows, marking the most secure
    border in U.S. history.

### **Murders and crime are at record lows.**

**After years of chaos, skyrocketing crime, and soft-on-crime policies
under Radical Left policies plunged the nation’s biggest cities into
anarchy and disorder, President Trump took office on a promise to
restore public safety — and he has delivered.**

-   New data
    [shows](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2026/02/icymi-violent-crime-plummets-across-major-u-s-cities/)
    steep declines across every major violent crime category in 2025
    compared to the prior year: overall murders down 19%, robberies down
    20%, and aggravated assaults down nearly 10%.
-   The murder rate in the nation’s biggest cities
    has [fallen](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/22/murder-rate-century-low) to
    its lowest level in at least 125 years — marking the largest
    single-year drop in recorded history. Beyond murders, the nation
    also saw [dramatic
