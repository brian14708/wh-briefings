title: President Trump Is Delivering for Texans
---
 
**As President Donald J. Trump travels to Corpus Christi, Texas, today,
he returns to a state that is thriving under Republican leadership —
powered by American energy dominance, bold tax relief, secure borders,
and massive private sector investments.** Under President Trump, Texas
families are seeing real results in lower costs, higher wages, safer
streets, and more jobs — with much more to come as the Trump
Administration works tirelessly to repair the damage of the Biden era.

### **Lower energy costs are putting money back in Texans’ pockets.**

-   Texas’s average price for regular gasoline stands at [$2.60 per
    gallon](https://gasprices.aaa.com/?state=TX) — down more than $2 per
    gallon (44%) from its [all-time
    record](https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/local/texas-gas-prices-hits-all-time-high-overnight/287-a424e12f-e687-4890-be11-2629817cec32)[Biden-era
    high](https://gasprices.aaa.com/?state=TX#:~:text=HIGHEST%20RECORDED%20AVERAGE%20PRICE)
    — ranking among the nation’s [top ten
    states](https://www.gasbuddy.com/usa) for affordable fuel.
    -   Gas can even be found for [less than $2 per
        gallon](https://www.gasbuddy.com/gasprices/texas) at several
        stations across the state.

    <!-- -->

    -   Diesel prices have also dropped significantly, down 38% from the
        Biden-era [record high](https://gasprices.aaa.com/?state=TX).

### **Tax relief is boosting take-home pay for Texas families.**

-   Thanks to President Trump’s and Republicans’ Working Families Tax
    Cuts Act, the average Texas family is [saving
    $4,009](https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/federal/obbba-average-tax-cuts-impact-map/) on
    their taxes this year.
-   Texans stand to see wages rise by [up
    to $6,900](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Texas-WH-OBBB-Savings-by-State.pdf) per
    person over the next several years.
-   Tax reforms will protect [580,000 Texas
    jobs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Texas-WH-OBBB-Savings-by-State.pdf) in
    the coming years.
-   Texas is receiving an investment of [more than $281
    million](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/12/all-50-states-will-receive-historic-funding-from-trump-administration-to-strengthen-rural-health-care/#:~:text=%24-,281%2C319%2C361,-Utah) in
    rural health care thanks to Republicans — strengthening communities
    across the state.

    areas with the largest number of illegal aliens — all of which have
    seen homes become [more
    affordable](https://www.realtor.com/research/january-2026-data/) amid
    President Trump’s mass deportation agenda.
    -   In the Dallas-Fort Worth area, the median home listing price is
