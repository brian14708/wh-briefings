**“Violent crime dropped sharply across America’s biggest cities in
2025,” Axios**
[**reports**](https://www.axios.com/2026/02/11/violent-crime-homicides-falls-major-cities-trump)
**— yet another resounding validation of President Donald J. Trump’s
unwavering commitment to restoring law and order.** After years of
chaos, skyrocketing crime, and soft-on-crime policies under Biden
plunged the nation’s biggest cities into anarchy and disorder, President
Trump took office on a promise to restore public safety — and he has
delivered in historic fashion.

The new data confirms steep declines across every major violent crime
category in 2025 compared to the prior year: overall murders down 19%,
robberies down 20%, and aggravated assaults down nearly 10%.

**These gains build on** [**earlier

**showing America’s cities are now safer than they’ve been in over a
century under President Trump’s leadership.** The murder rate in the
nation’s biggest cities has
[fallen](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/22/murder-rate-century-low) to
its lowest level in at least 125 years — marking the largest single-year
drop in recorded history. Beyond murders, the nation also saw [dramatic
reductions](https://majorcitieschiefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MCCA-Violent-Crime-Report-2025-and-2024-January-to-September.pdf)
in rapes, robberies, aggravated assaults, shooting deaths
([fewest](https://www.thetrace.org/2025/12/data-shooting-stats-gun-violence-america/) since

**This is the direct result of President Trump’s aggressive, no-nonsense
approach to public safety.** By surging federal resources to
Democrat-run cities that had devolved into war zones, removing savage
criminal illegals from our streets, supporting police and prosecutors,
and rejecting the Radical Left’s weakness, President Trump’s decisive
actions have turned the tide, saved countless lives, and restored peace
to communities long abandoned by Democrat politicians who prioritized
criminals over citizens.

**Under President Trump, America is safer, stronger, and winning again —
and the era of Democrat-inspired lawlessness is over.**
