title: 'This Is the Trump Economy: Job Growth Crushes Expectations as More Americans
  Work for Higher Wages'
---
 
> “Today’s blockbuster, expectation-shattering jobs report proves that
> President Trump’s economic agenda continues to pay off. The
> unemployment rate fell and private sector job growth remains robust —
> particularly for specialty trade construction jobs as the trillions in
> investments secured by the President pour into American manufacturing.
> With new revisions showing that the Biden jobs market was even worse
> than expected, President Trump continues to turn the page on the Biden
> disaster by rightsizing federal employment to the lowest level since
> 1966 and turbocharging economic growth.”  
> — White House Deputy Press Secretary Kush Desai

## **Job growth surged in January — and the strength is in the private sector.**

-   The economy added 172,000 new private sector jobs and shed 42,000
    government jobs — bringing the unemployment rate down to 4.3%.
    -   As President Trump’s agenda takes effect, factory
        groundbreakings and data centers are leading to more
        construction jobs — with construction employment up 33,000 in
        January, including 25,000 new jobs in the nonresidential
        specialty trades (the highest monthly change in five years).
-   January’s 130,000 new nonfarm jobs is the best month of job growth
    yet, signaling President Trump’s pro-growth policies are starting to
    deliver real momentum in the labor market.
-   In President Trump’s second term, 615,000 private sector jobs have
    been added while federal employment has declined to its lowest level
    since 1966 — and the lowest level in recorded history as a share of
    the total workforce.

## **As wage growth booms, Americans want to join the Trump Economy.**

-   Average weekly earnings for private sector employees rose 0.7% in
    January.
    -   In President Trump’s second term, average weekly earnings have
        grown by 4.3% and average hourly earnings have increased by
        3.7%.
-   Prime-age labor force participation rose to its highest level since
    2001 as more Americans come off the sidelines and enter the
    workforce.

## **The numbers shattered expectations (again).**

-   In fact, the number of new jobs added in January was more than
    double economists’ predictions, coming in higher than nearly all
    economists surveyed by Bloomberg.

## **The labor market under Biden was far weaker than we already knew.**

-   From initial release to the current estimate, job growth over
    Biden’s final two years was overstated by 1.9 million jobs.
