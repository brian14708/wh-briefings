title: Minnesota Democrats Protected This Violent Illegal Alien. The Trump Administration
  Is Deporting Him.
---
 
**The Trump Administration is aggressively removing dangerous criminal
illegal aliens from Minnesota’s communities — predators that Radical
Left Democrats**
[**insist**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2014185150796509436)
[**on**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2016539408149754172)
**providing** [**safe
harbor**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1902903998434210172)**.**

A stark example: Last week, ICE
[apprehended](https://x.com/ICEgov/status/2018460728902996142) [Esdras
Aaron
Rodriguez-Hernandez](https://x.com/CrimeWatchMpls/status/2018583504536178836),
a Guatemalan national and accused domestic abuser, in a case that
exposes the dangerous stupidity of Minnesota’s “sanctuary” policies —
and the [self-inflicted
necessity](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2011512206731452556) of
Operation Metro Surge.

In 2024, Rodriguez-Hernandez was
[arrested](https://x.com/CrimeWatchMpls/status/2018583504536178836) and
[charged](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Case-Search-Minnesota-Court-Records-Online-MCRO.pdf#page=2)
with [domestic
assault](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.2242#:~:text=609.2242%20DOMESTIC%20ASSAULT,harm%20upon%20another.)
(intentionally inflicting or attempting to inflict bodily harm on a
family member) and [released without
bail](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Case-Search-Minnesota-Court-Records-Online-MCRO.pdf#page=5).
A warrant was issued after he [didn’t show up for
court](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Case-Search-Minnesota-Court-Records-Online-MCRO.pdf),
and he evaded justice for nearly a year.

In November, he was arrested on the warrant and
[booked](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Hennepin-County-Sheriff-Jail-Roster.pdf)
into the Hennepin County Jail, only to be
[released](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/MCRO_27-CR-24-20458_Law-Enforcement-Notice-of-Release-and-Appearance_2025-11-12_20260203111824.pdf)
the next day [on a $100
bail](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/MCRO_27-CR-24-20458_Order-for-Conditional-Release_2025-11-10_20260203111809.pdf).
After a radical prosecutor downgraded the charge, he was [granted a stay
of
adjudication](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/MCRO_27-CR-24-20458_Order-Other_2026-01-06_20260203111832.pdf)
and set free once again.

******At every step, local officials in the “sanctuary” jurisdiction
failed to notify ICE of his custody — forcing federal agents to expend
significant resources tracking him down and putting Minnesotans at
unnecessary risk.******

Rodriguez-Hernandez now awaits deportation, joining a [long
list](https://www.dhs.gov/wow?combine=&field_country_of_origin_target_id=All&field_state_value=Minnesota)
of criminal illegal alien thugs the Trump Administration has removed
from Minnesota’s streets — often with zero help from leaders who
prioritize criminals over citizens.

**Minnesota’s “sanctuary” policies are a deliberate choice to put
criminal illegals ahead of Americans’ safety.** But the Trump
Administration will not relent in targeting the worst of the worst and
putting American citizens — not violent criminals — first.
