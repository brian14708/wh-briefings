**Director Michael Kratsios**

**Remarks at the India AI Impact Summit 2026**

Good morning, everyone. Thank you to the distinguished heads of state,
public servants, and business leaders participating in India’s AI Impact
Summit 2026 here in New Delhi. It is a great honor to speak to you as
head of delegation, representing the United States of America.

\*\*\*

At this summit last year in Paris, Vice President J.D. Vance sought to
refocus the AI conversation in his remarks, from safety to opportunity.

The future is something to be built, not awaited. And both the problems
and solutions that AI presents are opportunities to make bold choices to
better the lives of the people we represent.

So today, I want to call on each of you to join us as partners in the
effort to build the AI future, on behalf of your own nation and your own
people.

\*\*\*

America is the birthplace of AI and the home of the frontier companies
and hyperscalers that have ushered in this critical moment. That is no
accident.

Within days of returning to the White House last year, President Trump
recommitted America to AI leadership. He repealed the last
administration’s so-called diffusion framework, which prevented AI
exports and placed partner countries, like India, in a supposed second
tier. And last summer, the Trump Administration released America’s AI
Action Plan, a strategy for winning the AI race based on three pillars:
Innovation, Infrastructure, and International Partnerships.

Today, America’s leading position is clearly visible in a booming U.S.
AI industry. Our biggest AI and chip companies have individual market
caps that exceed that of the entire FTSE 100. Our four largest AI
companies plan to spend nearly $700 billion on AI infrastructure this
year, *three times* more than it cost to put American footsteps on the
surface of the Moon. And of the billion people using America’s leading
AI platforms, more than three quarters log on from *your* countries,
outside the U.S.

Industry benchmarks show that American AI services are more capable and
cost-effective than competitors for nearly every application, and offer
greater robustness and security. American chips are many times more
advanced and reliable than alternatives—sought by nations spanning the
globe, both west and *east*. And when competitor nations claim to have
made breakthroughs in frontier models, U.S. companies recognize the
tell-tale signs of American innovation.

The gold standard in AI is made in America.

\*\*\*

International discussion of AI has evolved, as this summit itself
attests. We have moved from gathering to talk about AI safety to calling
for AI action, and now we are here to consider AI impact.

I think this is clearly a positive development. But it is not clear to
me that these forward-thinking changes in how we describe these
gatherings are much more than cosmetic. Too many international forums,
such as the U.N.’s Global Dialogue on AI Governance, maintain a general
atmosphere of fear.

We must replace that fear with hope. We cannot allow AI to become, as
nuclear power was for many decades, a foundation for a future of
abundance, abandoned and left unrealized.

Ideological, risk-focused obsessions, such as climate or equity, become
excuses for bureaucratic management and centralization. In the name of
safety, they increase the danger that these tools will be used for
tyrannical control.

I believe that if we embrace AI and exercise its power well, it will
advance human flourishing and drive unprecedented prosperity.

Focusing AI policy on safety and speculative risks, however, rather than
concrete opportunities, inhibits a competitive ecosystem, entrenches
incumbents, and isolates developing countries from full participation in
the AI economy.

\*\*\*

Adoption remains the critical bottleneck in realizing AI’s potential to
transform industries and unleash new productivity. I will address
international AI adoption trends shortly, but, in the American context,
I see two main limiting factors.

One is trust. Regulatory and non-regulatory policy frameworks that
safeguard the public interest are necessary to earn the public’s trust
in AI. To give the American people confidence in these tools, the Trump
Administration seeks to support legislators as they construct a national
policy framework that protects children, prevents censorship, respects
intellectual property, and safeguards our workers, families, and
communities.

The other primary limiting factor to U.S. AI adoption is regulatory
certainty and clarity. It is our position that, with smart updates to
existing frameworks to reflect new technological realities, use-case and
sector-specific regulation best allows adoption. This gives industry
confidence that tomorrow’s rules will be common-sense developments of
today’s, allowing them to focus on creative deployment.

\*\*\*

AI governance must focus on the particular needs and interests of
particular people, and so it must be local.

As the Trump Administration has now said many times: We totally reject
global governance of AI. We believe AI adoption cannot lead to a
brighter future if it is subject to bureaucracies and centralized
control.

Prioritizing AI for your people does not mean joining international
efforts that are either purely symbolic or a sacrifice of national
self-determination.

It does not mean constructing a regulatory regime that exchanges your
countries’ capacity to build and innovate for the self-satisfaction of
technocrats.

It does not mean isolating yourself, hoping to reconstruct the whole AI
stack from scratch even as you are left behind.

Prioritizing AI for your people means pursuing a sovereign AI capability
for your country now. This begins with the rapid adoption of the best
components of the technology stack available, while your national
champions work to develop their own.

\*\*\*

Real AI sovereignty means owning and using best-in-class technology for
the benefit of your people, and charting your national destiny in the
midst of global transformations. It does not mean waiting to participate
in an AI-enabled global market until you have tried and failed to build
full self-sufficiency.

Complete technological self-containment is unrealistic for any country,
because the AI stack is incredibly complex. But strategic autonomy
alongside rapid AI adoption is achievable, and it is a necessity for
independent nations. America wants to help.

We believe that independent partners are critical to unlocking the
prosperity AI adoption can open to all of us. That is why the president
launched the American AI Export Program. That is why I am here with you
today.

The U.S. setting the gold standard for AI means winning on the merits.
We believe American companies and technology succeeds in open
competition, and we want to lead an AI ecosystem that works with your
local technologies, local datasets, and local languages, rather than
imposing global standards or pursuing vendor-lock-in.

America is the only AI superpower willing and able to truly empower
partner nations in your pursuit of meaningful AI sovereignty. American
companies can build large, independent AI infrastructure, with secure
and robust supply chains that minimize backdoor risk. They build it;
it’s yours.

American AI companies and open-source models can enable local training
and fine-tuning with linguistic and cultural adaptation, without
embedded political orthodoxies. And cryptographically protected
confidentiality, and world-leading American security, can help you keep
your sensitive data within your borders and within your control.

\*\*\*

The Trump Administration is passionate about sharing the benefits of
American AI, and we have thought long and hard about how we can help
make the AI future one of prosperous collaboration and peaceful
competition, together.

The United States and the rest of the world can only fully realize the
amazing potential of this technology when we share an open, cooperative
AI ecosystem built on top of localized, sovereign infrastructure. But as
you know, while use of AI tools continues to grow worldwide, the pace of
adoption and sophistication of deployment continues to stratify.
Developing countries are falling behind developed economies at a
fundamental inflection point.

Developed countries face adoption problems similar to America’s, and are
primarily concerned about how their native technology companies will fit
into a competitive global AI ecosystem. But developing countries face
two additional barriers to AI adoption.

One is financing. The AI stack is expensive. Through the enormous energy
and material demands of its infrastructure, it brings the digital
transformation of our world back into physical reality. Data centers,
semiconductors, power production, all of these elements require physical
labor and resources. The other barrier is a deficit in the technical
sophistication needed to deploy AI tools as effectively as possible.

To help facilitate worldwide adoption of trusted AI systems; the
creation of a competitive, open, and interoperable AI ecosystem; and to
further the efforts of the
<a href="https://aiexports.gov/" id="https://aiexports.gov/">American AI
Exports Program</a> in both developed and developing partner nations,
today I am pleased to announce a U.S. government-wide suite of support
initiatives.

To integrate partner nation companies with the American AI stack,
ensuring that no country has to choose between completing the stack and
developing domestic AI, we have established a National Champions
Initiative. We recognize that partners need the chance to build their
native technology industries, and believe facilitating this will be a
critical part of the exports program.

To facilitate the development of industry-led, open, and secure AI agent
standards, and to give the public confidence in this next-generation
technology, we are creating an [AI Agent Standards
Initiative](https://www.nist.gov/caisi/ai-agent-standards-initiative).

To empower developing partner countries to overcome financing obstacles
as they import the American AI stack, the U.S. International Development
Finance Corporation, the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the
U.S. Trade and Development Agency, the Millennium Challenge Corporation,
and a new World Bank Fund have all initiated new AI-focused programs.

And to further enable AI adoption in the developing world, the Trump
Administration is bringing America’s historic Peace Corps into the
21<sup>st</sup> Century with the launch of the [Tech
Corps](https://www.peacecorps.gov/ways-to-serve/tech-corps/). This new
initiative will embed volunteer technical talent with import partners to
provide last-mile support in deploying powerful AI applications for
enhanced public services. In everything from energy and education, to
manufacturing and medicine, to transportation and agriculture, I am
confident that the American AI stack can be key to unlocking new
economic and social benefits for your people.

\*\*\*

The hope of the United States is that the pursuit of real AI
sovereignty—the adoption and deployment of sovereign infrastructure,
sovereign data, sovereign models, and sovereign policies within your
borders, under your control—will become an occasion for bilateral
diplomacy, international development, and global economic dynamism.

The American AI Exports Program exists to make that happen.  

The U.S. wants to share the American AI stack, because this technology
presents the opportunity to lead—as our nation’s Founders did 250 years
ago—a revolution in human history, to the benefit of all mankind. These
tools, used well, will unlock new knowledge of our world and new sources
of prosperity, and challenge us to grow the strength of our humanity to
match our growing capabilities.

American AI is settling a new frontier, but America does not seek to
build this new future alone. So, I ask you to join us.

Thank you.
