**The progress reflects the early impacts of President Trump’s
comprehensive approach to housing — increasing supply, reducing
bureaucratic barriers, and empowering builders to meet demand.** While
renters enjoy this relief today, President Trump remains focused on
restoring the American Dream of homeownership for all Americans,
committed to building on this momentum with further reforms that deliver
affordability now and the path to owning a home for generations to come.
