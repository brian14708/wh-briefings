title: In Munich, Secretary Rubio Calls on Allies to Embrace Shared Heritage, Meet
  Challenges of New Era
---
 
**Today, Secretary of State Marco Rubio delivered a** [**landmark
address**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2022816000358379666)
**at the Munich Security Conference, boldly reaffirming President Donald
J. Trump’s commitment to a revitalized transatlantic alliance grounded
in mutual strength, shared heritage, and unapologetic defense of Western
civilization.** Drawing on Europe’s profound Christian foundations and
cultural legacy — which helped forge the United States — Secretary Rubio
urged European leaders to reclaim their sovereignty, confront common
threats, and build a confident, self-reliant continent.

**Secretary Rubio synthesized President Trump’s America First foreign
policy:** one that brings sovereign nations together in common purpose,
rejects outdated globalist structures, rebuffs self-destructive policies
such as unchecked mass migration and climate extremism, and secures
prosperity and cultural preservation for future generations.

**The speech drew widespread acclaim:**

[Vice President JD
Vance](https://x.com/JDVance/status/2022779447741403517): “This is a
great speech. Worth watching the whole thing.”

[Sen. Katie
Britt](https://x.com/SenKatieBritt/status/2022718105495929091?s=20):
“Incredible. Watch this. Listen to every word.”

[Sen. Joni
Ernst](https://x.com/SenJoniErnst/status/2022723965152530481?s=20):
“Powerful words from @SecRubio! When our allies and partnerships are
stronger, our adversaries are weaker. As America charts the path for a
new century of prosperity, we hope to do it alongside our European
allies.”

[Sen. Lindsey
Graham](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/2022739760847163648):
“@SecRubio did a masterful job explaining why Europe should make new
decisions regarding the direction the continent is going. He stressed
the following: – Europe’s outcome matters dramatically to America –
Modern America was birthed on the European continent but we have our own
mind It is my hope that Europe continues to become more in control of
the mass migration that has plagued the continent, and more committed to
its own defense. Secretary Rubio explained — as well as anyone I’ve
heard — that America First doesn’t mean America Alone. America First
means a new relationship with Europe that is equally beneficial. To
those in Europe who want to hold onto the old way of business, you are
making a mistake – it hasn’t worked. Well done, Marco.”

[Sen. Mike
Lee](https://x.com/BasedMikeLee/status/2022712457400131963?s=20):
“Secretary Rubio speaks truth to power”

watch!”

[Sen. Eric
Schmitt](https://x.com/Eric_Schmitt/status/2022680406873850301?s=20):
“Great speech by @SecRubio I pray Europe listens.”

[Rep. Mark
Alford](https://x.com/RepMarkAlford/status/2022791993919758630): “One of
the greatest speeches by a Secretary of State with a message made for
the 21st Century. Perhaps this will mark a turning point in the future
of Western Civilization. America First is not America alone. Well done,
@SecRubio.”

[Rep. Michael
Baumgartner](https://x.com/RepBaumgartner/status/2022654707001627068):
“Secretary Rubio gave it straight to Europe’s leaders. America wants to
partner with Europe, but Europe has to get its act together and build a
real military, reject socialism, stop climate extremism, and defend our
mutual cultural heritage.”

[Rep. Carlos
Gimenez](https://x.com/RepCarlos/status/2022699348845346819?s=20):

America’s place in the world.”

[Rep. Mike
Lawler](https://x.com/lawler4ny/status/2022757229502337406?s=20): “The
remarks delivered by @SecRubio were a tour de force and perfectly
encapsulated the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. America
and our European allies must unite against the unholy alliance that
seeks to undermine and destabilize Europe, America, and the free world.”

[Rep. Nathaniel
Moran](https://x.com/RepNateMoran/status/2022778915593331067?s=20):
“@SecRubio delivered a historic speech at the Munich Security Conference
today. Rightfully, he did so without fear, without reservation, and
without apology. His clear and precise words of truth reinforced the
principles, purposes, and steadfast resolve that have motivated American
strength in the past and that now give renewed direction for the future.
The United States of America will not fade quietly into the night;
instead, we will stand victoriously with our allies against the
evildoers of this world.”

[Rep. Greg
Murphy](https://x.com/RepGregMurphy/status/2022800781741531276?s=20):

to ‘wake up’ and abandon Liberal policies that are destroying Europe and
the US. Amen @SecRubio!!”

[Rep. Zach Nunn](https://x.com/ZachNunn/status/2022795094684844339):

linked together by shared history and values. We must lead together or
fall behind. That means securing supply chains, unleashing energy
independence, and building a security alliance our adversaries won’t
test.”

McCarthy](https://x.com/SpeakerMcCarthy/status/2022746656861753365?s=20):

country has to offer in terms of leadership on the world stage.”

disciplined implementation.”
