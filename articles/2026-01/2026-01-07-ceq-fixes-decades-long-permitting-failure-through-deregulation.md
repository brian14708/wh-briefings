title: CEQ Fixes Decades-Long Permitting Failure Through Deregulation
---
 
*President Trump’s deregulation effort has already delivered permitting
reform.*

Today, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) took the final
administrative action to complete one of the Trump Administration’s most
significant deregulatory efforts, affirming the removal of CEQ’s
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) implementing regulations. CEQ
rescinded these regulations last year; this final rule reaffirms that
rescission and responds to comments received on the initial action. This
final rule is now available for public inspection
[here](https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2026-00178/removal-of-national-environmental-policy-act-implementing-regulations),
ahead of its forthcoming official publication in the Federal Register.

On February 25, 2025, CEQ published an Interim Final Rule (IFR), which
went into effect on April 11, removing its NEPA regulations pursuant to
President Trump’s direction in his day-one [*Unleashing American
Energy*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/)
Executive Order to expedite and simplify the permitting process. In the
Executive Order, President Trump revoked the 1977 Carter-era Executive
Order that directed CEQ to issue Federal government-wide NEPA
regulations. President Trump directed CEQ to instead return to its core
statutory mission of consulting with agencies to ensure that their
agency-specific NEPA implementing procedures comply with the policies of
the United States and the text of the Congressional statute. Today’s
final action responds to public comments received on the IFR and
reaffirms this removal of CEQ’s regulations.

“In this Administration, NEPA’s regulatory reign of terror has ended,”
said **Council on Environmental Quality Chairman Katherine Scarlett**.
“Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, CEQ acted early to slash
needless layering of bureaucratic burden and restore common sense to the
environmental review and permitting process. The Trump CEQ is putting
the American people first by cutting red tape that has held back growth
of the U.S. economy and refocusing its attention on ensuring the
certainty needed in the permitting process to invest in American
infrastructure. Renewing our energy and other infrastructure will lead
to job creation, energy dominance, economic growth, and better
environmental outcomes.”

This deregulation has already cleared a path for Federal agencies to
speedily reform their own NEPA procedures—many of which had not been
updated in decades. On [June 30,
2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/06/fact-sheet-president-trump-is-delivering-historic-permitting-wins-across-the-federal-government/),
major permitting agencies across the Executive Branch updated their
respective NEPA implementing procedures to simplify this overly
burdensome process and ensure efficient and timely environmental
consideration.

CEQ continues with its core statutory mission of consulting and
coordinating with other Federal agencies as they revise their NEPA
procedures in line with the statute as amended and with President
Trump’s policies, providing guidance on the modernization of NEPA to
ensure consistency across agencies.  CEQ offers [implementation

and

to streamline NEPA reviews.  Today’s action delivers on President
Trump’s promise to fix a broken permitting system while preserving clean
air, water, and land for all Americans.
