title: "Democrats Once Demanded Maduro\u2019s Ouster. Now They Mourn His Capture \u2014\
  \ Because Trump Did It."
---
 
President Donald J. Trump has scored another remarkable foreign policy
triumph: the bold capture and extradition of Nicolas Maduro, the
indicted narcoterrorist and socialist dictator who plunged Venezuela
into chaos, starved its people, and menaced American security, now
detained on U.S. soil to face long-overdue justice.

Democrats spent years howling that Maduro was a ruthless tyrant who had
to be delegitimized, pressured, and removed. But the instant President
Trump succeeds where they failed, they erupt in furious hypocrisy —
prioritizing their unhinged hatred of President Trump over American
interests and national security.

**Here are just a few of the many hypocritical Democrats then vs. now:**

#### **Sen. Chuck Schumer**

-   **THEN:** “And the President brags about his Venezuela policy. Give
    us a break. He hasn’t brought an end to the Maduro regime. The
    Maduro regime is more powerful today and more entrenched today than
    it was when the President began.”
    ([2/5/20](https://www.c-span.org/program/us-senate/senate-session-part-1/540846#:~:text=I%27LL%20SPEAK%20LATER,OF%20A%20QUORUM.))
-   **NOW:** “This is reckless. And the American people are just, this
    morning, in fear of what’s going to happen here.”
    ([1/4/26](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-1-4-26-secretary-state-marco/story?id=128879021#:~:text=This%20is%20reckless.%20And%20the%20American%20people%20are%20just%2C%20this%20morning%2C%20in%20fear%20of%20what%27s%20going%20to%20happen%20here.))

#### **Sen. Dick Durbin**

-   **THEN:** “The people of Venezuela deserve better than this. We
    can’t allow this President’s short attention span to stop us from
    delivering on our promise to help the Venezuelan people rebuild
    their country… Though President Trump may seem ready to throw in the
    towel, I stand committed to aiding the people of Venezuela.”
    ([6/20/19](https://x.com/SenatorDurbin/status/1141779932323962881)**)**
-   **NOW:** “I disagree with President Trump’s use of U.S. military
    forces without Congressional approval & worry deeply about this
    Admin’s follow through on foreign policy interventions.”
    ([1/3/26](https://x.com/SenatorDurbin/status/2007543334559199700?s=20))

#### **Sen. Chris Van Hollen**

-   **THEN:** “\[T\]he United States is now going to use its levers and
    influence to push for a negotiation to have a transition to the
    truly elected leader… Obviously, we know Maduro and his cronies do
    not want to go quietly into the night, but the United States needs
    to work with its partners and allies in the region to ratchet up the
    pressure…”
    ([8/2/24](https://archive.org/details/MSNBCW_20240802_150000_Jose_Diaz-Balart_Reports/start/2460/end/2520))
-   **NOW:** “It is an illegal act of war to replace Maduro.”
    ([1/3/26](https://x.com/ChrisVanHollen/status/2007480271960981764))

#### **Sen. Chris Murphy**

-   **THEN**: “If Trump cared about consistency, he would make the
    realist case for intervention in Venezuela (getting rid of Maduro is
    good for the United States) rather than trying to pretend his
    Administration all of the sudden cares about toppling
    anti-democratic regimes.”
    ([1/23/19](https://x.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1088255884134965249))
-   **NOW:** “The invasion of Venezuela has nothing to do with American
    security. Venezuela is not a security threat to the U.S.”
    [(1/4/26)](https://x.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/2007838257040494995)

#### **Sen. Tim Kaine**

-   **THEN:** “This is a deeply concerning development for Venezuelans
    and for the entire region, since instability abroad impacts us here
    at home, too.”
    ([9/2/24](https://x.com/SenTimKaine/status/1830765977472319711))
-   **NOW:** “President Trump’s unauthorized military attack on
    Venezuela to arrest Maduro… is a sickening return to a day when the
    United States asserted the right to dominate the internal political
    affairs of all nations in the Western Hemisphere.”
    ([1/3/26](https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-statement-on-trump-administrations-unauthorized-military-attack-on-venezuela#:~:text=President%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20unauthorized%20military%20attack%20on%20Venezuela%20to%20arrest%20Maduro%E2%80%94however%20terrible%20he%20is%E2%80%94is%20a%20sickening%20return%20to%20a%20day%20when%20the%20United%20States%20asserted%20the%20right%20to%20dominate%20the%20internal%20political%20affairs%20of%20all%20nations%20in%20the%20Western%20Hemisphere.))

#### **Sen. Amy Klobuchar**

-   **THEN:** “I have of course supported bringing in the new president
    and delegitimizing the Maduro government. You always leave things on
    the table.”
    ([5/2/19](https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/democrats-split-in-responses-to-venezuela-crisis/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20have%20of%20course%20supported%20bringing%20in%20the%20new%20president%20and%20delegitimizing%20the%20Maduro%20government%2C%E2%80%9D%20Minnesota%20senator%20Amy%20Klobuchar%20says.%20%E2%80%9CYou%20always%20leave%20things%20on%20the%20table%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20added%20when%20asked%20about%20U.S.%20intervention.))
-   **NOW:** “I have strongly opposed sending American forces into
    harm’s way in Venezuela without authorization from Congress. We
    should not put Americans at risk in this way without careful
    deliberation among the people’s elected representatives. Wars for
    regime change can lead to unintended
    consequences.”([1/3/26](https://x.com/SenAmyKlobuchar/status/2007491787590430792))

#### **Sen. Elizabeth Warren**

-   **THEN:** “Maduro is a dictator and a crook who has wrecked his
    country’s economy, dismantled its democratic institutions, and
    profited while his people suffer. The United States should lead the
    international community in addressing Venezuela’s humanitarian
    crisis and supporting regional efforts to negotiate a political
    transition.”
    ([7/30/2019](https://www.cfr.org/article/presidential-candidates-venezuela#:~:text=Maduro%20is%20a%20dictator%20and,to%20negotiate%20a%20political%20transition))
-   **NOW:** “What does it mean that the U.S. will ‘run’ Venezuela, and
    what will Trump do next around the world? The American people voted
    for lower costs, not for Trump’s dangerous military adventurism
    overseas that won’t make the American people safer.”
    ([1/3/26](https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-statement-on-trumps-military-action-in-venezuela))

#### **Rep. Jamie Raskin**

-   **THEN:** “The democratic world must stand up for the rule of law in
    Venezuela and oppose Maduro’s assault on the electoral process and
    free speech. The right-wing attack on democratic institutions
    anywhere is a threat to freedom everywhere.”
    ([8/2/24](https://x.com/RepRaskin/status/1819438900529483794?s=20))
-   **NOW:** “Trump is not only violating our Constitution, but he is
    shredding the rules-based international order created after World
    War II, whose essential building block is the political sovereignty
    and territorial integrity of each nation.”
    ([1/4/26](https://raskin.house.gov/2026/1/raskin-statement-on-trump-s-unconstitutional-military-strike-on-venezuela))

#### **Rep. Darren Soto**

-   **THEN:** “Honored to speak with @cdvorlando yesterday about
    Venezuelan TPS, raising the reward for Maduro’s capture to $100M,
    and bringing democracy back to Venezuela. \#VenezuelaLibre”
    ([10/6/24](https://x.com/RepDarrenSoto/status/1843037465935778168))
-   **NOW:** “Trump’s trading one dictator for another just to get oil?
    This will do NOTHING to help my constituents’ family members who
    just lost their TPS and still can’t return home.”
    ([1/5/26](https://x.com/RepDarrenSoto/status/2008199231694369236))
