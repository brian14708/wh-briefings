title: "Mass Deportations Are Improving Americans\u2019 Quality of Life"
---
 
**In just one year, President Donald J. Trump’s ironclad commitment to
securing our border and enforcing our nation’s laws is liberating
Americans from the crushing burden of unchecked illegal immigration.**
Through mass deportations, the Trump Administration is freeing up
resources, revitalizing opportunity, and restoring safety — delivering
tangible results that put American citizens first.

## **Mass deportations = lower housing costs.**

In 14 of the top 20 [metro
areas](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/03/11/us-metro-areas-unauthorized-immigrants/)
with the largest illegal migrant populations, [home list
prices](https://www.realtor.com/research/December-2025-data/) declined
year-over-year in December — and the three metro areas that saw modest
price increases are all so-called “sanctuary cities.” Overall, home
prices have
[dropped](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/11/us-home-prices-negative.html)
for the first time in more than two years as housing affordability shows
[signs of
improvement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2026/01/as-president-trump-tackles-housing-affordability-progress-emerges-and-more-relief-is-on-the-horizon/)
under the Trump Administration.

to rise 4.2% in President Trump’s first full year.

## **Mass deportations = more jobs.**

Between January and December 2025, two million native-born Americans
have [gained](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNU02073413) employment,
while 662,000 foreign-born workers
have [lost](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNU02073395) employment; 1.8
million [native-born](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNU01073413) Americans
have [joined](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNU01073413) the labor
force, while 881,000 foreign-born workers have
[left](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNU01073395) the labor force.

## **Mass deportations = lower crime.**

The nation experienced the [largest single-year
drop](https://www.axios.com/2025/12/24/us-trump-murder-data-killing-crime-national-guard)
in murders on record last year, alongside [steep
declines](https://majorcitieschiefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MCCA-Violent-Crime-Report-2025-and-2024-January-to-September.pdf)
in rapes, robberies, aggravated assaults, shooting deaths (the
[fewest](https://www.thetrace.org/2025/12/data-shooting-stats-gun-violence-america/)
since 2015), [on-duty law enforcement officer

The results are especially pronounced in Democrat-run jurisdictions
where the Trump Administration conducted mass deportation and enhanced
law enforcement operations:

    to its lowest level in nearly 50 years.

**Under President Trump, the America First promise is a reality.** While
Democrats fight to sabotage these gains and drag us back to the chaos of
open borders, skyrocketing costs, and rampant crime, President Trump
remains unwavering in his commitment to delivering the security,
prosperity, and safety the American people deserve.
