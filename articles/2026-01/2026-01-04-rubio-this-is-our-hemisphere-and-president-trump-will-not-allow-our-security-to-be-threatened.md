title: "RUBIO: This Is Our Hemisphere \u2014 and President Trump Will Not Allow Our\
  \ Security to be Threatened"
---
 
**This morning, Secretary of State Marco Rubio joined multiple news
programs to discuss the Trump Administration’s decisive operation that
successfully apprehended indicted narcoterrorist and illegitimate former
Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro.** Secretary Rubio underscored
President Donald J. Trump’s ironclad commitment to preventing the
Western Hemisphere from becoming a safe haven for drug traffickers,
Iranian proxies, or hostile regimes that endanger our national security
— declaring the days of weakness are over and the U.S. will deploy every
tool to eradicate these threats from our backyard.

-   “There’s not a war. We are at war against drug trafficking
    organizations — not a war against Venezuela.”

-   “We don’t have U.S. forces on the ground in Venezuela. They were on
    the ground for about two hours when they went to capture Maduro…
    What the President is saying is very simple — and that is as
    President of the United States, he is not going to go around telling
    people what he’s not going to do.”

-   “This is the Western Hemisphere. This is where we live — and we’re
    not going to allow the Western Hemisphere to be a base of operation
    for adversaries, competitors, and rivals of the United States.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2007829441938899005))
-   “The first steps are securing what’s in the national interest of the
    United States and also beneficial to the people of Venezuela, and
    those are the things that we’re focused on right now. No more drug
    trafficking. No more Iran, Hezbollah presence there. No more using
    the oil industry to enrich all our adversaries around the world.”

-   “This was not an action that required congressional approval. In
    fact, it couldn’t require congressional approval because this was
    not an invasion. This is not an extended military operation… We will
    seek congressional approval for actions that require congressional
    approval. Otherwise, they’ll get congressional notification.”

-   “The whole foreign policy apparatus thinks everything is Libya,
    everything is Iraq, everything is Afghanistan. This is not the
    Middle East, and our mission here is very different. This is the
    Western Hemisphere.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2007848190343528817))
-   “The most immediate changes are the ones that are in the national
    interests of the United States. That’s why we’re involved here —
    because of how it applies and has a direct impact on the United
    States.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2007820705962795392))
-   “We’ve seen how our adversaries all over the world are exploiting
    and extracting resources from Africa, from every other country.
    They’re not going to do it in the Western Hemisphere. That is not
    going to happen under President Trump. Read our national security
    strategy. He is serious about it.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2007828894104035405))
-   “What we are going to react to is very simple: what do you do? Not
    what you’re saying publicly, what happens… Do the drugs stop coming?
    Are the changes made? Is Iran expelled? Is Hezbollah and Iran no
    longer able to operate against our interests from Venezuela?”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2007839507849064804?s=20))
-   “It’s running policy — the policy with regards to this. We want
    Venezuela to move in a certain direction because not only do we
    think it’s good for the people of Venezuela, it’s in our national
    interest.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2007821006161817788))
-   “We retain all the options we had before this raid and this capture
    and this arrest… until such time as changes are made.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2007847071080939820))
-   “In the Biden Administration, they had a $25 million reward for
    \[Maduro’s\] capture — so we have a reward for his capture but we’re
    not going to enforce it? That’s the difference between President
    Trump and everybody else… President Trump did something about it.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2007824830352040017))
-   “Until they address \[the problems\], they will continue to face
    this oil quarantine. They will continue to face pressure from the
    United States. We will continue to target drug boats if they try to
    run towards the United States. We will continue to seize the boats
    that are sanctioned with court orders. We will continue to do that
    and potentially other things until the things we need to see
    addressed are addressed… The number one thing we care about is the
    safety, security, wellbeing, and prosperity of the United States.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2007828360160813335))
-   “Maduro is not just an indicted drug trafficker; he was an
    illegitimate president. He was not the head of state. I continue to
    see these media reports referring to him as ‘President Maduro’ and
    the ‘head of state.’ He was not the head of state.”
