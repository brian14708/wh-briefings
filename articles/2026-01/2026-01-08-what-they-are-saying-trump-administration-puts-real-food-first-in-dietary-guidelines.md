  Guidelines'

**The Trump Administration’s**
[**updated**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2008937778386526621)
**Dietary Guidelines represent the most significant**
[**reset**](https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/fact-sheet-historic-reset-federal-nutrition-policy.html)
**of federal nutrition policy in decades**. By [prioritizing real
food](https://realfood.gov/) — not ultra-processed foods, added sugars,
and refined carbohydrates — these guidelines restore commonsense and
science to health policy, putting real food back at the center of
preventing chronic disease and promoting lifelong wellness.

**The move immediately drew widespread praise from leading medical
organizations, farmers, public health experts, and wellness advocates
alike:**

[American Academy of Pediatrics President Andrew Racine, MD,
PhD](https://www.medpagetoday.com/primarycare/dietnutrition/119327#:~:text=Some%20physician%20groups,on%20added%20sugars.%22):
“The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recognizes the importance of
the \[guidelines’\] clear focus on child nutrition guidance that
supports healthy eating patterns for children, with a focus on whole,
minimally processed foods. Every day, pediatricians support families in
developing healthy eating habits, and we commend the inclusion of the
academy’s evidence-based policy related to breastfeeding, introduction
of solid foods, caffeine avoidance, and limits on added sugars.”

[American College of Cardiology President Christopher M. Kramer,
MD](https://www.acc.org/About-ACC/Press-Releases/2026/01/07/22/59/American-College-of-Cardiology-Comments-on-New-Dietary-Guidelines):
“The ACC acknowledges and appreciates the release of new federal
nutrition guidance and remains committed to helping clinicians and
patients use it to support heart health. We welcome the inclusion of
several important science-based recommendations, including a focus on
eating whole fruits and vegetables; limiting added sugars, highly
processed foods, saturated fats and sugary drinks; and incorporating
whole grains and healthy fats from whole foods like meats, seafood,
eggs, nuts, seeds, olives and avocados.”

[American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy
Duvall](https://www.fb.org/news-release/dietary-guidelines-focus-on-fresh-nutrient-dense-foods):
“Farm Bureau appreciates HHS and USDA for recognizing the importance of
America’s farmers and ranchers who grow a safe and nutritious food
supply. The new dietary guidelines acknowledge the value of prioritizing
high-quality protein, dairy, and fresh fruits and vegetables. Farm
Bureau looks forward to working with the administration to ensure food
policy decisions are grounded in science and easily understood so
America’s families have confidence when stocking their pantries.”

[American Medical Association President Bobby Mukkamala,
MD:](https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/ama-press-releases/ama-applauds-dietary-guidelines-announces-commitments-nutrition)
“The American Medical Association applauds the Administration’s new
Dietary Guidelines for spotlighting the highly processed foods,
sugar-sweetened beverages, and excess sodium that fuel heart disease,
diabetes, obesity, and other chronic illnesses. The Guidelines affirm
that food is medicine and offer clear direction patients and physicians
can use to improve health. Today the AMA is making significant
commitments to improve clinical competency, deliver educational
resources for physicians, and work with Congress to enact meaningful,
lasting nutrition change that can improve lives. The AMA is focused on
helping physicians translate this science into everyday care and helping
patients improve their overall health.”

[American Heart
Association](https://newsroom.heart.org/news/releases-20260107-6915862):
“The American Heart Association welcomes the new dietary guidelines and
commends the inclusion of several important science-based
recommendations, notably the emphasis on increasing intake of
vegetables, fruits and whole grains while limiting consumption of added
sugars, refined grains, highly processed foods, saturated fats and
sugary drinks. These elements align closely with the longstanding
dietary guidance of the American Heart Association and other public
health authorities.”

[American Hospital Association Executive Vice President Stacey
Hughes](https://www.aha.org/news/headline/2026-01-07-hhs-usda-release-updated-dietary-guidelines):
“We welcome the Trump Administration’s revised dietary guidelines and
continued focus on improving nutrition and promoting healthy eating. It
is essential to the wellbeing of individuals, families and communities,
and it plays a critical role in preventing disease and supporting
long-term health. Today’s guidelines jump-start important conversations
about what we eat, and hospitals remain committed to helping patients
access wholesome food and empowering them to make informed choices that
support their health.”

**Consumer Brands Association**: “We look forward to working with the
Administration and Congress as the Dietary Guidelines for Americans
inform important food and beverage policy. American consumers continue
to seek a diverse selection of foods and beverages and the makers of
America’s trusted household brands provide a wide variety of products to
choose from that are affordable, safe and nutritious, along with access
to the information consumers need to make informed choices.”

[Environmental Working Group Senior Strategic Campaign Director for Food
Systems Sarah
Reinhardt](https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/statement/2026/01/ewg-statement-new-federal-dietary-guidelines):
“When it comes to ultra-processed food, the guidelines point us in the
right direction. We don’t have to know everything to know some things,
and we already know that ultra-processed foods high in refined grains
and added sugar are contributing to chronic disease. This is an urgent
public health problem. America leads the world in the consumption of
UPF. Kids now get more than 60% of their calories from UPF and for
adults, it’s more than 50%. We need to start somewhere to tackle this
problem. Cutting back on refined grains and sugar-sweetened foods and
drinks alone would go a long way toward improving public health.”

[FARE CEO Sung Poblete, PhD,
RN](https://www.foodallergy.org/media-room/statement-sung-poblete-phd-rn-ceo-fare-release-2025-2030-dietary-guidelines-americans):
“Early introduction to prevent the development of food allergy has been
a FARE priority for years. We applaud the recognition of evidence-based
science that broadens the infant feeding recommendation to reduce food
allergy beyond peanut as recommended in the 2020-2025 DGA. It is
critical that this recommendation be acted upon quickly by health
professionals and federal agencies—every month that passes without broad
adoption of early introduction means infants will continue to develop
food allergy and potentially bear that burden for a lifetime. With this
new recommendation, we urge quick action to reduce food allergy within
the next generation.”

[Global Wellness Forum Chairman Sayer
Ji](https://x.com/sayerjigmi/status/2008967318487859676?s=20): “For too
long, our food pyramid and health policies have fueled—not fixed—the
chronic disease epidemic. A science-based, food-first nutritional
framework incorporating ancestral foods has the potential to
dramatically reduce diabetes, heart disease, autoimmune conditions, and
more, while restoring metabolic and immune resilience at scale. This
shift is nothing short of revolutionary. Gratitude to everyone in the
MAHA movement for helping move this long-suppressed truth into the
public conversation. When nutrition aligns with biology, healing becomes
possible again.”

[GoTowardHealth Chief Medical Officer Dr. Tro
Kalayjian](https://x.com/DoctorTro/status/2008941203409305909): “Finally
the Food Pyramid we deserve! Retweet if you are excited about our NEW
dietary guidelines”

[Independent Medical Alliance President and Chief Medical Officer Dr.
Joseph
Varon](https://imahealth.org/independent-doctors-praise-new-dietary-guidelines/):
“The new guidelines’ emphasis on nutrient-dense whole foods,
high-quality proteins, healthy fats, and strict limits on added sugars
represents a science-backed approach that prioritizes real nourishment
over processed alternatives. As we enter the new year, HHS and USDA are
providing Americans with science-backed, holistic food guidelines that
can truly transform health outcomes in 2026 and beyond. We expect
lasting positive impacts for generations to come.”

[Independent Women Senior Fellow for Health Policy Dr. Monique
Yohanan](https://www.independentwomen.com/2026/01/07/new-dietary-guidelines-mark-a-crucial-move-to-restore-common-sense-to-federal-health-recommendations/):
“Our food has been making us sick. Dietary guidelines that emphasize
real food, limiting sugar, and avoiding ultra-processed products are a
welcome correction.”

[International Dairy Foods Association President and CEO Michael Dykes,
DVM](https://www.idfa.org/news/new-dietary-guidelines-affirm-dairys-central-role-in-a-healthy-diet-and-recommend-dairy-products-at-all-healthy-fat-levels):
“The new Dietary Guidelines send a clear and powerful message to
Americans: dairy foods belong at the center of a healthy diet. IDFA
applauds HHS and USDA for grounding the 2025–2030 DGA in today’s
nutrition science, including the evidence showing that dairy products at
all fat levels support healthy eating patterns. Recommending the
consumption of whole and full-fat dairy products such as whole milk,
yogurt, cheese, and other dairy products is an important victory for
consumer choice and public health. Americans can now enjoy the wholesome
dairy foods that work for their cultural, dietary and lifestyle
preferences knowing that they are benefitting from dairy’s unique
nutrient profile.”

[International Fresh Produce Association Vice President of Nutrition and
Health Mollie Van
Lieu](https://www.freshproduce.com/who-we-are/press-center/2026/critical-role-of-fruits-and-vegetables-in-dietary-guidelines-for-americans/):
“Today’s Dietary Guidelines reinforce the critical role fruits and
vegetables play in overall health. Scientific evidence consistently
shows that fruits and vegetables should make up the majority of what
people eat. The Administration’s focus on whole foods is an opportunity
to increase fruit and vegetable intake, as they are the most
nutrient-dense foods available.”

[Johns Hopkins Medicine Cardiologist Dr. Joseph
Marine](https://x.com/DrJMarine/status/2008943903227990226): “Impressive
roll-out of what looks to be historic change in US dietary guidelines.
Look forward to digging into the details. I like the simple message: Eat
Real Food Don’t Eat Highly Addictive Toxic Poison…”

[Lifeway Foods President and CEO Julie
Smolyansky](https://www.foodbev.com/news/whole-foods-protein-dairy-and-fat-back-in-favour-under-new-us-guidance#:~:text=%22For%20decades%2C%20Lifeway,the%20American%20diet.%22):
“For decades, Lifeway has championed what these guidelines now affirm:
that real, minimally processed foods with protein, healthy fats and
fermentation are foundational to human health. Seeing kefir recognised
for gut health validates our mission and reinforces why fermented dairy
belongs at the centre of the American diet.”

[Meat Institute President and CEO Julie Anna
Potts](https://www.meatinstitute.org/press/recommend-prioritizing-protein-nutrient-dense-meat-poultry):
“We are pleased the Dietary Guidelines recommend Americans prioritize
protein and that families can get that protein from nutrient dense meat
and poultry. Secretary Rollins and Secretary Kennedy’s leadership have
simplified the Dietary Guidelines making it clear that meat is a protein
powerhouse which plays a vital role in healthy diets. Robust scientific
evidence demonstrates that meat is a rich source of high-quality
protein, essential vitamins, and highly bioavailable minerals that
support human health throughout the lifespan.”

[National Association of County and City Health Officials CEO Lori
Tremmel
Freeman](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/07/health/dietary-guidelines-rfk-maha?Date=20260107&Profile=cnnbrk&utm_content=1767803186&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20primary%20benefit,avoid%20chronic%20conditions.%E2%80%9D):
“We have an obesity epidemic in this country that is causing chronic
disease extensively…Diet and exercise guidelines help us get people
focused on how to stay healthy and avoid chronic conditions. Revisions
to dietary guidelines and a review of them are certainly always welcomed
by the public health and broader health community, especially when
things haven’t been looked at for some time or there’s new or evolving
data.”

[National Association of Wine Retailers President Dave
Parker](https://nawr.org/press-releases/u-s-wine-retailers-statement-dietary-guidelines/):
“Americans deserve a balanced and unbiased approach to recommendations
on alcohol consumption and this is exactly what we got today from the
new Dietary Guidelines. Moderate consumption has long been the
foundation of the proper relationship with alcohol, and we are very
pleased to see that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did
not succumb to the call by extremist anti-alcohol groups to throw the
idea of moderate consumption under the bus.”

[National Cattlemen’s Beef Association Vice President Kim
Brackett](https://www.ncba.org/news-media/news/details/46309/new-dietary-guidelines-emphasize-beefs-place-in-a-healthy-diet):
“As a mom, I understand the importance of eating nutritious wholesome
protein and as a rancher, I see the hard work that goes into providing
the best possible food for our communities. The updated and simplified
Dietary Guidelines will help more families like mine learn the facts
about beef’s nutritional value and make the best decisions when they’re
shopping for a nutrient-rich, whole, and delicious protein. Beef
provides high amounts of protein plus nine other essential nutrients
like iron and B vitamins, and gold-standard clinical studies have
consistently shown that it is easy to incorporate beef into a balanced,
heart-healthy diet. We appreciate Secretary Rollins and Secretary
Kennedy underlining the role of beef as an important part of a healthy
diet.”

[National Confectioners
Association](https://candyusa.com/news/nca-statement-on-2025-2030-dietary-guidelines-for-americans/):
“We support and value the role of the Dietary Guidelines in promoting
balanced nutrition. The Dietary Guidelines have consistently reinforced
for consumers what they already know about chocolate and candy – that
they are treats, and not meal replacements – and this latest iteration
reflects that same notion. American consumers have a unique mindset when
they enjoy chocolate and candy that is not present when interacting with
other foods. People in the U.S. enjoy chocolate and candy 2-3 times per
week, averaging just 40 calories per day and about one teaspoon of added
sugar per day. To help consumers choose the right treat for any
occasion, chocolate and candy companies are offering more variety in
pack sizes and portion options than ever before – all while reminding
consumers that candy is a treat and not a center-of-the-plate food.”

[National Chicken Council Senior Vice President of Scientific and
Regulatory Affairs Ashley Peterson,
PhD](https://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/new-dietary-guidelines-reaffirm-chickens-role-in-a-healthy-diet/):
“It’s abundantly clear that chicken is a lean and affordable protein
that can help all Americans across all stages of life meet the new
dietary guidelines. I want to thank President Trump, and Secretaries
Rollins and Kennedy for their leadership in the formulation of the new
guidelines. We’re pleased the administration took a science-based and
common-sense approach to healthy eating and rejected recommendations put
forth by the previous Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) that
emphasized plant-based proteins over lean meats like chicken, as
evidenced in the new Food Pyramid.”

[National Fisheries Institute
(NFI)](https://aboutseafood.com/news/national-fisheries-institute-welcomes-release-of-2025-2030-dietary-guidelines-for-americans/):
“Seafood is a whole-food source of both key nutrients the new Guidelines
encourage Americans to prioritize, protein and healthy fats,
specifically omega-3s. NFI supports the Guidelines’ user-friendly
format, which aims to deliver concise messaging that can help Americans
understand the benefits of eating a seafood-rich diet. The new
Guidelines recommend early introduction of seafood at six months and
ongoing consumption across the lifespan.  Seafood is especially
important during rapid growth periods like adolescence, pregnancy, and
breastfeeding. Seafood naturally fits within the simple, overarching
message of the Guidelines, “Eat Real Food.”  All forms of whole
seafood—including fresh, frozen, and canned—count and work together to
make a healthy diet affordable and accessible to American families.”

[National Milk Producers Federation President and CEO Gregg
Doud](https://www.nmpf.org/nmpf-statement-on-the-2025-2030-dietary-guidelines-for-americans/):
“NMPF thanks HHS and USDA for recognizing dairy’s critical role in a
healthy diet in the new Dietary Guidelines for Americans, as shown by
its continued recommendation of three servings of dairy for Americans,
its recognition of dairy’s benefits at all fat levels, and dairy’s
prominence in diverse diets. We are proud to benefit American health in
fundamental ways, and we welcome the potential these guidelines hold for
expanding upon dairy’s critical role in the diet. As also shown in the
scientific report that preceded today’s guidelines, reducing or
eliminating dairy from the diet leads to undernourishment in key
nutrients for millions of Americans. These guidelines encourage
consumption of dairy nutrients critical to human health. Meanwhile, not
all fats are created equal, and because the guidelines acknowledge this,
dairy’s benefits are better reflected in this iteration of the
guidelines.”

[National Pork Producers Council President-elect Rob
Brenneman](https://nppc.org/news/u-s-pork-producers-pleased-new-dietary-guidelines-put-pork-front-and-center-on-plate/):
“America’s pork producers appreciate the 2025 Dietary Guidelines putting
pork front and center on the plate. They took note of producer concerns
and rightly gave pork and other high-protein, nutrient-dense, and
delicious meats their due when it comes to Americans’ health and dietary
habits.”

[National Turkey Federation President and CEO Leslee
Oden](https://www.eatturkey.org/2026/01/07/national-turkey-foundation-applauds-release-of-2025-2030-dietary-guidelines-for-americans/):
“The National Turkey Federation (NTF) applauds the work of USDA and HHS
in developing the 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) and
their shared commitment to improving the health and well-being of all
Americans. The DGA’s emphasis on animal protein as a cornerstone of
healthy, balanced dietary patterns aligns with our shared goal of
helping American families thrive through practical, affordable and
accessible nutrition guidance.”

[Natural Products
Association](https://www.npanational.org/news/statement-from-the-natural-products-association-on-the-release-of-the-revised-dietary-guidelines-for-americans/):
“The release of the revised Dietary Guidelines for Americans is an
important milestone in federal nutrition policy and will shape health
programs, consumer behavior and regulatory priorities for years to come.
The Natural Products Association welcomes the Guidelines’ emphasis on
nutrient-dense diets and improved overall diet quality. However, as
policymakers and health professionals consider how Americans can
realistically meet these recommendations, it is critical to acknowledge
a longstanding reality. Millions of Americans fail to obtain adequate
intake of key vitamins, minerals and other essential nutrients solely
from food.”

[North American Blueberry Council President Kasey
Cronquist](https://nabc.blueberry.org/newsroom/nabc-supports-emphasis-on-whole-foods-in-new-u-s-dietary-guidelines/):
“The North American Blueberry Council welcomes the newly released 2025
Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which emphasize eating whole foods,
such as blueberries – fresh, frozen and dried. The Dietary Guidelines
play a critical role in shaping dietary choices and supporting the
shared goal of making America healthy again by helping ensure that all
Americans, including those participating in federal nutrition programs,
are eating high-quality, nutrient-dense foods like blueberries.”

[PhRMA Chief Medical Officer Dr. Mike
Ybarra](https://x.com/mybarra/status/2008995505456689515?s=20): “In the
ER, I see what poor nutrition does to real people… heart disease,
diabetes, kidney failure. Thoughtful, evidence-based dietary guidelines
can be one of our strongest tools to improve health across the country.”

[Plant Based Food Association Executive Director Marjorie
Mulhall](https://plantbasedfoods.org/latest/pbfa-responds-to-2025-2030-dietary-guidelines):
“U.S. plant-based food companies are dedicated to providing delicious,
nutrient-dense products that help Americans meet their dietary needs and
preferences. We are glad to see the updated Dietary Guidelines recommend
that plant-based proteins be prioritized as part of a healthy diet.”

[Plant Based Foods Institute Executive Director Sanah
Baig](https://plantbasedfoods.org/latest/pbfa-responds-to-2025-2030-dietary-guidelines#:~:text=%E2%80%9CStronger%20plant%2Dforward,in%20rural%20communities.%20%E2%80%9D):
“Stronger plant-forward guidance could advance public health while also
serving as an economic opportunity for U.S. agriculture. Increased
recognition of the important role plant-based protein- and fiber-rich
foods have in our diets can help growers expand their farming
operations, build durable markets for American-grown pulses and other
crops, and keep more food dollars circulating in rural communities.”

[Science Over Bias](https://www.scienceoverbias.com/joint-statement):
“The Dietary Guidelines’ longstanding, overarching advice is that if
alcohol is consumed, it should be done in moderation. These updated
guidelines, underpinned by the preponderance of scientific evidence,
reaffirm this important guidance.”

[Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council President and CEO Karen
Kerrigan](https://sbecouncil.org/2026/01/07/statement-on-the-trump-administrations-new-dietary-guidelines-for-americans/):
“The new dietary guidelines unveiled by the Trump Administration provide
timely and valuable guidance to the millions of Americans who resolved
to prioritize their health and wellness in 2026, and the millions of
others who are on the journey to improved health through lifestyle
changes. The simple message to ‘eat real foods’ along with
straightforward and flexible guidance will save and improve lives. The
impact on the health and wellbeing of young people in terms of promoting
nutrient-dense foods has the potential be transformative.”

[Stanford University School of Medicine Huberman Lab Director Andrew D.
Huberman,
PhD](https://x.com/hubermanlab/status/2008952938786640223?s=20):
“Oatmeal (and I think that’s rice and sourdough) made the cut! In all
seriousness, assuming overall calories are kept in check and people
exercise & get sun(day)light, this looks spot on.”

[Texas & Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association President Carl Ray Polk
Jr.](https://tscra.org/cattle-raisers-applaud-new-dietary-guidelines-for-americans/):
“Texas & Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association applauds the Trump
Administration for encouraging Americans to prioritize protein with
every meal. Cattle Raisers will continue to produce a highly nutritious
protein, ensuring consumers have access to safe, affordable and
wholesome beef. Beef provides essential nutrients that support healthy
growth and development, and we appreciate dietary guidelines that are
grounded in sound science, recognizing the important role animal
agriculture plays in nourishing families across our nation.”

“The Brewers Association supports moderation and responsible
consumption, ideas that are reflected in the new dietary guidelines.
Beer, when enjoyed responsibly, remains the beverage of moderation and a
valued part of many people’s balanced lifestyle.”

Krystal
Register](https://www.fmi.org/newsroom/latest-news/view/2026/01/07/fmi-statement-on-dietary-guidelines-for-americans):
“FMI welcomes the release of the updated Dietary Guidelines for
Americans as they are intended to provide science-based advice and daily
recommendations on food groups and nutrients to encourage and those to
limit – all in an effort to support healthy and balanced eating
patterns. Fortunately, every day, America’s food producers,
manufacturers and retailers provide the choice and variety needed to
accomplish this goal.”

Mozaffarian](https://www.npr.org/2026/01/07/nx-s1-5667021/dietary-guidelines-rfk-jr-nutrition):
“Highly processed foods are clearly harmful for a range of diseases, so
to have the U.S. government recommend that a wide class of foods be
eaten less because of their processing is a big deal and I think a very
positive move for public health…”

[United Egg Producers President and CEO Chad
Gregory](https://www.wattagnet.com/business-markets/policy-legislation/news/15801388/new-us-dietary-guidelines-prioritize-protein-at-every-meal):
“America’s egg farmers are proud to produce eggs – a healthy, natural
food with high-quality protein and essential nutrients. The Dietary
Guidelines for Americans are important, and we appreciate the
recognition of the value of eggs in the 2026 guidelines, which make both
whole foods and protein a priority. One egg alone has six grams of
protein, and the protein quality of an egg is so high, that eggs are
often used as the standard for measuring the protein value of other
foods. U.S. egg producers are grateful for the continued support of the
egg industry by USDA, HHS and the administration.”

“The new dietary guidelines clearly affirm the essential role of beans,
peas, lentils, and chickpeas in improving the diets of American
families. Pulses are nutritional powerhouses that serve double duty as
both a protein and vegetable source. The new guidelines’ emphasis on
increasing protein and nutrients like fiber makes beans, peas, lentils,
and chickpeas the perfect choice for families looking to improve their
health. We commend USDA and HHS for recognizing the nutritional
strengths of pulses and we look forward to working with them to ensure
these American-grown foods make it onto more plates.”

[Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee

dietary guidelines are out with an emphasis on real food to include more
red meat, milk and eggs with an emphasis on more protein and less
refined grain and sugar! Well done @SecRollins @SecKennedy”

[“The Keto Reset Diet” author Mark

“This is big. Back when we all started with this Primal/paleo/real food
stuff 20 years ago, did you ever think you’d see these words and phrases
and recommendations in the USDA dietary guidelines? “Nutrient-dense”
“Healthy fats from whole foods… eggs, seafood, meats, full-fat dairy…”
“1.2-1.6 grams per kg” of protein “Colorful” fruits and vegetables
“traditionally prepared” grains… “oats, rice, and sourdough preferred”
They even cut way back on grains. 2-4 servings of whole grains down from
8-11 in the old guidelines. There’s no mention of seed/vegetable oils,
but the implication is that they should be avoided. These are big wins.”

is incredible. This is \#foodforhumans … Red meat, animal foods,
saturated fat – these are not to be feared. So stoked to see the
guidelines reflecting this! Bravo.”
