title: Big Wins for American Families as Gas Prices, Mortgage Rates Plummet
---
 
**As 2026 begins, President Donald J. Trump’s America First agenda is
making more progress delivering real, tangible relief to American
families, with gas prices falling to their lowest levels in five years
and mortgage rates dropping sharply.** These declines — driven by the
Trump Administration’s relentless pursuit of energy dominance and
housing affordability — are putting money back in Americans’ pockets and
making the American Dream more attainable than ever.

### **Gas drops its lowest price in years — again.**

Gas prices have hit their
[lowest](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/4414350/gas-prices-national-average-falls-to-2-79-per-gallon-for-first-time-in-nearly-five-years/)
levels [since
2021](https://gasprices.aaa.com/stable-national-average-to-start-the-year-lowest-since-2021/),
with the national average declining for the [seventh straight
week](https://x.com/GasBuddyGuy/status/2010718948246073506). According
to
[GasBuddy](https://www.gasbuddy.com/go/average-gas-prices-fade-for-7th-straight-week-but-is-the-end-in-sight),
the [average
price](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2010715755130589630) for
regular gas is below $3 per gallon in 43 states, below $2.75 per gallon
in 30 states, and at or below $2.50 per gallon in 17 states. In fact,
Americans can even find gas below $2 per gallon at certain stations in
at least [19 states](https://www.gasbuddy.com/gasprices).

This relief is putting real money back in Americans’ pockets: motorists

### **Mortgage rates fall sharply to three-year lows.**

The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage
[dipped](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/real-estate/30-year-mortgage-rates-below-6-percent-rcna253218)
to its lowest in nearly three years —

more than 1% in the past year — driving Americans’ monthly housing
payments to their
[lowest](https://www.redfin.com/news/housing-market-update-housing-payments-lowest-level-2-years/)
point in over two years. Rents have
[declined](https://www.apartmentlist.com/research/national-rent-data)
for five straight months, providing needed relief for American families.

The progress stems directly from President Trump’s aggressive
[agenda](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-housing-plan-could-bring-big-win-americans-pulte-says)
to restore the American Dream of homeownership — including
[directing](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115861588073149023)
the purchase of $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities through
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to push borrowing costs lower and taking
[action](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115855059527504524)
to ban large institutional investors from buying up single-family homes,
ensuring more properties remain available for everyday Americans.
