title: "Iowa Families Are Winning Again Under President Trump\u2019s Leadership"
---
 
**As President Donald J. Trump visits Iowa today, he returns to a state
that is clearly winning again under his leadership — even as work
remains to fully reverse the economic damage of the Biden years.**
President Trump will not rest until every American is better off than
ever before, yet meaningful relief is already reaching Iowans through
sharply lower gas prices, robust economic growth, improving home
affordability, tax savings, and policies that put working families
first.

### **Iowans are clearly better off under President Trump and Republican leadership:**

-   Iowa’s average gas price stands at [$2.56 per
    gallon](https://www.gasbuddy.com/usa), with [some
    stations](https://www.gasbuddy.com/gasprices/iowa) even offering gas
    under $2 per gallon — down 46% from its [record
    Biden-era high](https://gasprices.aaa.com/?state=IA).
    -   Diesel prices have also dropped sharply, down 37% from their
        [record Biden-era high](https://gasprices.aaa.com/?state=IA).

    -   Midwestern gas prices remain at their
        [lowest](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GASREGMWW) since
        early 2021.
-   Iowa’s economy is roaring ahead, with [strong GDP
    growth](https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gdp-state) outpacing the
    national average, fueled by agriculture, manufacturing, and smart
    policies.
-   The average Iowa family is [saving
    $3,139](https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/federal/obbba-average-tax-cuts-impact-map/)
    on taxes this year thanks to President Trump’s landmark Working
    Families Tax Cuts.
    -   Iowans stand to see wages rise by [up to
        $6,100](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Michigan-WH-OBBB-Savings-by-State.pdf)
        per person over the next several years.

    <!-- -->

    -   [66,000 Iowa
        jobs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Iowa-WH-OBBB-Savings-by-State.pdf)
        will be protected in the coming years under these tax reforms.

    <!-- -->

    -   Iowa is receiving an investment of [more than $209
        million](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/12/all-50-states-will-receive-historic-funding-from-trump-administration-to-strengthen-rural-health-care/)
        in rural health care thanks to Republicans — strengthening
        communities across the state.
-   Home affordability is improving, with the median price of an Iowa
    home [down 3.5%](https://www.realtor.com/local/market/iowa) from
    last year — and trending lower.
-   Iowa [ranks](https://www.eia.gov/states/IA/overview) among the top
    10 for the lowest average electricity prices nationwide, delivering
    reliable, affordable power to homes and businesses.
-   Iowa proudly remains the [nation’s top
    producer](https://www.eia.gov/states/IA/overview) of ethanol and
    biodiesel, benefiting from energy policies that support farmers and
    keep costs down.

### **The Trump Administration is also delivering for Iowa homeowners — putting vital tools to work after previous administrations ignored their potential. Over the past year:**

-   Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have empowered over 22,000 Iowa families
    to purchase or refinance their homes.
-   The Trump Administration has delivered more than $5.3 billion in
    mortgages through Fannie and Freddie, directly supporting these
    22,000 Iowan families in achieving or maintaining homeownership.
-   More than 55% of all first-time homebuyers in Iowa have relied on
    Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac financing.
-   Nearly 3,000 Iowa families have received critical mortgage
    assistance from Fannie and Freddie to stay in their homes amid
    recovery from Biden-era challenges.
-   Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have invested nearly $11 million in Iowa
    to rehabilitate and repair post-foreclosure properties, making them
    ready for new buyers and boosting local neighborhoods.
-   In the Des Moines area — including around today’s rally site in
    Clive — Fannie Mae has helped nearly 3,700 families purchase or
    refinance homes, driving affordability right where Iowans live and
    work.

**The proof is in the results: Lower costs, rising wages, protected
jobs, and renewed strength mean Iowa families are winning again under
President Trump — and the best is yet to come.** Strong Republican
leadership is delivering a brighter, more prosperous future, and today’s
visit drives that message home loud and clear.
