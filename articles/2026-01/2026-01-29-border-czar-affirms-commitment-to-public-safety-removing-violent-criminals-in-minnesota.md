title: Border Czar Affirms Commitment to Public Safety, Removing Violent Criminals
  in Minnesota
---
 
**This morning, White House Border Czar Tom Homan held a** [**press
conference**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2016887767372800139)
**in Minneapolis to deliver a clear update on the ongoing immigration
enforcement operations in the state.** These targeted operations
continue to remove the [worst of the
worst](https://www.dhs.gov/wow?combine=&field_country_of_origin_target_id=All&field_state_value=Minnesota)
illegal alien killers, rapists, gang members, and other violent
criminals from the streets of our cities, fulfilling President Donald J.
Trump’s commitment to public safety and the rule of law.

Following productive discussions with state and local leaders, Mr. Homan
highlighted significant progress in keeping these operations as
efficient, professional, and targeted as possible while charting a clear
path forward as cooperation grows — ensuring safer communities for all
involved.

**Here’s what you missed:**

-   “I’ve met with Governor Walz, Attorney General Ellison, Mayor Frey,
    numerous police chiefs and sheriffs… One thing we all agreed on was
    U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is a legitimate law
    enforcement agency that has a duty to enforce the laws enacted by
    Congress and keep this community safe.”

-   “What we’ve been working on is making this operation safer, more
    efficient, by the book. The mission is going to improve because of
    the changes we’re making internally.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2016868643817054618))
-   “The prioritization \[is\] going to be criminal aliens, public
    safety threats, and national security threats… \[But\] if you’re in
    the country illegally, you’re never off the table.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2016874941958742232))
-   “I want to be clear… We are NOT surrendering the President’s mission
    on immigration enforcement.”

-   “About the organization and the funding of the attacks on ICE…
    They’ll be held accountable. Justice is coming.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2016874164083175687))
-   “\[Attorney General Ellison\] clarified for me that county jails may
    notify ICE of the release dates of criminal public safety risks so
    ICE can take custody of them upon their release from the jail… It’s
    safer for the community, it’s safer for the agent, and it’s safer
    for the alien.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2016869621257646195))
-   “My main focus now is draw-down based upon the great conversations
    I’ve had with your state and local leaders. Again, I’m not a fool;
    I’m not walking away without seeing this put in place, but I take
    the word of the people that I met with.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2016874665851936975))
-   “One of the words \[President Trump\] said to me when I came up here
    — he didn’t want to see anybody die… I don’t want to see anybody die
    — even the people we’re looking for… I think my conversations the
    last two and a half days are leading us to a safer community.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2016876185486020871))
-   “The reason for the massive deployment is because of the threats,
    because of the violence… We brought extra resources in to provide
    that security… When the violence decreases, we can drive down those
    resources.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2016872709121049056))
-   “ICE and CBP officers are performing their duties in a challenging
    environment under tremendous circumstances, but they’re trying to do
    it professionally… These men and women that carry that badge and gun
    are American patriots. They put themselves on the line for this
    nation every day. I want you to remember they don’t hang their heart
    on a hook every day to come to work. They’re mothers and fathers,
    too. They’re sons and daughters, too — and if they’ve seen a
    fraction of the tragedies I’ve seen in my career, they take a lot of
    damage home every day.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2016871333850657125))
-   “Under the President’s leadership, we have the most secure border in
    the history of this nation — which means less woman are being raped,
    less children are dying crossing that border, less fentanyl is
    getting into this country to kill Americans.”
