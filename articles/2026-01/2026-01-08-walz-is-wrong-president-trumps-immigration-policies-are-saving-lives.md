title: "Walz Is Wrong: President Trump\u2019s Immigration Policies Are Saving Lives"
---
 
**What exactly does Tim Walz find so objectionable about enforcing our
nation’s immigration laws?** In his pathetic, inflammatory press
conference today, Walz bizarrely
[claimed](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2009322756698251394)
“there is no verifiable evidence” that President Donald J. Trump’s
immigration enforcement operations are “making America safer.”

**Radical Left lunatics like Walz, blinded by their deep delusions and
seething hatred for President Trump, have become completely untethered
from reality — ignoring the indisputable evidence that President Trump’s
immigration policies are literally saving lives:**

-   The nation likely
    [saw](https://www.axios.com/2025/12/24/us-trump-murder-data-killing-crime-national-guard)
    the largest-ever one-year drop in homicides in 2025 — with

    where the Trump Administration
    [undertook](https://www.heritage.org/crime-and-justice/commentary/trumps-dc-crime-success-puts-spotlight-chicagos-deadly-war-zone)
    targeted immigration enforcement and crime prevention operations.
    -   For example, a single immigration enforcement operation in
        Florida

    by nearly 15% in 2025, reflecting the real-world impact of President
    Trump’s approach on everyday Americans’ lives.

It is an indisputable fact that President Trump’s immigration policies
are saving American citizens from being killed, raped, and assaulted at
the hands of
[criminal](https://x.com/AliBradleyTV/status/2009329151790972931)
illegal aliens with no right to be here.

**If Walz and Democrats find that troublesome, it only further exposes
their disturbing priorities — putting criminals ahead of Americans.**
