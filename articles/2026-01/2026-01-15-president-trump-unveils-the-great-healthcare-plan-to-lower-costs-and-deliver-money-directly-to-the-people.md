title: President Trump Unveils The Great Healthcare Plan to Lower Costs and Deliver
  Money Directly to the People
---
 
President Donald J. Trump’s Great Healthcare Plan is a broad healthcare
initiative that will slash prescription drug prices, reduce insurance
premiums, hold big insurance companies accountable, and maximize price
transparency in the American healthcare system.

This plan will deliver money directly to the American people, not
insurance companies, big pharma and special interest groups—putting
patients over industry leaders’ profits, just as he promised. The Great
Healthcare Plan also builds on the successes of his first term by
promoting competition, eliminating wasteful spending, and putting
consumers back in control.

**President Trump [Announces](http://greathealthcare.gov)** **The Great
Healthcare Plan:**

-   “I am thrilled to announce my plan to lower healthcare prices for
    all Americans and truly make healthcare affordable again—we’re doing
    things that nobody’s ever been able to do, we’re calling it The
    Great Healthcare Plan.”
-   “Instead of putting the needs of big corporations and special
    interests first **our plan finally puts you first and puts more
    money in your pocket**.”
-   “The government is going to pay the money **directly to you**. It
    goes to you, and then you take the money and buy your own
    healthcare… **the big insurance companies lose and the people of our
    country win.**”
-   “This proposal locks in the massive discount on prescription drugs
    that my administration is achieving through our
    **most-favored-nations drug pricing** agreement… It’ll bring down
    drug prices 80, 90% in some cases, just numbers that nobody’s ever
    heard of before.”
-   “**Your prescription drugs will come way, way down** and, under this
    policy, the prices of many drugs will be slashed by 300, 400 even
    500% starting this month at the *Trumprx.gov*.”
-   “So **instead of Americans paying the highest drug prices in the
    world, which we have for decades, we will now be paying the lowest
    cost paid by any other nation**… that’s what we’re going to pay, and
    the American people will get the savings.”
-   “I have to reiterate, **the lowest price in the world is what you’re
    going to pay**, before you were paying the highest price in the
    world by far and the politicians did nothing about it, so I’m asking
    Congress to complete the work that we’ve started.”
-   “My plan would reduce your insurance premiums by **stopping
    government payoffs to big insurance companies and sending that money
    directly to the people**.”
-   “**Obamacare was designed to make insurance companies rich. I call
    it the UNAFFORDABLE Care Act**, with billions of dollars and
    taxpayer subsidies that help their stock prices skyrocket over
    1,700% as you paid more money for healthcare every single year—more
    and more the premiums went higher and higher.”
-   “I want to **end this flagrant scam and put extra money straight
    into the healthcare savings account in your name**, and you go out
    and buy your own healthcare, and you’ll make a great deal, **you’ll
    get better healthcare for less money**—that way you can choose the
    care that is right for your family.”
-   “To further reduce insurance premiums, **my plan ends the giant
    kickbacks to insurance brokers and corporate middleman that only
    drive up the costs…**”
-   “It fully funds a long-neglected part of the law known as **the Cost
    Sharing Reduction program.** This measure alone should **cut
    premiums** on the most popular Obamacare plans—it’s hard to believe
    there are any because it’s a hated program, it’s unaffordable—but
    it’s going to cut them **by an average of 10 to 15%**.”
-   “The Great Healthcare Plan… **It’s great healthcare at a lower
    price**, mandates **unprecedented accountability and transparency
    from insurance companies** and all healthcare providers so that
    **special interests can no longer profiteer at your expense**.”
-   “As the saying goes, sunlight is the best disinfectant, that is why
    my plan orders all the insurance companies to publish rate and
    coverage comparisons in very plain English.”
-   “It **requires insurers to publish detailed information about how
    much of your money they’re going to be paying out in claims versus
    how much they are taking in in profits**… It forces them to release
    detailed data on how many claims are being denied and whether those
    denials are eventually overturned on appeal.”
-   “Most importantly, it will require **any hospital or insurer who
    accepts Medicare or Medicaid to prominently post all prices of their
    place of business so that you are never surprised, and you can
    easily shop for a better deal or better care**—and you’re going to
    end up doing both, **you’re going to get a better deal and better
    care**.”
-   “We will have maximum price transparency and costs will come down
    incredibly. **I’m calling on Congress to pass this framework into
    law without delay—we have to do it right now so that we can get
    immediate relief to the American people, the people I love.**”

By implementing these measures, The Great Healthcare Plan will deliver
immediate relief to millions of Americans struggling with high
healthcare costs due to Democrats’ Unaffordable Care Act.
