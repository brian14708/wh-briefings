### **President Trump heralded the economic revival after one year back in office**.

-   “After less than 12 months in office, I’m back in Michigan to report
    to you on the strongest and fastest economic turnaround in our
    country’s history.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2011153739600871667?s=20))
-   “Biden gave us a colossal stagflation catastrophe, but my
    Administration has rapidly and very decisively ended that. We have
    quickly achieved the exact opposite of stagflation — almost no
    inflation and super high growth.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2011155553222087105?s=20))
-   “After real wages plummeted by $3,000 under Sleepy Joe Biden, real
    wages are up by $1,300 in less than one year under President Trump.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2011160963127693631?s=20))
-   “We have gas stations in the Detroit area where you can fill up for
    less than $2.30 a gallon — whereas two years ago, it was $4.50.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2011161701694259213?s=20))
-   “The stock market is now the highest in history… boosting 401(k)s
    and retirement accounts for millions and millions of Americans.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2011156862780272924?s=20))
-   “The Trump Tariffs have delivered us trillions of dollars of new
    investment… They brought hundreds of billions of dollars pouring
    into the United States Treasury, helped curb inflation, and helped
    cut the federal budget deficit by a staggering 27%.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2011158176746606625?s=20))
-   “Under Biden, we had the highest trade deficit ever recorded —
    losing more than $1 trillion every single year… We’ve slashed that
    gaping trade deficit by, in a short period of time, 62%.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2011158245554204977?s=20))
-   “Just as I promised you, I’ve imposed a 25% tariff on all foreign
    automobiles… U.S. auto factories are now seeing more than $70
    billion of new investment.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2011159094997237886?s=20))

### **President Trump laid out bold new plans to ensure all Americans feel the benefits of the Trump Economy**.

-   “Next week, I’m going to provide much more detail about our housing
    policies so that every American who wants to own a home will be able
    to afford one… This will include a ban on large institutional
    investors buying up single-family homes all over the country… I’ve
    also announced that the U.S. government is purchasing $200 billion
    dollars of mortgage bonds to bring down mortgage
    rates.” ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2011162344123236488?s=20))
-   “I proudly called for credit card companies to cap interest rates at
    10% for one year because they’re getting 28% and 30% and 30% — and
    it’s unfair. The rates are way too high.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2011162957653344596?s=20))
-   “To provide further relief to hardworking Americans, we will also be
    confronting one of the biggest factors in driving up prices — the
    monstrosity known as the Unaffordable Care Act… Later this week,
    I’ll announce our healthcare affordability framework that will
    reduce premiums for millions.”

positive impact of President Trump’s agenda:**

-   [Ford CEO Jim
    Farley](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2011146033162813763?s=20):
    “We’re adding a combustion truck, an affordable one, in Tennessee…
    That’s what these policies are doing for Ford. We’re going to
    actually expand one of our existing plants and make a different kind
    of truck there.”
-   [Ford Executive Chairman Bill
    Ford](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2011144770005995704?s=20):
    “We have a great relationship with the President and his whole
    staff. They’ve been great to work with for us. He, personally, is
    incredibly responsive every time we need something or call — and we
    very much appreciate it. We couldn’t be more excited. We’re adding
    market share. We’re growing as a company. We’re adding jobs…”

### **President Trump addressed the Minnesota Somali Fraud Scandal**.

-   “Another urgent priority for bringing down the cost of living is to
    stop the colossal fraud that is bleeding American taxpayers
    absolutely dry… Our country has been losing over half a trillion
    dollars to fraud every single year, but those days are over.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2011165014506491949?s=20))
-   “I’m creating a brand-new division at the Department of Justice — a
    legal strike force led by a really tough, smart, new \[assistant\]
    attorney general for fraud… We intend to imprison any fraudster,
    politician, or public official involved in these sick plots to loot
    and pillage our country.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2011166251184521466?s=20))
-   “We’re also going to revoke the citizenship of any naturalized
    immigrant — from Somalia or anywhere else — who is convicted of
    defrauding our citizens.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2011166681582989334?s=20))
-   “We’ve frozen all children’s payments to those states… We will now
    require proof of attendance in order to receive federal funding for
    childcare… Additionally, from this moment forward, if you’re on
    public assistance, like almost all Somalis are… You can’t wire money
    out of the country back to your bank account from where you came.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2011165519131390348?s=20))
-   “Starting February 1, we’re not making any payments to ‘sanctuary’
    cities or states having ‘sanctuary’ cities because they do
    everything possible to protect criminals at the expense of American
    citizens — and it breeds fraud and crime and all of the other
    problems that come.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2011165934153843146?s=20))
-   “As we liberate our country from this cultural scourge and the
    plague of corruption and fraud, we’ll rediscover the natural energy
    and native spirit that truly makes America great
    again.” ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2011167131988378102?s=20))
