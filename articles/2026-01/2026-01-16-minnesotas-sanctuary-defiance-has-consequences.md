**As President Donald J. Trump delivers on the**
[**promise**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/07/president-trump-has-kept-his-promises-and-then-some/)
**that secured his overwhelming re-election, Minnesota’s “leaders” have
chosen defiance over partnership.** Instead of working with the Trump
Administration to uphold the law and protect public safety, the state’s
Democrat politicians have repeatedly boasted of their so-called
“sanctuary” status, encouraged resistance, and smeared ICE officers.

**This toxic combination of “sanctuary” policies and** [**anti-ICE
rhetoric**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2026/01/57-times-sick-unhinged-democrats-declared-war-on-law-enforcement/)**has
created a climate of hostility that

[violence](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2010165363070382171).**
Make no mistake: the responsibility for the enhanced enforcement
operations in Minnesota — and the tension and violence — lies squarely
with these officials who
[refuse](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2011897339217428608) to
partner with the Trump Administration and instead put their Radical Left
agenda over public safety and the rule of law.

**For years, the state’s Democrat politicians have bragged about being a
safe haven for criminal illegal alien thugs:**

-   [Minnesota Attorney General Keith
    Ellison](https://x.com/AGEllison/status/1883538826678997014): “There
    is nothing in American law that requires local officials to
    cooperate with federal law enforcement officials… We’re going to
    devote the resources of our state to our state business, not
    immigration business.”
    -   [Ellison](https://archive.ph/BEJjd#selection-575.0-575.108:~:text=%E2%80%9CMinnesota%20law%20enforcement%20agencies%20risk%20significant%20civil%20liability%20if%20they%20enforce%20immigration%20detainers%2C%E2%80%9D):
        “Minnesota law enforcement agencies risk significant civil
        liability if they enforce immigration detainers.”

    <!-- -->

    -   [Ellison](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2012187329692365264):
        “I’m one of them people who believes we should give our
        neighbors sanctuary and if you ask yourself, ‘What would I do if
        I was a Gentile in 1941 if my Jewish neighbors were under attack
        by the Nazis, would I give them sanctuary? You might be about to
        find out what you would do. Would you pass that moral test or
        would you fail it?’”
-   [Gov. Tim
    Walz](https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/jeff-johnson-tim-walz-minnesota-sanctuary-state/#:~:text=My%20position%20on,not%20do%20so.):
    “My position on Minnesota becoming a sanctuary state boils down to
    who has the responsibility for enforcing immigration laws… The role
    of law enforcement is to enforce state and local laws, not federal
    immigration laws, and I strongly believe that they should not do
    so.”
-   [Minneapolis Mayor Jacob
    Frey](https://x.com/AntGockowski/status/1884375273719636373): “I
    want to speak directly to people who are undocumented … In the city
    of Minneapolis, we will stand up for you and we will do anything in
    our power to help because you’re not an alien in our city … As for
    cooperation with ICE, the answer is no.”
    -   [Frey](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1902903998434210172):
        “Minneapolis will continue to be a safe haven for undocumented
        immigrants.”

        “In Minneapolis, we do not enforce federal immigration law
        because that’s not our job.”
-   [Rep. Ilhan
    Omar](https://x.com/Ilhan/status/1973128019809096097?s=20): “I stand
    with Minnesota officials who are defending our values and our
    immigrant neighbors against these unconstitutional attacks on
    sanctuary policies.”
    -   [Omar](https://x.com/Ilhan/status/1136037160300060672): “I will

    -   [Omar](https://x.com/IlhanMN/status/1238482953006731271): “We

    <!-- -->

    -   [Omar](https://x.com/IlhanMN/status/1149336016148471808): “If
        you are an undocumented immigrant, please know that you are in
        my thoughts and that I will keep fighting.”
-   [Minnesota State Sen. Omar
    Fateh](https://x.com/OmarFatehMN/status/1883941739519709604): “With
    President Trump’s immigration policies targeting sanctuary cities
    like Minneapolis, the fear of ICE raids is very real and our
    communities are on high alert… Minneapolis stands defiant and ready
    to protect our neighbors and loved ones.”
-   [Minneapolis City Council Member Jason
    Chavez](https://x.com/JChavezMpls/status/1881039222095913221): “In
    Minneapolis, we will not compromise on values of protecting our
    undocumented immigrants and we will not help with immigration
    enforcement. It’s not the city’s role to do the federal government’s
    inhumane work.”
-   [Minneapolis City Council Member Aisha
    Chughtai](https://x.com/aishaforward10/status/1873733878894199226):
    “\[T\]he City must be ready to act as the last line of defense for
    targeted communities.”
-   [Former Minneapolis City Council Member Jeremiah
    Ellison](https://www.instagram.com/efornorth/p/DHy3HhGs_el/):
    “\[I\]t’s clear that being a sanctuary city is not enough to protect
    our neighbors.”

    “The City of Saint Paul abides by its separation ordinance that
    makes clear local law enforcement officers are only to uphold local
    laws in the course of their duties, not federal immigration
    policies. SPPD cannot and does not cooperate with ICE.”
-   [Minneapolis Police Chief Brian
    O’Hara](https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/MPLS/2025/01/16/file_attachments/3135343/1-16-2025%20Minneapolis%20Police%20Update%20Policy%20to%20Provide%20Clear%20Guidance%20to%20Officers%20Regarding%20Authority%20in%20Immigration%20Matters.pdf):
