*Cartel Expert Becomes First Woman to Lead Nation’s Drug Control Policy*

Today, in a 52-48 vote, United States Senate confirmed Sara Carter as
the 10<sup>th</sup> Director of the White House Office of National Drug
Control Policy, a position also referred to as the “Drug Czar.” Director
Carter was nominated by President Trump to help lead the
administration’s fight against illicit drugs and the drug cartels.

A statement from Director Carter on her confirmation follows:

“I am honored and humbled to join President Trump’s Administration as
Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. As ONDCP
Director, I will work tirelessly to achieve a safe and healthy America,
where a drug-free life is the prevailing norm. This is a turning point
for our Nation. President Trump is putting the American people first.
Under his leadership, we will reassert our fundamental right to live
healthy lives. We will hold accountable the narco-terrorists who
infringe upon this right, participating in the deliberate poisoning of
tens of thousands of Americans each year. They will no longer kill our
families, friends, neighbors, and even children with impunity. At the
same time, I will ensure that every parent, family member, and child
have the resources they need to prevent and combat addiction. I will
stand with our brave law enforcement officials, and with every family
who has lost a loved one to drug overdose. This is my promise to the
American people.”

Director Carter brings extensive knowledge and field experience to
ONDCP, having worked as an investigative journalist exposing the cartels
and mapping the drug trafficking routes along the United States-Mexico
border.
