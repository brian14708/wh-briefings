*White House CEQ “Permitting Innovation Center” Launches “CE Works”
Pilot Program*

Today, the Council on Environmental Quality’s (CEQ) Permitting
Innovation Center announced the launch of a pilot program for *CE
Works*, a technology platform that digitizes the environmental review
process to assist federal agencies with completing categorical exclusion
(CE) determinations pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA). Federal agencies make thousands of CE determinations per year,
and making determinations with this new technology will cut through red
tape and result in expedited timelines for important energy and
infrastructure projects.

*CE Works* provides agencies with a digital pathway to apply categorical
exclusions under NEPA. Agency staff can use the platform to select an
appropriate CE, collaborate among resource experts within the agency,
route the determination for approval, and generate a record for
publication.

*CE Works* was developed in response to President Donald J. Trump’s
memorandum *<a

id="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/updating-permitting-technology-for-the-21st-century/">Updating
Permitting Technology for the 21st Century</a>*. Specifically, it calls
on CEQ to design and test prototype tools for use under the
<a href="https://permitting.innovation.gov/resources/action-plan/"
id="https://permitting.innovation.gov/resources/action-plan/">Permitting
Technology Action Plan</a> for modernizing the technology used for
Federal permitting and environmental review processes for infrastructure
projects.

CEQ developed the *CE Works* tool in collaboration with the General
Services Administration’s (GSA) Technology Transformation Services. GSA
is supporting the accelerated work of the Permitting Innovation Center
to advance critical Administration initiatives by providing top tech
talent focused on delivering high-quality software development,
infrastructure efficiencies and an effective user experience.

For the launch of the *CE Works* pilot program, CEQ is partnering with
the Bureau of Land Management’s Moab Field Office with additional agency
partnerships expected in coming months. By leading agency field tests,
CEQ is leveraging on the ground experience to advise agencies and
promote the widespread adoption of digital solutions to bring speed and
efficiency to the environmental review process.

“President Trump has given clear direction to leverage modern technology
to expedite and simplify the permitting process,” said **Council on
Environmental Quality Chairman Katherine Scarlett**. “The digital
solutions coming out of the Permitting Innovation Center are going to
move projects forward with greater speed and efficiency than ever
before, and the direct result will be America’s golden age.”
