    Return Marks New Era of Success, Prosperity</span>

One year ago today, President Donald J. Trump [returned to
office](https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/01/the-inaugural-address/)
with a resounding mandate to restore prosperity, secure the border,
rebuild American strength, and put the American people first. In just
365 days, President Trump has delivered truly transformative results
with the most accomplished first year of any presidential term in modern
history.

From negative net migration for the first time in 50 years to the
largest homicide drop on record, trillions in reshored investments,
peace deals ending multiple wars, record energy production, and massive
bureaucracy cuts, President Trump has put America First with urgency —
and he’s just getting started.

**Here are 365 wins from President Trump’s first 365 days back in
office:**

## SECURING AMERICA’S BORDERS AND PUTTING AMERICANS FIRST

    through deportations and voluntary self-departures.
3.  Carried out over 650,000 arrests, detentions, and deportations of

    for eight consecutive months, restoring deterrence at the border.

    southern border to support enforcement and repel the invasion.

    miles of new construction underway or already completed, including
    new border barrier projects underway in El Paso and the Rio Grande
    Valley — to safeguard the homeland against future invasion.

    the largest migrant detention facility in U.S. history — to ensure
    detained means detained, not released back into our communities.

    non-compliant foreign truck drivers out of service.

    Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE) Office to provide direct
    support to victims of illegal alien crime.

    crossing into the country to a record low.
30. Invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport brutal Tren de Aragua gang
