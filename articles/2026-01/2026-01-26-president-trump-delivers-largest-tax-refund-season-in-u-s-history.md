## **Economists and financial experts agree — 2026 will mark an unprecedented year for tax refunds:**

    “The average refund in 2025 was $2,939, IRS data showed. This year,
    refunds could be as much as 30% more due to new provisions from
    President Donald Trump’s mega tax and spending bill, according to
    James Knightley, chief international economist at Dutch bank ING.”

    “Many Americans could see heftier tax refunds next year when they
    file their 2025 tax returns, largely due to new provisions enacted
    through the Republicans’ ‘one big, beautiful bill’ act that are
    retroactive to the start of the current year, according to an
    analysis from Oxford Economics. Total taxpayer savings could amount
    to an additional $50 billion through bigger tax refunds or a cut in
    their 2026 taxes…A $50 billion boost in tax refunds would represent
    an 18% increase from the $275 billion in refunds the IRS sent this
    year to nearly 94 million taxpayers who overpaid on their 2024
    federal tax returns.”
