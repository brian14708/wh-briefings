title: "Trump Policies Power U.S. Auto Sales to Best Year Since 2019 \u2014 Proving\
  \ \u201CExperts\u201D Wrong (Again)"

Earlier this year, analysts claimed President Donald J. Trump’s Made in
America trade agenda would “[deal a serious blow to
automakers](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-car-prices-auto-sales/),”
“[cut sales by
millions](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-tariffs-auto-industry-costs-rising-rcna201005),”
and “[increase
prices](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/07/auto-sales-tariffs.html).”
