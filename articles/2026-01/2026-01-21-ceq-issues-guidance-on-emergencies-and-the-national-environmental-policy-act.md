title: CEQ Issues Guidance on Emergencies and the National Environmental Policy Act
---
 
*Expediting Emergency Actions for Agencies*

Today, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) issued new NEPA
emergency guidance designed to ensure federal agencies have the tools
and support needed to act immediately in emergency situations.

The guidance provides clarity to Federal agencies on how to comply with
NEPA when responding to emergency situations.  Examples of such
emergencies include catastrophic wildfires, threats to species and their
habitat, economic crises, infectious disease outbreaks, and states of
emergency declared by the President.

“With the issuance of this emergency guidance, CEQ is helping federal
agencies provide rapid response and delivery of assistance to the
American people when they need it the most,” said **Council on
Environmental Quality Chairman Katherine Scarlett**. “Whether responding
to unforeseen events or other states of emergency, agencies need to be
able to act fast and take necessary actions to control the immediate
impacts of the emergency without getting bogged down in bureaucratic
hurdles.”

The guidance provides step-by-step direction for agencies to fully
utilize all tools at their disposal to meet the moment, while ensuring
all necessary legal requirements and environmental considerations are
fully addressed.

CEQ has over 50 years of experience assisting agencies in implementing
NEPA during emergency situations. With this guidance, CEQ advances this
Administration’s priorities consistent with NEPA.
