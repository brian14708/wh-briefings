    President in History</span>

**From the day President Donald J. Trump took office, his Administration
has unapologetically stood for the sanctity of life.** As tens of
thousands of Americans gather in our nation’s capital this week to March
for Life, the Trump Administration is proud to have reversed the Radical
Left’s war on family and restored a culture of life to our society —
recognizing that all humans are created in the image of God, with
infinite worth and boundless potential.

### **This week, the Trump Administration advanced bold action to safeguard life and uphold Americans’ fundamental freedoms**.

-   **President Trump** [issued a
    message](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2026/01/presidential-message-on-national-sanctity-of-human-life-day-2026/)
    declaring National Sanctity of Human Life Day.
-   The **Department of State**
    [finalized](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/state-dept-moves-expand-mexico-city-policy-targeting-abortion-dei-gender-ideology-foreign-aid)
    a historic expansion of the Mexico City Policy to bar U.S. foreign
    assistance from directly or indirectly subsidizing abortion, gender
    ideology, or DEI programs.
-   The **National Institutes of Health**
    [announced](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-announces-major-policy-shift-end-use-human-fetal-tissue-nih-supported-research)
    it is ending the use of fetal tissue of aborted babies in
    federally-funded research.
-   The **Small Business Administration** [opened a
    review](https://www.sba.gov/article/2026/01/22/sba-opens-review-over-88-million-planned-parenthood-paycheck-protection-program-loans)
    requiring Planned Parenthood affiliates to provide documentation
    proving their eligibility for $88 million in small business loans
    they received from the COVID-era Paycheck Protection Program —
    almost all of which was forgiven by the Biden Administration.
-   The **Department of Health and Human Services**
    [issued](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/nov-illinois.pdf) a
    Notice of Violation to Illinois over a state law that forces health
    care providers to refer for abortions, even against their religious
    beliefs or moral convictions — in violation of federal conscience
    protections.
-   The **Department of Health and Human Services**
    [rescinded](https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/fact-sheet-announcements-on-conscience-and-life.html)
    eight Biden-era guidance
    [documents](https://www.hhs.gov/conscience/your-protections-against-discrimination-based-on-conscience-and-religion/hhs-disavowal-repudiation-documents/index.html)
    that promoted and mandated abortions, abortion drugs, and abortion
    coverage by insurance companies — failing to protect freedom of
    religion and freedom of conscience.
-   The **Department of Health and Human Services** issued a nationwide
    [“Dear Colleague”
    letter](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/conscience-dcl.pdf)
    to educate the public on protections for health care providers who
    object to abortion, sterilization, or assisted suicide.
-   The **Department of Health and Human Services**
    [moved](https://www.dailysignal.com/2026/01/23/exclusive-hhs-advances-rule-ending-taxpayer-funded-abortion-travel-for-alien-children/)
    to roll back a Biden-era policy that guaranteed on-demand,
    taxpayer-funded abortions for unaccompanied illegal alien children.

### **March for Life**

**In a powerful** [**video message**](https://youtu.be/YR6d3DbwJ9E) **to
the March for Life, President Trump reaffirmed our nation’s recognition
of the right to life from its founding to today — that every life is a
sacred gift from God.**

**Vice President JD Vance delivered inspiring**
[**remarks**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2014756657281032500?s=20)
**to the March for Life, reinforcing the Trump Administration’s
unwavering commitment to supporting families and protecting life:** “The
mark of barbarism is that we treat babies like inconveniences to be
discarded rather than the blessings to cherish that they are, but the
inheritance of our civilization is something else — the fact that, as
Scripture tells us, each life is fearfully and wonderfully made by our
Creator.”

### **The Trump Administration remains steadfast in its commitment to the pro-life cause.**

From Day One, President Trump has taken decisive steps to [protect the
unborn](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/09/president-trumps-top-100-victories-for-people-of-faith/),
[restore conscience
rights](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/05/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-establishes-the-religious-liberty-commission/),
[end taxpayer-funded
abortion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-enforces-overwhelmingly-popular-demand-to-stop-taxpayer-funding-of-abortion/),
and champion [faith-based
adoption](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/11/national-adoption-month-2025/)
and [foster
care](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/11/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-fosters-the-future-for-american-children-and-families/).
President Trump also
[ordered](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-eradicates-anti-christian-bias/)
the Department of Justice to investigate government weaponization
against Christians and
[pardoned](https://www.foxnews.com/us/pro-life-protesters-pardoned-trump-fox-confirms)
23 pro-life Americans unjustly prosecuted by the Biden Administration
for exercising their faith and conscience.

Finally, President Trump signed the [Working Families Tax Cuts
Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/obbb/) into law, which:

-   Established Trump Accounts to invest in newborns’ futures;
-   Permanently increased the Child Tax Credit to $2,200 per child;
-   Expanded employer childcare tax credits, especially for small
    businesses;
-   Strengthened and made permanent the paid family and medical leave
    tax credit; and
-   Protected Medicaid from funding abortion providers.

### **President Trump is proudly leading the most pro-life Administration in American history.**
