For too long, an environmental statute known as the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) has been weaponized to stall growth in
the United States.

But there is good news.

In today’s
[*Newsweek*](https://www.newsweek.com/the-trump-administration-is-moving-to-fix-a-broken-permitting-system-opinion-11359565),
White House Council on Environmental Quality Chairman Katherine Scarlett
highlights incredible work that has taken place in this Administration
to fix the environmental review and permitting process.

A historic deregulation effort, led by President Donald J. Trump, in
coordination with CEQ, has created a path for Federal agencies to
accomplish permitting reform at [record
speed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/06/fact-sheet-president-trump-is-delivering-historic-permitting-wins-across-the-federal-government/)—
ensuring America is not left behind in the global race to buildout
critical infrastructure.

Chairman Scarlett writes:

***“The Trump administration, Congress, and the Supreme Court have all
acted to cut through the mess known as the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA).”***

***“President Trump moved decisively to address the NEPA quagmire,
beginning with his Day One***

***Executive Order that directed the CEQ to expedite and simplify the
permitting process.”***

As Chairman Scarlett put it in today’s opinion piece, the President’s
vision to further modernize the permitting process and rapidly
deregulate so we can start building now reflects a simple truth:
***“…while China breaks ground on critical infrastructure, the U.S.
can’t be stuck doing paperwork. To this end, the administration is
tirelessly working on other areas to cut red tape while fostering
exceptional stewardship of the environment.”***
