    Policy Executive Working Group</span>

From January 20-21, the United States hosted the inaugural meeting of
the U.S.-India Drug Policy Executive Working Group in Washington, D.C.
The Oﬃce of National Drug Control Policy’s (ONDCP) Director, Sara
Carter, opened the meeting by emphasizing President Trump and Prime
Minister Modi’s mutual commitment to strengthening security cooperation
and eradicating narco-terrorism. Ambassador Vinay Kwatra, Ambassador of
India to the United States of America, stated that India accorded the
highest priority to addressing the threat posed by narcotics trafficking
and the diversion of precursor chemicals, while also balancing effective
enforcement with facilitation of legitimate trade. The Executive Working
Group, led by ONDCP’s Acting Deputy Director, Debbie Seguin, and the
Narcotics Control Bureau’s Deputy Director General, Monika Ashish Batra,
worked with the U.S. and Indian delegations, respectively, to deliver
tangible, measurable outcomes in advancing the critical counter
narcotics partnership.

“The drug crisis is now a core national security priority,” said
Director Carter. This Executive Working Group leverages the bilateral
partnership to protect families while also supporting legitimate
industries.

Both countries committed to strengthening bilateral cooperation to
dismantle the illegal production and traﬃcking of illicit drugs and
their precursor chemicals that threaten our communities. They emphasized
the importance of a whole-of-government approach that streamlines
interagency and intergovernmental eﬀorts and secures the pharmaceutical
supply chain, consistent with respective national rules and regulations,
while also building upon the success of recent joint operations to
disrupt illicit narcotic traﬃcking networks.

This meeting highlights the United States’ and India’s enduring and
shared commitment to addressing the global drug challenge and fostering
a safer and healthier future for both nations.
