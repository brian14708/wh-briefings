---
 
**Today, President Donald J. Trump**
[**announced**](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115983891481988557)
**his nomination of Kevin Warsh to serve as Chairman of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System.** Mr. Warsh is exceptionally
well-prepared to lead the world’s most influential central bank, with a
distinguished background including degrees from Stanford University and
Harvard Law School, prior roles as a Morgan Stanley executive and top
economic advisor to the Bush Administration, and service as the
youngest-ever Federal Reserve Governor — where he helped steer the
institution through the 2008 financial crisis.

**The nomination has drawn widespread praise from lawmakers, business
leaders, financial experts, and industry voices across the spectrum:**

[Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Chairman Tim

mortgage rates to retirement savings, and President Trump has been clear
that bringing accountability and credibility to the Federal Reserve is a
priority, and his nomination of Kevin Warsh reflects that focus. As a
former Federal Reserve Governor, Kevin has deep knowledge of markets and
monetary policy that will be essential in this role. Federal Reserve
independence remains paramount, and I am confident Kevin will work to
instill confidence and credibility in the Fed’s monetary policy. As
Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, I look forward to leading a
thoughtful, timely confirmation process that carefully examines his
vision for focusing the Federal Reserve on its core mission.”

“Phenomenal choice by President Trump! Kevin Warsh is a brilliant mind

powerful central bank. Having observed and interacted with Kevin during
his prior tenure as Fed Governor, in academia, and as a fellow member of

President Trump understands the need for strong leadership at the
Federal Reserve to fulfill its dual mandate while modernizing the
institution. The Forum applauds President Trump’s nomination and looks

dual mandate will be critical as the central bank navigates a complex
economic environment and works to maintain stability, confidence, and
long-term growth. We look forward to working with Mr. Warsh and
policymakers to advance sound, predictable policies that support a
strong economy, a resilient financial system, and broad access to credit

[American Bankers Association President and CEO Rob
Nichols](https://www.aba.com/about-us/press-room/press-releases/warsh-nomination-statement):
“Congratulations to Kevin Warsh on his nomination to serve as the next
chair of the Federal Reserve Board. In selecting Warsh, President Trump
has chosen an experienced and tested policymaker who previously served
at the Fed during one of its most challenging moments. Having worked
alongside him in the Bush administration, I know he has a deep
understanding of monetary policy, markets and the important role the
nation’s banks play in the economy. We look forward to learning more
about his current policy views during the confirmation process, and
ultimately seeing a smooth transition in Fed leadership.”

[Job Creators Network CEO Alfredo
Ortiz](https://www.jobcreatorsnetwork.com/press_releases/job-creators-network-supports-trumps-pick-of-kevin-warsh-for-fed-chairman/):
“Kevin Warsh is the perfect choice to lead the Federal Reserve. He has
repeatedly demonstrated understanding of the true driver of inflation:
excessive government money printing, not economic growth. Under his
leadership, the Fed can finally reach its target inflation rate,
something Chairman Powell has continually failed to do, while also
expanding access to credit for small businesses. By protecting the value
of the dollar, supporting economic growth, and boosting capital access,
a Warsh chairmanship can backstop a booming small business economy. The
Senate should quickly confirm him.”

[Investment Company Institute President and CEO Eric J.
Pan](https://www.ici.org/news-release/ici-welcomes-kevin-warshs-nomination-to-lead-federal-reserve):
“ICI offers our warm congratulations to Kevin Warsh on his selection to
lead the Federal Reserve. Warsh’s wealth of experience in monetary
policy and financial regulation, along with his deep understanding of
the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate, will serve him well in this
position. His unique background as a former Federal Reserve Governor,
twinned with his experience in global financial markets, means he has a
firm foundation from which to step into this leadership role. We commend
President Trump for this outstanding nomination and look forward to
working with Warsh to support the millions of American investors we
serve.”

“CREFC congratulates Kevin Warsh on his nomination to lead the Federal
Reserve. As a former Federal Reserve Governor with deep experience in
financial markets, Mr. Warsh brings valuable perspective at a critical
moment for the U.S. economy. Federal Reserve policy has a direct and
significant impact on commercial real estate finance, influencing
interest rates, liquidity, and the availability of capital across CRE
lending and securitization markets. Strong, transparent leadership at
the Fed is essential to maintaining market stability and supporting
economic growth. We look forward to engaging with Mr. Warsh and
policymakers throughout the confirmation process and beyond to advance
policies that promote a healthy, resilient commercial real estate
finance system.”

nomination to serve as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. As a
previous member of the Fed board, Warsh has demonstrated a clear
understanding of the important role of community banks in the nation’s
economy and the need for tiered regulations to support access to banking
services in local communities. ICBA encourages policymakers in
Washington to continue ongoing efforts to address excessive regulatory
burdens on community banks and ensure a level regulatory playing field
between banks and nonbank entities to support a secure environment for
consumers and the financial system. We look forward to continuing to
work closely with Warsh, the Trump administration, and the 119th
Congress on these issues.”

public servant with the intellect, experience, and judgment to lead the
Federal Reserve. He understands the central bank’s key role for the
United States and our allies around the world. We will benefit from his
steady, principled leadership.”

[Apollo Global Management Chief Economist Torsten
Slok](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2017264655635300568): “He
will be really a great Fed Chair because the issue is that he
understands the institution. He understands that this is a committee;
there are 12 voting members. He absolutely also understands the
importance of guiding the committee and figuring out the consensus
opinion.”

[UPS CEO Carol B.
Tomé](https://about.ups.com/us/en/newsroom/statements/statement-from-carol-tome-on-kevin-warsh-nomination.html):

with Vice Chair Bowman on the work she’s already begun in right-sizing
bank regulation and ensuring capital access across the country. Mr.
Warsh’s work at the Fed, in the private sector, and in the executive

I look forward to working alongside him to bolster the American
economy.”

[Rep. Dan Meuser](https://x.com/RepMeuser/status/2017276795217731944):
“@POTUS made an excellent choice in Kevin Warsh to lead the
@federalreserve, after months of vetting incredible candidates including
Kevin Hassett, Chris Waller, and Rick Rieder. Warsh is a serious,
credible choice who understands the magnitude of the job ahead — Fed
policy directly affects mortgage rates, borrowing costs, and the price
of everyday goods. President Trump has been clear about his priorities:
lowering costs, fighting inflation, and restoring affordability,
especially in the housing market. Kevin Warsh shares that focus and
understands that you don’t fix the economy by crushing it. You restore
stability with disciplined monetary policy that supports growth rather
than working against it. With experience at the Fed, in the White House,
and in the private sector, Kevin Warsh understands how monetary policy
impacts real people, real businesses, and long-term economic strength.
The Senate should move quickly to confirm him so the Fed can refocus on
its core mission and focus on helping our economy grow to the benefit of
all Americans.”
