title: 'ICYMI: Murder Rate Plunges to 125-Year Low as President Trump Restores Law
  and Order'
---
 
**Under President Donald J. Trump’s leadership, America is safer than it
has been in over a century — and** [**brand new
data**](https://counciloncj.org/crime-trends-in-u-s-cities-year-end-2025-update/)
**proves it.** A new report
[shows](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/22/murder-rate-century-low) the
murder rate across the nation’s biggest cities plummeted last year to
its lowest level since at least 1900, marking the biggest one-year drop
in recorded history.

**This monumental turnaround is a direct result of President Trump’s
unwavering commitment to Make America Safe Again.** In addition to the
historic drop in murders last year, the nation experienced [steep
declines](https://majorcitieschiefs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MCCA-Violent-Crime-Report-2025-and-2024-January-to-September.pdf) in
rapes, robberies, aggravated assaults, shooting deaths
([fewest](https://www.thetrace.org/2025/12/data-shooting-stats-gun-violence-america/) since
2015), [on-duty law enforcement officer

([80-year

**President Trump is reversing the chaos and carnage unleashed by
Radical Left Democrats who turned our streets into war zones by coddling
criminals and opening our borders.** Since taking office, President
Trump has deployed a whole-of-government offensive in Democrat-run
cities, [driving down
crime](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2026/01/mass-deportations-are-improving-americans-quality-of-life/#:~:text=The%20results%20are,nearly%2050%20years.),
ridding the streets of savage criminal illegal aliens, backing law
enforcement, and bringing back order where incompetent Democrat
politicians surrendered to anarchy and despair.

President Trump’s proven America First agenda is delivering real results
for American citizens, proving once and for all that strength and
resolve win out over weakness and wokeness — and the results are only
just beginning.
