title: In Davos, President Trump Outlines Bold Vision for American Prosperity, Transatlantic
  Strength
---
 
**President Donald J. Trump commanded the stage this morning at the
World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, delivering a bold address
that reaffirmed America’s leadership on the global stage and charted a
decisive path forward for Western nations.** Highlighting the
imperatives of national sovereignty, cultural preservation, and
proactive security, President Trump articulated a robust strategy to
promote mutual prosperity and fortify alliances against global
challenges.

**Here are the highlights:**

### **President Trump outlined innovative initiatives to lower costs for everyday Americans:**

-   “Homeownership has always been a symbol of the health and vigor of
    American society, but that goal fell out of reach for millions and
    millions of people in the Biden era… Homes are built for PEOPLE, not
    for corporations — and America will NOT become a nation of renters…
    That’s why I have signed an executive order banning large
    institutional investors from buying single-family homes… And I’m
    calling on Congress to pass that ban into permanent law.”

-   “I have instructed government-backed institutions to purchase up to
    $200 billion in mortgage bonds to bring down interest rates… Last
    week, the average 30-year mortgage rate dropped below 6% for the
    first time in many years.”

-   “The profit margin for credit card companies now exceeds 50% — one
    of the biggest — and they charge Americans interest rates of 28%… To
    help our citizens recover from the Biden disaster… I’m asking
    Congress to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for one year.”

-   “I’m also working to ensure America remains the crypto capital of
    the world… Congress is working very hard on crypto market structure
    legislation… Which I hope to sign very soon, unlocking new pathways
    for Americans to reach financial freedom.”

### **President Trump showcased the remarkable economic achievements of his first year back in office:**

-   “Under the Biden Administration, America was plagued by the
    nightmare of stagflation, meaning low growth and high inflation — a
    recipe for misery, failure, and decline. But now, after just one
    year of my policies, we are witnessing the exact opposite —
    virtually no inflation and extraordinarily high economic growth.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2013970976996786438))
-   “In one year, I slashed our monthly trade deficit by a staggering
    77% — and all of this with no inflation, something everyone said
    could not be done.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2013973993536070051))
-   “Because of my landslide election victory, the United States avoided
    the catastrophic energy collapse which befell every European nation
    that pursued the Green New Scam — perhaps the greatest hoax in
    history.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2013976114432020550))
-   “Under my leadership, U.S. natural gas production is at an all-time
    high, U.S. oil production is up by 730,000 barrels a day… the price
    of gasoline is now below $2.50 a gallon in many states.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2013975007714480170))
-   “In 12 months, we have removed over 270,000 bureaucrats from the
    federal payrolls — the largest single-year reduction in government
    employment since the end of World War II… We’ve cut federal spending
    by $100 billion and slashed the federal budget deficit by 27% in a
    single year… In July, we passed the largest tax cuts in American
    history, including No Tax on Tips, No Tax on Overtime, and No Tax on
    Social Security for our great seniors.”

### **President Trump issued a call to action for European partners:**

-   “The USA is the economic engine on the planet — and when America
    booms, the entire world booms.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2013971969243259101))
-   “In recent decades, it became conventional wisdom in Washington and
    European capitals that the only way to grow a modern Western economy
    was through ever-increasing government spending, unchecked mass
    migration, and endless foreign imports… This was the path that the
    Sleepy Joe Biden Administration and many other Western governments
    very foolishly followed, turning their backs on everything that
    makes nations rich and powerful and strong.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2013973453833920889))
-   “The consequences of such destructive policies have been stark —
    including lower economic growth, lower standards of living, lower
    birthrates, more socially disruptive migration, more vulnerability
    to hostile foreign adversaries, and much, much smaller militaries.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2013977014881906698))
-   “The United States cares greatly about the people of Europe… and we
    believe deeply in the bonds we share… That’s why issues like energy,
    trade, immigration, and economic growth must be central concerns to
    anyone who wants to see a strong and united West.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2013977014881906698))
-   “The situation in Minnesota reminds us that the West cannot
    mass-import foreign cultures which have failed to ever build a
    successful society of their own.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2013988841820926234))
-   “The explosion of prosperity and progress that built the West did
    not come from our tax codes; it ultimately came from our very
    special culture. This is the pressure inheritance that America and
    Europe have in common… We have to defend that culture and rediscover
    the spirit that lifted the West from the depths of the Dark Ages to
    the pinnacle of human achievement.”
