title: "Here\u2019s What the Trump Administration Is Doing to Crush Minnesota\u2019\
  s Fraud Epidemic"
---
 
President Donald J. Trump and his Administration are unleashing a
relentless assault to dismantle the massive fraud empires built in
Minnesota under the watch of incompetent Democrats like Tim Walz and his
Radical Left enablers.

Fueled by [shocking
video](https://x.com/nickshirleyy/status/2004642794862961123) from Nick
Shirley and [tenacious reporting](https://alphanews.org/fraudmn/) by
Alpha News exposing the Somali-dominated scams that have bled taxpayers
dry, this Administration is spearheading a no-holds-barred effort to
hunt down and prosecute the criminals who have exploited Democrats’
non-existent oversight to bilk hardworking taxpayers out of billions of
dollars.

**Here are actions the Administration has already taken:**

-   The **Department of Justice** is currently engaged in multiple
    active, ongoing, and extensive investigations into the fraudulent
    activity that has occurred in various Minnesota programs, including
    the state’s Feeding Our Future, Housing Stabilization Services,
    Early Intensive Developmental and Behavioral Intervention programs,
    and Evergreen Recovery.
    -   To date, DOJ has
        [charged](https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/2005764911427731459?s=20)
        98 defendants in Minnesota fraud-related cases — [85 of
        whom](https://x.com/TheJusticeDept/status/2006533670358663367)
        are of Somali descent. 64 the defendants have already been
        convicted.
    -   DOJ has already issued over 1,750 subpoenas, executed over 130
        search warrants, and conducted over 1,000 witness interviews as
        part of its ongoing investigation.
    -   Many of the facilities and schemes visited in Shirley’s viral
        video are currently under active investigation by the DOJ; in
        fact, [one of the
        buildings](https://x.com/lizcollin/status/1945525577969959328)
        prominently featured in the video has had 13 defendants charged
        for fraud.
    -   The **Federal Bureau of Investigation** is
        [conducting](https://x.com/C__Herridge/status/2006091693259636775)
        investigations into dozens of the state’s health care and home
        care providers accused of fraud, surging forensic accountants
        and data analytics teams, and investigating potential links to
        elected officials and terrorist financing.
-   The **Department of Homeland Security** is [on the
    ground](https://x.com/DHSgov/status/2005688262695018606) conducting
    [door-to-door](https://x.com/DHSgov/status/2006130445755322720)
    investigations of suspected fraud sites in Minnesota, with hundreds
    of Homeland Security Investigations officers in the state and more
    on the way.
    -   DHS has arrested over 1,000 criminal illegal aliens in just the
        past few weeks as immigration enforcement operations continue.
        Additionally, as part of Operation Twin Shield earlier this
        year, DHS
        [identified](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/uscis-announces-results-of-operation-twin-shield-a-large-scale-immigration-fraud-investigation)
        over 1,300 fraud findings based on site visits in Minneapolis
        and Saint Paul — and is currently in the process of determining
        which cases require additional vetting, including for refugee
        status and
        [potential](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5667727-trump-administration-denaturalization-somali-minnesota/)
        denaturalization.
-   The **Department of Health and Human Services** has
    [frozen](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hhs-freezes-minnesota-child-care-payments-over-alleged-daycare-fraud-scheme)
    childcare payments and
    [started](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/hhs-halts-federal-child-care-payments-minnesota-fraud-claims-rcna251619)
    requiring a justification, receipt, or photo evidence for all
    childcare-related payments nationwide, and is
    [enforcing](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15379705/minnesota-somali-donald-trump-fraud-hhs.html)
    a long-ignored federal law to demand repayment of Medicaid benefits
    incurred by sponsored immigrants from their sponsors. HHS is also
    currently
    [investigating](https://nypost.com/2025/12/16/us-news/hhs-probes-whether-billions-in-taxpayer-money-used-to-fuel-illegal-and-mass-migration/)
    Minnesota’s Head Start programs over allegations of fraud by illegal
    aliens.
-   The **Small Business Administration** has
    [halted](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5665860-sba-halts-grants-minnesota-fraud/)
    all annual grant program payments to Minnesota. The agency also
    [suspended](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5669459-minnesota-fraud-sba-ppp/)
    6,900 borrowers in the state for approximately $400 million in
    suspected fraudulent activity — banning the individuals from all
    further loan programs, including disaster loans.
-   The **Department of Housing and Urban Development** has
    [dispatched](https://www.newsnationnow.com/crime/root-out-fraud-hud-secretary-minnesota/)
    a team to Minnesota to conduct a wide-ranging investigation into
    possible public housing assistance fraud.
-   The **Department of Labor **is currently
    [conducting](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20251215)
    a targeted review of Minnesota’s Unemployment Insurance program.
-   The **Department of Agriculture** has
    [demanded](https://www.foxnews.com/us/agriculture-secretary-demands-minnesota-fix-snap-benefits-4-counties-immediately-under-pilot-program)
    Minnesota conduct recertification for its SNAP recipients to ensure
    the program complies with eligibility requirements — a commonsense
    move inexplicably
    [challenged](https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Communications/2025/12/23_SNAP.asp)
    in court by state officials.

**President Trump promised decisive action and his Administration is
delivering, with unprecedented investigations, freezes, and prosecutions
spanning multiple agencies.** These complex criminal networks didn’t
build themselves overnight on Tim Walz’s watch, and rooting them out
completely requires thorough, methodical work to build cases that secure
convictions and recover taxpayer dollars.

The Trump Administration is moving with full force and urgency — and
more results are on the way.
