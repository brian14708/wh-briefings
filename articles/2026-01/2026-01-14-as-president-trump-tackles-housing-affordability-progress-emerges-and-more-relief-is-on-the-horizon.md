**As President Donald J. Trump advances bold action to address the
housing challenges facing American families following years of rising
costs under Biden, new data shows encouraging signs of improvement.**
With mortgage rates trending lower, home sales gaining momentum, and
income growth supporting buyers, there is clear momentum as President
Trump works to restore the American Dream of homeownership for all
Americans.

    reflects ongoing gains in housing affordability, with recent months
    showing the longest stretch of annual improvement in years.
    Meanwhile, the National Association of Realtors’ [Housing
    Affordability
    Index](https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/housing-statistics/housing-affordability-index)
    — measuring the typical family’s ability to qualify for a mortgage —

    in nearly three years as median family incomes climb and rates ease.

    mortgage rate has
    [dipped](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/real-estate/30-year-mortgage-rates-below-6-percent-rcna253218) to
    multi-year lows, driving monthly housing payments to their [most
    affordable](https://www.redfin.com/news/housing-market-update-housing-payments-lowest-level-2-years/)
    levels in over two years and providing critical relief for
    prospective buyers.
-   **More relief is coming.** President Trump has undertaken an
    aggressive [agenda](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-housing-plan-could-bring-big-win-americans-pulte-says) to
    tackle housing challenges head-on —
    including [directing](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115861588073149023) Fannie
    Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase $200 billion in mortgage-backed
    securities to further drive down borrowing costs and
    taking [action](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115855059527504524) to
    ban large institutional investors acquiring single-family homes,
    ensuring more inventory remains available for everyday American
    families.

The Trump Administration remains committed to cutting red tape, boosting
supply, and delivering lasting affordability so every American can
achieve the dream of homeownership.
