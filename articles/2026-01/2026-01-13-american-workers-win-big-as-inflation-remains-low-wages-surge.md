title: American Workers Win Big as Inflation Remains Low, Wages Surge

> **“Yet another report confirms that President Trump has defeated the

Fresh economic data
[released](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm) today reaffirms
that inflation is firmly under control as American workers see real wage
gains in President Donald J. Trump’s economy.

**Here’s what you need to know:**

-   **Core inflation came in**
    [**below**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-13/us-core-cpi-rose-by-less-than-forecast-in-december)
    **economists’ expectations.** It’s “a more confident signal of
    cooling price growth after shutdown-related distortions” and a
    “convincing sign that inflation is on a downward path,” [according
    to
    Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-13/us-core-cpi-rose-by-less-than-forecast-in-december#:~:text=Underlying%20US%20inflation%20rose%20in%20December%20by%20less%20than%20expected%2C%20a%20more%20confident%20signal%20of%20cooling%20price%20growth%20after%20shutdown%2Drelated%20distortions%20complicated%20the%20previous%20report.).
-   **President Trump ended Biden’s inflation crisis.** Since President
    Trump took office, headline inflation has been running at 2.4% (much
    lower than the 3% annual rate inherited from Biden) and core
    inflation has been running at 2.4% (much lower than the 3.3% annual
    rate inherited from Biden).
-   **Wages are rising.** Real private sector weekly earnings are on
    track to rise 4% in President Trump’s first full year in office —
    resoundingly beating inflation. In fact, private sector workers are
    on track to see a real wage gain of $1,100 — gaining back some of
    the purchasing power they lost under Biden.
-   **Blue-collar workers are seeing real results.** Overall,
    goods-producing workers — the backbone of American industry — are on
    track to see their real annual earnings rise by $1,300 in President
    Trump’s first full year in office. Mining and logging workers are on
    track for an increase of $2,200, construction workers are on track
    for an extra $1,400, and manufacturing workers are on track to gain
    $1,300.
-   **Cars have become more affordable under President Trump.** The
    latest report shows vehicle prices continue to decline as President
    Trump’s policies power automakers to their [best sales year since
    2019](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2026/01/trump-policies-power-u-s-auto-sales-to-best-year-since-2019-proving-experts-wrong-again/).
    -   [Bloomberg’s Chris
        Anstey](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2026-01-13/us-cpi-report-for-december?cursorId=69664E264A180000):
        “\[D\]espite many analysts anticipating a bump up in prices for
        the 2026 model year, with automakers expected to do a lot more
        to pass along the tariff increases, that just really hasn’t
        happened.”
