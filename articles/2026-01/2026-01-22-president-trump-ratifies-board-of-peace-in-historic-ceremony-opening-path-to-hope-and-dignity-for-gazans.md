title: President Trump Ratifies Board of Peace in Historic Ceremony, Opening Path
  to Hope and Dignity for Gazans
---
 
**Today, in an historic ceremony in Davos, Switzerland, President Donald
J. Trump formally ratified the Charter of the Board of Peace —
establishing it as an official international organization.** President
Trump, who is serving as the Board’s Chairman, was joined by Founding
Members representing countries around the world who have committed to
building a secure and prosperous future for Gaza that delivers lasting
peace, stability, and opportunity for its people.

**It’s another pivotal step forward in realizing President Trump’s**
[**vision**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1972726021196562494)
**of transforming Gaza from a region plagued by conflict and despair
into one defined by opportunity, hope, and vitality.** The Board of
Peace stands ready to mobilize global resources, enforce accountability,
and guide the implementation of the next critical phases of
demilitarization, governance reform, and large-scale rebuilding.

-   [**President
    Trump**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0uSK9MaCdA)**:** “This
    Board has the chance to be one of the most consequential bodies ever
    created, and It’s my enormous honor to serve as its Chairman… Today,
    the first steps toward a brighter day for the Middle East and a much
    safer future for the world are unfolding right before your very
    eyes. Together, we are in a position to have any credible chance… to
    end decades of suffering, stop generations of hatred and bloodshed,
    and forge a beautiful, everlasting, and glorious peace for that
    region.”
-   [**Secretary of State Marco
    Rubio**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2014289807585743188)**:**
    “We are here today because of President Trump’s vision. If we go
    back just a few months ago, people thought what was happening in
    Gaza was impossible to solve… No one thought that that would ever
    come to a resolution without more fighting and more bloodshed along
    the way… But President Trump had the vision and the courage to dream
    the impossible, to believe that it was doable, and to pursue it with
    all of his heart.”
-   [**Chief Commissioner of the National Committee for the
    Administration of Gaza Dr. Ali
    Sha’ath**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2014291460485472374?s=20)**:**
    “I want to start by thanking President Donald J. Trump and his
    Administration for his intensive efforts to advance peace in the
    whole region… These efforts created the opportunity for a new future
    in Gaza, but what will really matter is what comes next.”
-   [**High Representative for Gaza Nickolay
    Mladenov**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2014295780165587381?s=20)**:**
    “Who would’ve thought two years ago that we would be sitting here
    with this group of countries, with this leadership, giving the
    people of Gaza a new chance?… For too long, Gazans, Palestinians,
    and Israelis have lived with conflict, with death, with destruction.
    Now, the page turns.”
-   [**Special Envoy for Peace Missions Steve
    Witkoff**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2014292512182050830?s=20)**:**
    “We have achieved a peace deal in Gaza. We have brought the hostages
    home… And maybe most importantly, we have created a sense of hope
    for what the future can bring in Gaza and all other places where the
    Board of Peace will operate. And I am so honored, Mr. President, to
    have worked on this on your behalf.”
-   [**Jared
    Kushner**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2014296086333034791?s=20)**:**
    “85% of the GDP of Gaza has been aid for a long time. That’s not
    sustainable. It doesn’t give these people dignity; it doesn’t give
    them hope. And so we want to use free market economy principles — a
    lot of what President Trump spoke about that he’s doing in America —
    we want to bring the same mindset, the same approach, to a place
    like Gaza to give these people the ability to thrive and have a good
    life… If we believe that peace is possible then peace really can be
    possible.”
