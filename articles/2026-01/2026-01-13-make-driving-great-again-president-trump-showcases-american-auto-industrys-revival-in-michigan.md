  s Revival in Michigan"

**President Donald J. Trump took office on a**
[**promise**](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-speech-campaign-rally-novi-michigan-october-26-2024/#81:~:text=We%27ll%20bring%20back%20the%20auto%20industry%20greater%20than%20it%20has%20ever%20been.)
**to revitalize the American auto industry — and after just one year, he
has unquestionably delivered.** Today, as President Trump visits
Michigan and
[tours](https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/trump-will-tour-fords-rouge-center-during-tuesday-visit-michigan)
the home to the assembly of Ford’s iconic F-150 pickup truck, the nation
celebrates the U.S. auto industry’s robust resurgence under his
leadership.

**Under President Trump’s America First agenda, the American auto
industry is primed for unprecedented expansion:**

### **Automakers Are Thriving Amid Record-Breaking Sales**

The past year marked the [strongest
year](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cox-automotive-forecast-despite-q4-slowdown-new-vehicle-sales-expected-to-hit-16-3-million-in-2025--up-nearly-2-from-2024-best-result-since-2019--302645028.html)
for [new vehicle
sales](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-auto-sales-defy-regulatory-uncertainty-rise-2-2025-2026-01-05/)
since 2019.
Ford [achieved](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/06/ford-f-2025-annual-sales.html) its
best annual sales in six years, General
Motors [reported](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/05/gm-posts-5point5percent-us-sales-gain-in-2025-while-jeep-ends-annual-declines.html) soaring
overall vehicle sales with
its [strongest](https://investor.gm.com/static-files/bd576095-7337-4596-bfd2-cb7b3b5b336a) SUV
performance in decades, and
Stellantis [saw](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/05/gm-posts-5point5percent-us-sales-gain-in-2025-while-jeep-ends-annual-declines.html)
Jeep brand sales rise for the first time since 2018.

### **Vehicles Are More Affordable for American Families**

New data indicates that prices for both new and used vehicles have
decreased since President Trump took office — a trend complemented by
[recent
declines](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2026-01-13/us-cpi-report-for-december?cursorId=69664AB4697C0001)
in vehicle maintenance, repair, and insurance costs, as well as gas at
its
[lowest](https://www.wxyz.com/news/gas-prices-in-michigan-down-to-lowest-average-in-nearly-five-years-to-kick-off-2026)
average price in nearly five years.

Additionally, for the first time, Americans can
[deduct](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/one-big-beautiful-bill-act-tax-deductions-for-working-americans-and-seniors#:~:text=new%20reporting%20requirements.-,%E2%80%9CNo%20Tax%20on%20Car%20Loan%20Interest%E2%80%9D,year%202025%20for%20interest%20recipients%20subject%20to%20the%20new%20reporting%20requirements.,-Deduction%20for%20Seniors) interest
on auto loans for vehicles made-in-America — positioning the market for
even greater demand.

### **Major Investments in Domestic Manufacturing**

President Trump’s policies have catalyzed [big
investments](https://www.whitehouse.gov/investments/) from leading
automakers to expand their U.S.-based production. Companies including
[Ford](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/15/ford-ev-pullback.html), 
[Stellantis](https://www.stellantis.com/en/news/press-releases/2025/october/stellantis-to-invest-13-billion-to-grow-in-the-united-states), [General
Motors](https://news.gm.com/home.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2025/jun/0611-plants.html),
[Honda](https://content.services.honda.com/Honda-in-America-Booklet-Final.pdf),
[Toyota](https://pressroom.toyota.com/toyota-boosts-hybrid-production-with-912-million-investment-creating-252-new-u-s-manufacturing-jobs/),
and [many
others](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/08/trump-effect-a-running-list-of-new-u-s-investment-in-president-trumps-second-term/)
are investing billions in American facilities, creating good-paying jobs
and strengthening supply chains here in America — like right here in
Michigan.

### **Tariffs Are Driving U.S. Manufacturing — Without Inflation**

Contrary to
[Fake](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-car-prices-auto-sales/)
[News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-tariffs-auto-industry-costs-rising-rcna201005)
[doomcasting](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/07/auto-sales-tariffs.html),
President Trump’s tariffs have had [no
impact](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-auto-sales-defy-regulatory-uncertainty-rise-2-2025-2026-01-05/#:~:text=tariffs%20did%20not%20substantially%20affect%20vehicle%20prices%2C%20J.D.%20Power%20found.%20The%20average%20new%2Dvehicle%20retail%20transaction%20price%20in%20December%20had%20been%20expected%20to%20reach%20%2447%2C104%2C%20up%20%24715%20or%201.5%25%20from%20December%202024%2C%20the%20firm%20said.) on
vehicle prices — while his [Section 232
tariffs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/10/adjusting-imports-of-medium-and-heavy-duty-vehicles-medium-and-heavy-duty-vehicle-parts-and-buses-into-the-united-states/)
on heavy duty trucks have instead fueled a revival in domestic
manufacturing, with Ford CEO Jim Farley
[calling](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1973006831321796809?s=20)
it a “really big deal.”

As Bloomberg
[noted](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2026-01-13/us-cpi-report-for-december?cursorId=69664E264A180000):
“\[D\]espite many analysts anticipating a bump up in prices for the 2026
model year, with automakers expected to do a lot more to pass along the
tariff increases, that just really hasn’t happened.”

### **Streamlined Regulations Are Making U.S. Production More Competitive**

President Trump
has [reversed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/12/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-announces-the-reset-of-corporate-average-fuel-economy-cafe-standards/) onerous
Biden-era fuel economy standards that would
have [added](https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-news-politics/trump-unveil-historic-reset-biden-fuel-rules-touts-109-billion-savings) nearly
$1,000 to the cost of the average new vehicle, delivering billions in
savings for consumers. The Trump Administration
also [eliminated](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-releases-proposal-rescind-obama-era-endangerment-finding-regulations-paved-way) the
unpopular vehicle stop-start
requirement, [authorized](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1996951040298496250) the
production of affordable and efficient “tiny
cars,” [rescinded](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/12/trump-revokes-californias-nation-leading-electric-vehicle-mandate-00402601)
state-level electric vehicle mandates, and implemented other reforms to
eliminate hidden cost increases imposed by Democrat policies.

These moves have earned
[wide](https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/ford-ceo-hails-trump-fuel-standards-reset-victory-affordability-common-sense)
[praise](https://www.repairerdrivennews.com/2025/12/05/auto-industry-praises-trump-administration-as-it-rolls-back-cafe-standards/)
from
[automakers](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1996320360522739813?s=20)
and [auto
dealers](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1996322049581871287?s=20)
alike as victories for “common sense and affordability.”
