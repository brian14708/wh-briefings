title: "President Trump\u2019s Politico Interview: Democrats Lost Control \u2014 I\
  \ Took it Back"
---
 
In a wide-ranging
[interview](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/09/donald-trump-full-interview-transcript-00681693?nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000&nname=playbook&nrid=a78bbdeb-959a-4bbc-b083-b7dbe744f560)
with Politico, President Donald J. Trump reflected on the progress of
his second term as it approaches the one-year mark — detailing how he is
reversing the economic wreckage left by Biden, unleashing an investment
surge, slamming the door on illegal border crossings and maritime drug
smuggling, and restoring an America First posture abroad.

**Here are some of the key moments:**

-   “The Democrats love to say, ‘Affordability, affordability,’ but then
    they never talk about it. They’re the ones that gave us the high
    prices. I’m the one that’s bringing them down.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1998405400899530760?s=20))
-   “I inherited a total mess. Prices were at an all-time high when I
    came in. Prices are coming down… Look at energy.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1998418096491553014?s=20))
-   “We have $18 trillion being invested. Car companies are moving back
    that left us years ago. AI is coming in at levels never seen before.
    Factories are opening up all over the country… Ultimately, you know
    what it reduces itself to? Jobs. You’re going to have jobs like
    you’ve never seen in the United States.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1998404851730944033?s=20))
-   “When I go on a trip, I only have one place in mind — it’s the
    United States… Most of my time is spent here, but when I do go
    outside, it’s only going outside for here. For instance, settling
    and solving the problem with China. That has a huge effect in the
    United States.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1998405705989038415))
-   “I want to see people that contribute. I don’t want to see Somalia.
    I don’t want to see a woman that marries her brother… then becomes a
    congressman and does nothing but complain.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1998400281151754334))
-   “Two years ago, a year ago, under Biden, this country was out of
    control; millions of people pouring through, totally unchecked,
    totally unvetted. And now, we have nobody coming in… Nobody ever
    talks about that anymore. They should talk about that.”
     ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1998406727570522473))
-   “Obamacare was set up for insurance companies to become rich…
    They’ve been paid trillions — not billions — trillions of dollars
    and what I’m saying is very simple: I don’t want to pay them
    anything. No money for the insurance companies… I want to pay the
    money directly to the people and let the people get their own
    healthcare. But you know who’s fighting me on that? The Democrats.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1998413085279687034?s=20))
-   “Trillions of dollars goes to the insurance companies. I want that
    money to go to the people and let the people go out and buy their
    own healthcare. It works like magic, but you know who doesn’t want
    it? The Democrats because they’re corrupt people — because they’re
    totally owned and bought by the insurance companies.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1998411911193333989?s=20))
-   “\[Zelensky\] is going have to get on the ball and start accepting
    things… because they’re losing. They’ve lost territory — long before
    I got here… You certainly wouldn’t say it’s a victory.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1998393396516311371?s=20))
-   “I hate to see young, beautiful people being killed.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1998393778223104366?s=20))
-   “I have no vision for Europe. All I want to see is a strong Europe.
    I have a vision for the United States — America First. It’s ‘Make
    America Great Again.’”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1998398448928792795))
-   “We save 25,000 people every time we knock out a boat. On average,
    they kill 25,000 Americans. I don’t like doing that, but the drugs
    coming in through the sea — they’re down by 92 percent… Nobody wants
    to drive boats to America loaded up with drugs anymore.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1998401342897897602?s=20))
-   “\[Birthright citizenship\] was meant for the babies of slaves… That
    case was not meant for some rich person coming from another country,
    putting a foot in our country, and all of a sudden their whole
    family becomes United States citizens.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1998412422344827172?s=20))
-   “I’m one of the people that survived, but they weaponized the
    government. We had the most weaponized government… They indicted me.
    I came out good — here we are in the White House. Things are looking
    nice, but they were vicious… They’re sick people.”
