title: "A CALL TO ACTION: Submit \u201CMedia Bias\u201D Tips"
---
 
The White House recently launched a [Media Bias
Portal](https://www.whitehouse.gov/mediabias/) as a service to truth and
transparency. Its purpose is to combat the baseless lies, purposely
omitted context, and outright left-wing lunacy of the Fake News Media —
a tall task that demands the help of everyone who believes in facts and
accuracy over Fake News.

**That’s why the White House is calling on everyday Americans to support
the truth and hold the Fake News accountable.**
By visiting [whitehouse.gov/biastips](https://www.whitehouse.gov/biastips),
anyone can submit biased or undeniably false articles, and valid
submissions will be used to keep the Media Bias Portal updated.

So-called “journalists” have made it impossible to identify every false
or misleading story, which is why help from the American people is
essential. The days of the Fake News Media controlling the narrative
with lies, fake anonymous sources, and willful bias are over.

If the legacy media won’t honor their responsibility to accurately
inform the public, we know the American people will.
