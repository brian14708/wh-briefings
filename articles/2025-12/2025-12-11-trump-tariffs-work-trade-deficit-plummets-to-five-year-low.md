title: 'Trump Tariffs Work: Trade Deficit Plummets to Five-Year Low'
---
 
The trade deficit has
[narrowed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-11/us-trade-deficit-unexpectedly-shrinks-to-smallest-since-2020?srnd=homepage-americas)
to its smallest since mid-2020, down more than 35% over last year — and
more proof that President Donald J. Trump’s America First trade agenda
is working.

**Here’s what you need to know:**

-   U.S. exports are up 6% over last year — rising to their
    [second-highest](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-11/us-trade-deficit-unexpectedly-shrinks-to-smallest-since-2020?srnd=homepage-americas#:~:text=The%20value%20of%20US%20exports%20rose%203%25%20to%20the%20second%2Dhighest%20level%20on%20record)
    value on record — while Inflation-adjusted exports of consumer goods
    are the
    [largest](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-11/us-trade-deficit-unexpectedly-shrinks-to-smallest-since-2020?srnd=homepage-americas#:~:text=Exports%20of%20consumer%20goods%2C%20after%20adjusting%20for%20price%20changes%2C%20were%20the%20largest%20on%20record.)
    ever.
-   The seasonally adjusted trade deficit with China has
    [narrowed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-11/us-trade-deficit-unexpectedly-shrinks-to-smallest-since-2020?srnd=homepage-americas#:~:text=Meanwhile%2C%20the%20merchandise%2Dtrade%20shortfall%20with%20China%2C%20when%20adjusted%20for%20seasonal%20fluctuations%2C%20narrowed%20to%20the%20second%2Dsmallest%20in%20data%20back%20to%202009.)
    to its second-smallest since 2009.
-   In the third quarter of 2025, real exports grew by a 4.1% annual
    rate and imports fell by around 5% — adding about 1% to real GDP
    growth.
-   As President Trump delivers better terms for American workers,
    farmers, and manufacturers, November’s deficit was [cut by more than
    half](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-posts-173-billion-budget-deficit-november-2025-12-10/)
    compared to the same month last year, fueled by soaring tariff
    revenues.

**President Trump is delivering on his commitment to level the playing
field after decades of weak trade policies allowed foreign countries to
flood our markets with their goods while shutting their own markets to
our producers.**

-   Since announcing his historic trade agenda in April, President
    Trump’s use of tariffs has given him unprecedented leverage to
    secure new and improved trade deals with major U.S. trading partners
    covering more than half of global GDP — including the [United
    Kingdom](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/06/fact-sheet-implementing-the-general-terms-of-the-u-s-uk-economic-prosperity-deal/), [European

-   As President Trump pursues his bold commitment to an America First
    trade agenda, [scores of
    companies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/investments/) have announced
    trillions of dollars in new investment as they onshore workers from
    foreign countries and create tens of thousands of new American jobs
    — [positioning](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/07/icymi-president-trump-announces-92-billion-in-ai-energy-powerhouse-investments/) the
    U.S. as the dominant player for the jobs of the future.
