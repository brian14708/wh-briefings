title: "President Trump Delivers Progress on Lowering Costs \u2014 With Much More\
  \ Relief on the Way"
---
 
**Since taking office, President Donald J. Trump has made substantial
progress reversing the inflation and cost-of-living disaster he
inherited from the recklessness of the Biden Administration.** Inflation
has been cut by more than half, gas prices have fallen sharply, real
wages are growing again, and key household expenses are finally heading
in the right direction.

**But President Trump is also clear: there is still important work ahead
to ensure every American feels the full benefit of lower costs.** While
Democrats attempt to con Americans into believing they’re the champions
of affordability, the reality is that Democrats created the problem —
and President Trump is stopping at nothing to fix it.

## **On inflation**…

**President Trump tamed Biden’s inflation crisis — and is working to
bring it down further.**

-   Under Biden, inflation averaged nearly 5% and [hit
    9.1%](https://x.com/PressSec/status/1989005388671496604) amid the
    worst inflation crisis in decades — fueled by the Radical Left’s
    obsession with spending.
-   In President Trump’s second term, inflation has dropped to an
    average of just 2.7% — the critical first step in reversing
    Democrats’ cost-of-living disaster. In fact, under President Trump,
    Americans have even seen the [first overall price
    decline](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/04/trump-effect-americans-see-first-price-relief-in-years/)
    since 2020.

## **On wages…**

**Under President Trump, Americans have made real wage gains — and work
continues on reversing the damage they suffered under Biden.**

-   Under Biden, Americans workers lost over $2,900 in purchasing power
    because inflation rose faster than wages.
-   In President Trump’s second term — even after accounting for higher
    prices — Americans’ real wages have grown by nearly 4% — or nearly
    $700 — and are on track to grow by nearly $1,200 after his first
    full year in office.

## **On gas prices…**

**Americans are spending less on gas than they have in years — and this
is only the beginning.**

-   Under Biden, gas prices were the [highest they had ever
    been](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3289436/biden-term-highest-gas-prices-us-history/)
    — even after he drained our strategic reserves to artificially
    decrease prices.
-   In President Trump’s second term, gas prices have fallen to the
    lowest average price in [1,682
    days](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/12/gas-prices-plunge-to-new-multi-year-low-and-trending-lower/)
    and Americans on track to spend the [lowest
    amount](https://san.com/cc/americans-on-pace-to-spend-lowest-amount-on-gasoline-in-last-two-decades/#:~:text=WHILE%20FEARS%20ABOUT%20INFLATION%20AND,OF%20THE%20COVID%2D19%20PANDEMIC.&text=THE%20MAIN%20**DRIVER**,THE%20STRAIGHT%20ARROW%20NEWS%20APP.) of
    their disposable income on gas in the last two decades. In fact,
    average gas prices have dipped below $3 per gallon in 36 states,
    below $2.75 per gallon in 20 states, and below $2.50 per gallon in
    five states — with prices below $2 per gallon at some stations
    in [at least four
    states](https://x.com/GasBuddyGuy/status/1998048203376361907).

## **On housing costs…**

**Housing affordability is finally trending in the right direction.**

-   Under Biden, mortgage rates hit their [highest in
    decades](https://fortune.com/2023/09/29/mortgage-rates-two-decade-high-housing-market-home-sales-drag/)
    as rents
    [surged](https://budget.house.gov/imo/media/doc/assessing_bidenflations_impact_on_families1.pdf).
-   At the beginning of December, the average 30-year fixed mortgage
    rate was [6.19%](http://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE30US) —
    12% lower than when President Trump took office in January.
    According to the Consumer Price Index, shelter inflation is at a
    [four-year low](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1OB0r), and the
    national median rent has
    [fallen](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/02/apartment-rents-vacancies-november.html)
    for four straight months.

## **On grocery prices…**

**Prices for everyday staples are starting to see price declines — and
there’s much more to come.**

-   Under President Trump, prices for eggs, butter, ice cream, fresh
    fruit, cereal, fish, seafood, rice, pasta, and ham have all seen
    declines.

## **On everything else…**

**The Trump Administration’s whole-of-government effort will continue
driving prices down, boosting take-home pay, and strengthening the
economy so all Americans can feel relief.**

-   **President Trump signed into law the largest tax cuts in American
    history.** This includes No Tax on Tips, No Tax on Overtime, and No
    Tax on Social Security — all of which will save Americans money in
    their tax returns. This landmark legislation will
    [raise](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Preserving-and-Expanding-Low-Tax-Rates-to-Create-American-Economic-Prosperity.pdf) Americans’
    take-home pay by as much as $13,300 and wages by as much as $11,600.
    In fact, thanks to the landmark law, millions of Americans will see
    [higher tax
    refunds](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tax-refund-1000-higher-2026-piper-sandler-obbba-big-beautiful-bill/)
    — with the average refund estimated to increase by about $1,000 per
    filer.
-   **President Trump’s deregulatory efforts are**
    [**saving**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/president-trumps-deregulation-effort-has-already-saved-families-thousands-of-dollars/)
    **Americans a collective $180 billion — or $2,100 per family of
    four.** For example, President Trump
    [halted](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/president-trump-is-undoing-bidens-economic-damage/)
    burdensome Biden-era efficiency standards that jacked up the price
    of everyday appliances.
-   **American consumers are thriving.** Consumer sentiment is back [on
    the
    rise](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-05/us-consumer-sentiment-rises-for-first-time-in-five-months?srnd=homepage-americas)
    and small business optimism is
    [spiking](https://www.wsj.com/business/entrepreneurship/u-s-small-business-sentiment-inches-up-26689809?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqfgKOGBcPS9gv0TVIs7QT7b_-FTPgaBDAjoeUIXK_M1VRmILUNWXhpV4hzTV8o%3D&gaa_ts=69389310&gaa_sig=BH56xsimp_cs5Pmk1m5eDgXYsuuek7b9rL081SQ4HnwLwn41GXdDDQfSiwd7ljiFTQzhPOgkbUMCEQnd_-P8Hw%3D%3D)

    holiday shoppers and sales.
-   **President Trump is bringing jobs and investment back to the U.S.**
    Since President Trump took office, companies have
    [invested](https://www.whitehouse.gov/investments/) trillions of
    dollars into their U.S.-based operations — onshoring and creating
    hundreds of thousands of new jobs for Americans.
-   **1.9 million more American-born workers are employed today than
    when President Trump took office**. Right now, the U.S. has more
    people working now than at any time in the history of our country.
-   **President Trump is reducing the deficit.** A combination of
    spending cuts, interest savings, economic growth, and tariff
    revenues are
    [expected](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/The-One-Big-Beautiful-Bill-Legislation-for-Historic-Prosperity-and-Deficit-Reduction-1.pdf)
    to reduce the deficit by trillions of dollars — resulting in higher
    take-home pay, lower interest rates, and a stronger economy.

**The Trump Administration will not rest until the high prices that
resulted from Democrat policies are fully reined in.** We’re making
progress — and the best is yet to come.
