**— and**

**lower.** According to
[GasBuddy](https://x.com/GasBuddyGuy/status/1998040188950614213?s=20),
average gas prices have dipped below $3 per gallon in 37 states, below
$2.75 per gallon in 22 states, and below $2.50 per gallon in five
states.

In fact, Americans can even find gas below $2 per gallon at some
stations in [at least four
states](https://x.com/GasBuddyGuy/status/1998048203376361907) — with
[prices](https://www.gasbuddy.com/gasprices/colorado) as low as $1.69
per gallon in Colorado.

Under Biden, gas prices were the [highest they had ever
been](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3289436/biden-term-highest-gas-prices-us-history/),
even after he drained our strategic reserves to artificially decrease
prices. So far in President Trump’s second term, Americans on track to
spend the [lowest

their disposable income on gas in the last two decades amid the Trump
Administration’s pursuit of American energy dominance.

**It’s part of an emerging trend of strong economic news, backed up by
data.** In just the past week, Americans saw the national median rent
[fall](https://x.com/SecretaryTurner/status/1996294100220350935) for the
fourth straight month, weekly jobless claims

[spike](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-05/us-consumer-sentiment-rises-for-first-time-in-five-months?srnd=homepage-americas).

**That’s all good news for American consumers — and much more progress
is on the way.** After four years of Biden’s reckless spending, open
borders, and anti-energy policies that drove inflation through the roof
and crushed working families, the momentum is now unmistakably in the
right direction — and the Trump Administration will stop at nothing to
make sure all Americans feel relief.
