title: 'Trump Delivers: Core Inflation Hits Lowest Level in Nearly Five Years'

> **“Just as President Trump told Americans last night: inflation
> continues to fall, wages continue to rise, and America is trending
> towards a historic economic boom. Today’s report shows that inflation
> came in far lower than market expectations — a stark comparison to the
> record-high 9% inflation crisis caused by Joe Biden. Core inflation is
> at a new multi-year low, as prices for groceries, medicine, gas,
> airfare, car rentals, and hotels keep falling. Americans can expect
> this trend of lower prices and bigger paychecks to continue into the
> New Year!”**

**The latest inflation data shattered economists’ expectations once
again, with core inflation — often called the best measure of inflation
— at its** [**lowest
level**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2001664354174013843) **in
nearly five years.** Inflation is down, gas prices are down, the deficit
is down, wages are up — and as President Donald J. Trump [told the
nation](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2001498834589962357?s=20)
last night, the best is yet to come.

**Here’s what you need to know:**

-   **The era of inflation is over.** The latest data shows the rate of
    inflation down about 70% from its Biden-era peak. In fact, if the
    pace of the past two months were to continue, inflation would be
    running at only 1.2% — far below the Fed’s 2% target.
-   **Prices are moderating.** Over the last two months, prices for
    groceries, dairy, fruits and vegetables, toys, prescription drugs,
    clothing, airfares, natural gas, car and truck rentals, and hotels
    all declined as average gas prices
    [plummet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/12/gas-prices-plunge-to-new-multi-year-low-and-trending-lower/)
    to multi-year lows. Moreover, rent inflation is at its lowest since
    October 2021 as illegals no longer drive-up housing costs.
-   **Wages are up.** Private sector workers are on track to see their
    real wages rise by $1,300 in President Trump’s first full year in
    office as they earn back the purchasing power lost under Biden. Wage
    increases are largest among blue-collar workers, with annualized
    real earnings growth up $1,800 for construction workers and $1,600
    for manufacturing workers.
-   **The so-called “experts” continue to underestimate the Trump
    Economy.** Every single

    and [Dow

    economist was wrong in their projections as tariffs show no
    demonstrable impact on inflation.

**Here’s what they’re saying:**

-   [CNBC’s Steve
    Liesman](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2001651796922482923?s=20):
    “That is a very good number.”
-   [CNN’s Matt
    Egan](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2001653064994828798?s=20):
    “Clearly, this is another step in the right direction.”
-   [Harvard University Professor of Economics & Public Policy Ken
    Rogoff](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2001652780134732233?s=20):
    “A better number than anyone was expecting… Positive news. There’s
    no other way to spin it.”
-   [Economist Steve
    Moore](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2001651907203645602?s=20):
    “Amazing… This is good news for Wall Street; it’s good news for Main
    Street… I got a big smile on my face right before Christmas with
    this number.”
-   [Strategic Wealth Partners CEO Mark
    Tepper](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2001652937412759685?s=20):
    “Incredible. I thought tariffs were supposed to be inflationary, by
    the way, and we’re seeing inflation coming down. The affordability
    gap is closing every single day under President Trump’s watch. We’ve
    seen real wage growth be positive, inflation slowing — this is great
    for America.”
-   [*The Washington Examiner’s* Tiana Lowe
    Doescher](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2001652323215610060?s=20):
    “It’s incredible to look at that core \[inflation\] number… the
    lowest number we’ve had since Biden started this all lighting the
    economy on fire… That is called bringing it back. Well done to
    Donald Trump!”
-   [Bloomberg’s Chris
    Anstey](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-12-18/us-cpi-report-for-november?cursorId=694403B14A180000):
    “The lowest estimate in Bloomberg’s survey of 62 economists was 2.8%
    for the core year-on-year increase. (That was from Citigroup.) And
    the reading came in two tenths below that. Remarkable.”
-   [*The Washington Post’s* Andrew
    Ackerman](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/12/18/inflation-november-consumer-prices/#:~:text=Inflation%20cooled%20unexpectedly%20in%20November%2C%20easing%20pressure%20on%20household%20budgets%20and%20handing%20the%20White%20House%20a%20welcome%20reprieve.):
    “Inflation cooled unexpectedly in November, easing pressure on
    household budgets and handing the White House a welcome reprieve.”

**President Trump took office on a promise to defeat the inflation and
cost-of-living crisis he inherited — and he has unquestionably
delivered, laying the foundation for a banner year ahead.**
