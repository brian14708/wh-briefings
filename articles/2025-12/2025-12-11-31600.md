---
 
**WASHINGTON –** On Thursday, December 11<sup>th</sup>, 2025, Assistant
to the President and OSTP Director Michael Kratsios chaired the third
White House Artificial Intelligence (AI) Education Task Force meeting
with cabinet officials, educators, and parents **to discuss AI’s impact
in the classroom.**

Today’s Task Force meeting aimed to connect Administration officials
with parents and educators to discuss the opportunities and challenges
presented by AI in K-12 education. During the meeting, Task Force
members heard from Chris Woolard with the Ohio Department of Education,
Adeel Khan, the founder and CEO of Magic School, and Tina Descovish,
Co-Founder of Moms for Liberty.

**“The goal in all of our AI education efforts is to demystify these
amazing technologies. If America’s families, young people, and educators
know how AI works, then they can understand what the technology is good
at, and good for, and what it’s bad at, and bad for, and why. When they
understand these tools, then they can fully take advantage of AI
applications with confidence and responsibility,” said OSTP Director
Kratsios.**

Task Force members include the Director of OSTP, the Secretary of
Agriculture, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Education, the
Secretary of Energy, the Director of the National Science Foundation,

for AI & Crypto, and the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff
to the First Lady.

Director Michael Kratsios also highlighted the [Presidential AI

encourages educators and students to develop their AI literacy. Since
the announcement of the challenge, over 5,000 students and 1,000

This Task Force meeting builds upon President Trump’s Executive Order on
[Advancing Artificial Intelligence Education for American
