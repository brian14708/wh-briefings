### **Here’s what you need to know:**

-   **Trump Accounts will be available to every U.S. citizen born
    between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028.** These innovative,
    tax-advantaged savings accounts — created through President Trump’s
    Working Families Tax Cuts Act — enable a generation of American
    children to begin building wealth from the moment they are born.
-   **Each Trump Account will launch with a one-time $1,000 government
    seed contribution.** Families and others can contribute up to $5,000
    annually; the funds will be invested in a broad stock-market index,
    remain private property under guardian control until age 18, and, if
    fully funded and left untouched, could grow to as much as [$1.9
    million](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/bbbs-trump-accounts-kids-could-grow-1-9-million-treasury-says)
    by age 28.
-   **Thanks to the Dell’s unprecedented**
    [**gift**](https://apnews.com/article/michael-dell-susan-trump-accounts-stock-market-poverty-inequality-7e2615d50a3fc0563109ed0eeb4c41e1)**,
    the first 25 million American children age 10 and under living in
    ZIP codes with median incomes below $150,000 will receive an
    additional $250.** This historic act of generosity will give
    millions of low- and middle-income children an even stronger shot at
    achieving the American Dream.

### **Frequently Asked Questions**:

-   **What is a Trump Account?**  
    A Trump Account is a tax-deferred savings account for children
    under 18. The accounts are designed to grow with investment earnings
    over time, and when the child becomes an adult, the accounts
    generally function like a traditional IRA.  
      
-   **Who is eligible?**  
    Any child under 18 with a valid Social Security number may open a
    Trump Account. Parents or guardians must set up and manage the
    account until the child turns 18.  
      
-   **What is the $1,000 government contribution?**  
    The parent or guardian of a child born between calendar year 2025
    and 2028 who is a U.S. citizen with a valid Social Security number
    may choose to have a one-time $1,000 contribution made by Treasury
    to the child’s Trump Account. This contribution does not count
    against the annual $5,000 contribution limit. This benefit is
    available for these children so long as the account is opened before
    the year in which the child turns age 18.  
      
-   **Do Trump Accounts protect taxpayer dollars by preventing waste,
    fraud, and abuse?**  
    Trump Accounts are built with strict safeguards to protect taxpayer
    funds, including requiring a valid Social Security number and
    limiting the one-time $1,000 pilot contribution exclusively to U.S.
    citizens born between calendar years 2025 and 2028, ensuring this
    benefit goes only to eligible American children.  
      
-   **Who can contribute to a Trump Account?**  
    Children, parents or guardians, grandparents, family members,
    friends, and employers (with the first $2,500 per employee per year
    excluded from the employee’s income) may make contributions.
    Additionally, qualifying charitable organizations and government
    entities (e.g., states, tribes, localities, etc.) may make
    contributions for all children in a “qualified class” (e.g., all
    children born in a year, all children in a state, all children
    nationwide, etc.).  
      
-   **How much can be contributed each year?**  
    The annual contribution limit is $5,000 total per child, with
    cost-of-living increases after 2027. Qualifying charitable
    organizations and government entities may make additional
    contributions that do not count toward the $5,000 limit.  
      
-   **When do contributions begin?**  
    Contributions to Trump Accounts will be accepted starting July 4,
    2026.  
      
-   **How are Trump Accounts invested?**  
    By law, Trump Accounts may only be invested in broad U.S. equity
    index funds that track the overall U.S. stock market (e.g., S&P
    500), do not use leverage, and charge no more than 0.10% in annual
    fees.  
      
-   **Can money be withdrawn before age 18?**  
    No. Funds may not be withdrawn before the child turns 18, except for
    a rollover of the entire account to a Trump Account with another
    brokerage (trustee-to-trustee transfer), certain rollovers to an
    ABLE account in the year the child turns 17, or distribution upon
    death. After age 18, standard IRA rules for withdrawals apply.  
      
-   **What happens when the child turns 18?**  
    At age 18, the account is generally treated like a traditional IRA.
    The account holder may continue contributing subject to IRA rules
    and earned income requirements. Withdrawals follow traditional IRA
    rules and the account holder may be subject to a 10% additional tax
    for any withdrawal before age 59 ½, unless an exception (such as for
    distributions for higher education expenses or first home purchases)
    applies.  
      
-   **How do I open a Trump Account for my child?**  
    Use IRS Form 4547 to make the election to establish an initial Trump
    Account for the exclusive benefit of a child who is eligible; also
    use Form 4547 to make an election for the $1,000 pilot program
    contribution from the U.S. Treasury to the child’s Trump Account if
    they are eligible for the contribution. After the election is made,
    beginning in May 2026, Treasury or its agent will send information
    to the individual who made the election to activate the account
    through an authentication process and complete the opening of the
    initial Trump account.  
      
-   **When can I open a Trump Account for my child?**  
    IRS Form 4547 can be filed at any time, including at the same time
    as the electing individual’s 2025 income tax return is filed.
    Beginning mid-2026, these elections can also be made through an
    online account at [trumpaccounts.gov](http://trumpaccounts.gov).  
      
-   **Where will the Trump Account be held? Can I use my preferred
    brokerage firm?**  
    All Trump Accounts will initially be created and held with
    Treasury’s designated financial agent. At a later date, parents or
    guardians will be able to transfer the full balance of a Trump
    Account to their preferred brokerage firm through a simple
    trustee-to-trustee rollover.  
      
-   **Can my employer offer Trump Account contributions through a
    cafeteria plan?**  
    Yes. Pre-tax salary-reduction contributions will be allowed to Trump
    Accounts owned by an employee’s dependent child through an
    employer-sponsored cafeteria plan, up to $2,500 per employee per
    year.
