title: This Is Who Democrats Like Tim Walz Are Defending
---
 
**The streets of Minneapolis are safer today thanks to the hard work of
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and their federal partners
during** [**Operation Metro
Surge**](https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-minnesota-ice-arrests-dhs-operation-metro-surge/601539892)**.**

**President Trump has**
[**long**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1996615775109689367) **—
and rightly — called out the problems associated with unchecked Somali
refugee resettlement in Minnesota.** Aside from the [massive fraud
scandal](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/12/yes-theres-something-wrong-with-walz-and-it-cost-taxpayers-1-billion/)
that bilked taxpayers out of $1 billion, the state’s Somali population
has also become exceptionally
[vulnerable](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1996448720754504160)
to
[radicalization](https://www.leg.mn.gov/docs/2016/mandated/160141.pdf#page=5)
— with terror networks viewing Minnesota as “[prime recruitment
grounds](https://www.leg.mn.gov/docs/2016/mandated/160141.pdf#page=5).”

**Thankfully, the Trump Administration is taking strong and decisive
action.** In addition to [pausing
migration](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115625427648743414)
from third-world countries incompatible with American values, the Trump
Administration is also swiftly removing public safety threats off the
streets of Minneapolis — as Democrats like Gov. Tim Walz and [Mayor
Jacob Frey](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1996776463228367151)
sanctimoniously complain.

**Here are only a few of the** [**would-be
astronauts**](https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/media/michael-moore-says-deported-migrants-could-have-cured-cancer/)
**and scientists who are no longer terrorizing the streets of
Minneapolis thanks to** [**Operation Metro
Surge**](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/12/04/ice-arrests-worst-worst-criminal-illegal-aliens-during-operation-metro-surge)**:**
