Today’s [jobs report](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm)
shows the strength of President Donald J. Trump’s economy is in the
private sector — where it should be.

**Here’s what you need to know:**

-   Since September, the private sector has gained 121,000 jobs, while
    the federal government has
    [shed](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm#:~:text=Federal%20government%20employment,the%20establishment%20survey.))
    168,000 jobs as the Trump Administration shrinks the runaway federal
    bureaucracy.
    -   <span style="letter-spacing: 0.2px">Federal employment is now at
        the lowest level in over a decade — down 271,000 jobs since
        President Trump took office.</span>
    -   Since August, the private sector has added 225,000 jobs.
-   Under President Trump, 100% of the job growth has come in the
    private sector and among [native-born
    Americans](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNU02073413) — [NOT
    illegals](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNU02073395).

        687,000 private sector jobs.</span>
    -   Between January and November 2025, 2.7 million
        native-born Americans
        [GAINED](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNU02073413)
        employment, while 972,000 foreign-born workers
        [LOST](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNU02073395) employment;
        2.75 million

        [JOINED](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNU01073413) the labor

-   52,000 construction jobs have been
    [added](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES2000000001) over the past
    three months as we build in America — with American workers leading
    the way.
-   Americans’ real wages are on track to rise by 4.2% in the first full
    year of the Trump Administration — far outpacing inflation and a
    complete reversal from the Biden era.
-   Labor force participation
    [rose](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000) between
    September and November as more Americans come back to the workforce
    in the Trump Economy.
    -   The slight increase in the unemployment rate is entirely because
        more Americans are jumping back into the job market as the
        booming Trump Economy brings them off the sidelines.
-   The Democrat Shutdown is
    [estimated](https://katv.com/news/nation-world/60k-private-sector-jobs-lost-during-shutdown-white-house-economic-adviser-says-economy-labor-market-government-business)
    to have cost the private sector as many as 62,000 new jobs in
    October.
