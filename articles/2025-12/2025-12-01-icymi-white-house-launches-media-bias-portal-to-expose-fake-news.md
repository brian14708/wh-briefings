title: "ICYMI: White House Launches \u201CMedia Bias\u201D Portal to Expose Fake News"
---
 
The White House just dropped a flamethrower on the Fake News Media: a
[new public database](https://www.whitehouse.gov/mediabias/) that
catalogs the avalanche of lies, deliberate distortions, and manufactured
hoaxes churned out by activist “journalists” and their failing outlets.

Now live at [wh.gov/mediabias](https://www.whitehouse.gov/mediabias/),
the site lays bare the offending “journalists” and their outlets
alongside the *actual* facts they attempted to bury, twist, or invent.
Fully sortable and routinely updated, it ensures no hoax, no anonymously
“sourced” fan fiction, and no partisan smear gets memory-holed again.

Coupled with the White House [Rapid Response account on
X](https://www.x.com/rapidresponse47), the Trump Administration is
pushing back in real time to ensure the American people get the
unfiltered truth — no ideological filter, no corporate spin, only the
facts so they can decide for themselves.
