In a powerful primetime [address to the
nation](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2001498834589962357) last
night from the White House, President Donald J. Trump reflected on the
transformative progress achieved in just 11 months — [turning the
tide](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/12/democrats-caused-high-prices-president-trump-is-bringing-them-down/)
on inflation and costs, securing the border, and honoring our military
with a special [Warrior
Dividend](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2001476701436420554) —
while promising even greater prosperity, tax relief, and renewed respect
for America in the year ahead.

**Here’s what you missed:**

-   “Over the past 11 months, we have brought more positive change to
    Washington than any Administration in American history.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2001474404899807408))
-   “For the last four years, the United States was ruled by politicians
    who fought only for insiders, illegal aliens, career criminals,
    corporate lobbyists, prisoners, terrorists, and above all, foreign
    nations… Now, you have a President who fights for the law-abiding,
    hardworking people of our country — the ones who make this nation
    run.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2001474804348510396))
-   “We inherited the worst border anywhere in the world and we quickly
    turned it into the strongest border in the history of our country.
    In other words, in a few short months, we went from worst to best.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2001474967347835385))
-   “We’re deporting criminals \[and\] restoring safety to our most
    dangerous cities… Drugs brought in by ocean and by sea are now down
    by 94%. We have broken the grip of sinister, woke radicals in our
    schools… I’ve restored American Strength, settled eight wars in ten
    months, destroyed the Iran nuclear threat, and ended the war in
    Gaza.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2001475544635068686))
-   “We’re bringing our economy back from the brink of ruin… Under the
    Biden Administration, car prices rose 22%, and in many states, 30%
    or more. Gasoline rose 30% to 50%. Hotel rates rose 37%. Airfares
    rose 31%. Now, under our leadership, they are all coming down — and
    they’re coming down fast.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2001475912643060084))
-   “I am also proud to announce that more than 1,450,000 military
    service members will receive a special Warrior Dividend before
    Christmas… In honor of our nation’s founding in 1776, we are sending
    every soldier $1,776 — and the checks are already on the way.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2001476701436420554))
-   “Next year, you will also see the results of the largest tax cuts in
    American history… Many families will be saving between $11,000 and
    $20,000 dollars a year, and next Spring is projected to be the
    largest tax refund season of all time.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2001476724564070471))
-   “On Day One, I declared a national energy emergency. Gasoline is now
    under $2.50 a gallon in much of the country.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2001477919865213145))
-   “For the first time in 50 years, we are now seeing reverse
    migration… leaving more housing and more jobs for Americans.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2001478484552749428))
-   “The yearly cost of a typical new mortgage increased by $15,000
    dollars under Democrat rule. In 11 months, I have already gotten
    that annual cost down by $3,000 dollars.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2001477956955443563))
-   “I’ve secured a record-breaking $18 trillion dollars of investment
    into the United States — which means jobs, wage increases, growth,
    factory openings, and far greater national security.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2001476352315429273))
-   “I’m also taking on the gigantic health insurance companies that
    have gotten rich on billions of dollars of money that should go
    directly to the people… so they can buy their own health insurance,
    which will give far better benefits at much lower costs.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2001477172108611796))
-   “I’m doing what no politician of either party has ever done —
    standing up to the special interests to dramatically reduce the
    price of prescription drugs…”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2001477670299681212))
-   “After 11 months, our border is secure, inflation is stopped, wages
    are up, prices are down, our nation is strong, America is respected,
    and our country is back… We’re poised for an economic boom the likes
    of which the world has never seen.”
