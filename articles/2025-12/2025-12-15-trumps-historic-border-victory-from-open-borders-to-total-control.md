---
 
**Today, President Donald J. Trump will award the** [**newly
established**](https://www.army.mil/article/288060/hegseth_announces_establishment_of_mexican_border_defense_medal)
**Mexican Border Defense Medal to U.S. service members for their
extraordinary work to safeguard our nation’s southern border and uphold
American sovereignty.**

Under President Trump’s decisive leadership, the southern border has
undergone a profound transformation to turn back the invasion unleashed
by the Biden Administration — achieving levels of security unseen in
decades. By reversing Biden-era failed policies and swiftly implementing
robust enforcement, the Trump Administration has restored order,
deterred illegal entries, and protected American communities from the
threats posed by unchecked migration, transnational crime, and fentanyl
trafficking.

**Here’s what you need to know about the success of President Trump’s
unprecedented border security effort in his second term:**

-   More than 2.5 million illegal aliens have been
    [removed](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/12/11/trumps-dhs-celebrates-record-breaking-over-2-5-million-illegals-leaving-us/)
    from the United States.

    their streets.
-   The number of Americans dying from drugs has
    [fallen](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1994175716343034035)
    every single month as the Trump Administration [stems the

-   The Laken Riley Act was

    violent crimes are detained.

    [enhanced](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/uscis-increases-screening-vetting-of-aliens-working-in-us)

    country.

**All we needed was a new President:**

-   Beginning on Day One, President Trump reversed dangerous, Biden-era
    policies that invited millions of illegal aliens into our country —

    Sinaloa Cartel, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, the United
    Cartels, the Gulf Cartel, the Northeast Cartel, and the Michoacán
    Family — as Foreign Terrorist Organizations.
-   President Trump’s landmark One Big Beautiful Bill makes the
    largest-ever one-time investment in border security — allowing the
    Trump Administration to fortify the extraordinary progress for
    decades to come.
