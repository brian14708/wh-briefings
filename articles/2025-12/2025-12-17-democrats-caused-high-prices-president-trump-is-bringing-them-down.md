title: Democrats Caused High Prices. President Trump Is Bringing Them Down.
---
 
**President Donald J. Trump took office on a promise to defeat inflation
and bring down costs — and 11 months later, he has made substantial
progress in reversing the inflation and cost-of-living disaster he
inherited.** Inflation has been cut by more than half, gas prices have
fallen sharply, real wages are growing again, and key household expenses
are finally heading in the right direction.

## **President Trump tamed Biden’s inflation crisis — and is working to bring it down further.**

**Democrats caused it.** Under Biden, inflation averaged nearly 5% and
[hit 9.1%](https://x.com/PressSec/status/1989005388671496604) amid the
worst inflation crisis in decades — fueled by the Radical Left’s
obsession with spending.

**President Trump is fixing it.** In President Trump’s second term,
inflation has dropped to an average of just 2.7% — the critical first
step in reversing Democrats’ cost-of-living disaster. In fact, under
President Trump, Americans have even seen the [first overall price
decline](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/04/trump-effect-americans-see-first-price-relief-in-years/)
since 2020. Core inflation — often called the best measure of inflation
— is now lower than it was at any time during the last three years of
the Biden Administration.

## **Prices are declining — and there’s much more to come.**

**Democrats caused it.** Under Biden, prices rose across the board; for
example, car prices rose 22%, gas prices rose 30%, hotel rates rose 37%,
and airfares rose 31%.

**President Trump is fixing it.** Under President Trump, prices for
eggs, butter, ice cream, fresh fruit, cereal, fish, seafood, rice,
pasta, and ham have all seen declines — while the price of a
Thanksgiving turkey this year was
[down](https://www.fb.org/news-release/cost-of-thanksgiving-dinner-declines#:~:text=Individual%20Prices,in%20the%20West%20at%20$84.97.)
nearly one-third compared to its Biden-era high. Other everyday
essentials, like toothpaste, shampoo, toilet paper, laundry detergent,
and diapers, have all
substantially [decreased](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/11/new-data-lower-prices-bigger-paychecks/) in
price over the past year.

Moreover, households heated by propane or heating oil will [pay
less](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/perspectives/2025/10-winterfuels/article.php)
to heat their homes this winter than last winter. In fact, since
President Trump took office, prices for propane, kerosene, firewood, and
fuel oil are all down.

Finally, after increasing 9% in total under Biden, prescription drug
prices fell in President Trump’s first eight months in office. Now,
thanks to President Trump’s relentless “Most Favored Nation” push, drug
prices will come down even further with unprecedented deals that lower
the costs for inhalers, arthritis medication, obesity drugs, infertility
medicine, and other items.

## **Under President Trump, Americans have made real wage gains — and work continues on reversing the damage they suffered under Biden.**

**Democrats caused it.** Under Biden, Americans’ real wages plummeted by
nearly $3,000.

**President Trump is fixing it.** For the first time in years, wages are
rising much faster than inflation. In President Trump’s second term,
even after accounting for higher prices, Americans’ real wages are on
track to grow by more than $1,000 after his first full year in office —
and much more for workers in certain industries.

## **Americans are spending less on gas than they have in years as prices continue to fall.**

**Democrats caused it.** Under Biden, gas prices were the [highest they
had ever
been](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3289436/biden-term-highest-gas-prices-us-history/),
setting multiple all-time record highs despite draining our strategic
reserves to artificially decrease prices.

**President Trump is fixing it.** In President Trump’s second term, gas
prices have fallen to the lowest average price in [1,741
days](https://www.gasbuddy.com/go/average-gas-prices-fall-for-third-straight-week-reaching-fresh-multi-year-low)
and Americans on track to spend the [lowest
amount](https://san.com/cc/americans-on-pace-to-spend-lowest-amount-on-gasoline-in-last-two-decades/#:~:text=WHILE%20FEARS%20ABOUT%20INFLATION%20AND,OF%20THE%20COVID%2D19%20PANDEMIC.&text=THE%20MAIN%20**DRIVER**,THE%20STRAIGHT%20ARROW%20NEWS%20APP.) of
their disposable income on gas in the last two decades. In fact, average
gas prices have dipped below $3 per gallon in 39 states, below $2.75 per
gallon in 24 states, and below $2.50 per gallon in seven states. Prices
at some stations are even below $2 per gallon in [seven
states](https://x.com/GasBuddyGuy/status/2001043899742130408).

## **After Biden’s open borders agenda decimated the housing market for law-abiding Americans, affordability is finally trending in the right direction.**

**Democrats caused it.** Under Biden, mortgage rates hit their [highest
in
decades](https://fortune.com/2023/09/29/mortgage-rates-two-decade-high-housing-market-home-sales-drag/)
as rents
[surged](https://budget.house.gov/imo/media/doc/assessing_bidenflations_impact_on_families1.pdf).

**President Trump is fixing it.** At the beginning of December, the
average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was
[6.19%](http://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE30US) — 12% lower than
when President Trump took office in January, saving Americans $3,000 per
year on new mortgages. According to the Consumer Price Index, shelter
inflation is at a [four-year
low](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1OB0r), and the national
median rent has
[fallen](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/02/apartment-rents-vacancies-november.html)
for four straight months.

## **Even with all the progress, there is still important work ahead to make sure every American feels the full benefit of lower costs.**

-   **Every American will benefit from the largest tax cuts in
    history.** This includes No Tax on Tips, No Tax on Overtime, and No
    Tax on Social Security — all of which will save Americans money in
    their tax returns. This landmark legislation will
    [raise](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Preserving-and-Expanding-Low-Tax-Rates-to-Create-American-Economic-Prosperity.pdf) Americans’
    take-home pay by as much as $13,300 and wages by as much as $11,600.
    In fact, thanks to the landmark law, millions of Americans will see
    [higher tax
    refunds](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tax-refund-1000-higher-2026-piper-sandler-obbba-big-beautiful-bill/)
    — with the average refund estimated to increase by about $1,000 per
    filer.
-   **President Trump’s deregulatory efforts are**
    [**saving**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/president-trumps-deregulation-effort-has-already-saved-families-thousands-of-dollars/)
    **Americans a collective $180 billion — or $2,100 per family of
    four.** For example, President Trump
    [halted](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/president-trump-is-undoing-bidens-economic-damage/)
    burdensome Biden-era efficiency standards that jacked up the price
    of everyday appliances.
-   **American consumers are thriving.** Consumer sentiment is back [on
    the
    rise](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-05/us-consumer-sentiment-rises-for-first-time-in-five-months?srnd=homepage-americas)

    holiday shoppers and sales.
-   **President Trump is bringing jobs and investment back to the U.S.**
    Since President Trump took office, companies have
    [invested](https://www.whitehouse.gov/investments/) trillions of
    dollars into their U.S.-based operations — onshoring and creating
    hundreds of thousands of new jobs for Americans.
-   **2.7 million more American-born workers are employed today than
    when President Trump took office**. Right now, the U.S. has more
    people working now than at any time in the history of our country.
-   **The stock market is thriving.** Since President Trump’s election,
    the stock market has set [51 all-time record
    highs](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SP500).
-   **President Trump is reducing the deficit.** A combination of
    spending cuts, interest savings, economic growth, and tariff
    revenues are
    [expected](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/The-One-Big-Beautiful-Bill-Legislation-for-Historic-Prosperity-and-Deficit-Reduction-1.pdf)
    to reduce the deficit by trillions of dollars — resulting in higher
    take-home pay, lower interest rates, and a stronger economy.
    Meanwhile, the trade deficit has already narrowed to its smallest
    since mid-2020 — down more than 35% over last year.
-   **President Trump eliminated Biden’s expensive fuel efficiency
    standards for cars.** The Biden Administration’s unrealistic
    standards would’ve forced Americans into expensive electric
    vehicles, raising the cost of vehicles — and stopping it will save
    American families [$109
    billion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/12/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-announces-the-reset-of-corporate-average-fuel-economy-cafe-standards/)
    over the next five years.
