from the One Big Beautiful Bill, the Trump Administration is swiftly
moving forward to build hundreds of miles of new border wall and make
other technological and safety improvements that will make the southern
border the most secure in modern history.

[**From *The Washington
Times***](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/aug/31/trump-won-border-wall-battle/)**:**

*“Just months into his new term, Mr. Trump already has 100 miles of
border barrier in the works and Capitol Hill just approved an additional
$46.5 billion to add hundreds more miles to that total, finishing out
his marquee promise from his 2016 campaign.*

*The money was approved this summer with barely a whimper from lawmakers
as part of Mr. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill budget law…*

*Customs and Border Protection said it already has 83 miles of
traditional wall and 17 miles of waterborne barriers either under
construction or in planning, using money left over from the first Trump
administration. Those are dollars President Biden slow-walked, but which
never expired and were waiting for the new president in January.*

*CBP also says it already has a ‘robust acquisition strategy’ to spend
the new money, which will fill out Mr. Trump’s border wall vision and
fill in gaps Mr. Biden left when he halted all construction on his first
day in office in 2021.* *…*

*Art Del Cueto, a former Border Patrol agent who’s now with the
Federation for American Immigration Reform, said the lower numbers
aren’t a reason to let up on border improvements.*

*He said walls work by shaping how illegal immigrants attempt to cross.
That means agents can be better positioned to respond and catch the
people who do make it over.”*
