Today, President Donald J. Trump joined Administration officials to
announce major progress in understanding the root causes of autism,
which has
[exploded](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1970229029400911992) in
diagnoses over the past two decades, and unveil [bold new
initiatives](https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-trump-kennedy-autism-initiatives-leucovorin-tylenol-research-2025.html)
to tackle the autism epidemic.

Predictably, the Fake News immediately went into frenzied
hyperventilation with their usual smears, distortions, and lies.

**FACT: Evidence suggests acetaminophen use in pregnant women,
especially late in pregnancy, may cause long-term neurological effects
in their children.**

-   Large-scale cohort studies — including [the Nurses’ Health Study
    II](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30923825/) and the [Boston Birth
    Cohort](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31664451/) — report
    associations between in utero exposure and later diagnoses of autism
    spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
    (ADHD).
-   Scientists have
    [proposed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35450103/) biological
    mechanisms linking prenatal acetaminophen exposure to altered brain
    development and adverse birth outcomes.

    funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), of
    the potential risks of acetaminophen use during pregnancy… We found
    evidence of an association between exposure to acetaminophen during
    pregnancy and increased incidence of neurodevelopmental disorders in
    children.”

-   In 2021, an international [consensus
    statement](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34556849/) highlighted “a
    call for precautionary action,” recommending that pregnant women
    “minimize exposure” to acetaminophen “by using the lowest effective
    dose for the shortest possible time.”
