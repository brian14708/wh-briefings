**Wholesale inflation**
[**fell**](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/10/ppi-inflation-august-2025-.html)
**in August —**
[**smashing**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-10/us-producer-prices-unexpectedly-drop-first-decline-since-april?srnd=homepage-americas)
**economists’ expectations — as President Donald J. Trump continues to
make good on his promise to tame inflation.** The number underscores
what the Trump Administration has been
[saying](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/bessent-defends-trumps-tariffs-against-claims-harm-us-businesses)
all along: American consumers are seeing little effect on prices from
tariffs. 

**Here’s what you need to know:**

-   The Producer Price Index (PPI), which serves as a
    [bellwether](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/10/economy/us-producer-price-index-ppi-august) for
    prices consumers may see in the months ahead, came in at 2.6%
    year-over-year in August — far below economists’
    [expectations](https://www.barrons.com/articles/ppi-wholesale-inflation-data-august-83ddcabb)
    of 3.3%.
    -   Wholesale prices declined in August from the month prior — also
        defying economists’
        [expectations](https://www.marketwatch.com/economy-politics/calendar).

    <!-- -->

    -   Prices for energy goods, trade services, and final demand
        services all fell in August.
-   President Trump was right again:
    companies [refrained](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-10/us-producer-prices-unexpectedly-drop-first-decline-since-april) from
    outsized price increases last month despite tariffs.
-   This comes as small business optimism is [on the
    rise](https://x.com/Stephanie_Link/status/1965411223740318149) —
    increasing in August to its highest level since January and above
    its historical average.

**Here’s what they’re saying:**

-   [**CNBC’s Rick
    Santelli**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1965761591179182133)**:
    “**Boy, I’m surprised — real progress here. 2.6% on the
    year-over-year headline. We were expecting 3.3%!”
-   [**Allianz Chief Economic Advisor Mohamed
    El-Erian**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1965765484793692466)**:**
    “What we’re learning is that the final impact on the consumer is
    much less than people expected… If the Fed is truly data dependent,
    the question should be, ‘Why not 50 \[basis points\]?’”
-   [**Bullseye Investment Group’s Adam
    Johnson**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1965762198237769831)**:**
    “This is fantastic news. Producer prices much lower than we thought…
    I thought we were going to see some of the tariff impact in this
    inflation data. We haven’t seen it. 2.6% was the PPI. We thought it
    was going to be 3.3%. This is just such wonderful news. I’m
    thrilled.”
-   [**Fox Business Network’s Cheryl
    Casone**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1965762468694863968)**:**
    “That tariff \[price\] impact… not seeing it — and here we go with a
    very positive and good inflation report coming out.”
-   [**CNBC’s Becky
    Quick**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1965762391620391046)**:**
    “That’s a real shocker, Steve, the idea that inflation is so much
    weaker than anticipated.”
-   [**Allianz Chief Economic Advisor Mohamed
    El-Erian**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1965764846072582464)**:**
    “There’s the exporter, there’s the importer, and there’s the
    consumer — and so far, the consumer is carrying the least of the
    burden.”
