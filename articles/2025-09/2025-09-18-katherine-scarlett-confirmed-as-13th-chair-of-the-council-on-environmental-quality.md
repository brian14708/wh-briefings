title: Katherine Scarlett Confirmed as 13th Chair of the Council on Environmental
  Quality
---
 
Today, the United States Senate confirmed Katherine Scarlett as the
Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). She will serve
as President Trump’s advisor on policies that promote environmental
quality and lead the implementation of the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA) to ensure timely environmental review and permitting
processes across the Federal government to support the economic
prosperity and energy security of the American people.

  
“I’m extraordinarily grateful to President Trump for affording me the
opportunity to lead the Council on Environmental Quality,” said
Katherine Scarlett. “I will work hard every day to leverage this
Nation’s environmental policies and technologies to grow the American
economy while ensuring that every American has clean air, clean water,
and clean land.”

  
With years of experience dedicated to the intersection of environmental
policy and infrastructure permitting, Scarlett has received widespread
support across government and industry:

**American Exploration & Production Council**  
“Under President Trump, the Council on Environmental Quality has
achieved significant progress to restore common sense to the permitting
process. AXPC congratulates Katherine Scarlett on her confirmation and
looks forward to collaborating with her to continue advancing smart,
durable reforms to the environmental review process across agencies to
unleash American energy and grow the economy,” said American Exploration
& Production Council CEO Anne Bradbury.

**America First Policy Institute**  
“It is our belief that Ms. Scarlett, through her time in the Senate
Environment and Public Works Committee, the White House Permitting
Council, and as CEQ’s Chief of Staff, has demonstrated a commitment to
providing Americans with clean air, water, and land by improving
environmental reviews and cutting down on onerous regulations that have
stifled American prosperity and growth.”

**American Petroleum Institute**  
“Katherine Scarlett’s extensive policy experience and ability to work
across government and industry make her exceptionally well qualified to
lead the Council on Environmental Quality. Her pragmatic, results-driven
approach will be critical to advancing balanced policies that support
President Trump’s energy dominance agenda and deliver the permitting
reform needed to unlock America’s full potential,” said Kristin Whitman,
American Petroleum Institute Senior Vice President of Federal Relations.

**American Wildlife Conservation Partners**  
“Throughout her public service, Scarlett has demonstrated a strong
understanding of the importance of conserving wildlife habitat,
expanding access to public lands, and ensuring that federal
environmental policies align with the priorities of sportsmen and women.
Her leadership will be vital in ensuring CEQ continues to serve as a
fair and effective advisor to the President while supporting outdoor
traditions and sustainable resource use.”

**ClearPath**  
“CEQ plays an important role in coordinating the federal permitting
process and will be well-suited to deploy advanced technology and
process improvements under Chair Scarlett’s strong leadership,” said
ClearPath Action CEO Jeremy Harrell. “As Congress begins debate on a
robust bipartisan permitting modernization, we look forward to working
with CEQ to let America build.”

**Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation**  
“The Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation (CSF) congratulates Katherine
Scarlett for being confirmed as the Chair of CEQ. Katherine is a
thoughtful and pragmatic consensus builder that has been a steadfast
champion for sportsmen and women during her time on Capitol Hill and
with the Administration,” said CSF Senior Vice President Taylor Schmitz.
“Katherine brings a strong track record of success to CEQ, and CSF looks
forward to working with her as the Chair of the Council on Environmental
Quality.”

**National Association of Manufacturers**  
“As Congress works toward permitting reform that will unlock
manufacturing investment, innovation and growth, CEQ will play a
critical role in implementing any final legislation that is passed. Ms.
Scarlett, with her years as a senior professional staffer on the Senate
Environment and Public Works Committee and in the executive branch, has
the expertise to faithfully implement Congressional intent of the
permitting reforms manufacturers desperately need,” said NAM Managing
Vice President of Policy, Charles Crain.

**National Rural Electric Cooperative Association**  
“Under Katherine Scarlett’s leadership, CEQ is well-positioned to guide
federal agencies in implementing the 2023 bipartisan Fiscal
Responsibility Act amendments to NEPA and the Supreme Court’s Seven
County decision. NRECA looks forward to working with CEQ as it
coordinates efforts to modernize and accelerate NEPA reviews and
permitting as co-ops work to build and improve electric and broadband
infrastructure,” said National Rural Electric Cooperative Association’s
Senior Vice President for Government Relations Louis Finkel.

**U.S. Chamber of Commerce**  
“Throughout her career, Ms. Scarlett has demonstrated an ability to
navigate complex policy matters and foster collaboration. She previously
served as Chief of Staff for the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering
Council, now the Permitting Council, and at CEQ from 2018 to 2020 prior
to her current CEQ role. She also worked on an array of environmental
and permitting policy topics for the Senate Environment and Public Works
Committee, where she consistently advanced policies that balance
economic growth with environmental stewardship. Ms. Scarlett understands
the intricacies involved in federal environmental policy,” said U.S.
Chamber of Commerce Executive Vice President, Chief Policy Officer, and
Head of Strategic Advocacy, Neil L. Bradley.

**Water and Sewer Distributors of America**  
“Our organization particularly supports Ms. Scarlett’s previous and
ongoing efforts to bring commonsense and reform to overly burdensome and
complex permitting policies that make it far too easy to block and delay
the building of critical water and other utility-based infrastructure.”

**U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Chairman of the Senate
Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee**  
“Katherine Scarlett is well qualified to be Chairman of the White House
Council on Environmental Quality, and her knowledge and experience
regarding environmental issues position her well to move the Trump
administration’s priorities forward. Katherine proved herself as a vital
member of my EPW Committee staff, displaying a deep understanding of
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) provisions and how they impact
communities in West Virginia and across the country. In her current
role, Katherine is working with federal agencies to implement the
bipartisan Fiscal Responsibility Act, coordinating updates to agencies’
individual NEPA procedures to reflect recent court decisions and
executive policies, and helping modernize the NEPA process through the
use of technology. She is an excellent choice to take on this role and
I’m excited she can now bring her valuable perspective to CEQ as
Chairman.”

**U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND)**  
“Katherine Scarlett is the right person to lead @WHCEQ47. Her experience
in both the legislative and executive branches is what’s needed to
refine cumbersome permitting processes, promote innovation across the
federal government, and keep the Council on Environmental Quality within
the confines of the law.”

**Chairman James L. Connaughton, Council on Environmental Quality,
2001-2009**  
“Congratulations to Katherine Scarlett on her confirmation as the 13th
Chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. For 55 years,
CEQ has helped inspire, initiate, mediate, negotiate, and guide the
implementation of our nation’s environmental laws, programs, and
international agreements in collaboration with the Congress, the States
and global partners. I look forward to Chair Scarlett improving on this
proud legacy by providing wise counsel to President Trump and her
Administration colleagues, and by assuring that ‘man and nature can
exist in productive harmony’ using 21st century policy, permitting,
management, technology, and legal innovations.”

**Chairman Mary Neumayr, Council on Environmental Quality, 2019-2021**  
“Through her experience in a variety of roles in the Executive and
Legislative Branches, Ms. Scarlett has gained experience and knowledge
relating to the functions and operations of CEQ, and specifically with
regard to implementation of the National Environmental Policy Act and
infrastructure permitting matters. She is very practical, diligent and
professional and has a willingness to consider all views and to work
efficiently and effectively with colleagues.”
