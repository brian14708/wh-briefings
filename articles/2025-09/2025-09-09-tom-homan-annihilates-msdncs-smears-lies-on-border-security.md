title: "Tom Homan Annihilates MSDNC\u2019s Smears, Lies on Border Security \U0001F525"
---
 
**This morning, the Trump Administration’s legendary Border Czar Tom
Homan delivered a clinic in beating back the endless smears and lies
from the Fake News.** In an
[interview](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1965413836720394317) on
MSDNC’s “Morning Joe,” Homan quickly dismantled every lie and Democrat
talking point regurgitated by “Morning Mika” Brzezinski, who was
completely out of her depth.

***Morning Mika repeatedly demanded “to see that data” after Homan noted
that 70% of ICE arrests are criminals, while the others are national
security threats or gang members who often lack a criminal history.***

-   **FACT:** [**70% of ICE
    arrests**](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/07/22/ice-arrests-worst-worst-criminal-illegal-aliens)
    **have involved illegal aliens convicted of, or charged with,
    crimes.** According to the [Center for Immigration
    Studies](https://cis.org/Arthur/Trump-vs-Biden-ICE-Arrests-Removals),
    35.7% of the illegal aliens in ICE detention have criminal
    convictions, 30.5% have pending criminal charges, and the remaining
    33.8% are “other immigration violators” — while [nearly
    70%](https://cis.org/Arthur/Trump-vs-Biden-ICE-Arrests-Removals#:~:text=Again%2C%20roughly%20two%2Dthirds%20of%20the%20aliens%20removed%20by%20ICE%20after%20ICE%20detention%20under%20Trump%20II%20had%20criminal%20histories.)
    of those removed from the country have criminal histories. As a
    result of this unprecedented effort,

    have been taken off our streets.

***Homan*** [***set the record
straight***](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1965408503805477363)
***on their implication that ICE is “racial profiling.”***

-   **FACT:** The Supreme Court has
    [upheld](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/25a169_5h25.pdf)
    the Trump Administration’s legal right to stop individuals to
    briefly question them on their legal status. This has long been the
    federal government’s “[well
    settled](https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1037&context=jleg)”
    practice
    [authorized](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1357) by the
    Immigration and Nationality Act. The ability of federal officers “to
    interrogate any alien or person believed to be an alien as to his
    right to be or to remain in the United States” is NOT “racial
    profiling.”

***Morning Mika repeatedly cited the case of Narciso Barranco, who she
claims was merely “cutting bushes at an IHOP” before he was “surrounded
by ICE agents wearing masks and dragged into a car.”***

-   **FACT:** He is an illegal immigrant who
    [refused](https://www.foxla.com/news/narciso-barranco-oc-gardener-arrested-ice#:~:text=According%20to%20DHS,to%20identify%20himself.)
    to identify himself to federal law enforcement, refused to comply
    with their commands, then
    [assaulted](https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1937206354218725806) agents
    with a weed whacker as he [attempted to
    flee](https://www.foxla.com/news/narciso-barranco-oc-gardener-arrested-ice#:~:text=According%20to%20DHS,to%20identify%20himself.)
    through a busy intersection.

***Homan***
[***torched***](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1965412418072576443)
***Morning Mika for suggesting that ICE is “disappearing” people —
correctly noting the “1,000% increase in the assaults on ICE officers”
largely due to that reckless rhetoric.***

-   **FACT:** The number is actually up from July, when ICE agents were
    facing an [830%
    increase](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/07/15/dhs-announces-ice-law-enforcement-are-now-facing-830-percent-increase-assaults)
