title: At UN, President Trump Champions Sovereignty, Rejects Globalism
---
 
Today, in
[remarks](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1970525758855536854) to
the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly, President
Donald J. Trump delivered a powerful rebuke to the destructive globalism
that has fueled endless conflict and chaos around the world. During the
address, President Trump was unapologetic in proclaiming American
strength as he unveiled a bold vision for sovereign nations to unite
against the true threats of terrorism, unchecked migration, biological
warfare, and loss of cultural identity.

**Here are highlights from President Trump’s speech:**

-   “America is blessed with the strongest economy, the strongest
    borders, the strongest military, the strongest friendships, and the
    strongest spirit of any nation on the face of the earth. This is
    indeed the Golden Age of America.”

-   “Four months in a row, the number of illegal aliens admitted and
    entering our country has been zero… Our message is very simple: If
    you come illegally into the United States, you’re going to jail or
    you’re going back to where you came from.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1970493106119155861))
-   “In a period of just seven months, I have ended seven ‘un-endable’
    wars… No President or Prime Minister — and for that matter, no other
    country — has ever done anything close to that… It’s too bad that I
    had to do these things instead of the United Nations doing them —
    and sadly, in all cases, the United Nations did not even try to
    help.”

-   “What is the purpose of the United Nations? The UN has such
    tremendous potential… All they seem to do is write a really strongly
    worded letter, and then never follow that letter up. It’s empty
    words — and empty words don’t solve war.”

-   “Everyone says that I should get the Nobel Peace Prize… but for me,
    the real prize will be the sons and daughters who live to grow up
    with their mothers and fathers because millions of people are no
    longer being killed in endless and un-glorious wars. What I care
    about is not winning prizes, it’s saving lives.”

-   “A dramatically better future is within our reach — but to get
    there, we must reject the failed approaches of the past and work
    together to confront some of the greatest threats in history.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1970496005612413078))
-   “My position is very simple: the world’s number one sponsor of
    terror can never be allowed to possess the most dangerous weapon.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1970495693295902896))
-   “Now, as if to encourage continued conflict, some of this body is
    seeking to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state… Instead of
    giving in to Hamas’s ransom demands, those who want peace should be
    united with one message: release the hostages now!”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1970496014709858351))
-   “China and India are the primary funders of the ongoing war by
    continuing to purchase Russian oil — but inexcusably, even NATO
    countries have not cut off much Russian energy.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1970497379095703779))
-   “Today, I’m also calling on every nation to join us in ending the
    development of biological weapons once and for all.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1970497572331462937))
-   “Not only is the UN not solving the problems it should, too often,
    it is actually creating new problems for us to solve… The United
    Nations is funding an assault on Western countries and their
    borders… The UN is supposed to stop invasions, not create them and
    not finance them.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1970497913987195259))
-   “What makes the world so beautiful is that each country is unique —
    but to stay this way, every sovereign nation must have the right to
    control their own borders.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1970498697927548982))
-   “When your prisons are filled with so-called ‘asylum seekers’ who
    repaid kindness with crime, it’s time to end the failed experiment
    of open borders.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1970499285587259508))
-   “Any system that results in the mass trafficking of children is
    inherently evil — yet that is exactly what the globalist migration
    agenda has done.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1970499911708754187))
-   “To every terrorist thug smuggling poisonous drugs into the United
    States of America, please be warned — we will blow you out of
    existence.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1970500345655669093))
-   “I’m telling you that if you don’t get away from the ‘green energy’
    scam, your country is going to fail. If you don’t stop people that
    you’ve never seen before that you have nothing in common with, your
    country is going to fail.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1970502026627858852))
-   “The entire globalist concept of asking successful, industrialized
    nations to inflict pain on themselves and radically disrupt their
    entire societies must be rejected completely and totally — and it
    must be immediate.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1970503952484520123))
-   “The challenge with trade is much the same as with climate: the
    countries that followed the rules, all their factories have been
    plundered… by countries that broke the rules. That’s why the United
    States is now applying tariffs to other countries.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1970504130725654877))
-   “Together, let us defend free speech and free expression. Let us
    protect religious liberty, including for the most persecuted
    religion on the planet today — it’s called Christianity.”
