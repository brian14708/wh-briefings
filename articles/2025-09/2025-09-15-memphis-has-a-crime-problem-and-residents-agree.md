title: "Memphis Has a Crime Problem \u2014 and Residents Agree"
---
 
President Donald J. Trump’s
[plan](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1966478031867793669) to
deploy federal resources, including the National Guard, to Memphis comes
amid the Trump Administration’s push to dismantle the violent crime
crisis fueled by failed Democrat policies.

**With the** [**highest
rate**](https://www.wsmv.com/2025/09/05/this-tennessee-city-has-highest-violent-crime-rate-country-see-where-your-home-ranks/#:~:text=Memphis%20had%20the%20highest%20rate%20of%20violent%20crime)
**of violent crime in the country, it’s clear Memphis** [**needs
help**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/09/president-trump-announces-bold-action-to-crush-violent-crime-in-memphis/)**:**

-   **“We’re grateful for the National Guard coming,”**
    [said](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1967600611622633511) the
    owner of a Memphis tax service.
-   **“It’s just so dangerous that you can’t get out of your car. You
    can’t go to the grocery store. You can’t go to the market or the
    service station. So, yeah, I want to see the crime stop — and if the
    National Guard is going to stop the crime, bring them on,”**
    [said](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1967577446464819621)
    another Memphis resident.
-   **“Everybody turns the cheek when it’s not in their ZIP code, but
    it’s becoming a problem for everybody,”**
    [said](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1967618701865488764) a
    Memphis man who was woken up to a “barrage of gunfire” into his
    home.
-   **“There’s a need for more boots on the ground,”**
    [said](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1967616534769218028) the
    director of a Memphis-based crime prevention organization.
-   **“I got two guns put in my face within five minutes at two
    different locations,”**
    [said](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1967613931591016663) a
    Memphis mom recently robbed and carjacked at gunpoint. **“I was
    scared and I was just hoping he didn’t shoot me.”**
-   **“I honestly thought he was going to kill me,”**
    [said](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1967612336409297341) a
    60-year-old Memphis carjacking victim who was body slammed to the
    ground and left with a head injury.

**Violent crime has prompted headline after headline in recent months:**
