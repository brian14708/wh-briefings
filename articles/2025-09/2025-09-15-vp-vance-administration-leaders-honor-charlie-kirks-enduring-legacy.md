title: "VP Vance, Administration Leaders Honor Charlie Kirk\u2019s Enduring Legacy"
---
 
Today, Vice President JD Vance and senior Trump Administration officials
honored the memory of Charlie Kirk by hosting a special edition of The
Charlie Kirk Show live from the White House — coming together in a
heartfelt tribute to the visionary conservative leader’s unwavering
faith, patriotism, and values that inspired the next generation of
American Patriots.

**Vice President Vance shared powerful reflections about his personal
friendship with Kirk — and emphasized the need for truthful unity in the
face of tragedy:**

-   “The last several days have been extremely hard for our country,
    they’ve been hard for me, hard for my family, hard for the countless
    people in this building who knew and loved Charlie Kirk — and, of
    course, they’ve been hardest, most of all, for his darling wife,
    Erika, and their two beautiful children. The thing is, every single
    person in this building — we owe something to Charlie.”

-   “If it weren’t for Charlie Kirk, I would not be the Vice President
    of the United States.”

-   “Psalm 133 tells us, ‘Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for
    brethren to dwell together in unity! It is like the precious
    ointment upon the head.’ Oh, how badly have I craved that precious
    ointment in recent days, and I believe we can have it — but first,
    first, we must tell the truth.”

-   “I really do believe that we can come together in this country. I
    believe we must. But unity — real unity — can be found only after
    climbing the mountain of truth — and there are difficult truths we
    must confront… While our side of the aisle certainly has its
    crazies, it is a statistical fact that most of the lunatics in
    American politics today are proud members of the Far Left.”

**Officials from across the Trump Administration also shared their
personal stories:**

-   **White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles:** “The person that really
    did everything they said they were going to do and more is Turning
    Point. He had an army of good people who were motivated and
    passionate and they delivered 100% — and I don’t know that Charlie
    gets enough credit for that… it was an immeasurable help.”

-   **Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.:**
    “Charlie was probably the primary architect of my unification with
    President Trump… I first met Charlie in July of 2021… He had me on
    his show for this very, very wide-ranging talk… By the end of that
    interview, I felt like I had met a spiritual soulmate, and our
    friendship blossomed.”

-   **White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt:** “He inspired me as
    a young voice for President Trump, now behind the White House
    podium. Before every briefing, I always pray to Jesus Christ, and
    Charlie was so outspoken with his faith — and I will continue to be
    in honor of him.”

-   **White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller:** “I’ve known
    Charlie for ten years. He was a treasured friend. He made you
    believe more in yourself is the best way I can put that. He was your
    biggest cheerleader… With God as my witness, we are going to use
    every resource we have at the Department of Justice, Homeland
    Security, and throughout this government, to identify, disrupt,
    dismantle, and destroy these \[Radical Left\] networks and make
    America safe again for the American people. It will happen, and we
    will do it in Charlie’s name.”

-   **White House Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich:** “Before
    Wednesday, Charlie Kirk was a young man inspiring young people.
    After he was killed, he has become a titan whose inspiration will
    move through eternity inspiring millions of people for decades to
    come.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1967719868582793641))
-   **White House Deputy Communications Director Kaelan Dorr:** “It’s
    our mission to go out there and embolden young conservatives, young
    Christians, most importantly, to go out there and continue to do his
    work because that’s exactly what he’d want.”
