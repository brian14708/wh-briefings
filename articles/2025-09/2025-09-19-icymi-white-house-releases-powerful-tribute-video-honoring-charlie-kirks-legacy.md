title: "ICYMI: White House Releases Powerful Tribute Video Honoring Charlie Kirk\u2019\
  s Legacy"
---
 
This week, the White House released a [tribute
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLj1PHXRkw4) honoring the life,
legacy, and profound impact of Charlie Kirk. The three-minute tribute
features excerpts from Kirk’s speeches, rallies, and personal moments
with his family, alongside footage from the numerous memorial services,
prayer vigils, and gatherings held across the country in his honor.

Set to the words of his beloved wife, Erika — delivered with heartbreak
and resolve — the video underscores the enduring fire of her husband’s
mission: “You have no idea the fire you have ignited.”
