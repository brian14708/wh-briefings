title: "President Trump Joins Nation in Celebrating Charlie Kirk\u2019s Enduring Legacy"
---
 
**Yesterday, President Donald J. Trump, Vice President JD Vance, key
Administration officials gathered with tens of thousands of other
American Patriots at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, to
celebrate the life and legacy of Charlie Kirk.** It was a celebration of
Charlie Kirk’s extraordinary life — ensuring his message of hope,
reason, and righteousness endures as a beacon for generations.

The Administration — including [President
Trump](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1969919578227486788), [Vice
President
Vance](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1969888409066819673),
[Secretary of State Marco
Rubio](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1969872907254796430),
[Secretary of War Pete
Hegseth](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1969875365813276815),
[Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy,
Jr.](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1969875978475143241),
[Director of National Intelligence Tulsi
Gabbard](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1969870322804425215),
[White House Chief of Staff Susie
Wiles](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1969866346751021116), [White
House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen
Miller](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1969864878107373764), and
[White House Office of Presidential Personnel Director Sergio
Gor](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1969862319770652812) — shared
stirring testimonies of Kirk’s role as a leader, mentor, and motivator
who didn’t just debate ideas, but ignited souls and forged a movement
that now stands stronger than ever.

**Here are key moments from President Trump’s remarks:**

-   “Charles James Kirk was heinously murdered by a radicalized,
    cold-blooded monster for speaking the truth that was in his heart.
    He was violently killed because he spoke for freedom and justice,
    for God and country, for reason and for common sense. He was
    assassinated because he lived bravely, he led boldly, and he argued
    brilliantly — without apology… On that terrible day, September 10th,
    2025, our greatest evangelist for American liberty became immortal.
    He’s a martyr now for American freedom.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1969893675132936682))
-   “Through it all, the core of Charlie’s message and his basic method
    never changed… At every campus event, Charlie asked the people who
    disagreed with him to come forward — and instead of silencing them,
    he handed them a microphone and let them speak.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1969897329290334444))
-   “Shortly before Charlie arrived on campus the day he was
    assassinated, a staff member texted him that there were many critics
    and students who were opposed his views… Charlie wrote back to the
    staff member saying, ‘I’m not here to fight them. I want them to
    know them and love them and I want to reach them and try and lead
    them into a great way of life in our country.’ In that private
    moment on his dying day, we find everything we need to know about
    who Charlie Kirk truly was.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1969898336183373937))
-   “The radicals and their allies in the media — sometimes referred to,
    as my son said, the Fake News Media — tried to silence Charlie for a
    simple reason: because he was winning, and he was winning big… They
    lied about him because they did not want you to listen to him or
    learn from him.
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1969898742926151899))
-   “Every single American should take a long, hard look at the twisted
    soul and dark spirit of anyone who would want to kill a young man as
    good as Charlie Kirk — to kill anybody, but to kill a man like this…
    and anyone who would make excuses for it.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1969900488742039948))
-   “Charlie’s murder was not just an attack on one man or one movement
    — it was an attack on our entire nation… It was an assault on our
    most sacred liberties and God-given rights. The gun was pointed at
    him, but the bullet was aimed at all of us… Indeed, Charlie was
    killed for expressing the very ideas that virtually everyone in this
    arena, and most other places throughout our country, deeply belief
    in. But the assassin failed in his quest — because Charlie’s message
    has not been silenced, it now is bigger and better and stronger than
    ever before, and it’s not even close.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1969900488742039948))
-   “Some of the very same people who spent the last eight years trying
    to sit in moral judgment of anyone who disagreed with them about
    politics suddenly started cheering for murder… Some of the very
    people who call you a ‘hater’ for using the wrong pronoun were
    filled with glee at the killing of a father with two young children,
    and the same commentators who this week are screaming ‘fascism’ over
    a canceled late-night TV show, where the anchor had no talent or no
    ratings, last week were implying that Charlie Kirk deserved what
    happened to him.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1969901738015760705))
-   “No side in American politics has a monopoly on disturbed or
    misguided people, but there’s one part of our political community
    which believes they have a monopoly on truth, goodness, and virtue —
    and concludes they have also have a monopoly on power, thought, and
    speech… Tragically, atrocities of this kind we saw in Utah of all
    places are the eventual consequence of that kind of thinking. If
    speech is violence, then some are bound to conclude that violence is
    justified to stop speech.” 
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1969901490727690423))
-   “The tradition of reason and open debate that Charlie practiced is
    not a pillar of our democracy; in many ways it’s the basis of our
    entire society… We will defend it at all costs and we will carry
    forward the torch of liberty that Charlie Kirk held so proud and so
    high.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1969902250073158102))
-   “Perhaps it should be no surprise that Charlie, who spent his life
    speaking with the critics of these traditions, ultimately became
    convinced that we needed not just a political re-alignment, but also
    a spiritual reawakening… He would have been so pleased to hear his
    friends and colleagues today giving testimony and giving glory to
    God.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1969902390770909508))
-   “The lesson of Charlie’s life is that you should never underestimate
    what one person can do with a good heart, a righteous cause, a
    cheerful spirit, and the will to fight, fight, fight… Charlie Kirk
    started with only an idea to change minds on college campuses and
    instead he ended up with a far greater achievement — changing
    history.”
