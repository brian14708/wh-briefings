on a train in Charlotte, North Carolina — a shocking act of evil that
didn’t have to happen.

The deranged monster had been arrested [again and

in January — free to slaughter an innocent woman just months later.

That has become the norm in Democrat-run cities, where Radical Left
policies like “no cash bail” and “defund the police” put depraved career
criminals back on the streets — free to continue raping, pillaging, and
killing their way through our nation.

**It’s the culmination of North Carolina’s Democrat politicians,
prosecutors, and judges prioritizing woke agendas that fail to protect
their citizens when they need them the most:**

-   In 2020, the Charlotte City Council launched an initiative to
    “[reimagine](https://www.governing.com/now/charlotte-will-divert-some-911-calls-to-non-police-responders.html#:~:text=At%20an%20Oct.%2026%20meeting%2C%20the%20City%20Council%20will%20vote%20on%20a%20more%C2%A0comprehensive%20plan%20to%20%E2%80%9Creimagine%E2%80%9D%20CMPD)“ policing,
    which

    calls away from the police department.
-   In 2020, then-Governor Roy Cooper
    [established](https://ncdoj.gov/trec/) the “Task Force for Racial
    Equity in Criminal Justice” —

    by then-Attorney General and current Governor Josh Stein — which
    [recommended](https://ncdoj.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/TREC_Recommendations_02262021.pdf)
    “reimagining public safety” to “promote diversion and other
    alternatives to arrest,” “deemphasize” some felony crimes,
    prioritize “restorative justice,” and “eliminate cash bail” for many
    crimes.
-   Over the last seven years, Mecklenburg County Criminal Justice
    Services
    has [received](https://news.mecknc.gov/county-awarded-grant-sustain-local-justice-system-solutions) millions
    of dollars from a foundation that
    [advocates](https://x.com/safety_justice/status/1963285616017240427)
    for no-cash bail and decreasing jail populations to address
    “inequities.”

    reducing “racial disparities and disproportionality within the
    criminal justice system” as among its goals.
-   In 2020, Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Chief Johnny Jennings
    [said](https://www.wccbcharlotte.com/2020/06/26/incoming-cmpd-chief-on-systemic-racism-when-you-have-enough-people-that-are-saying-its-an-issue-you-have-to-pay-attention-to-it/)
    “law enforcement, in general, is based on racism” and their
    department can “probably slow down” on “discretionary arrests.”
-   In 2020, Democrat State Senator Mujtaba Mohammed, who represents
    Charlotte,
    [declared](https://x.com/MMohammedNC/status/1274044877152624648)
    “independence from rogue police.”

**As President Trump** [**said
today**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1965069289083584737)**:
“There are evil people. We have to be able to handle that. If we don’t
handle that, we don’t have a country.”**
