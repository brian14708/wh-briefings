title: "Democrats Press on with Shutdown Threats\u2026 Even the Media Isn\u2019t Buying\
  \ Their Obstruction"
---
 
Democrats are threatening to hold government funding hostage to score
political points, ignoring the real-world consequences — barreling our
country towards a government shutdown if Republicans don’t adhere to
their roughly $1.5 trillion wish list.

**The American people want to keep their government open — and even the
media isn’t buying Democrats’ political posturing.**

[Politico
reports](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/22/democrats-shutdown-leverage-00574029) Democrats
are using the shutdown as political leverage.

*“It’s Republicans who are pushing a ‘clean’ seven-week continuing
resolution, which they say will buy time for more negotiations on
full-year spending bills and possibly an extension of expiring health
insurance subsidies. **Democrats, meanwhile, wrote an alternative
four-week punt that tacks on a laundry list of other demands**,
including a permanent extension of the insurance subsidies.”*

Senate Democrats are to blame as Congress heads toward a government
shutdown, [Bloomberg
reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-19/us-lurches-toward-shutdown-as-senate-democrats-block-gop-stopgap).

*“**Democrats, unable to slow Trump’s agenda or even garner much media
attention for their efforts, are under increasing pressure to risk a
shutdown.** Schumer in March backed off from a similar threat and
allowed 10 Democrats to vote for a temporary spending bill. He is taking
a tougher line this time, even as some of the same 10 senators refuse to
say how they will vote in the end.”*

[*The New York Times*
reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/us/politics/house-spending-extension.html)
Democrats are to blame for blocking the GOP bill to fund the government
through November.

*“**Senate Democrats on Friday blocked Republicans’ plan to keep federal
funding flowing** past a Sept. 30 deadline, demanding concessions on
health care and other issues in exchange for their support for a measure
needed to avert a government shutdown.”*

reports that Democrats are risking a shutdown in pursuit of their
“Democratic wish list of other policies that are non-starters for the
GOP.”

*“The Republican plan was passed by the House last week but failed to
clear a 60-vote filibuster in the Senate. It includes largely extending
current funding levels through Nov. 21 to allow appropriators more time
to finish a bipartisan annual budget. A Democratic counterproposal would
provide funding through October and extend the Obamacare insurance
credits**, along with a Democratic wish list of other policies that are
non-starters for the GOP.”***

[The
Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5508947-looming-government-shutdown-threat/) reports
that Democrats say a shutdown is “necessary” to “send a message” to
President Trump.

*“Democratic senators say that unless Republicans scrap their plan to
advance a ‘clean’ seven-week continuing resolution, they don’t see any
option other than defeating it as a way to send a ‘message’ to President
Trump.”*

Democrats are going to battle over the government shutdown for a “fight
with Trump,” [CNN
reports](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/20/politics/democrats-government-shutdown-schumer).

*“Still locked out of power in Washington, Senate Minority Leader Chuck
Schumer and his party are seizing on a fresh battle with President
Donald Trump: a high-stakes gamble over this month’s government funding
deadline.*

*“Party leaders and rank-and-file are publicly projecting a united
front, and many Democrats are truly eager for a fight with Trump. But
behind the scenes, some are also worried about the party’s exit strategy
if Trump and the GOP refuse to cave. They fear that a shutdown could
wreak havoc across the country — only for Democrats to ultimately yield
to Republicans with nothing in exchange.”*

Democrats have no plan — only obstruction, as
[Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/18/democrats-government-shutdown-strategy-00570559)
outlines.

*“Still, under tremendous pressure from their base to show that they are
willing to fight President Donald Trump, Democrats are flirting with a
politically risky shutdown without a firm exit plan or even an idea of
what victory might look like.”*
