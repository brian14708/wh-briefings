title: New Report Card Data Confirms We Can, And Must, Do Better on Education
---
 
The latest [National Assessment of Educational
Progress](https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/) — a nationwide test
administered in 2024 — underscores what President Donald J. Trump has
been saying all along: on education, we can, and must, be better.

**These results released today from the 2024 assessments were
devastating:**

-   **Just**
    [**31%**](https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/reports/science/2024/)
    **of eighth grade students are proficient in science.**
-   **Just**
    [**22%**](https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/reports/mathematics/2024/g12/)
    **of high school seniors are proficient in math** — the lowest score
    since the current assessment began.
-   **Just**
    [**35%**](https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/reports/reading/2024/g12/)
    **of high school seniors are proficient in reading** — the lowest
    score on record.

**Since 1979, the U.S. Department of Education has spent over **[**$3
trillion**](https://www.ed.gov/about/ed-overview/annual-performance-reports/budget/us-department-of-education-budget-history)** and
per-pupil spending has**
[**increased**](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d22/tables/dt22_236.55.asp)** by
more than 245% — with nothing to show for it.** Standardized test scores
have [remained flat](https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/ltt/?age=9) for
decades and U.S. students

the bottom compared to other developed nations in critical subjects like
math.

**Why would we keep doing the same thing over and over again and expect
a different result?**

That’s why the Trump Administration is challenging the status quo that
has failed our students for decades. Instead of a bloated federal
system, the Trump Administration is moving forward with a bold plan to
return education back to the individual states — which are best equipped
to meet the needs of their students — and providing every available
opportunity for parents to enrich the education of their children
through individual choice.
