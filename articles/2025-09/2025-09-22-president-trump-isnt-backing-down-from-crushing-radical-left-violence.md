**President Donald J. Trump** [**is
right**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1967359769603449320)**:
the violence problem is on the Left.** That’s why he just
[designated](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1970250137193644374)
Antifa — a network of Radical Left terrorists that aim to overthrow the
government through violence and agitation — as a domestic terrorist
organization.

**Antifa has a long history of terrorizing our communities:**

-   **In July 2025, members of an Antifa cell**
    [**ambushed**](https://www.fox4news.com/news/texas-ice-detention-center-attack-alvarado)** officers
    at an ICE facility in Alvarado, Texas. **After defacing vehicles
    with anti-ICE graffiti — including “ICE pig” and “F— you pigs” — the
    assailants lured officers out of the building and opened fire,
    shooting one officer in the neck.
-   **In July 2025, deranged rioters
    viciously **[**assaulted**](https://katu.com/news/local/3-accused-of-assaulting-federal-officers-in-portland-ice-facility-protests-on-4th-of-july)** federal
    agents at an ICE facility in Portland, Oregon. **Officers at the
    facility — which had been targeted by the local Antifa terror cell
    for weeks — were kicked, punched, and targeted with an “incendiary
    device.”
-   **In February 2024, a transgender Antifa terrorist**
    [**detonated**](https://1819news.com/news/item/kyle-shideler-arrest-of-suspected-alabama-bomber-shows-antifa-is-not-just-a-portland-problem)
    **an explosive device outside the office of Alabama Attorney General
    Steve Marshall.** The terrorist left behind numerous stickers with
    Antifa slogans and anarchist symbols.

    and commercial-grade fireworks, and destroyed construction equipment
    in what local police described as “anarchy.”
