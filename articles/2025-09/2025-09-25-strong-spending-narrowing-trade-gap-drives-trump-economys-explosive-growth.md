Second-quarter GDP was [revised up to
3.8%](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1971193358837219494) — once
again proving the so-called “experts” wrong as strong consumer spending,
rising incomes, and a narrowing trade gap define President Donald J.
Trump’s economic resurgence.

**Here’s what else you need to know:**

-   Second quarter GDP was revised up from its [last upward
    revision](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1961055769333223629),
    reflecting a narrowing trade gap and strong consumer spending.
    -   Real disposable income growth was also revised up to 3.1%,
        showing that income growth remains strong and wages are rising.

**Here’s what they’re saying:**

-   [CNBC’s Rick
    Santelli](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1971193358837219494):
    “We see a really solid revision — 3.8%. I’m a bit shocked, to be
    honest… The balance is moving in favor, the momentum is moving in
    favor, for better growth.”
-   [Fox Business Network’s Cheryl
    Casone](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1971195261897802219):
    “A gain of 3.8%. This is much higher than the second read of the
    second quarter for GDP of 3.3%. It’s now 3.8%, and this is the final
    read for the second quarter. A strong economy. Consumer spending —
    strong… That GDP number, it’s very rare to see that. That was a good
    number.”
-   [Job Creators Network CEO Alfredo
    Ortiz](https://www.jobcreatorsnetwork.com/press_releases/job-creators-network-statement-on-gdp-upward-revision-and-strong-durable-goods-orders/):
    “Thursday’s positive economic indicators demonstrate America’s small
    business backbone is strong and getting stronger. Economic growth in
    the second quarter was revised up to nearly 4%, and durable goods
    orders smashed expectations. These numbers reflect a robust
    underlying economy that is being powered by Republican tax cuts,
    including pro-growth provisions such as permanent 100% immediate
    expensing and the 20% small business deduction.”
-   [Oxford Economics Chief U.S. Economist Ryan
    Sweet](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-gdp-surges-38-q2-much-more-previously-estimated#:~:text=%22Consumers%20spent%20more,spending%20this%20quarter.%22):
    “Consumers spent more than previously thought in Q2, leading to a
    noticeable upward revision to real GDP growth… Odds are that we will
    be revising higher our forecast for Q3 GDP because of the incoming
    data on spending this quarter.”
-   [BMO Senior Economist Priscilla
    Thiagamoorthy](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gdp-q2-second-quarter-revision-3-8-percent-growth/#:~:text=%22That%20was%20a,some%20slowdown%20ahead.%22):
    “That was a meaningful bump-up from the previous estimate of 3.3%
    thanks to the mighty consumer. Today’s run of data suggest that the
    economy — which strongly rebounded after the pandemic recession —
    continues to hold up well…”
