title: President Trump Signs Technology Prosperity Deal with United Kingdom
---
 
Today, President Donald J. Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer signed
the [Technology Prosperity
Deal](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/memorandum-of-understanding-between-the-government-of-the-united-states-of-america-and-the-government-of-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-regarding-the-technology-prosperity-de/),
a landmark science and technology agreement that will propel the U.S. –
UK special relationship to new heights for the technological age, and
deliver wins for the American people and American innovation globally.

**“President Trump signed another game-changing deal that furthers
American technology leadership and strengthens ties to one of our
closest allies.  With the TPD, the United States is exporting its
world-class tech stack, accelerating scientific discovery, and advancing
pro-innovation policies worldwide,” said Michael Kratsios, Assistant to
the President and Director of the White House Office of Science and
Technology Policy.**

The Technology Prosperity Deal establishes joint initiatives between the
two nations’ premiere research and standards institutions across
artificial intelligence, nuclear energy, and quantum computing to bring
transformative benefits to citizens – from accelerating breakthroughs in
health care, to lowering energy costs, and supporting national security.

On Artificial Intelligence:

-   The TPD strengthens and refocuses the partnership between the U.S.
    Center for AI Standards and Innovation (CAISI) and the UK AI
    Security Institute (AISI) to exchange best practices in metrology
    and standards development for AI models, improve understanding of
    the most advanced models, and exchange talent between the
    institutes.
-   The TPD establishes a flagship AI for Science research program
    between the U.S. Departments of Energy, Health, and the National
    Science Foundation and its UK counterparts geared towards
    cutting-edge biotechnology research and precision medicine. As part
    of this, we’ll collaborate on automated labs and new scientific data
    sets,focusing especially on cancer and chronic disease research that
    will improve the lives of our peoples.

On Civil Nuclear Energy:

-   The TPD aligns the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the UK Office
    for Nuclear Regulation, and the UK Environment Agency to streamline
    and accelerate licensing, targeting reactor design reviews within
    two years and site licensing within one year;
-   The TPD also commits the UK to achieve full independence from
    Russian nuclear fuel by the end of 2028 – bringing the UK in
    alignment with U.S. statutory commitments – ensuring a secure and
    reliable supply chain for advanced nuclear fuels in both countries.
-   The TPD facilitates coordination of fusion energy research and
    development, including through the use of artificial intelligence,
    with enhanced collaboration to develop harmonized, responsible, and
    pro-innovation policies to enable commercial development of fusion
    technologies.

On Quantum Computing:

-   The TPD advances trusted, interoperable standards for quantum
    technologies and establishes a joint benchmarking taskforce that
    will cover across quantum computing hardware, software, and
    algorithms.
-   Additional partnerships between our top quantum institutions will
    lead to more a secure quantum supply chain and capability to
    accelerate breakthroughs in defense, finance, energy, and beyond.
