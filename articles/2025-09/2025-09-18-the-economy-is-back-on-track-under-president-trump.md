relentless America First agenda.

In fact, the share of Americans who say gas prices are a “major problem”
is

renewed optimism driven by a [sharp

in approval “across the political spectrum” for President Trump’s
economic policies.

**Here’s why:**

-   **Homeownership is more affordable:** Mortgage rates have
    [fallen](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/09/icymi-mortgage-rates-fall-to-three-year-low/)
    to a [three-year
    low](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mortgage-interest-rates-fall-3-year-low-september-2025/)

    after millions of illegal immigrants
    [drove](https://www.heritage.org/housing/commentary/why-open-border-means-more-expensive-housing)
    housing costs up under Biden.
-   **Driving costs less:** Americans are spending the [smallest
    share](https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/gasolines-burden-americans-wallets-lightest-since-2005)
    of their disposable income on gasoline since 2005, while the annual
    cost to own and operate a new vehicle is

    across the board.
-   **Americans are spending like never before:** Retail sales are
    [booming](https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/nrf-consumer-survey-finds-halloween-spending-to-reach-record-13-1-billion)

    over last year, far outpacing inflation — as Americans spend in
    [record
    amounts](https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/nrf-consumer-survey-finds-halloween-spending-to-reach-record-13-1-billion).

    for 26 straight months under Biden, real wages
    have [increased](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/08/wages-grow-as-inflation-remains-low-and-stable/#:~:text=have%20increased%20each%20month%20since%20President%20Trump%20took%20office.) nearly
    every month since President Trump took office — driven by historic
    wage gains for [blue-collar
    workers](https://x.com/SecScottBessent/status/1957575711490760802),
    which are rising at the [fastest
    rate](https://x.com/USDOL/status/1962532555980194127) in six
    decades.
-   **Retirements are booming:** The stock market is booming, with the
    Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all hitting [new record
    highs](https://www.reuters.com/business/sp-500-nasdaq-futures-hit-record-highs-after-fed-cuts-rates-intel-soars-2025-09-18/).
    In fact, the S&P 500 is up nearly 15% and the Nasdaq is up more than
    21% [since Election
    Day](http://bloomberg.com/graphics/market-reactions-trump-second-term/).
-   **An industrial renaissance is here:** President Trump has secured
    [nearly $9 trillion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/investments/) in
    U.S. investment — nearly [nine times
    more](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administration-record)
    than Biden attracted in his entire four-year term — as companies
    report a
    [resurgence](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/08/the-one-big-beautiful-bill-is-igniting-an-american-business-boom/)
    in competitiveness thanks to the landmark reforms of the One Big
    Beautiful Bill.
