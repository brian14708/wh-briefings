title: 'Winning Streak: Record-Breaking Tariffs, Border Security, and Safer Cities'
---
 
President Donald J. Trump’s America First agenda is delivering historic
results at an unprecedented pace. From shattering tariff revenue records
to securing the border and revitalizing our nation’s capital, the Trump
Administration is proving that bold leadership gets real results.

**Here are a few of the latest victories for the American people you may
have missed:**

### **💰** **Tariff revenues set another new record**

President Trump continues to deliver on his promise to make America
wealthy again through tariffs. In August, tariff revenues topped [$31
billion](https://x.com/SecScottBessent/status/1963006523300258208) —
bringing the total to $158 billion this calendar year, or more than 2.5
times the revenue this time last year.

Even the left-wing Congressional Budget Office
[admits](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/08/icymi-tariffs-will-reduce-deficit-by-4-trillion/)
President Trump’s tariffs will reduce total deficits by $4 trillion over
the next decade.

### **💼** **New data shows President Trump’s return-to-office order worked**

President
Trump’s [order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/return-to-in-person-work/) that
federal workers return to the office five days a week is working, [Axios
reports](https://www.axios.com/2025/09/03/trump-return-to-office-federal-workers),
with federal employees now “twice as likely to work in-office as
employees overall nationwide.” In fact, the percentage of federal
employees working in-office
[increased](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/694361/hybrid-work-retreat-barely.aspx)
nearly 30 points in the second quarter of the year — a major
[boost](https://www.dcnewsnow.com/news/local-news/washington-dc/downtown-dc-businesses-celebrate-federal-return-to-office-policy/)
for local economies that rely on in-person foot traffic and for the
overall cohesion of the federal workforce.

### **🔙** **“Reverse flow” of migration to the U.S.**

More would-be illegal immigrants are [turning

rather than making the perilous journey to our southern border, while
the number of unaccompanied migrant children attempting to enter the
country — often at the hands of criminal smugglers — has dramatically
[declined](https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2025/09/02/trumps-deputies-shrink-unaccompanied-alien-children-border-loophole/).
In fact, northward migration from Central American countries is [down
97%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/08/29/migration-venezuela-darien-gap-trump-colombia/c95ef74c-84e0-11f0-a8f4-28ba053d904b_story.html#:~:text=Friday%E2%80%99s%20report%2C%20published%20with%20support%20of%20the%20U.N.%20High%20Commissioner%20for%20Human%20Rights%2C%20said%20that%20northward%20migration%20had%20dropped%2097%25%20this%20year.)
this year, while unaccompanied migrant crossings are [down
93%](https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2025/09/02/trumps-deputies-shrink-unaccompanied-alien-children-border-loophole/)
over last year.

After years of Democrat-induced open borders making the U.S. a magnet
for dangerous, unchecked migration, it’s yet another sign that President
Trump’s unprecedented border security effort is working.

### **🤝** **D.C. Mayor partners with Trump Administration**

Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser
[announced](https://www.dailysignal.com/2025/09/02/democrat-dc-mayor-announces-unlikely-alliance-trump-fight-crime/)
a continued partnership with the Trump Administration to Make D.C. Safe
Again following the unprecedented success in cracking down on crime in
the nation’s capital — establishing a model for other Democrat
politicians in some of the nation’s most violent cities to follow.
