title: "BLS Revisions Show President Trump Was Right \u2014 Again"

> ***“Today, the BLS released the largest downward revision on record

> and the BLS is broken. This is exactly why we need new leadership to
> restore trust and confidence in the BLS’s data on behalf of the
> financial markets, businesses, policymakers, and families that rely on
> this data to make major decisions. Much like the BLS has failed the
> American people, so has Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell — who has officially
> run out of excuses and must cut the rates now.”***

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) just
[revised](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/09/jobs-report-revisions-september-2025-.html)
down their jobs numbers from April 2024 to March 2025 by 911,000 jobs —
the biggest revision [on
record](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/09/09/us-jobs-economy/)
and another blunder in the [lengthy
history](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/08/bls-has-lengthy-history-of-inaccuracies-incompetence/)
of inaccuracies and incompetence at BLS.

**Here’s what you need to know:**

-   **The benchmark revisions make clear the economy President Trump
    inherited was even weaker than we thought.** Job growth was
    lackluster under Biden, with initial revisions from the last two
    years showing job growth was overstated by roughly 1.5 million
    workers — showing the Biden economy was propped up by illegal
    immigrants, poor data, government handouts, and a flood of Federal
    spending. In fact, despite opening the borders to millions of
    illegal aliens, the Biden economy still failed to add meaningfully
    more jobs than President Trump did in his first term.
-   **President Trump is right to demand accountability and reform at
    BLS.** The stark revisions underscore the urgent need for Congress
    confirm [E.J.
    Antoni](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/e-j-antoni-is-the-right-man-for-bls-politics-policy-a8851da1?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAiuoEoSZxSFSH1ad78jDPWRbQHcPerUrlTAiWnvkhsOw49k17asPnYHn3AJ0_M%3D&gaa_ts=68c03d6e&gaa_sig=wg_jKIbG-SJUOS8A8An4aI_cEJcVkJZxtXA-5tbQzjf1MJOM7YBwMTugMQXHOKC80d3qzQ-qegGQTva4ZcUcug%3D%3D),
    President Trump’s nominee for BLS commissioner, and begin the major
    reforms needed to restore Americans’ trust in the data after years
    of inaccuracy that has misled policymakers and eroded confidence.
-   **President Trump is right about the Federal Reserve being** [**TOO
    LATE**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1952704804020539737)**.**
    The revisions make clear that the Fed’s monetary policy is far too
    restrictive and interest rates remain too high.
-   **President Trump is revitalizing our economy.** He remains laser
    focused on implementing pro-growth policies, [cutting

    for hardworking Americans, and creating good-paying American jobs to
    usher in the Golden Age of America.
