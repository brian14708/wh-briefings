title: President Trump Is Delivering for American Workers
---
 
As Americans across the nation mark Labor Day, President Trump stands as
the champion of the American Worker. From surging native-born employment
and rising blue-collar wages to innovative workforce initiatives like
expanded apprenticeships and trade school funding, the Trump
Administration is reversing decades of neglect and finally putting
American Workers first.

### **President Trump is overseeing a private sector boom.**

-   Employment for native-born Americans has
    [grown](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1951273348077363661) by

    job gains in President Trump’s second term.

    reducing penalties on small businesses
    and [eliminating](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osec/osec20250701-0) ten
    regulations for every single new regulation created — empowering
    employers to grow and create good jobs.

    [driven](https://www.whitehouse.gov/investments/) more than $8

    hundreds of thousands of new, good-paying jobs for Americans.

    trading partners covering more than half of global GDP and

    [issued](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osec/osec20250710) to
