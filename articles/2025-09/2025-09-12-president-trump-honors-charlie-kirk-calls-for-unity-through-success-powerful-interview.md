    **Charlie Kirk:** “Don said to me, ‘He’s sort of like a son to you…’
    He started this really during what would normally be college… and
    it’s become a movement… I’ve never seen young people, or any group,
    go to one person like they did to Charlie.”

    **the moment he learned of Kirk’s murder:** “They said, ‘Charlie
    Kirk is dead.’ I didn’t know what they meant. I said, ‘What do you
    mean, dead?’ ‘Charlie Kirk was shot…’ I just told these people, ‘Get
    out. Just go.’”

    **the National Guard will be deployed to Memphis to assist in
    fighting violent crime:** “We’re going to Memphis. Memphis is deeply
    troubled… The mayor is happy and the governor of Tennessee, the

    Washington.”  
      
-   **President Trump**
    [**urged**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1966478252546961450)
    **Americans to move forward rather than living in fear of political

    **his visit to the New York Yankees game on the 24th anniversary of
    9/11:** “It was like the old days… We had a good time — and the fans
    were really nice… We got a tremendous applause because they love the
    country.”      
      
-   **President Trump**
    [**outlined**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1966486865541816692)

    **the economic success of his second term:** “I love doing it
    because we’re going to Make America Great Again — it’s happening.
    Look at the stock market. We’ve had the stock market hitting record
    highs… never been higher.”  
      
-   **President Trump** [**spelled
    out**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1966479556388200614)
    **the reality on big city crime:** “Almost every city that’s in
    trouble is run by Democrats. Cashless bail is a disaster… has to be
    ended immediately.”  
      
-   **President Trump**
    [**touted**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1966477432157827326)
    **the historic success of his Make D.C. Safe Again initiative:**
    “Look at what we did in D.C. We took D.C. — probably the
    single-worst place in the country in terms of the country — \[and
    now\] there’s no crime. It’s a crime-free area.”  
      
-   **President Trump**
    [**mentioned**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1966480468934561857)
    **investigations into organized agitation by the Radical Left:**
    “We’re going to look into Soros because I think it’s a RICO case
    against him and other people because this is more than protests.
    This is real agitation; this is riots on the street — and we’re
    going to look into that.”  
      
-   **President Trump**
    [**praised**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1966478901917467069)
    **the Supreme Court’s decisions on merit:** “We have a decision on
    merit. In other words, this country is now a country of merit. You
    don’t have to be a woman or a man or a this or a that… it’s all
    based on merit now… That was a big, big decision.”  
      
-   **President Trump**
    [**lambasted**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1966485661466124704)
    **Senate Democrats’ obstruction:** “We have 200 people that left
    their jobs in order to come into the Administration, and the
    Democrats are blocking every one… “If I had George Washington and
    Abraham Lincoln — they came back from the dead and they wanted to go
    into the Administration — Schumer would not approve them.”  
      
-   **President Trump**
    [**scorched**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1966484961696899126)
    **Fed Chair Jerome Powell:** “Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell. Too late on
    the interest rates… He’s a year late — and despite that, we have the
    best economy.”  
      
-   **President Trump**
    [**lamented**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1966482959998861363)
    **the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine:** “\[My patience\]
    sort of running out and running out fast — but it does take two to
    tango… When Putin wants to do it, Zelensky didn’t. When Zelensky
    wanted to do it, Putin didn’t… We’re going to have to come down
    very, very strong.”  
      
-   **President Trump**
    [**trumpeted**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1966485827594174934)
    **the importance of his America First trade agenda:** “We’ve been
    successful because of the tariffs. It’s given us a great power to
    negotiate with other countries that took advantage of us —
    tremendous power. Also, it has brought billions of dollars into the
    country. We have a big case… it’s now at the Supreme Court. That
    case is really important to win because it’s made us a rich
    country.”
