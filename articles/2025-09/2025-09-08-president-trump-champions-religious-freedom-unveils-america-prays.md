title: President Trump Champions Religious Freedom, Unveils America Prays
---
 
In a powerful address at the Museum of the Bible, President Donald J.
Trump emphasized the enduring role of faith in America’s identity,
highlighted his Administration’s [unwavering
defense](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/09/president-trumps-top-100-victories-for-people-of-faith/)
of faith-based values, and reaffirmed his commitment to protecting our
religious freedoms. The President also launched the [America
Prays](https://www.whitehouse.gov/america250/america-prays/) initiative
— a call for Americans to unite in prayer for the nation’s strength,
peace, and prosperity as the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of
Independence approaches.

**Here’s what you missed:**

-   **President Trump**
    [**reaffirmed**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1965063180998398065)
    **our nation’s founding principles:** “When faith gets weaker, our
    country seems to get weaker. When faith gets stronger… good things
    happen for our country. It’s amazing the way it seems to work that
    way. Under the Trump Administration, we’re defending our rights and
    restoring our identity as a nation under God. We are One Nation
    Under God — and we always will be.”
-   **President Trump**
    [**called**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1965073638924915182)
    **for Americans to come together in prayer:** “Next year, we will
    celebrate 250 years since that Declaration was signed. As part of
    the grand commemoration… we’ve invited America’s great faith
    communities to pray for our nation, for our people, and for peace in
    the world.”
-   **Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Scott Turner**
    [**announced**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1965076176998723605)
    **that more than 70 faith organizations and churches have joined
    together to participate in the America Prays initiative:** “Think
    about the miracles that would take place over the next year… the
    transformation that you and I could witness in communities all
    across the land.”
-   **President Trump**
    [**previewed**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1965066363137105993)
    **new rules protecting Americans’ right to pray in public schools:**
    “I am pleased to announce this morning that the Department of
    Education will soon issue new guidance protecting the right to
    prayer in our public schools.”
-   **President Trump**
    [**highlighted**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1965065299734192600)
    **the importance of faith in God:** “To have a great nation, you
    have to have religion. I believe that so strongly. There has to be
    something after we go through all of this — and that something is
    God.”
-   **President Trump**
    [**defended**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1965075612466545042)
    **our American values of faith:** “America has always been a nation
    that believes in the power of prayer and we will never apologize for
    our faith — ever, ever, never, never. We will never surrender our
    God-given rights. We will defend our liberties, our values, our
    sovereignty, and we will defend our freedom.”
-   **President Trump**
    [**welcomed**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1965067607062536669)
    **a 12-year-old California student who was forced in school to read
    material contrary to his religious beliefs:** “Last year, in fifth
    grade, Shay was forced to read a book to a Kindergarten student
    promoting a message of radical gender ideology that is contrary to
    his religious beliefs and ours.”
-   **President Trump**
    [**admonished**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1965065052798472539)
    **a Democrat Senator for denying that our rights come from God:**
    “The need for this commission has never been more clear than it was
    last week when the ineffectual Senator from Virginia — a man named
    Tim Kaine — stated that the notion our rights come from our Creator
    is ‘extremely troubling’ to him… It’s this Declaration of
    Independence that proclaims we’re endowed by our creator with the
    right to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. The Senator
    from Virginia should be ashamed of himself.”
