title: "President Trump\u2019s Top 100 Victories for People of Faith"
---
 
***Promises Made, Promises Kept.*** Since taking office, President
Donald J. Trump has made history again and again for the faith
community. Since the founding of our nation, nobody has fought harder or
gained more for believers, reversing the catastrophic policies of the
previous administration while building on the winning legacy of his
first term. President Trump has protected religious liberty and affirmed
faith in America. He has fought anti-Christian, anti-Semitic, and other
forms of anti-religious bias while ending the weaponization of
government against all people of faith. He has expanded school choice,
protected parental rights, restored biological truth, uplifted families,
ended illegal and divisive DEI policies, stopped taxpayer funding for
abortion, restored free speech, and stood side-by-side with Israel. He
is the most pro-faith and pro-religious liberty President in American
history.
