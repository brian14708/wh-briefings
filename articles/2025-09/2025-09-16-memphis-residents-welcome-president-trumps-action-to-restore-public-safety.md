President Donald J. Trump’s [bold
action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restoring-law-and-order-in-memphis/)
to deploy federal resources to Memphis marks a powerful step forward in
the fight to make the city safe again amid its longtime
[struggle](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1967695891978129862)
with [violent
crime](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/09/president-trump-announces-bold-action-to-crush-violent-crime-in-memphis/).
This bold federal-state
[partnership](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/09/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-restores-law-and-order-in-memphis/)
drew immediate praise from residents, business owners, and area
lawmakers as a transformative step to reclaim the city from violent
crime and chaos.

**Residents, who have endured escalating dangers, hailed it as a
long-overdue lifeline:**

-   **“This is an opportunity for us and for our city. I hope we make
    the most of it,”**
    [says](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1967936235567296728) an
    East Memphis business owner.
-   **“I don’t even feel safe anymore except for the places I know they
    have security guards… You really don’t know how bad it is in Memphis
    unless you’ve been a part of it for 40 or 50 years… This has been
    needing to be done for a long time,”**
    [says](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1968007914687513008) a
    longtime Memphis resident.
-   **“If \[the National Guard\] is going to be a buffer between them
    and the police to help minimize the crime, then that’s a great
    thing,”**
    [says](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1968004605788475867) a
    Memphis woman whose son was recently shot and killed trying to break
    up a fight in the city.
-   **“I have armed security seven days a week and it’s unbelievable
    what happens every day in front of my restaurant. Without a doubt,
    \[the federal deployment\] will help,”**
    [says](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1967990302326841412) a
    Memphis restaurant owner.
-   **“We just offered any of them that want to come in a free lunch
    plate just to say thank you for coming in and helping with the crime
    issue… I’m very concerned about crime, like everybody else… We’ve
    closed earlier and earlier and earlier because there’s no traffic on
    the streets \[due to crime\],”**
    [says](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1967990002329194888)
    another restaurant owner in Memphis.
-   **“President Donald Trump… is finally saying, ‘Yes, Memphis matters.
    We are going to make Memphis safe again’ — because our local leaders
    have failed to do so,”**
    [says](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1967938097288712342) one
    Memphis resident.

**Elected officials expressed gratitude for the Trump Administration’s
commitment to public safety:**

-   [Gov. Bill
    Lee](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1967979829766369736): “We
    do have a desire in Tennessee to partner with the Trump
    Administration. The first thing I want to say is thank you to
    President Trump. We requested, and he is providing, a full
    complement of federal resources to address crime — which is a
    serious problem in a great city… We’ve been working with the Trump
    Administration for months on a strategy for Memphis… We now will
    have resources to finally address an issue that has really dragged
    on for way too long.”
-   [Sen. Marsha
    Blackburn](https://x.com/MarshaBlackburn/status/1967730702809706534):
    “Tennesseans are grateful for what the Trump administration is doing
    to rid Memphis of violent crime and restore law and order in this
    great city. This is a long-term effort to Make Memphis Safe Again.
    Thank you, @realDonaldTrump!”

    Hagerty](https://www.hagerty.senate.gov/press-releases/2025/09/16/hagerty-applauds-trump-admins-efforts-to-stop-violent-crime-in-memphis/):
    “I thank President Trump… This is an extraordinary display of
    federal, state, and local governments coming together and setting
    partisan politics aside to do what’s in the best interest of
    Americans and keep their communities safe.”
-   [State Sen. Brent
    Taylor](https://x.com/SenBrentTaylor/status/1967677648177398086):
    “While Democrats refuse the help, I’m grateful for President Trump’s
    willingness to send federal resources to Memphis. We don’t have to
    live this way. Safe and clean streets are in our future, and I
    appreciate all who partner with us to make our community a better
    place to raise a family.”
-   [State Rep. John
    Gillespie](https://x.com/repgillespie/status/1966503705823351160):
    “I’m grateful to @POTUS, Sen. @MarshaBlackburn, & @GovBillLee for
    working together to protect the Memphis community. I’m encouraged
    about the National Guard deployment to Memphis. The additional
    resources will bolster state & local law enforcement efforts to get
    control of crime.”
