**It’s a key step forward in accelerating President Donald J. Trump’s
energy dominance agenda by fortifying our supply chains to meet energy
demand.** The company cites the White House [AI Action
Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf)
as its catalyst — the Trump Administration’s
transformative [strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/07/white-house-unveils-americas-ai-action-plan/) to
propel the U.S. into a new era of AI dominance and cement our position
as the global AI powerhouse.

Earlier this year, President Trump
[showcased](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/07/president-trump-solidifies-u-s-position-as-leader-in-ai/)
an unprecedented [$92 billion
commitment](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/07/icymi-president-trump-announces-92-billion-in-ai-energy-powerhouse-investments/)
by many of the world’s leading energy and technology companies to build
cutting-edge AI and energy infrastructure in Pennsylvania.

Meanwhile, the Trump Administration has overseen an [investment
boom](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/08/trump-effect-a-running-list-of-new-u-s-investment-in-president-trumps-second-term/)
as companies race to onshore production, expand manufacturing
operations, and build new critical infrastructure amid President Trump’s
America First trade policy.
