In a [new
op-ed](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/09/22/autism-trump-nih-fda-cms-op-ed-00575420),
National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, FDA
Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary, and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz outline the bold new initiatives
the Trump Administration is taking to finally tackle the autism epidemic
amid its [dramatic
rise](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1970229029400911992) in
prevalence over the past two decades.

**From the op-ed:**

*“President Donald Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
challenged us to break down the walls between our agencies so we can
rapidly address the health crises facing the American people. Today, we
announce an approach to provide relief for children on the autism
spectrum.*

*This administration’s bold action — opening the door to the first
FDA-recognized treatment for autism, confronting environmental and
medical risk factors, and investing in groundbreaking research — follows
the science, restores trust and will deliver hope to millions of
families. The nearly five-fold increased prevalence of autism in recent
decades demands a rapid response — with prompt research and by acting on
information as it becomes available.*

*Despite the sharp rise in autism prevalence, there is no scientific
consensus on what is causing rates to grow, and families have few
effective tools to prevent or treat it. Today, the Trump administration
launched a trio of initiatives representing unprecedented cooperation
across the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the U.S. Food & Drug
Administration (FDA), and the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services
(CMS), the three agencies we lead, to provide help for families.”*
