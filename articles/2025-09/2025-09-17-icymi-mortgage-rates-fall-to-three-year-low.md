Mortgage rates have fallen to their [lowest levels in three
years](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/mortgage-rates-drop-to-3-year-low-ahead-of-fed-meeting.html),
making the [third straight
week](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-10/us-mortgage-rates-at-11-month-low-rekindle-home-finance-activity)
of declines as President Donald J. Trump continues to make good on his
promise to lower costs for the American people.

**From**
[**CNBC**](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/mortgage-rates-drop-to-3-year-low-ahead-of-fed-meeting.html)**:**

*“Mortgage rates dropped sharply Tuesday, as investors in
mortgage-backed bonds seemed to buy in ahead of a widely expected rate
cut by the Federal Reserve.*

*The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage dropped 12 basis points
from Monday to 6.13%, according to Mortgage News Daily. That is the
lowest level since late 2022.”*
