<td>The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy has decided
to recompete the Awards for the 2025 DFC Support Program to ensure that
applicants are in compliance with the President’s Executive Orders. DFC
Awards are granted every year to drug-free youth coalition organizations
across the nation that have applied for federal funding through ONDCP’s
DFC Support Program.<br />
<br />
It is imperative that ONDCP protects American taxpayer dollars. Our team
is working aggressively to put safeguards in place towards advancing
President Trump’s America-First policy agenda and mission. We are
performing due diligence to ensure that absolutely no taxpayer dollars
go to furthering the radical left’s agenda.<br />
<br />
The money remains available for awards. We want to ensure that the money
entrusted to our office is being responsibly allocated to the
communities that are actually working to protect our youth from drugs.
