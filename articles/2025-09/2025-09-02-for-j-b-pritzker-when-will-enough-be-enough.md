title: For J.B. Pritzker, When Will Enough Be Enough?

Nearly 60 people were shot and at least [nine people were
killed](https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2025/09/02/labor-day-weekend-violence-crime-brandon-johnson-donald-trump)
in Chicago [over Labor Day
weekend](https://abcnews.go.com/US/57-shot-weekend-chicago-governor-rejects-trumps-threat/story?id=125134744)
amid [dozens of
shootings](https://news.wttw.com/2025/09/02/eight-people-killed-gunfire-over-labor-day-weekend-chicago-police)
that marked the most violent holiday weekend of the summer in one of the
nation’s [most dangerous
cities](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/08/yes-chicago-has-a-crime-problem-just-ask-its-residents/).
The shootings included a drive-by attack that

seven people and another that resulted in a teenage girl getting

stray bullet.

No problem, according to Democrat Gov. J.B. Pritzker — who has
repeatedly resisted
[calls](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960006729619443983) from
President Donald J. Trump to ask for assistance in quelling the violence
after the Trump Administration’s

[success](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1961048093660508396)
cracking down on crime in the nation’s capital.

**According to Pritzker:**

-   “We’ve been trying to prevent crime and it’s been working.”
    ([Link](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/guard-not-needed-in-chicago-pritzker-tells-ap-during-tour-of-city-to-counter-trumps-crime-claims#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%E2%80%99ve%20been%20fighting%20crime.%20We%E2%80%99ve%20been%20trying%20to%20prevent%20crime%20and%20it%E2%80%99s%20been%20working.%E2%80%9D))
-   “We have our job, which is to fight violent crime on the streets of
    our city — and by the way, we’re succeeding.”
    ([Link](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1962168311614931214))
-   “There is no emergency.”

-   “Donald Trump is attempting to manufacture a crisis.”
    ([Link](https://gov-pritzker-newsroom.prezly.com/statement-from-governor-pritzker-on-reports-of-military-deployments))
-   “Big cities have crime.”

Despite pleas from
[residents](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/08/yes-chicago-has-a-crime-problem-just-ask-its-residents/#:~:text=Chicago%E2%80%99s%20residents%20want%20action%3A),
[members of](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1962854649771294748)
[the city
council](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960038758855881215), and
[even MSNBC](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1962854049486643572),
Pritzker is too blinded by Trump Derangement Syndrome to take action in
the best interest of his constituents and end the bloodshed.

**The Trump Administration’s message to Chicagoans and residents in
Democrat-run cities nationwide is simple:** [**you don’t have to live
like
this**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1961117590467514686)**.**
