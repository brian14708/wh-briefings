*This List Designates the Countries Responsible for Producing and
Transporting Illicit Drugs to the United States*

On September 15, President Trump delivered the “Major’s List” to
Congress, designating the countries responsible for sourcing and
transporting illicit drugs into the United States. The State Department
announced the Presidential Determination of these 23 countries, with
five countries—Afghanistan, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, and
Venezuela—listed as having “failed demonstrably to make substantial
efforts,” calling upon them to improve their counternarcotics efforts.
By manufacturing and trafficking illicit drugs and precursor chemicals,
these countries are threatening the safety of the United States and its
citizens.

Under President Trump’s leadership, the White House Office of Drug
Control Policy (ONDCP) will use every tool in our arsenal to hold these
designated countries accountable and keep illicit drugs from pouring
into our country and destroying American lives.
