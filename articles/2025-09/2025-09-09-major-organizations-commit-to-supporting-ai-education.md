## Charter Communications

“Charter Communications, which operates under the Spectrum brand in its
local communities, today announced its participation in the federal
“Invest in America” Trump Accounts initiative, further strengthening the
Company’s commitment to its 100% U.S.-based employee workforce. Charter
will match the federal government’s $1,000 contribution for its
employees’ children, doubling the impact of the program for thousands of
working families across the country. In addition, the Company plans to
offer employees additional ways to direct their own pay into their
children’s “Invest in America” Trump Accounts.

“When employees know their children have a pathway to financial
security, it shapes how they view their future and their place at
Spectrum – that’s good for customers and our communities, and that’s
good business,” said Chris Winfrey, President and CEO of Charter
Communications. “Our participation in ‘Invest in America’ Trump Accounts
benefits the children of Spectrum employees with a dollar-for-dollar
match of the government’s $1,000 investment. This initiative helps
nurture future prosperity, supporting our employees and their families
as we grow together.”

Charter’s participation in “Invest in America” Trump Accounts builds on
its broader commitment to employee financial security, and specifically,
its frontline, U.S.-based sales and service workforce. The Company
recently introduced an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) that gives
employees the option to purchase Charter stock and receive matching
Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) based on tenure. In the ESPP’s first
six-month enrollment window, nearly 20% of eligible employees
participated. Charter also offers a market-leading retirement plan with
a Company contribution of up to 9% of eligible pay per year;
comprehensive health benefits for which Charter has absorbed the full
annual cost increase for the last 12 years; and a starting wage of at
least $20 per hour, nearly three times the federal minimum wage.

Promoting financial well-being is one part of Charter’s investment in
its workforce, alongside meaningful opportunities for development and
career growth. High quality craftsmanship from U.S.-based employees is
what Spectrum customers want and why the Company backs its work with a
market-leading Customer Commitment for reliable connectivity, same-day
service and money-back guarantees when these standards aren’t met.

Charter’s Education Benefit covers 100% of tuition costs for full-time
employees pursuing select degrees and certificates, and its
self-progression programs for frontline roles provide the opportunity
for employees to advance their careers and increase their earnings. In
Field Operations for example, employees complete coursework and receive
a $500 completion bonus to advance to the next level, earning up to a
10% increase in their hourly wage with each new level. The Company also
intends to create a path for employees to direct these completion
bonuses to their children’s “Invest in America” Trump Accounts.

By participating in “Invest in America” Trump Accounts, Charter is
extending its long-standing employee support to directly benefit the
next generation. This new benefit adds to the Company’s broader strategy
to attract and retain talent, strengthen families and support employees
at every stage of life.”

## Mason Contractors Association of America

“The Mason Contractors Association of America (MCAA)’s Wall Evaluation
software provides a standardized, objective evaluation for vocational
students in the masonry industry. This software creates a near-instant
digital mesh of a student’s project, scoring it on multiple criteria to
objectively assess their hands-on performance.

This initiative is designed not only to benchmark student performance
but also to bridge the critical gap between what educational
institutions define as “career ready” and what the construction industry
defines as career ready.

Typically, traditional education relies on testing with the use of
scantron forms and other paper tests to assess progression and
advancement in a skilled trade. This new Wall Evaluator (powered by AI)
offers an industry critical assessment of skill, something much more
important, and can track progression of a student from day one to
graduation. It takes the subjectivity out of the assessment process. The
actual evaluation of students based on hands-on initiatives, is the
definition of craft training and evaluation and will align education
need for objective assessments and show of progression and industry need
for students who are on their way to mastering a craft. This potential
collaboration between industry and public educators provides a tangible,
data-driven solution to ensure expectation of industry and the newly
graduated craftsperson.”
