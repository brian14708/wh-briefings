Overview

Overall inflation in the United States has eased. Headline CPI increased
at a 1.9 percent annualized rate from January through July. Under the
hood, there has been a shift in relative prices. Core goods (which
exclude food and energy) inflation has risen modestly, which has been
more than offset by a decline in services inflation. Some commentators
have been quick to attribute the increase in goods inflation to trade
policy. However, placing the increase in an international context
highlights the following facts:

-   Core goods inflation has increased globally over the past 12 months.
-   Even with the increase, core goods inflation in the United States
    remains at a low level (1.2 percent over the 12 months through July
    and 1.1 percent annualized since January). Itâ€™s also lower than in
    other countries.
-   Based on core goods inflation in other countries this year, we would
    have expected core goods prices to have increased by more than they
    actually increased from January through July.
