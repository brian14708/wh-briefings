    **with a striking montage showing the best moments of the first 200
    days:** “That’s 200 days — not four years, by the way.”

    **President Trump’s border security with the Biden Administration’s
    open border:** “We now have the most secure border in modern
    American history after a four-year period where millions upon
    millions of illegal aliens poured into the country each year and Joe
    Biden told us the border was closed. In the month of July, for a
    third month in a row, zero illegal aliens were released into the
    country.”
-   **White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller**
    [**outlined**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1953612380950143040)
    **the long list of victories achieved for the American people:**
    “It’s the reawakening of the American spirit — putting our country
    first, our people first, our citizens first, in every interaction
    around the world. We have a President now who is defending, with
    every ounce of his being, the wellbeing of the American people.”
-   **Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy**
    [**delivered**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1953624243033239800)
    **an update on the Trump Administration’s air traffic control
    overhaul:** “We just got a historic downpayment — $12.5 billion. We
    have a plan in place to spend that money and to make it great… We’ve
    surged more air traffic controllers into our Academy… We are on the
    pathway to making sure that we resolve all of these delays and
    cancellations that take place on our airspace.”
-   **Duffy**

    **the success of the Administration’s English language proficiency
    requirement for truck drivers:** “We have taken 1,500 trucks out of
    service — off the roads — because the drivers couldn’t speak
    English… English is the language of the United States of America —
    and if you’re going to get in a mobile missile, you should speak our
    language.”
-   **Secretary of Education Linda McMahon**
    [**spotlighted**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1953619548868940187)
    **the Administration’s America First education policy:** “What the
    President wants to do is to get the bureaucracy out of education.
    The fact that we have to spend over 50 cents of every dollar that
    goes to a school for regulatory compliance is just ridiculous. That
    money should be going to kids, it should be going to schools, it
    should be put into teachers’ pay… We’re going to have much better
    education in our country by returning it to the states.”
-   **Border Czar Tom Homan**
    [**described**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1953616902456062299)
    **the stunning results of the Administration’s border security
    effort:** “Within seven weeks, President Trump gave us the most
    secure border in the history of this nation, and the numbers prove
    it. He did in seven weeks what Joe Biden couldn’t — and wouldn’t —
    do in four years… I’ve been doing this for over 40 years; they’re
    certainly the lowest numbers I’ve ever seen — but going back in the
    history books, we can’t find a more secure border in the history of
    this nation than we have today.”
-   **Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing Peter Navarro**
    [**reflected**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1953620309531124179)
    **on the differences between the first and second terms:** “The
    President pursued an agenda much like he’s doing now, which is to
    say deregulation, tax cuts, good-paying jobs, and most of all,
    getting tough on trade, having fair trade. The difference is how the
    Trump trade policy is being welcomed now and acknowledged as working
    beautifully… This is night and day — everybody working for the
    President is pulling an oar in the right direction… He is the
    greatest President in modern history.”
-   **State Department Spokeswoman Tammy Bruce perfectly**
    [**summarized**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1953626301467677079)
    **foreign policy in President Trump’s return:** “America is back
    because Donald Trump is back.”
