title: BLS Has Lengthy History of Inaccuracies, Incompetence
---
 
A lengthy history of inaccuracies and incompetence by Erika McEntarfer,
the former Biden-appointed Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, has completely eroded public trust in the government agency
charged with disseminating key data used by policymakers and businesses
to make consequential decisions.

**Under McEntarfer, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) consistently
published overly optimistic jobs numbers — only for those numbers to be
quietly revised later:**

-   Today, BLS had to revise down May and June jobs reports by a
    [combined](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/jobs-report-today-stock-market-08-01-2025/card/why-jobs-numbers-were-revised-sharply-downward-for-june-may-kBugDhlM4tT7W0SpXaOa?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAg_YkmCDsDSaVvUPruRvviZu8B_ARq7aHV7_cgIYCYuNyVdBnimJBSQ&gaa_ts=688d28cb&gaa_sig=JtJvlFEQJuUtaGpmEKYR93EaDs56MhAeCGKbJYcfjxVqYLWO3RBwhZdWzxeGfE98HnPYhbv7XwqWNDaJkMhgkg%3D%3D)
    258,000 jobs. These previous faulty jobs reports enabled the Federal
    Reserve to continue its disastrous policy of keeping interest rates
    high.

        style="letter-spacing: 0.2px"><em>The New York Times</em> reported</a><span style="letter-spacing: 0.2px">:
        “A solid jobs report for May has reinforced the Federal
        Reserve’s stance that it can take its time before restarting
        interest rate cuts.</span>
    -   On July 3, [*The New York Times*
        reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/03/business/jobs-fed-rate-cuts.html)
        that the June jobs report “fortifies the Federal Reserve’s case
        that it does not need to be in a hurry to lower borrowing
        costs.”
-   Last year, BLS
    [revised](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/business/economy/us-jobs-economy.html)
    down the benchmark payroll growth for the year ending in March 2024
    by 818,000 jobs — the
    [second-largest](https://x.com/RealEJAntoni/status/1826290040374243821)
    benchmark revision on record.
    -   [The Daily
        Caller](https://dailycaller.com/2024/08/23/jobs-biden-admin-announced-year-not-real-revisions/):
        “Including monthly revisions, the Biden administration
        overstated the number of jobs in the U.S. economy by 1.18
        million in the year through March, accounting for approximately
        36% of the 3.24 million jobs initially claimed, according to
        data from the BLS calculated by the Daily Caller News
        Foundation”
-   In July 2024, BLS
    [revised](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/outlook/economic-outlook/jobs-report-june-2024)
    jobs added in May of that year down by 54,000 jobs, and the jobs
    added in April down by 57,000 jobs.
-   In April 2024, BLS
    [revised](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/outlook/economic-outlook/jobs-report-march-2024)
    the jobs added in February of that year down — then further
    [revised](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/outlook/economic-outlook/jobs-report-april-2024)
    the number down the following month.
-   In February 2024, BLS
    [revised](https://www.clearstar.net/february-2024-jobs-report-shows-u-s-economy-added-275000-jobs-in-month/)
    the jobs added in December of the prior year down by 43,000 jobs and
    the jobs added in January of that year down by 124,000 jobs.
-   [Bloomberg, 11/15/24](https://archive.ph/no8Nj): “Two key Senate
    Republicans excoriated the US government statistics agency
    responsible for monthly employment reports, saying recent
    large-scale revisions to initial figures show its ‘continued
    failures’ in producing crucial economic data … A preliminary annual
    revision to the jobs data, made in August, suggested job growth in
    the 12 months through March will be marked down by more than 800,000
    — the largest downward revision since 2009 — making waves in
    financial markets and on Capitol Hill. The final data is due early
    next year.”
-   [Bloomberg, 6/6/24](https://archive.ph/kICAG): “Data published
    Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggest payrolls might
    have grown about 60,000 less per month on average last year than the
    roughly 250,000 run-rate derived from the agency’s monthly
    employment report.”
-   [The Heritage Foundation,
    5/3/2024](https://www.heritage.org/jobs-and-labor/commentary/new-government-data-shows-the-economy-may-be-losing-jobs):
    “The BLS provides monthly estimates for the number of nonfarm
    payrolls across the country through a survey of over 600,000
    businesses. According to that data, payrolls increased by 640,000 in
    the third quarter of last year … But now, the BLS has published its
    Business Employment Dynamics, or BED, report from that same period,
    and it shows a drop in private payrolls of 192,000. That’s a mammoth
    difference of 832,000 for the months of July, August and September.”

**During McEntarfer’s tenure, BLS was consistently plagued by technical
errors and leaks of sensitive information:**

-   [*The Washington Post*, 8/28/24](https://archive.is/rMkbO): “The
    Bureau of Labor Statistics said Wednesday that a technical issue
    caused delays last week in the scheduled release of jobs data that
    carried major implications for the economy and the presidential
    election. Outside parties, the BLS said, then got the data because
    of a lack of communication within the agency over how to respond to
    public inquiries … The episode is at least the third in a series of
    missteps this year that critics argue may undermine faith in the
    agency.”
-   [*The Washington Post*, 8/28/24](https://archive.is/rMkbO): “Last
    week’s episode involved data closely watched by economists, Wall
    Street traders, and Federal Reserve officials who are keeping close
    tabs on employment as they prepare to cut interest rates. The lapse
    happened just days before the Fed sent its strongest signal yet that
    it was time to take pressure off the economy, in large part because
    officials fear that the labor market is softening — so financial
    markets were anticipating the release even more than usual.”
-   [*The Washington Post*, 8/28/24](https://archive.is/rMkbO): “The job
    revisions for last year and early 2024 appeared on a government
    website about a half-hour after their scheduled release time. But
    despite the delay, a handful of financial firms were able to obtain
    the information — which showed the largest downward revision to
    annual job creation in 15 years — before it was posted publicly. The
    gaffe appeared to run counter to the nonpartisan statistical
    agency’s long-standing policies intended to prevent individual
    stakeholders, particularly financial traders, from gaining any edge
    by ensuring that information is made widely accessible to everyone
    at the same time.”
-   [House Committee on Education and the Workforce,
    12/10/24](https://edworkforce.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=412081):
    -   “In
        [March](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/19/business/economy/bls-housing-inflation-email.html)
        \[2024\], news reports revealed a BLS economist shared nonpublic
        information with several Wall Street firms.”
    -   “On [May
        15](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/16/cpi-data-released-early-says-labor-department.html)\[,
        2024\], BLS accidentally loaded data files to its website 30
        minutes prior to the scheduled release time of the consumer
        price index.”
    -   “On [August
        21](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/business/economy/bls-jobs-revision-data-leak.html)\[,
        2024\], while the public waited for the release of the job
        numbers, some Wall Street firms got a head start as BLS released
        the numbers to firms that spoke to the agency by phone,
        potentially giving them an unfair advantage.”
    -   “On [August
        26](https://edworkforce.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=411873)\[,
        2024\], Chairwoman Foxx and Health, Employment, Labor, and
        Pensions Subcommittee Chairman Bob Good (R-VA) called out the
        Biden-Harris administration for exaggerating job growth when
        revised BLS numbers proved an overestimate of more than 800,000
        jobs.”
    -   “On [September
        25](https://edworkforce.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=411987)\[,
        2024\], to hold BLS accountable for its inability to ensure data
        is released uniformly and on time, Foxx and Good demanded
        answers from the Biden-Harris administration.”
    -   “On [October
        25](https://edworkforce.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=412019)\[,
        2024\], after BLS ignored the congressional request and
        additional disturbing reports surfaced in the press about BLS
        actions the day of the job numbers release on \[August 21,
        2024\], the Committee reupped its oversight inquiry and sent a
        follow-up letter to BLS.”
