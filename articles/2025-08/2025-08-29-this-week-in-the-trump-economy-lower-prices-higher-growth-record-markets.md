revive America’s energy capabilities

“lower rates and solid economic growth” as the primary driver. After
housing costs
[soared](https://www.heritage.org/housing/commentary/why-open-border-means-more-expensive-housing)
as the Biden Administration let millions of illegal immigrants into the
country, the Trump Administration has made housing affordability a [top
priority](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1961169996177907871) —
and it’s working.

### **📈** **Dow, S&P 500 notch fresh records**

highs](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/sp-500-dow-score-record-high-closes-nvidia-results-buttress-ai-rally-2025-08-28/),

track](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/28/stock-market-today-live-updates-.html#:~:text=The%20S%26P,points%2C%20or%200.3%25.)
to post its fourth straight winning month in a row as corporate earnings

and the One Big Beautiful Bill

renewed economic optimism.

### **💰** **GDP shatters expectations**

Second-quarter GDP was [revised up to
3.3%](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1961055769333223629) —
smashing many economists’ expectations and demonstrating the ongoing
economic resilience underway in President Trump’s economy. The report
also [showed](https://x.com/jackikotkiewicz/status/1961052965172662676)
increased consumer spending and business investment, while inflation
remains low, stable, and right on track with the Federal Reserve’s
target.
