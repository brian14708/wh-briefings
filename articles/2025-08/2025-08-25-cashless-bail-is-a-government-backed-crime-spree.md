title: "\u201CCashless Bail\u201D Is a Government-Backed Crime Spree"
---
 
President Donald J. Trump’s aggressive crackdown to end the failed
experiment known as “cashless bail” aims to get violent criminals off
our streets — starting in Washington, D.C., where dangerous predators
are being set free to offend again and again.

**The Radical Left’s fantasy of so-called “cashless bail” has turned the
streets of America’s cities into hunting grounds for repeat criminals
who mock our justice system by committing crime after crime without
consequence.**

    [smeared his own
    feces](https://nypost.com/2022/02/28/man-smears-poop-on-woman-in-nyc-subway-station/)
    on a random woman waiting for the subway — despite having dozens of
    prior arrests, including for slugging a bus driver just months
    earlier and a heinous [hate

    minor](https://nypost.com/2024/10/22/us-news/tren-de-aragua-member-trafficked-15-year-old-nyc-runaway-while-free-on-attempted-slay-rap-cops/).
