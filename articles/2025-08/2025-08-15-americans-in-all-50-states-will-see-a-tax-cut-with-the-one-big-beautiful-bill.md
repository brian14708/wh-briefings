title: Americans in All 50 States Will See a Tax Cut with the One Big Beautiful Bill
---
 
> “*President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill is the largest, most

The average American taxpayer will see a tax cut of $3,752 thanks to
President Donald J. Trump’s [One Big Beautiful
Bill](https://www.whitehouse.gov/obbb), [according to a new
analysis](https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/federal/obbba-average-tax-cuts-impact-map/)
— which finds the landmark legislation “will reduce federal taxes on
average for individual taxpayers in every state” and create nearly one
million new jobs.

The historic law — which
[includes](https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/american-worker/) No Tax on
Tips, No Tax on Overtime, [No Tax on Social
Security](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/The-One-Big-Beautiful-Bill-Delivers-On-President-Trumps-Promise-Of-No-Tax-On-Social-Security.pdf),
an expanded Child Tax Credit, Made in America tax breaks, small business
tax cuts, and much more — is a cornerstone of President Trump’s economic
agenda, which is [taming
inflation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/08/wages-grow-as-inflation-remains-low-and-stable/),
[driving historic
investments](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/08/trump-effect-a-running-list-of-new-u-s-investment-in-president-trumps-second-term/),
and [fueling a blue-collar wage
boom](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1956375347219333572).

[**From the Tax
Foundation**](https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/federal/obbba-average-tax-cuts-impact-map/)**:**

*“We estimate the OBBBA will reduce federal taxes on average for
individual taxpayers in every state… Across all individual tax filers
throughout the country, the average tax cut per taxpayer will be $3,752
in 2026… Tax Foundation estimates the OBBBA will create about 938,000
full-time equivalent jobs over the long run, ranging from more than
132,000 jobs in California and 81,000 jobs in Texas to about 1,700 new
jobs in Vermont.”*
