title: "\u2705 200 Days of Winning: President Trump Is Keeping His Promises"
---
 
**As President Donald J. Trump celebrates 200 days in office, the
winning is never-ending — and if his** [**first 100
days**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/05/president-trump-highlights-victories-for-americans-sets-path-for-next-100-days/)
**were historic, his second set was equally as impressive.** From
securing unprecedented trade deals and locking in massive investments to
unleashing American energy dominance and ending woke culture, President
Trump has accomplished more in his first 200 days than most
administrations do over an entire term — and the best is yet to come.

**President Trump made good on even more of his promises between Day 100
and Day 200:**

**PROMISE MADE:** “We’re going to have very large tax cuts for workers
and … No Tax on Tips, No Tax on Overtime.”
([10/12/2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJgCq3igruE&t=586s))

-   **✅ PROMISE KEPT:** President Trump
    [signed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/obbb/) the One Big Beautiful
    Bill into law, delivering the [largest tax cut in
    history](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/06/the-largest-tax-cut-in-history-for-working-and-middle-class-americans/) for
    working- and middle-class Americans — including No Tax on Tips, No
    Tax on Overtime, and No Tax on Social Security — along with
    unprecedented tax relief for small businesses, farmers, workers, and
    families.

**PROMISE MADE:** “We will close the border. We will stop the invasion
of illegals into our
country.” ([10/12/24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xguaneoZ5A&t=4624s))

-   **✅ PROMISE KEPT:** The U.S.
    [reached](https://x.com/BillMelugin_/status/1951275406029660380) a
    new monthly immigration low for illegal crossings at the southern
    border — including multiple months in a row with ZERO illegal
    immigrants released into the country’s interior. Border wall
    construction has resumed, with new border barrier projects underway
    in [El Paso](https://x.com/CBP/status/1945844840731754583) and the
    [Rio Grande
    Valley](https://www.borderreport.com/immigration/the-border-wall/new-border-wall-going-up-over-existing-barrier-in-rio-grande-valley/).

**PROMISE MADE:** “We get all these bad deals. We changed a lot of them…
but still plenty of them out there — a lot of unfair deals. If China or
any other country makes us pay a tariff… we will make them pay a
reciprocal tariff.”
([3/9/24](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-speech-political-rally-rome-georgia-march-9-2024/#233:~:text=I%20will%20pass,than%20ever%20before.))

-   **✅ PROMISE KEPT:** President Trump reached eight historic trade

    — keeping his promise to liberate the country from decades of
    failed, anti-American trade policy.

**PROMISE MADE:** “A vote for President Donald J. Trump is a vote for
prosperity.”
([9/13/24](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-speech-campaign-rally-las-vegas-september-13-2024/#176))
