title: President Trump Demands America First Prescription Drug Pricing
---
 
Last week, President Donald J. Trump sent
[letters](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1950986943229010015) to
17 of the leading pharmaceutical companies outlining [steps they must
take](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/07/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-announces-actions-to-get-americans-the-best-prices-in-the-world-for-prescription-drugs/)
to lower prescription drug prices for Americans — including [matching
the lowest
price](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/05/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-announces-actions-to-put-american-patients-first-by-lowering-drug-prices-and-stopping-foreign-free-riding-on-american-pharmaceutical-innovation/)
offered in other developed nations.

**There is no reason American consumers should pay exorbitantly more
than other countries for the same drug in the same packaging and
manufactured in the same factory.** That’s why President Trump warned
the companies that if they “refuse to step up, we will deploy every tool
in our arsenal to protect American families from continued abusive drug
pricing practices.”

****Meanwhile, there’s evidence it’s working:****

-   [**CNBC**](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/30/healthy-returns-astrazeneca-proposes-us-drug-price-cuts-to-trump.html)**:**
    “President Donald Trump has been pressuring pharmaceutical companies
    to lower U.S. drug costs, and it may be starting to work — at least
    on AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca has proposed price cuts to certain drugs
    in the U.S., its CEO \[Sir\] Pascal Soriot told reporters.”
-   [**Reuters**](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/gsk-talks-with-trump-administration-us-drug-pricing-ceo-says-2025-07-30/)**:**
    “British drugmaker GSK said on Wednesday it is in talks with the
    Trump administration about ways to lower U.S. drug costs, becoming
    the latest pharmaceutical company to acknowledge action under
    pressure from Washington to rein in prices.”
