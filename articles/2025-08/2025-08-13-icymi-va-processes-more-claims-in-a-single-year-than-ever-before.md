title: "ICYMI: \u201CVA processes more claims in a single year than ever before\u201D"

Today, in a resounding victory for America’s heroes, the Department of
Veterans Affairs announced they have processed a record 2.5 million
ratings claims so far in fiscal year 2025 — another milestone in
eliminating the massive backlog inherited from the Biden Administration.
This extraordinary progress, highlighted by a 37% reduction in pending
claims since President Donald J. Trump’s inauguration, demonstrates the
Trump Administration’s unwavering commitment to deliver swift, efficient
benefits to our nation’s heroes.

[**From the
VA**](https://news.va.gov/press-room/va-processes-more-claims-in-a-single-year-than-ever-before/)**:**

***“****In fiscal year 2024, VA processed a total of 2,517,519 ratings
claims, and this year the department reached an all-time high of
2,524,115 ratings claims issued Aug. 8 — nearly two months before the
end of FY25.*

*The milestone is the latest in a string of noteworthy VA claims
processing achievements. Since President Trump was inaugurated Jan. 20,
the backlog of Veterans waiting for VA benefits has dropped by more than
37%, after rising 24% during the Biden Administration.*

*In July, VA completed more than 300,000 ratings claims in a single
month for the first time ever. VA is processing claims faster in FY25
than in FY24, completing them 17.8% faster even as receipts are 10%
higher than this time last year.”*
