title: 'FACT: Yes, D.C. Crime Is Out of Control'
---
 
Washington, D.C. should be a symbol of pride and patriotism for the
American people — and a safe location for tourists, residents, and
public servants. Unfortunately, while Fake News journalists and
politicians go out of their way to claim otherwise, the reality is that
our nation’s capital is anything but safe.

    residents](https://www.rit.edu/liberalarts/sites/rit.edu.liberalarts/files/docs/CPSI%20Working%20Papers/2025-02_CPSI%20Working%20Paper_US%20City%20Homicide%20Stats.pdf).
    -   That was the [fourth-highest homicide
        rate](https://www.rit.edu/liberalarts/sites/rit.edu.liberalarts/files/docs/CPSI%20Working%20Papers/2025-02_CPSI%20Working%20Paper_US%20City%20Homicide%20Stats.pdf)
