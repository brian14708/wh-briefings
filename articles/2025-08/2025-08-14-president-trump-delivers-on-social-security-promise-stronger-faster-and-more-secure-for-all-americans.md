**President Donald J. Trump
[repeatedly](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1898754137161965642)
[promised](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1894802469445591437) to
preserve and protect Social Security for every eligible American — and
he has unquestionably delivered.** As Social Security celebrates its
[90th
anniversary](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/social-security-90-years-old-we-making-smarter-better-faster-under-trump),
the Trump Administration’s bold improvements to customer service,
technology, and efficiency have positioned the agency to provide quicker
access and greater value for the beneficiaries it serves.

**That includes President Trump making good on his No Tax on Social
Security [campaign
promise](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/07/president-trump-has-kept-his-promises-and-then-some/#:~:text=Large%20tax%20cuts,workers%2C%20and%20families.).**
Thanks to the [One Big Beautiful Bill](https://www.whitehouse.gov/obbb/)
— now the law of the land — the vast majority of seniors receiving
Social Security will [no longer pay
taxes](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/The-One-Big-Beautiful-Bill-Delivers-On-President-Trumps-Promise-Of-No-Tax-On-Social-Security.pdf)
on that income.

**Under President Trump’s leadership:**

### **Social Security has transformed customer service.**

-   The agency is handling 70% more calls than last year, while lowering
    the average speed of answer by 80%, from 30 minutes to just six
    minutes.
-   Improved use of technology has enabled 90% of calls to the national
    line to be served via automated self-service options or callbacks,
    further minimizing [hold
    times](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1920478360251072583).
-   Average customer wait times at field offices have
    [declined](https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/releases/2025/#2025-07-23:~:text=SSA%20is%20reducing%20field%20office%20wait%20times.%20The%20agency%20reduced%20the%20wait%20time%20in%20field%20offices%20to%2023%20minutes%20so%20far%20this%20year%2C%20compared%20to%2030%20minutes%20last%20year%2C%20or%20a%2023%20percent%20reduction.)
    by 23%, while five times as many visitors have scheduled
    appointments compared to last year.
-   All field offices are fully staffed, with employees returning to the
    office five days a week for the first time in years to better serve
    the American people.

### **Social Security has made vast technology improvements.**

-   Americans now have 24/7/365 access to their online accounts after
    [reducing](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1951257225923539053)
    the longstanding scheduled downtime of 29 hours per week to zero —
    enabling over 280,000 more customers to access their online accounts
    in the first two weeks alone.
-   A new recording and transcription system to replace antiquated
    hardware is near full implementation — increasing accuracy and
    saving millions of dollars per year.
-   Innovative upgrades to phone technology have been deployed to 92% of
    field offices.

### **Social Security has driven down backlogs and delivered ahead of schedule.**

-   There has been a 26% reduction in the backlog of initial disability
    claims from its all-time high last year, while the average
    processing time has been cut down by five days and the average wait
    time for a disability hearing has been
    [cut](https://blog.ssa.gov/social-security-achieves-key-milestones-in-customer-service-transformation/)
    by 60 days.
-   Over 3.1 million payments — totaling more than $17 billion — were
    [sent](https://blog.ssa.gov/social-security-achieves-key-milestones-in-customer-service-transformation/)
    to eligible beneficiaries under the Social Security Fairness Act
    five months ahead of schedule.

### **Social Security has dramatically increased accountability.**

-   The agency has identified more than $1 billion in cost avoidance and
    efficiencies this fiscal year.
-   The agency has
    [addressed](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1951255915916677169)
    billions of dollars in improper payments.
-   After years of delay, Social Security is rolling out a new payroll
    information exchange that will transmit information directly from
    payroll providers — saving billions of dollars in payments over the
    next decade.
