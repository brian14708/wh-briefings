title: President Trump Is Delivering on His Campaign Promise to Make D.C. Safe Again
---
 
President Donald J. Trump’s [executive
action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/08/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-declares-a-crime-emergency-to-restore-safety-in-the-district-of-columbia/)
to restore law and order to Washington, D.C. makes good on his campaign
pledge to dismantle the rampant [crime
crisis](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/08/fact-yes-d-c-crime-is-out-of-control/)
and transform our nation’s capital from a “nightmare of murder and
crime” into the safest and most beautiful city in the world.

**President Trump made the promise no fewer than 20 times:**

    “We will rebuild our once-great cities, including our capital in
    Washington, D.C., making them safe, clean, and beautiful again — and
    we want to make this city again safe. We don’t want people coming to
    Washington and getting mugged, shot, killed. We’re going to stop it.
    Law enforcement — and they have very good police here, but they have
    to be allowed to do their job. We’re going to stop it. We’re going
    to beautify it. We’re going to make it the most beautiful capital in
    the world.”

    we’re going to fix it very quickly and beautifully. We’re going to
    make it the most beautiful capital anywhere in the world — and we’re
