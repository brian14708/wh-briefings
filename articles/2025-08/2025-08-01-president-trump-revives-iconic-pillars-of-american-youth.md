title: President Trump Revives Iconic Pillars of American Youth
---
 
Yesterday, alongside American sports legends and members of his
administration, President Donald J. Trump signed an [Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/presidents-council-on-sports-fitness-and-nutrition-and-the-reesetablishment-of-the-presidential-fitness-test/)
reviving the Presidential Fitness Test and revitalizing the President’s
Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition — a natural extension of the
Trump Administration’s aim to end the childhood chronic disease epidemic
and foster the next generation of healthy, active citizens.

The Presidential Fitness Test is a time-honored tradition that has
inspired millions of American children to strive for their best
performance — physically, mentally, and civically — and served as the
gold standard for youth physical fitness across the country for
generations.

Meanwhile, the revitalized President’s Council on Sports, Fitness, and
Nutrition will create school-based programs to reward excellence in
physical education and support the development of a Presidential Fitness
Award — working in partnership with athletes, coaches, teams, and
schools to champion access to fitness and healthy living for all
Americans. The Council will also play an important role in restoring
tradition to college athletics, including reforming the broken transfer
portal and keeping men out of women’s sports.

The Council will include Executive Director Catherine Granito, Chair
Bryson DeChambeau, Saquon Barkley, Gary Bettman, Nick Bosa, Harrison
Butker, Cody Campbell, Roger Goodell, Wayne Gretzky, Nelly Korda, Paul
“Triple H” Levesque, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Mariano Rivera, Tony
Romo, Annika Sörenstam, Tua Tagovailoa, Lawrence Taylor, Matthew
Tkachuk, and Mariano Rivera.

It comes as the Trump Administration lays the groundwork for an American
sports renaissance. Over the next three years, the U.S. will host the
Ryder Cup, the President’s Cup, the FIFA World Cup, and the Summer
Olympics. The year 2026 will also mark the 250th anniversary of
America’s founding and the 70th anniversary of the original President’s
Council on Youth Fitness.
