title: The One Big Beautiful Bill Is Igniting an American Business Boom
---
 
**President Donald J. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill is fueling a
renaissance in American business competitiveness.** Thanks to the
landmark bill’s tax reforms — including [full
expensing](https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/the-one-big-beautiful-bill-boosts-made-in-america-manufacturing)
for new domestic factories, capital investments, and R&D, along with the
[largest tax cut in
history](https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/economic-growth/) and
[numerous other pro-growth provisions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/obbb/)
— companies nationwide are reporting enhanced cash flow, accelerated
job-creating investments, and increased business.

**In earnings reports and shareholder calls, companies are singling out
the legislation as a key catalyst for renewed optimism:**

    -   [CEO John
        Stankey](https://investors.att.com/~/media/Files/A/ATT-IR-V2/financial-reports/2q25-call-transcript.pdf):
        “Thanks to the policies in this legislation, we intend to invest
        more rapidly in next generation networks … In addition to
        investing a portion of these cash tax savings into our network,
        we intend to contribute $1.5 billion to our pension plan by the
        end of next year. This, coupled with the job creation associated
        with our stepped-up investments in world-class US communications
        infrastructure, demonstrates why the One Big Beautiful Bill Act
        is great policy for American workers.”

        “We are pleased that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act provides
        certainty for our previously announced $55 billion commitment to
        invest here in the United States. This includes provisions such
        as permanent expensing for domestic R&D spend, permanent bonus
        depreciation, and 100% expensing of qualified production
        property, including our newly planned facility in North

        “We did have very strong segment operating performance within
        the quarter, as you mentioned. One non-operational item that
        offset that was the change regarding tax reform. And overall,
        tax reform was a positive change, increasing cash flow that we
        can invest in the business, provide opportunities for people,
        and things of that nature.”

        “We saw a meaningful increase in our cash flow outlook. The

        result in roughly $200 million federal cash tax benefit this
        fiscal year.”

    -   [Executive VP and CFO Ted
        Grace](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4804340-united-rentals-inc-uri-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript):
        “Supported by the strength of our underlying business and the
        benefits from recent tax reform, we have increased our planned
        share repurchases for the year by $400 million to $1.9 billion.
        … The increase in free cash flow primarily reflects the benefits
        of recently enacted tax reform, which reinstated full expensing
        of CapEx and thus, will reduce our cash taxes.”

        “\[Customers\] are actually starting to engage us on that as
        that legislation has passed, and It does have benefits to their
        cash, their ability to deploy that cash for capital asset
        purchases like trucks is starting to be part of the conversation
        and is part of our optimism for the latter part of the year.”

        impact, which obviously benefits us from a cash flow
        perspective.”

        “All told, Zion estimates $148 billion in cash tax savings for a
        sample that covered 369 of the companies in the S&P 500. That is
        equivalent to 8.5% of the companies’ combined full-year
        estimates for free cash flow as of June 30, right before
        Congress passed the tax law.”
