President Donald J. Trump [fulfills his
promise](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/07/president-trump-has-kept-his-promises-and-then-some/#:~:text=Seal%20the%20border,the%20country%E2%80%99s%20interior.)

**“We may be dealing with — get this — negative net migration to the
United States in 2025. That would be the first time there is negative
net migration in this country in at least 50 years. We’re talking about
down from 2.8 million in 2024 … We are seeing record low levels, way
down from where we are during the Biden Administration,”** [says CNN’s
Harry Enten](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1952065321889902682).

The report aired as part of a [larger
segment](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1952064376984252644)
highlighting the historic first six months of President Trump’s second
term, in which Enten calls President Trump “the most influential
President of this century — and probably dating back a good portion of
last century.”
