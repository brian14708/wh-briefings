[unprecedented private sector job
growth](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960378761150361620),

[historic trade

[landmark tax
cuts](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960380355833102627), and
many other wins achieved on behalf of the American people.

**Here’s what else you missed:**

[**Vice President JD
Vance**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960400554729070627)**:**
“Public safety is not just something that should belong to the wealthy.
It should belong to every working man and woman in the United States of
America — and because of the work of this Administration, that is
happening.”

[**Secretary of Labor Lori
Chavez-DeRemer**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960399679222349934)**:**
“Unemployment is holding steady and more than two million net jobs for
native-born Americans has been key under your leadership. 84% of the
workforce and jobs has been produced by the private sector… \[The One
Big Beautiful Bill\] is protecting our American workforce by expanding
Pell Grants and childcare and a reduction in taxes.”

[**Secretary of the Interior Doug
Burgum**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960413612683747817)**:**
“You’ve led an opportunity for us to have lower taxes, way lower
deregulation, record amounts of investments that’s coming into this
country, we’re going to be seeing lower interest rates. All of those
things coming together is a gift to the working people. The policies are
lifting everybody up.”

[**Secretary of Education Linda
McMahon**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960391665828381059)**:**
“What I’m finding with great joy around the country is that states
really are being innovative in working more with middle schools and with
high schools to make sure that we are having hands-on learning, pathways
to jobs that are happening now… They’re learning on the job so that when
they graduate from high school, they’re ready to go into the workforce.”

[**Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Scott
Turner**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960403472614088749)**:**
“We have, at HUD, been very intentional about changing the conversation
about the dignity of work and the dignity and the honor of family
formation through work — and how the younger generation, when they see
their parents work, how they’re incentivized to work.”

[**Small Business Administrator Kelly
Loeffler**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960395717849108545)**:**
“\[The One Big Beautiful Bill is delivering\] the largest tax cut in
American history for working families. The average family of four is
going to save about $10,000 take home pay more a year. We’re seeing an
increase in the Child Tax Credit, an increase in the standard deduction
— hardworking families are going to benefit from this bill.”

[**Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug
Collins**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960406759983464607)**:**
“We’ve opened new facilities. We’ve put new facilities in places where
workers can get to. We’ve expanded out hours — over a million extra
hours so younger veterans, in particular, can get off work and bring
themselves to get their appointments after hours or on Saturdays… That’s
what it means for Labor Day because we can’t forget the ones that fought
for us.”

[**U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson
Greer**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960405132060901378)**:**
“In the last quarter of 2024, median weekly earnings fell 2.1%. In the
first quarter of your term, they went up 3.3% — and that’s why we’re
doing the trade policy we’re doing. It’s to help the workers of the
United States.”

[**Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy,
Jr.**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960391801941954660)**:**
“We’re raising an infusion of cash to rural hospitals and rural
communities by 50%. It’s going to be the biggest infusion in history and
it’s going to restore and revitalize these communities. We can’t survive
as a nation if we don’t honor our rural communities.”

[**Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi
Noem**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960396657293402135)**:**
“Today, the average family and individual that lives in this country is
safer than they’ve been in years… We’ve got three months in a row now
with zero illegal aliens coming into our country… 1.6 million people
voluntarily go home to their home countries — that were here in this
country illegally.”

[**Secretary of Energy Chris
Wright**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960398934922383610)**:**
“You led off today talking about gasoline prices. I’ll throw in diesel.
If you correct for inflation, they’re at multi-decade lows.”

[**Secretary of State Marco
Rubio**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960409870550643112)**:**
“You made it very clear from the outset, even in foreign policy,
everything we did has to be pro-American — it has to make America
stronger or safer or more prosperous…  For the first time in the modern
era, we are truly on offense against organized cartels that are pumping
poison — killer poison — into our cities.”

[**Secretary of the Treasury Scott
Bessent**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960401767209799999)**:**
“Economic security is national security and our country has never been
so secure… Your Administration has made a meaningful dent in the budget
deficit. The average budget deficit during this term is 26% less than
the last twelve months under Biden.”

[**Secretary of Agriculture Brooke
Rollins**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960402981683388903)**:**
“The Big Beautiful Bill… is the greatest investment in rural America in
history… A game-changer, a country saver.”

[**Secretary of Transportation Sean
Duffy**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960408567598497821)**:**
“We want to take the money that Congress gives us and actually deploy it
and put these men and women to work building the great projects of this
country… and that’s why we got rid of the DEI, we’ve got rid of the
‘green’… We’re going to move these projects faster, putting the great
American worker back to work.”

[**Attorney General Pam
Bondi**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960400032584360404)**:**
“\[Illegal alien gangs\] and others throughout this country, throughout
this world, have brought into our country drugs, cocaine, heroin,
fentanyl, methamphetamines. It’s killing our kids and we have to stop
that — and that’s what you’ve been doing, not only in D.C., but around
the country at your leadership.”

[**Secretary of Defense Pete
Hegseth**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960410925913268619)**:**
“\[The Department of Defense is\] the largest employer in America. We
like to think we have a different form of employees who need to be the
toughest and the strongest and the most well trained and the most
lethal. Under the previous administration and for decades, frankly, it
was social justice, it was political correctness, it was divisive
ideologies seeping into the ranks and changing how well we do our job.
No more. Now, it is only merit-based, gender-neutral, colorblind, the
best of the best from the top to the bottom. That is our expectation.”

[**Secretary of Commerce Howard
Lutnick**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960410275192168547)**:**
“Four days before you took office, the Commerce Department, which had
the CHIPS money, they set up… a make-believe not-for-profit. They signed
contracts to wire them $7.4 billion… We stopped the payment. We’ve got
the money.”

[**Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee
Zeldin**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960393606226739693)**:**
“In one agency, in one year, we’ll do more deregulation than entire
federal governments have done across all agencies across entire
presidencies.”

[**Director of National Intelligence Tulsi
Gabbard**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960394715615924589)**:**
“We’ve exposed some of the worst examples of the weaponization of
Intelligence in the last several weeks. I will continue down that
mission and that path — wherever it leads.”

[**Office of Management and Budget Director Russ
Vought**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960403697550418022)**:**
“We are at 245 deregulatory initiatives planned by these agencies. That
comes out to 30-for-1, so we are making incredible strides.”

[**Special Envoy Steve
Witkoff**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960405112716963929)**:**
“I was in Gaza — the first American diplomat on your behalf — and as we
delivered food and aid, pursuant to your new aid initiative… the people
were applauding you.”

[**CIA Director John
Ratcliffe**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960404406329073684)**:**
“The CIA workforce at the Trump CIA is grateful to be focused on what
it’s supposed to be, which is helping you prevent and end wars and to
make America safer.”
