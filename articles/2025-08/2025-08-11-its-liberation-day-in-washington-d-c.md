Today, President Donald J. Trump took bold
[executive](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/08/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-declares-a-crime-emergency-to-restore-safety-in-the-district-of-columbia/)
[action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/08/restoring-law-and-order-in-the-district-of-columbia/)
to liberate Washington, D.C., from the cesspool of crime and
homelessness that it has become after decades of unilateral Democrat
leadership.

**President Trump outlined his plan this morning:**

-   “This is Liberation Day in D.C. — and we’re going to take our
    capital BACK.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1954916584176443592))
-   “We’re declaring a public safety emergency in the District of
    Columbia — and Attorney General Pam Bondi is taking command of the
    Metropolitan Police Department as of this moment.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1954920633160331525))
-   “They’ll immediately begin massive enforcement operations targeting
    known gangs, drug dealers and criminal networks to get them the hell
    off the street.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1954921326629601637))
-   “The murder rate in Washington today is higher than that of Bogotá,
    Colombia, Mexico City… The number of car thefts has doubled over the
    past five years, and the number of carjackings has more than
    tripled.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1954916985361633535))
-   “This dire public safety crisis stems directly from the abject
    failures of the city’s local leadership.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1954919098325856546))

**President Trump’s bold action to end the lawlessness is welcome news
to residents and visitors alike:**

-   **“The mayor seems not to have enough control of the activities that
    are arising,**” [says a
    man](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1954880168268271727) whose
    three-year-old granddaughter was shot and killed in D.C.
-   **“This isn’t a partisan issue; this is a public safety issue,”**
    [says a former D.C. advisory neighborhood
    commissioner](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1953800902042685858).
-   **“If it’s going to stop the crime, then yeah — it’s necessary,”**
    [says a
    resident](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1954287936318681233)
    whose neighborhood was recently
    [rocked](https://wjla.com/news/local/benning-road-shooting-dc-northeast-cars-homes-bullets-damaged-casings-hospital-crime-violence-metropolitan-suspects-man-male-weapons-search-investigation)
    by a violent shootout.
-   **“I’m so happy they’re doing that because this is the capital of
    the United States and we have to make people want to come and visit.
    It’s awesome we have extra police presence to keep everybody safe
    and have them coming back,”** [says a
    visitor](https://wjla.com/news/local/dc-federal-law-enforcement-crime-doge-us-secret-service-agencies-patrols-late-night-arrests-presence-deployed-overnight-visitors-trup-safety-community-reaction-nation-capital#:~:text=%22I%27m%20so%20happy%20they%27re%20doing%20that%20because%20this%20is%20the%20capital%20of%20the%20United%20States%20and%20we%20have%20to%20make%20people%20want%20to%20come%20and%20visit%2C%22%20said%20Donna%20Andrews%2C%20who%20was%20visiting%20the%20nation%27s%20capital.%20%22It%27s%20awesome%20we%20have%20extra%20police%20presence%20to%20keep%20everybody%20safe%20and%20have%20them%20coming%20back.%22)
    to the nation’s capital.
-   **“Some days, I feel unsafe going outside,”** [says a D.C.
    resident](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1953512791282753883).
-   **“I almost feel a little desensitized to it, in a way, because it
    seems to be of the norm,”** [laments a D.C.
    resident](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1954887077637795873)
    after repeated instances of violence in her neighborhood.
-   **“We got caught in the middle of a drive-by shooting, so that was
    horrible,”** [says a D.C.
    resident](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1953512791282753883).
-   **“They need to do more about the juvenile crime. I think it’s
    because they keep letting them go — no deterrent,”** [says a D.C.
    resident](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1953512791282753883).

During the campaign, President Trump
[promised](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-speech-nra-leadership-forum-dallas-may-18-2024/#186:~:text=We%20will%20take,in%20the%20world.)
to make our capital city “[safe and
beautiful](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/making-the-district-of-columbia-safe-and-beautiful/)“
for all Americans — and he is delivering.
