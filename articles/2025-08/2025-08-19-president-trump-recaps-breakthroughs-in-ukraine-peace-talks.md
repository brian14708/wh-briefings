look at yesterday’s historic White House [peace
summit](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/08/american-leadership-is-back-under-president-trump/)
with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and key European leaders.
Detailing his bold diplomacy, President Trump emphasized his unwavering
commitment to stopping the bloodshed and securing lasting peace,
rallying European allies to lead on security and paving the way for an
ultimate resolution to the war.

**Here’s what you missed:**

    [**said**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1957777305058562529)
    **he arranged a bilateral meeting between President Putin and
    President Zelenskyy:** “I thought I’d first let them meet. They
    haven’t been exactly best friends… It only matters if we get things
    done… I hope that President Zelenskyy will do what he has to do. He
    has to show some flexibility also.”
-   **President Trump**
    [**described**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1957782313737056640)
    **his call with President Putin:** “I told him that we’re going to
    set up a meeting with President Zelenskyy, and you and he will meet,
    and then after that meeting, if everything works out OK, I’ll meet
    and we’ll wrap it up. It takes, in this case, two to tango. They
    have to have somewhat of a relationship, otherwise we’re just
    wasting a lot of time.”

    **the situation’s urgency by describing an interaction with a fellow
    leader:** “At the table, one of the gentlemen… he said, ‘Well, let’s
    meet in another month or two and let’s see if we can start making
    some…’ I said, ‘A MONTH OR TWO!? You’re going to have another 40,000
    people dead in a month or two — you have to do it TONIGHT.’ And I
    did, actually — I called President Putin and we’re trying to work
    out a meeting with President Zelenskyy.”

    [**explained**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1957777558780428559)
    **what has surprised him about President Putin and President
    Zelenskyy:** “I think the fact that maybe they’re getting along a
    little bit better than I thought, otherwise I wouldn’t have set up
    the \[bilateral\] meeting, I would’ve set up a three — a trilat. But
    I think they’re doing a little bit better. There’s been tremendous
    bad blood.”
-   **President Trump**
    [**outlined**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1957779032453300278)
    **how long-term peace in Ukraine could be secured:** “They’re not
    going to be a part of NATO, but we’ve got the European nations and
    they’ll front-load it and they’ll have, some of them — France,
    Germany, UK — they want to have boots on the ground. I don’t think
    it’s going to be a problem, to be honest with you.”
-   **President Trump**
    [**rejected**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1957779018746355883)
    **American troops defending Ukraine’s border:** “You have my
    assurance — and I’m President. I’m just trying to stop people from
    being killed.”  
      
-   **President Trump**
    [**detailed**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1957781433965010997)
    **his discussions with European leaders:** “They want to get back to
    leading their countries. They’re consumed with this far more than we
    are… There will be some form of security. It can’t be NATO because
    that’s just not something that would ever, ever happen.”  
      
-   **President Trump**
    [**commented**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1957776445213733345)
    **on his relationship with European leaders:** “I think really, they
    have respect for our country again. A year ago, they wouldn’t have
    come. They wouldn’t have even thought about it. Now, we’ve become
    the hottest country anywhere in the world. Everybody wants to be
    here.”
