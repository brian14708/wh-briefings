title: "California\u2019s \u201CSanctuary\u201D Policies Gave Way to Florida Tragedy"

Three innocent Americans are dead after an illegal alien semi-truck
driver [attempted an illegal
U-turn](https://x.com/unlimited_ls/status/1956482322020381172) on the
Florida Turnpike and caused a minivan to violently crash into the
truck’s trailer.

**The illegal alien is an [Indian
national](https://x.com/BillMelugin_/status/1957407285556240894) who was
[granted](https://www.flhsmv.gov/2025/08/16/illegal-u-turn-truck-driver-arrested-for-vehicular-homicide/)
a commercial driver’s license by the so-called “sanctuary state” of
California, whose reckless policies
[put](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/04/sanctuary-policies-put-accused-killer-back-on-the-streets/)
the lives of American citizens [at
risk](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/02/sick-politicians-want-killers-rapists-roaming-our-streets/)
every single day.** But instead of acknowledging the tragedy, criminal
illegal alien sympathizer Gavin Newsom callously doubled down,
[claiming](https://x.com/GovPressOffice/status/1957167562384662906) that
giving driver’s licenses to illegals “improves public safety.”

While Democrats put criminal illegal aliens over the Americans they
claim to represent, the Trump Administration provides [no such safe
harbor](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/08/america-first-in-action-deportations-surge-jobs-return-dc-gets-tough/#:~:text=Criminal%20Illegal%20Immigrant%20Deportations%20Ramp%20Up)
and is [seeking](https://x.com/BillMelugin_/status/1957407285556240894)
to place the individual into removal proceedings.

**“How many more innocent people have to die before Gavin Newsom stops
playing games with the safety of the American public?”** [asks the
Department of Homeland
Security](https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1957433429689020919). **“We pray
for the victims and their families. Secretary Noem and DHS are working
around the clock to protect the public and get these criminal illegal
aliens out of America.”**
