title: On CNBC, President Trump Touts Historic First Six Months
---
 
This morning, President Donald J. Trump joined CNBC’s Squawk Box for a
[wide-ranging
interview](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1952733095259472349) on
the massive victories for the American people so far in his second term
— including his unprecedented success revitalizing the economy, securing
fair trade deals, restoring public safety, and more.

**Here’s what you missed:**

-   **President Trump**
    [**outlined**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1952706764677275868)
    **his historic trade deals:** “We’re taking in trillions of dollars…
    If you look, Japan — we’re taking in $550 billion, and … that’s OUR
    money. It’s our money to invest as we’d like. European Union — $650
    billion… and they’re going to buy $750 billion worth of our energy.”
-   **President Trump**
    [**touted**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1952706657076510800)
    **his Most Favored Nation drug pricing plan:** “For 30 years, Europe
    has had drug prices that are, in many cases, one-tenth the cost of
    drugs here… We’re not going to pay ten times more for a pill than
    they pay in Europe, and that’s going to have a tremendous impact.”
-   **President Trump**
    [**lauded**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1952711304973549769)
    **the drop-off in foreign-born workers since he took office:**
    “That’s a great number, by the way, because it means we’re putting
    AMERICANS to work.”
-   **President Trump** [**weighed
    in**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1952704804020539737) **on
    interest rates:** “I wanted \[rate cuts\] a long time ago. Jay
    Powell is highly political… Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell. He’s too late,
    always. He always has been — except when it came to lowering
    interest rates before the election.”
-   **President Trump**
    [**previewed**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1952708394948653191)
    **forthcoming tariffs announcements:** “Within the next week or so,
    we’re going to be announcing tariffs on pharmaceuticals… We want
    pharmaceuticals made in our country.”
-   **President Trump**
    [**lambasted**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1952711262170649022)
    **big banks for discriminating against conservatives:** “They
    discriminated against many conservatives.… I believe what they did
    is they went to the regulators.”
-   **President Trump**
    [**praised**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1952705372835270909)
    **Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent:** “He’s doing a really
    good job. We made the greatest trade deals in the history of our
    country. We had to because we were being ripped off by the world.”
-   **President Trump**
    [**described**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1952709342869807264)
    **discussions with China:** “I’ll end up having a meeting \[with
    China\] before the end of the year, most likely, if we make a deal…
    We’re getting very close to a deal.”
-   **President Trump**
    [**commented**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1952703783663702109)
    **on the Bureau of Labor Statistics under the former Biden-appointed
    Commissioner:** “The numbers were rigged. Biden wasn’t doing well;
    he was doing poorly. They announced these phenomenal numbers… then
    they did the biggest revision, I think in history, of almost 900,000
    jobs… They gave phony numbers.”
-   **President Trump**
    [**detailed**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1952708025178832934)
    **trade discussions with India:** “We do very, very little business
    with India because their tariffs are so high — so India has not been
    a good trading partner because they do a lot of business with us,
    but we don’t do business with them. So, we settled on 25%, but I
    think I’m going to raise that very substantially over the next 24
    hours because they’re buying Russian oil. They’re fueling the war
    machine.”
