title: "Apple\u2019s $600 Billion Commitment to Boost U.S. Manufacturing"
---
 
Yesterday, President Donald J. Trump joined Apple CEO Tim Cook to
[announce](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1953203962795962563) the
company will
[increase](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/08/apple-increases-us-commitment-to-600-billion-usd-announces-ambitious-program/)
its U.S. investment to $600 billion over the next four years as it
brings additional components of its supply chain and advanced
manufacturing back home. Apple’s investment includes a new American
Manufacturing Program to incentivize its suppliers and partners to join
them in accelerating domestic manufacturing — directly creating 20,000
new American jobs and many thousands more across its suppliers.

“For years, Americans have watched as many of our leading tech giants
built their factories overseas and exported American jobs abroad — but
under the Trump Administration, we’re doing everything possible to make
this the best place on earth to build a factory or grow businesses,”
said President Trump.

“We’re going to keep making investments right here in America, we’re
going to keep hiring in America, and we’re going to keep building
technologies at the heart of our products right here in America because
we’re a proud American company, and we believe deeply in the promise of
this great nation. Thank you, President Trump, for putting American
innovation and American jobs front and center,” said Mr. Cook.
