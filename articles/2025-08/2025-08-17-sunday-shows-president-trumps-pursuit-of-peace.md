title: "SUNDAY SHOWS: President Trump\u2019s Pursuit of Peace"
---
 
This morning, Trump Administration officials were on the Sunday shows
discussing President Donald J. Trump’s relentless pursuit of peace
following his historic meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on
Friday and his forthcoming meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelensky and European leaders tomorrow.

**Here’s what you missed:**

### **Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Meet the Press**

-   “It was agreed to by all that the best way to end this conflict is
    through a full peace deal. There’s no doubt about that… What we’re
    aiming for here is not a ceasefire — what we ultimately are aiming
    for is an end to this war.”

-   “This is not our war. The United States is not in a war. Ukraine is
    in a war, and we’ve been supporting Ukraine. We happen to be in the
    role of the only country in the world with the only leader in the
    world that can actually bring Putin to a table to even discuss these
    things.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1957068448346870227))
-   “As much as people may not like it, as distasteful as people may
    find it, the only way to end this war is to get the Russians to
    agree — as well as the Ukrainians — but the Russians to agree to a
    peace deal.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1957069720798085357))
-   “The only way to reach a deal is for each side to get something and
    each side to give something — and that’s been very difficult. If it
    was easy, this wouldn’t have been going on for three and a half
    years… That’s why Zelensky is coming tomorrow… We are trying to find
    what can we get to that both sides can agree on.”

### **Secretary Rubio on This Week**

-   “Of course, concessions were asked — but what utility would there be
    of me going on a program and telling you we wagged our finger at
    Putin and told him you must do this and you must do that? It’s only
    going to make it harder and less likely that they’re going to agree
    to these things. As much as everyone would love it to be a live
    pay-per-view event, these discussions only work best when they are
    conducted privately in serious negotiations.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1957076077693509860))
-   “In order for us to get a peace agreement, Ukraine has to be a part
    of it. They have to be included; they have to be involved. That’s
    why the President called him on the phone immediately… That’s why
    President Zelensky will be traveling to Washington tomorrow.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1957078150703181961))
-   “You’re not going to end a war between Russia and Ukraine without
    dealing with Putin… The President is the only leader in the world
    that could get Putin to a meeting to talk about serious things.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1957082014156296663))
-   “Everyone, including the Ukrainians and all the countries in Europe,
    are begging the United States to be engaged, engage Putin, and try
    to get him to agree to a peace agreement.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1957084405052080215))

### **Secretary Rubio on Sunday Morning Futures**

-   “We never said there was going to be a deal coming out of the
    meeting because the Ukrainians are not there. This is a war between
    two countries; it’s not America… We made progress in narrowing down
    the issue set.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1957084694131953775))
-   “You can’t have a peace deal between two warring factions unless
    both sides agree to give up something and both sides agree that the
    other side gets something… Ultimately, where this should lead is to
    a meeting between the three leaders.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1957086054776742133))
-   “There’s only one leader in the world that has any chance of
    bringing these two sides together… that’s President Trump, and you
    forfeit that role the minute you put additional sanctions on.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1957088672890700051))

### **Secretary Rubio on Face the Nation**

-   “What the President deserves a lot of credit for is the amount of
    time and energy that his administration is placing on reaching a
    peace agreement for a war that’s not a war that started under him.
    It’s on the other side of the world… He has made it a priority of
    his administration to stop wars or prevent them.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1957093005929639976))
-   “In order for there to be a peace deal — this is just a fact, we may
    not like it, it may not be pleasant, it may be distasteful — but in
    order for there to be an end to the war, there are things that
    Russia wants that it cannot get and there are things that Ukraine
    wants that it’s not going to get. Both sides are going to have to
    give up something in order to get to the table.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1957095024551694765))
-   “This is such a stupid media narrative that they’re coming here
    tomorrow because Trump is going to bully Zelensky into a bad deal.
    We’ve been working with these people for weeks. They’re coming here
    tomorrow because they chose to come here tomorrow. We invited them
    to come.”

### **Special Envoy Steve Witkoff on State of the Union**

-   “We agreed to robust security guarantees that I would describe as
    game-changing.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1957068194004296033))
-   “We began to see some moderation in the way \[Russia is\] thinking
    about getting to a final peace deal — and so we feel that that’s
    encouraging. We briefed the Europeans immediately after we were done
    with the Summit. First, we briefed President Zelensky directly… then
    we had the Europeans on the phone, and I think everybody agreed that
    we had made progress… For the first time, we are seeing
    accommodation certainly more than we saw in the last administration,
    and that’s encouraging. Now, we have to build on that.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1957070355610161320))

### **Special Envoy Witkoff on Fox News Sunday**

-   “The President, as a mediator, was looking for ways to solve the
    crisis. He understands that it is for the Ukrainians to decide how
    they might land swap, how they might make a deal with the Russians
    on different territories there, but that’s why Zelensky and the
    Europeans are coming to the White House on Monday to make those
    decisions.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1957076089240428723))
-   “We were on the phone with President Zelensky moments after the
    Alaska summit ended… Everybody recognized on that telephone call —
    and there were various European leaders — how much progress we had
    made in demonstrating that the Russian Federation was going to make
    significant accommodations well beyond we thought before that summit
    started. So, it was absolutely acknowledged as a win.”
