  \ Low"

July was another month of record low illegal crossings at the southern
border, with just [4,598 illegal
immigrants](https://x.com/Sec_Noem/status/1951344837547958349) arrested
by Border Patrol — a 24% drop from the previous record low [set in
June](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/04/icymi-illegal-border-crossings-hit-new-record-low-in-march/)
and an average of just 148 illegal crossings every day.

That monthly total is nearly 500 fewer than the average number of DAILY
illegal crossings under the Biden Administration (5,110) — and a
staggering 97%
[decrease](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/southwest-land-border-encounters)
from July 2022 (181,834), 96% decrease from July 2023 (132,642), and 92%
decrease from July 2024 (56,400).

**“It’s unheard of for the nearly 2,000-mile-long southern border,”**
[says expert border reporter Bill
Melugin](https://x.com/BillMelugin_/status/1951275406029660380).

Meanwhile, the Trump Administration’s deportation operation is [quickly
ramping
up](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3487751/ice-arrests-150000-illegal-immigrants-since-january-trump-operation/)
— with nearly 150,000 illegal immigrants arrested since President Donald
J. Trump took office, including nearly 50,000 arrests over the past
eight weeks.

That’s [twice as
many](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3487751/ice-arrests-150000-illegal-immigrants-since-january-trump-operation/#:~:text=The%20latest%20arrest%20data%20suggest%20that%20ICE%20has%20averaged%20more%20than%20700%20arrests%20per%20day%2C%20twice%20as%20many%20as%20during%202024%20when%20former%20President%20Joe%20Biden%20was%20in%20office%2C%20according%20to%20Kathleen%20Bush%2DJoseph%2C%20attorney%20and%20policy%20analyst%20for%20the%20Migration%20Policy%20Institute%20in%20Washington.)
as the same period last year as the President Trump follows through with
his promise to remove illegal immigrant killers, rapists, gangbangers,
and other violent criminals from our streets.
