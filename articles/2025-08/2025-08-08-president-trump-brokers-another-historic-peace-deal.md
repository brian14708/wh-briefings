title: President Trump Brokers Another Historic Peace Deal
---
 
Today, President Donald J. Trump hosted Azerbaijani President Ilham
Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan at the White House,
where the two leaders
[signed](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1953914524081201264) a
historic joint declaration for peace after decades of bitter conflict
and scores of lives lost — a landmark achievement for international
diplomacy that only President Trump could deliver.

The two leaders also signed bilateral economic agreements with the U.S.,
unlocking the great potential of the South Caucasus region in trade,
transit, energy, infrastructure, and technology, and creating new
opportunities for the American people and American businesses.

“For more than 35 years, Armenia and Azerbaijan have fought a bitter
conflict that resulted in tremendous suffering for both nations… Many
tried to find a resolution… and they were unsuccessful. With this
Accord, we’ve finally succeeded in making peace,” [**said President
Trump**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1953910274735362478).

“It’s a day which will be remembered by the people of Azerbaijan with a
feeling of pride and gratitude to President Trump… Within several
months, he managed to put an end to conflicts in Asia, in Africa, and
now in South Caucasus — what we could not achieve for more than 30
years… We will turn the page of standoff, confrontation, and bloodshed,
and provide a bright and safe future for our children,” [**said
President
Aliyev**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1953913464629735696).

“Today, we have reached a significant milestone in Armenian and
Azerbaijani relations. We are laying a foundation to write a better
story than the one we had in the past. This breakthrough would simply
not have been possible without President Trump’s personal engagement and
his resolute commitment to peace,” [**said Prime Minister
Pashinyan**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1953913926879719922).

**President Trump is the President of Peace.** As President, he has
brokered peace between Azerbaijan and Armenia, [Cambodia and

President Trump is proving that nations across the globe can move beyond
longstanding conflicts of the past toward a shared future of peace,
prosperity, and success.
