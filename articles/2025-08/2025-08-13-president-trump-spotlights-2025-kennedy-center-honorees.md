**George Strait**. Beloved by millions, Strait has become known the
world over as the unambiguous “King of Country.” Over his extraordinary
four-decade career, he has sold more than 120 million records worldwide,
amassed 60 number-one hits, and produced 33 platinum-certified albums —
more than any other living American. He is the only act in history to
have a Top 10 hit every year for more than three decades. Offstage,
Strait’s philanthropy has raised tens of millions of dollars for
military and children’s causes, including through the Jenifer Strait
Memorial Foundation to preserve the memory of his daughter and by
presenting 127 mortgage-free homes to wounded veterans through the
Military Warriors Support Foundation.
