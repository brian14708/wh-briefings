title: "Yes, Chicago Has a Crime Problem \u2014 Just Ask its Residents"

President Donald J. Trump’s historic
[effort](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/08/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-declares-a-crime-emergency-to-restore-safety-in-the-district-of-columbia/)
to restore public safety in the nation’s capital has led to
[unprecedented
drops](https://x.com/DCPoliceUnion/status/1959958908996325448) in
violent crime, including
[murders](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1959951945088581906).

Now, as President Trump rightly
[calls](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1959995604907811044)
[attention](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960006729619443983) to
the crime and disrepair gripping other major U.S. cities — like
Democrat-run Chicago —
[Democrat](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/chicago-mayor-calls-trumps-national-guard-plan-most-flagrant-violation-our-constitution)
[politicians](https://x.com/GovPritzker/status/1959421957725720665) seem
far more upset about the offer of assistance than the crime epidemic in
their own backyards.

**Here are the facts on Chicago’s crime problem:**

-   For 13 consecutive years, Chicago has had the [most
    murders](https://www.thecentersquare.com/illinois/article_b131c8b9-d271-4a5f-b408-6a82c1109c07.html)
    of any U.S. city.
-   For seven consecutive years, Chicago has had the
    [highest](https://www.rit.edu/liberalarts/sites/rit.edu.liberalarts/files/docs/CPSI%20Working%20Papers/2025-02_CPSI%20Working%20Paper_US%20City%20Homicide%20Stats.pdf)
    murder rate among U.S. cities with more than one million people.
-   In 2024, Chicago’s [murder
    rate](https://www.rit.edu/liberalarts/sites/rit.edu.liberalarts/files/docs/CPSI%20Working%20Papers/2025-02_CPSI%20Working%20Paper_US%20City%20Homicide%20Stats.pdf)
    [per
    capita](https://www.thecentersquare.com/illinois/article_b131c8b9-d271-4a5f-b408-6a82c1109c07.html#:~:text=Chicago%20also%20claimed%20the%20top%20spot%20for%20highest%20murder%20rate%20per%20capita%20among%20big%20cities%20at%2021.5%20per%20100%2C000%20population)
    was three times higher than Los Angeles and nearly five times higher
    than New York City. That’s [more than
    double](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1954937260324934044/photo/1)
    the murder rate in Islamabad and nearly 15 times more than Delhi.
-   Out of Chicago’s 147,899 reported crimes since January 1, arrests
    have been made in [just
    16.2%](https://data.cityofchicago.org/stories/s/Crimes-2001-to-present-Dashboard/5cd6-ry5g)
    of them.
-   More illegal guns
    are [recovered](https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/more-than-10000-guns-recovered-off-chicagos-streets-in-2022-police#:~:text=But%20a%20top%20law%20enforcement%20source%20says%20the%20actual%20number%20of%20illegal%20firearms%20in%20Chicago%20%E2%80%94%20where%20more%20illegal%20guns%20are%20reportedly%20recovered%20than%20LA%20and%20New%20York%20Combined%20%E2%80%94%20likely%20exceeds%20half%20a%20million%2C%20and%20that%27s%20a%20conservative%20estimate.) in
    Chicago than in New York City and Los Angeles combined.
-   The number of reported motor vehicle thefts last year was [more than
    double](https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/chicago-drop-in-auto-thefts-new-concern-numbers-certain-vehicles/#:~:text=The%20trend%20continues%20this%20year.%20Through%20May%204%2C%20car%20thefts%20are%20down%2035%25.)
    the number in 2021.
-   Chicago has also come under
    [scrutiny](https://www.foxnews.com/us/fbis-flawed-crime-data-highlighted-chicagos-116-missing-murders-expert)
    over
    [discrepancies](https://archive.ph/B4lwS#selection-1751.0-1760.0:~:text=For%20example%2C%20the%20FBI%20report%20shows%20there%20were%20499%20homicides%20in%20Chicago%20in%202023%2C%20but%20the%20Chicago%20Police%20Department%27s%20own%20figures%20reported%20617%20homicides.%C2%A0)
    in its homicide data reporting.

**Chicago’s residents want action:**

-   “You have seniors that have been shot. Where’s the outcry? We need
    to have a police car out here and detail because we don’t know if
    this will happen again,”
    [said](https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2025/08/12/residents-on-edge-after-5-shot-in-bronzeville-they-were-just-shooting-at-all-old-people#:~:text=%E2%80%9CYou%20have%20seniors%20that%20have%20been%20shot.%20Where%E2%80%99s%20the%20outcry%3F%E2%80%9D%20she%20demanded.%20%E2%80%9CWe%20need%20to%20have%20a%20police%20car%20out%20here%20and%20detail%20because%20we%20don%E2%80%99t%20know%20if%20this%20will%20happen%20again.%E2%80%9D)
    one woman after a shooting near a senior living facility injured
    five people.
-   “You hardly see a police car in the neighborhood. It just seems like
    crime is really out of control right now… Mayor Johnson is more
    worried about his school board and his pension stuff that he’s
    working on right now. He should be worried more about the
    neighborhoods in Chicago,”
    [said](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960019984882831586) a
    pub owner and robbery victim.
-   “We have a rule — on weekends, we don’t walk here. If we to West
    Loop or whatever, we’ll Uber, then we’ll Uber home,”
    [said](https://abc7chicago.com/post/streeterville-shooting-chicago-tourist-shot-stray-bullet-amc-theater-illinois-street-officials-say/16003444/)
    one downtown resident after a shooting involving a group of
    teenagers.
-   “\[Burglaries, robberies\] were not happening a few years ago. It
    was very peaceful. Now it seems more dangerous to walk around the
    neighborhood,”
    [said](https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/06/11/4-armed-robberies-in-30-minutes-leave-lakeview-lincoln-park-neighbors-on-edge/)
    a small business owner after four armed robberies within an hour
    rocked his neighborhood.
-   “We certainly have a crime problem in Chicago,”
    [said](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960038758855881215) one
    alderman.
-   “I don’t think \[Mayor Johnson\] really listened to our concerns. He
    doesn’t understand. He needs to come and be in the midst of one of
    these ‘teen takeovers,’ and then maybe he’ll understand how
    dangerous it is for everyone,”
    [said](https://abc7chicago.com/post/chicago-mayor-brandon-johnson-expected-veto-controversial-curfew-plan-passed-city-council-teen-takeover-concerns-rise/16791839/)
    a resident of downtown Chicago after repeated teen brawls in the
    area.
-   “I was taking my daughter to school, and I noticed that my window
    was busted. This is not okay,”
    [said](https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/south-loop-vehicle-vandalism)
    a woman whose vehicle has been vandalized seven times in one year.
-   “I’m shocked and I’m disappointed at the same time because this
    neighborhood used to be a very good neighborhood,”
    [said](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960043719589085574) a
    resident after the third neighborhood store in one week was looted
    by criminals.
-   “There’s no control. There’s no law and order,”
    [said](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1960039558365454500) a
    Chicago resident.
