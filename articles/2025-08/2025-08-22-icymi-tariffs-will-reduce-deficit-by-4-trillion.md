title: 'ICYMI: Tariffs Will Reduce Deficit by $4 Trillion'
---
 
President Donald J. Trump’s tariffs will reduce total deficits by $4
trillion over the next decade, according to a [new
analysis](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61697) from the Congressional
Budget Office.

[**From *The Washington
Examiner***](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/finance-and-economy/3778849/trump-tariffs-reduce-deficits-4-trillion-decade-cbo/)**:**

*“The Congressional Budget Office projected that President Donald
Trump’s tariff agenda, if maintained, would decrease total deficits by
up to $4 trillion over the next decade.*

*The CBO, Congress’s nonpartisan scorekeeper, released the updated
projections on Friday. The CBO found that the effective tariff rate for
goods imported into the United States has increased by a notable 18
percentage points from last year.*

*If the stance is maintained for the next 10 years, primary deficits
would fall by $3.3 trillion, the CBO said. The tariff revenue would also
minimize the need for federal borrowing, and would result in $700
billion less spending on interest, driving total deficits down by $4
trillion.”*
