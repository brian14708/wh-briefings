title: Lowest Labor Day Gas Prices in Five Years as Travel Costs Dip in Trump Economy
---
 
*“Thanks to President Trump fully unleashing American energy dominance,
gas prices this summer are at five-year lows and families are saving
significant money at the pump. President Trump ended Joe Biden’s Green
New Scam policies and is making America affordable again.”*— White House
Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, [reported exclusively in Fox
News](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trumps-energy-agenda-delivers-lowest-holiday-gas-prices-half-decade).

*“President Trump campaigned on lowering costs and this Labor Day
Weekend, the American people will see the results firsthand at the gas
pump — with the lowest gas prices in years. His approach is simple and
commonsense: more American energy means lower costs, more jobs, and more
prosperity.”* — Secretary of Energy Chris Wright

Americans traveling for Labor Day weekend will see the [lowest gas

in at least five years and [dipping
airfare](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1961075437603266690) as
President Donald J. Trump delivers on his promises of [lower

[higher

[stable
inflation](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/08/12/white-house-touts-wages-outpacing-inflation-ignore-the-panicans-and-trust-in-president-trump/).

It will be “the lowest price at the pump on Labor Day since 2020,”
[according to
GasBuddy](https://www.gasbuddy.com/go/gas-prices-labor-day-2025) — and
“motorists can expect more relief to arrive in the weeks ahead.”
Meanwhile, hotel rates are
[down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eavYETZXEdw&t=1s) about 11
percent, domestic airfares are down six percent over last year, and car
rental costs are down three percent.

Lower gas prices are part of a
[trend](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/05/cheapest-memorial-day-weekend-gas-prices-in-years/)
under the Trump Administration, which has

relentless action to revive America’s energy capabilities and
