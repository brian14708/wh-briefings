**HOAX: The One Big Beautiful Bill is “**[**bad for our
families**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1929685488853475452)**.”**

**FACT:** Democrats have totally lost the plot — opposing middle class
tax cuts, an expanded child tax credit, border security, and more.

-   They’re opposing the [largest tax
    cut](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/04/icymi-president-trumps-largest-tax-cut-in-history/)
    in history, which will put an [extra
    $5,000](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Economic-Impact-of-Extending-TCJA-Provisions.pdf)
    in their pockets with a double-digit percent
    [decrease](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/x-23-25.pdf)
    to their tax bills. In fact, Americans earning between $30,000 and

    taxes](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/05/13/congress/average-taxpayers-tax-bills-set-to-fall-under-house-tax-package-forecasters-say-00347318).

    work in the service industry and NO TAX ON OVERTIME for law
    enforcement, nurses, and more.

    cuts](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/2025reconciliation/#:~:text=TAX%20RELIEF%0AFOR%20SENIORS)
    for senior citizens.
-   They’re opposing a
    [boost](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/2025reconciliation/#:~:text=%242%2C500%20CHILD%20TAX%20CREDIT)
    to the child tax credit.
-   They’re opposing new savings accounts for newborns and the chance
    for children across America to experience the miracle of compounded
    growth.
-   They’re opposing
    [expanded](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-One-Big-Beautiful-Bill-Champions-Life-and-Families.pdf)
    access to childcare for hardworking American families.
-   They’re opposing historic border security to keep their communities
    safe.
-   They’re opposing
    [expanded](https://www.tasconline.com/legislative-updates/the-one-big-beautiful-bill-may-bring-choice-on-the-horizon/)
    health savings accounts that give Americans greater choice and
    flexibility in how they spend their money.
-   They’re opposing
    [scholarships](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/community-family/3416571/advance-school-choice-congress-trump-one-big-beautiful-bill/)
    that empower Americans to choose the education that best fits the
    needs of their families.
