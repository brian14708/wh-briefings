title: 'ICYMI: Cheapest Summer Gas Prices in Four Years'
---
 
Americans are seeing the cheapest summertime gas prices since 2021 —
more than 20 cents lower than one year ago — as President Donald J.
Trump delivers on his promises of [lower
prices](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/06/under-president-trump-america-is-defeating-inflation/),
stable inflation, and higher wages.

**The Fake News was wrong (again).**

**From** [***The New York
Times***](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/26/business/gas-prices-iran-israel.html)**:**
*“Summer road trips appear to be safe from a big spike in gasoline
prices. The national average price of gasoline has hovered around $3.20
a gallon this week after Israel and Iran agreed to a cease-fire … And it
is more than 20 cents lower than a year ago. The last time the cost for
drivers was lower in late June was in 2021.”*

Journal***](https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/summer-gas-prices-iran-israel-0d586038?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAhedzc02c7ORpTpKXDLzHzqxrTdeqwLxCRjOpZWTFmc1ZOu1_L_uTQiumWt_uY%3D&gaa_ts=685e8a53&gaa_sig=3sbWFbLW-f-PfwmrR-YK1Km_mDE8n7wqrvXmvR5MjvFASIscAxvVN51JnF8BnC5J8knbdQmIBP3pB2uiyq4byw%3D%3D)**:**
*“Hitting the road this summer won’t bring as big of a hit to your
wallet. The national average for a gallon of regular gasoline, $3.21, is
about 23 cents cheaper than this time last year … Reduced prices would
be a boon for consumers during the warmer months when Americans drive
more. Low energy prices so far this year have already contributed to the
economy’s resilience and helped keep inflation in check.”*

**From [NBC
News](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1938616090021777468):**
*“Looking at gas prices that are the best in four years — and this is so
important for all of those millions of people who will be hitting the
roads … 20 cents less than it was a year ago, so that’s six or seven
bucks extra when you fill up. That’s real money.”*
