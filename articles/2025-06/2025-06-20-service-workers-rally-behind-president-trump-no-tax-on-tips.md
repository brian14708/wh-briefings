title: "Service Workers Rally Behind President Trump\u2019s NO TAX ON TIPS"
---
 
Hourly workers in the service, hospitality, and retail industries
overwhelmingly back President Donald J. Trump’s bold NO TAX ON TIPS plan
in the One Big Beautiful Bill, [according to a new
survey](https://www.instant.co/pressrelease/hourly-workers-support-no-tax-on-tips/)
— saying tax-free tips would bring them needed financial stability and
relief.

**In fact, 83% of hourly workers want to see NO TAX ON TIPS become law —
with just four percent saying otherwise:** “These results suggest that
any measure increasing the amount of immediately available income — such
as untaxed tips — would provide meaningful, stabilizing support for a
large segment of the hourly workforce,” the report says.

As one Nevada food service worker [put
it](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1936059926209597484): “I don’t
know what the holdup is. I don’t know what the politics are, but if we
can cut the BS now … it can help out a lot of people.”

**The NO TAX ON TIPS plan is just one aspect of President Trump’s**
[**Day One
commitment**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/delivering-emergency-price-relief-for-american-families-and-defeating-the-cost-of-living-crisis/)
**to deliver relief to Americans ravaged by years of Bidenflation.** In
his first five months, President Trump has overseen the [largest
increase](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/06/icymi-blue-collar-wage-growth-sees-largest-increase-in-nearly-60-years-under-trump/)
in blue-collar wage growth in 60 years, [lower
costs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/06/under-president-trump-america-is-defeating-inflation/),
and [explosive job
growth](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/04/jobs-jobs-jobs-explosive-job-growth-in-march-as-trump-economy-booms/)
for native-born Americans.

That progress will be
[supercharged](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/06/50-wins-in-the-one-big-beautiful-bill/)
by the One Big Beautiful Bill, which will deliver the [largest tax cut
in
history](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/06/the-largest-tax-cut-in-history-for-working-and-middle-class-americans/)
for working and middle-class Americans, tax cuts for seniors, No Tax on
Overtime, and much more.
