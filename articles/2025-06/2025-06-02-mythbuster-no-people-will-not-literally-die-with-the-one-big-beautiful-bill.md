**HOAX: People will “**[**literally
die**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1929176824321348033)**”
because of the One Big Beautiful Bill.**

This is one of Democrats’ most disgusting lies because the One Big
Beautiful Bill strengthens and protects the social safety net for every
eligible American citizen who needs it.

-   **FACT:** Medicaid will be strengthened for the American citizens
    for whom the program was designed — pregnant women, children, people
    with disabilities, low-income seniors, and other vulnerable
    low-income families. By removing at least
    [1](https://x.com/HouseCommerce/status/1922353850352021556)[.4
    million illegal
    immigrants](https://x.com/HouseCommerce/status/1922353850352021556)
    from the program, ending taxpayer-funded gender mutilation surgeries
    for minors, and eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse, the One Big
    Beautiful Bill will ensure Medicaid better serves the American
    people.  
-   **FACT:** [4.8
    million](https://x.com/HouseCommerce/status/1922353850352021556)
    able-bodied adults on Medicaid are choosing not to work — and by
    implementing commonsense, Clinton-era work, volunteer, education, or
    training requirements, the One Big Beautiful Bill lifts them up to
    find a better quality of life through the dignity of work. Through
    work, job training, or part-time volunteering, this requirement will
    strengthen the system to better help those most in need of
    assistance. Work requirements are a bipartisan solution
