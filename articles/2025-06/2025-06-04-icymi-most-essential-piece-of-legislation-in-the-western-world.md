---
 
In a series of X posts, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller
outlined why President Donald J. Trump’s [One Big Beautiful
Bill](https://www.whitehouse.gov/obbb/) is a once-in-a-lifetime

<p>The BBB will increase by orders of magnitude the scope, scale and
speed of removing illegal and criminal aliens from the United

For that reason alone, it’s the most essential piece of legislation
currently under consideration in the entire Western World, in
generations.</p>

<p>The Big Beautiful Bill contains three major sections:<br />
<br />
1. The most significant border security and deportation effort in
history, including the entire wall — up front, now, with no possibility
of Democrat obstruction.<br />
2. Full extension and expansion of the Trump Tax Cuts (this…</p>

<p>The one wrinkle of reconciliation is you can’t make “discretionary
cuts” (eg the bureaucracy) just mandatory (eg food stamp reform).<br />
<br />
Discretionary cuts happen through a separate process known as
“rescissions” (also 50 votes).<br />
