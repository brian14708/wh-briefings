title: Trump Accounts Will Chart the Path to Prosperity for a Generation of American
  Kids
---
 
Today, President Donald J. Trump joined top business leaders and
lawmakers to hail the creation of “Trump Accounts” — a provision in the
One Big Beautiful Bill that will create tax-deferred investment accounts
for all newborn American children.

Trump Accounts, which will be seeded with a one-time government
contribution of $1,000 and be private property of the child’s guardian,
will track a stock index and allow for additional private contributions
of up to $5,000 per year. This will afford a generation of children the
chance to experience the miracle of compounded growth and set them on a
course for prosperity from the very beginning.

**Here’s what they’re saying:**

[**Dell CEO Michael
Dell**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1932154492025245976)**:**
“We see … the establishment of these Trump Accounts as a simple yet
powerful way to transform lives. Decades of research has shown that
giving children a financial head start profoundly impacts their
long-term success. With these accounts, children will be much more
likely to graduate from college, to start a business, to buy a home, and
achieve lifelong financial stability.”

[**Goldman Sachs CEO David
Solomon**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1932155411614056710)**:**
“This initiative gets at the core of binding those future generations to
the benefits and the potential of America’s great companies and markets.
Early childhood investments have far-reaching benefits, and Goldman
Sachs is proud to support his initiative … Our economy’s future vitality
is dependent on young people understanding the power of investing for
the long term.”

[**Uber CEO Dara
Khosrowshahi**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1932155769581084800)**:**
“What if we could give that same powerful, real, tangible hope that
comes from having a stake in your own future and a stake in the best
companies in the world to every single child that’s born in this
country? That’s the promise of the Invest in America Act. It’s not just
an account; it’s a launchpad. It puts the unstoppable engine of
compounding to work for our kids, building a future for them from day
one.”

[**Altimeter Capital CEO Brad
Gerstner**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1932158705144881334)**:**
“This is aligning every child in America with the upside of free markets
and the benefits, and that is your Main Street agenda … It makes America
an ownership society again because all of those kids will see the
benefit of compounding interest … You are giving the shot for every
American to feel like they’re in the game again.”

[**Speaker Mike
Johnson**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1932153682906456098)**:**
“If you have a 401(k), you understand the power of investing early for
the future. Trump Accounts take that same principle and they apply it
from the very beginning of Americans’ lives … It’s a bold,
transformative policy that gives every eligible American child a
financial head start from day one … Trump Accounts are all about setting
up the next generation for success.”

[**House Ways & Means Committee Chair Jason
Smith**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1932156164814643510)**:**
“The Trump investment accounts will be a game-changer for new parents
even before their newborn baby can walk or talk. Their child will have
money saved to one day learn a trade, start a business, or to buy a
home. Every child born under this policy will have a better shot at a
future. It does not matter if they live on a city block or on a county
road — this will make a significant difference to their lives.”

**Together with historic tax cuts, an increased child tax credit, higher
wages, and monumental economic growth, the One Big Beautiful Bill will
change the lives of middle-class families across America.**
