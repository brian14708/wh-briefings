title: "MYTHBUSTER: The One Big Beautiful Bill Cuts Spending, Deficit \u2014 and That\u2019\
  s a Fact"
---
 
By every honest metric, President Donald J. Trump’s One Big Beautiful
Bill dramatically improves the fiscal trajectory of the United States
and unleashes an era of unprecedented economic growth.

**HOAX: The One Big Beautiful Bill increases spending.**

-   **FACT:** The One Big Beautiful Bill delivers nearly $1.7 trillion
    in mandatory savings — a fact that even the Congressional Budget
    Office (CBO) [admits](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61461) is
    true.
-   **FACT:** This is the
    [highest](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1930004618991546612)
    level of mandatory savings in history — dwarfing spending reductions
    from similar reconciliation bills in 2005 ($140 billion), 1997 ($800
    billion), 1993 ($370 billion), and 1990 ($440 billion) on an
    inflation-adjusted basis.
-   **FACT:** The One Big Beautiful Bill’s $1.7 trillion savings are
    permanent changes to the law — meaning these savings will continue
    long into the future.
-   **FACT:** This is a reconciliation bill — not an appropriations
    (budget) bill. This
    [means](https://x.com/StephenM/status/1930242667025195048) there is
    no mechanism for including spending reductions on 99% of government
    operations, which will come in future legislation.

**HOAX: The One Big Beautiful Bill adds to the deficit.**

-   **FACT:** So-called
    “[forecasts](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61461)” (including by
    the CBO) predicting higher deficits are based on a false assumption
    that President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts will expire. In reality,
    extending the CURRENT tax rates — which this legislation does — has
    zero impact on the deficit.
    -   If you cite the CBO’s faulty score, you must also cite CBO’s
        [forecast](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61389) that President
        Trump’s tariffs will cut the deficit by $2.8 trillion over the
        next decade. In other words, even the partisan CBO admits the
        deficit will be slashed by at least $500 billion over the next
        ten years.
-   **FACT:** Of course, the $1.7 trillion savings is partly offset by
    one-time spending on border security and additional tax cuts (NO TAX
    ON TIPS, NO TAX ON OVERTIME) — which brings the net deficit
    [reduction](https://x.com/russvought/status/1930301700780503122) to
    exactly $1.407 trillion.
-   **FACT:** Upon enactment the bill — and through increased tariffs
    revenues, discretionary spending cuts, and reversing Biden-era
    regulations — the Trump Administration will have taken actions that
    reduce deficits by at least $6.6 trillion over the next decade.
