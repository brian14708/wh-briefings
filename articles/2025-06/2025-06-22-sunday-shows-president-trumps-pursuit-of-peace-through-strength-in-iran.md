title: "SUNDAY SHOWS: President Trump\u2019s Pursuit of Peace Through Strength in\
  \ Iran"
---
 
This morning, key leaders of the Trump Administration were out across
the airwaves with a clear message: the world is safer today because of
President Donald J. Trump’s highly successful precision strikes against
the Iranian regime’s key nuclear facilities — and that what happens next
is up to them.

**Here’s what you missed:**

#### **Vice President JD Vance on Meet the Press**

-   [On the precision
    strikes](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1936773803998372136):
    “We’re not at war with Iran … We destroyed the Iranian nuclear
    program … and we did it without endangering the lives of American
    pilots. That’s an incredible thing.”
-   [On achieving
    peace](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1936774231343215051):
    “We do not want war with Iran. We actually want peace, but we want
    peace in the context of them not having a nuclear weapons program —
    and that’s exactly what the President accomplished last night.”
-   [On
    diplomacy](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1936776133866827930):
    “They weren’t taking this seriously. They were trying to draw this
    process out as long as possible so they could rebuild their nuclear
    weapons program without the threat of American action … We didn’t
    blow up the diplomacy. The diplomacy never was given a real chance
    by the Iranians.”
-   [On potential
    retaliation](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1936778850374910437):
    “We’re prepared in the event the that the Iranians do retaliate, but
    … if the Iranians want to enlarge this by attacking American troops,
    I think that would be a catastrophic mistake.”
-   [On further
    conflict](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1936779620369482072):
    “We have no interest in a protracted conflict. We have no interest
    in boots on the ground. The President has actually been one of the
    fiercest critics of 25 years of failed foreign policy in the Middle
    East, which is why he did what he did — a very precise, a very
    surgical strike tailored to an American national interest.”
-   [On regime
    change](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1936782212747206808):
    “Our view has been very clear that we don’t want a regime change …
    We want to end their nuclear program, and then we want to talk to
    the Iranians about a long-term settlement.”

#### **Vice President JD Vance on This Week**

-   [On Iranian nuclear
    capabilities](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1936781633585295640):
    “I can say to the American people with great confidence that \[Iran
    is\] much further away from a nuclear program today than they were
    24 hours ago. That was the objective of the mission.”
-   [On the nature of the precision
    strikes](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1936783665830248791):
    “If the Iranians attack us, they’re going to be met with
    overwhelming force … We did not attack the nation of Iran. We did
    not attack any civilian targets. We didn’t even attack military
    targets outside of the three nuclear weapons facilities.”
-   [On a peaceful
    solution](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1936785466512076873):
    “We believe the way that you achieve peace is through strength … You
    can’t sit there and allow the Iranians to achieve a nuclear weapon
    and expect that’s going to lead to peace … The President — more than
    anybody — is worried about protracted military conflicts. That is
    NOT what we’re getting ourselves involved in.”

#### **Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Face the Nation**

-   [On what happens
    next](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1936796747004625082):
    “What happens next will now depend on what Iran chooses to do next.
    If they choose the path of diplomacy, we’re ready. We can do a deal
    that’s good for them, the Iranian people, and good for the world. If
    they choose another route, then there’ll be consequences.”
-   [On the reality of Iran’s nuclear
    development](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1936797923267809774):
    “They had everything they need to build nuclear weapons. Why would
    you bury things in a mountain 300 feet under the ground? Why do they
    have 60% enriched uranium? … The only countries in the world that
    have uranium at 60% are countries that have nuclear weapons because
    they can quickly make it 90%.”
-   [On a peaceful
    resolution](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1936799222520815755):
    “We’ll defend our people … but let’s hope they don’t choose that
    route. Let’s all hope that they actually decide, ‘let’s go
    negotiate’ because we want a diplomatic and peaceful solution.”
-   [On
    diplomacy](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1936800459664019684):
    “This is very simple. The President wants to resolve this
    diplomatically and peacefully. He gave them a chance to do that …
    What happens next is up to the regime.”

#### **Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday Morning Futures**

-   [On President Trump’s
    decision](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1936788710235816334):
    “\[Iran\] tried to play him along the way they’ve played every
    American president for the last 35 years and the President told them
    if we don’t get a deal — which is what we wanted — then I’ll have to
    have to handle it differently … We didn’t make that choice, they
    did.”
-   [On U.S. military
    might](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1936789792098038138):
    “The President said very clearly, ‘We have 60 days to make progress
    on a deal and if we don’t, I’m going to deal with it differently’ …
    \[Our military\] went in, they did what they needed to do with
    precision and skill that no other military in the world can do, and
    they left.”
-   [On President Trump’s
    leadership](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1936790330533093630):
    “They thought they could do with President Trump what they’ve done
    with presidents in the past and get it away with it — and they found
    out last night that they can’t … This is a President that tells you
    what he’s going to do and then he does it.”
-   [On the evil of the Iranian
    regime](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1936792593301385714):
    “Why did Hezbollah exist? Because of Iran. Why does Hamas exist?
    Because of Iran. How do the Houthis exist? Because of Iran. Who
    built the IEDs that maimed and killed American soldiers in Iraq?
    Iran. They’re behind every problem in this region. They are the sole
    source of instability in the entire Middle East … Imagine those
    people having a nuclear weapon … That is unacceptable.”
-   [On the Strait of
    Hormuz](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1936794523931193610):
    “If they do that, it will be another terrible mistake. It’s economic
    suicide for them if they do it, and we retain options to deal with
    that.”
