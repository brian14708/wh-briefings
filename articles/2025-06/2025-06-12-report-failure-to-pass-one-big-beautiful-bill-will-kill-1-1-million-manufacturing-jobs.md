title: 'REPORT: Failure to Pass One Big Beautiful Bill Will Kill 1.1+ Million Manufacturing
  Jobs'
---
 
More than 1.1 million jobs in the manufacturing sector and nearly six
million jobs overall will be lost if Congress fails to extend the Trump
Tax Cuts in President Donald J. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill,
according to [a new report](https://nam.org/issues/tax/) — negative
effects on small businesses that are swift, severe, and completely
avoidable.

**Here are some key takeaways from the report:**

-   “More than 96% of businesses in America are organized as
    pass-throughs, meaning that they pay tax at individual income tax
    rates. Tax reform created a 20% deduction to allow these small
    businesses to compete on a level playing field with their peers
    organized as corporations … The pass-through deduction will expire
    completely at the end of 2025. A recent NAM survey found that 93% of
    pass-through manufacturers reported that the loss of this deduction
    will harm their ability to grow, create jobs and invest in their
    business.”
-   “The combination of the reduction in the top rate and the 20%
    passthrough deduction resulted in significant tax savings for these
    small businesses—enabling them to invest in new equipment,
    machinery, facilities and job creation. More than 74% of
    manufacturers have fewer than 20 employees, so it is crucial to the
    sector that Congress preserve tax reform’s competitive tax rates for
    small businesses.”
-   “If Congress does not act, accelerated depreciation will be entirely
    absent from the U.S. tax code for the first time in decades—limiting
    manufacturers’ ability to invest in the equipment and machinery they
    need to drive economic growth and job creation and making it more
    costly for businesses to invest in the U.S.”
-   “More than 90% of businesses in America are family-owned. In the
    manufacturing industry, family-owned businesses are a critical part
    of the manufacturing supply chain and pillars of their local
    communities … The estate tax exemption threshold is scheduled to be
    reduced by half at the end of 2025, subjecting more family business
    assets to taxation and threatening the viability of these businesses
    when the owner passes away. Congress should protect family-owned
    manufacturers by preserving the increased exemption threshold.”
