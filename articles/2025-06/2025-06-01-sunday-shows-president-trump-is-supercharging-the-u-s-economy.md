title: 'SUNDAY SHOWS: President Trump is Supercharging the U.S. Economy'
---
 
This morning, Trump Administration officials took to the airwaves to
describe how the One Big Beautiful Bill will be an economic boon for
working Americans, the soaring nature of the Trump economy, and more.

**Here’s what you missed:**

#### **Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought on State of the Union**

-   [On lowering the
    deficit](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1929169957847286257):
    “This bill doesn’t increase the deficit or hurt the debt. In fact,
    it LOWERS it by $1.4 trillion.”
-   [On protecting
    Medicaid](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1929170738453283173):
    “This bill will preserve and protect the programs, the social safety
    net, but it will make it much more common sense.”
-   [On cancer research
    funding](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1929167311241462036):
    “We actually want it to go to cancer research. We want it to go to
    the research that people think that they have been funding through
    their tax dollars … We don’t want it to go to waste, fraud, and
    abuse.”

#### **Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent on Face the Nation**

-   [On
    prices](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1929187165830869432):
    “We wanted to make sure that there aren’t price increases, Margaret
    — and thus far, there have been no price increases. Everything has
    been alarmist. The inflation numbers are actually dropping. We saw
    the first drop in inflation in four years.”
-   [On
    inflation](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1929188418249965629):
    “When we were here in March, you said there was going to be big
    inflation. There hasn’t been any inflation. Actually, the inflation
    numbers are the best in four years. So why don’t we stop trying to
    say this COULD happen — wait and see what DOES happen.”
-   [On the
    deficit](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1929192587094557159):
    “The deficit this year is going to be lower than the deficit last
    year — and in two years, it will be lower again. We are going to
    bring the deficit down slowly. We didn’t get here in one year.”

#### **Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick on Fox News Sunday**

-   [On
    tariffs](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1929169611632640251):
    “The $1.2 trillion trade deficit, and all the underlying
    implications of that, is a national emergency. It’s gutting our
    manufacturing base … Rest assured, tariffs are not going away …
    Congress has given this authority to President Trump and he’s going
    to use it.”

#### **National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett on This Week**

-   [On the
    deficit](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1929179874691846604):
    “If the bill doesn’t pass, then we’re looking at the biggest tax
    hike in American history … The idea that it’s worse for the deficit
    to do something that pays for itself if we get 3% growth is just not
    defensible.”

#### **Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem on Sunday Morning Futures**

-   [On
    deportations](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1929180073304699127):
    “President Trump is doing exactly what he campaigned on and what the
    American people elected him to do — and that’s enforce the law. And
    so we are going to do mass deportations … We are going out there and
    ensuring that people that repeatedly break our laws are being held
    accountable.”
-   [On international students at
    Harvard](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1929180954473468048):
    “These ties to China are deeply alarming … If you come to this
    country to learn and you’re a foreign student and you recognize the
    opportunity, that’s fantastic — but don’t come here to spy on us and
    take that information back home to an enemy that is working to
    destroy us every day. And China has infiltrated this country. It’s
    my job to protect the homeland and I’ve been given that direction by
    President Trump. They will not participate in this foreign student
    program until they clean up their ways.”
