title: One Big Beautiful Bill Will Protect American Jobs, Unleash Economic Growth
---
 
President Donald J. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill is a generational
opportunity to restore America’s economic strength and reward our
hardworking citizens. With provisions designed to support the backbone
of our nation — families, farmers, job creators, and law enforcement —
the One Big Beautiful Bill will deliver meaningful results for Americans
across the country.

**Everyday Americans joined top lawmakers to detail how the One Big
Beautiful Bill will affect their livelihoods:**

-   **Toni McAllister, executive director of the Louisiana Loggers
    Association,**
    [**says**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1937524995170725926)
    **the One Big Beautiful Bill will give small logging businesses a
    chance to thrive:** “It will finally give small businesses like ours
    a better opportunity to not just survive, but to grow and succeed …
    This legislation will lower the effective tax rate for producing in
    America, increase and make permanent the small business deduction,
    double immediate small business expensing, and reduce reporting
    burdens for small businesses.”
-   **Paul Danos, CEO of his family-owned offshore energy service
    company,**
    [**says**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1937523954643882205)
    **the One Big Beautiful Bill is key for American energy dominance:**
    “This bill is a lifeline for American energy and restores the kind
    of predictably that businesses like ours need to invest and grow.”
-   **Sam Palmeter, an executive at one of the last remaining laser
    technology companies fully owned and operated in America,**
    [**says**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1937522637737009238)
    **the tax cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill will give them a chance
    to expand:** “This will immediately allow us to double our
    manufacturing space … This bill incentivizes us to create new jobs
    in the U.S. and we are incentivized to manufacture in the USA.”
-   **Sheriff (Ret.) James Stuart, CEO of the Minnesota Sheriffs’
    Association,**
    [**says**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1937521912051122661)
    **the One Big Beautiful Bill will deliver needed support for law
    enforcement:** “No Tax on Overtime pay would benefit our protectors
    all across the country in tremendous ways. The increase in take home
    pay for these deputies and officers rewards the extra hours and the
    extra efforts that they devote to protecting their communities,
    impacting their own lives in significant ways. That is more money in
    their pockets to save, to invest, and to grow.”

**Agricultural leaders outlined how the One Big Beautiful Bill will
deliver for America’s farmers, ranchers, and producers.**

-   [**Michael Hunt, fifth-generation Wisconsin
    farmer**](https://x.com/BeefUSA/status/1937546871276532120)**:**
    “The single biggest threat to family farm operations in the United
    States right now is the Estate Tax limitations. There’s no possible
    way, with the rising real estate values that are occurring in rural
    America, for production agriculture to shoulder the cost burden of
    estate tax when the first generation passes on.”
-   [**Ethan Lane of the National Cattlemen’s Beef
    Association**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1937178669249646954)**:**
    “That big chunk of the farm bill that’s in this reconciliation bill,
    including those animal health provisions that we have worked on for
    so long in the cattle industry, that is a huge win for cattle
    producers.”
-   [**National Pork Producers
    Council**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1937563604988854305)**:**
    “These investments and policy extensions offer critical support to
    agriculture, ensuring stability and long-term growth for farmers,
    ranchers, and the rural economy.”

**a** [**new ad

**to highlight what’s at stake if the Trump Tax Cuts aren’t extended in
the One Big Beautiful Bill:** “If Congress doesn’t act, manufacturers
will be hit with the largest tax increase in U.S. history. Six million
jobs could be lost — that’s our neighbors, our communities, our
futures.”

**Secretary of Energy Chris Wright**
[**discussed**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1937528515869442171)
**how the One Big Beautiful Bill ENDS the Biden-era Green New Scam:**
“It’s going to get rid of these subsidies and distortions that have hurt
not just our electricity market, but our broader energy markets … The
One Big Beautiful Bill — it is big. There are a lot of things in it, but
a lot of them are just cleaning out underbrush and nonsense so it’s
easier to build things in our country again, remove the distortions from
the energy markets, unleash American businesses to build energy
productions of all different kinds — but kinds that work, without
subsidies.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America,**
[**says**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1937517903810552176)
**extending the Trump Tax Cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill is a top
priority for preventing American jobs from being exported to foreign
countries:** “These tax rates were meant to get the U.S. competitive on
taxes on corporations … Remember back to people were exporting business
outside the United States for lower tax rate reasons … All that’s been
gone for the last seven or eight years, and so we need to make sure
these extend or that will start up again.”
