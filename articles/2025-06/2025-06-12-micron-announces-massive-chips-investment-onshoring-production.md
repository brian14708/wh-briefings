---
 
Today, the Trump Administration
[announced](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/06/president-trump-secures-200b-investment-micron-technology-memory-chip)
a $200 billion investment by Micron Technology, the sole U.S.-based
manufacturer of advanced memory chips – only the latest large-scale
[investment](https://www.whitehouse.gov/investments/) secured since
President Donald J. Trump took office.

The
[investment](https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-and-trump-administration-announce-expanded-us-investments)
includes construction of a second chip fabrication facility in Boise,
Idaho, and modernizing its Manassas, Virginia, facility — onshoring
production of its advanced DRAM technology from Taiwan for the first
time and
[creating](https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-and-trump-administration-announce-expanded-us-investments#:~:text=creating%20an%20estimated%2090%2C000%20direct%20and%20indirect%20jobs)
90,000 direct and indirect jobs.

**It’s all part of President Trump’s commitment to revitalizing American
manufacturing and establishing the country as the global leader in
technology — particularly in artificial intelligence.**

Since President Trump took office, leading technology companies have
pledged [trillions of dollars](https://www.whitehouse.gov/investments/)
in U.S.-based manufacturing and production, including [Project
Stargate](https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/),
[Apple](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/),
[NVIDIA](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-manufacture-american-made-ai-supercomputers-us/),
[IBM](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2025-04-28-ibm-unveils-150-billion-investment-in-america-to-accelerate-technology-opportunity),
[TSMC](https://pr.tsmc.com/english/news/3210), and
[others](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/05/trump-effect-a-running-list-of-new-u-s-investment-in-president-trumps-second-term/).

It’s another big win for American workers, national security, and
leadership in the world — and the best is yet to come.
