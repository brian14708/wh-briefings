title: "Pass the One Big Beautiful Bill to Safeguard America\u2019s Sovereignty"
---
 
President Donald J. Trump has overseen a dramatic reversal in the
nation’s border security — going from 62,000 illegal immigrants released
into the country in a single month under the Biden Administration to
[zero](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/06/border-patrol-didnt-release-a-single-illegal-into-the-u-s-last-month/)
under the Trump Administration and achieving the
[lowest-ever](https://x.com/RealTomHoman/status/1935117219673031102)
numbers of daily illegal crossings.

Now, we’re at a defining crossroads: pass the One Big Beautiful Bill and
fortify that extraordinary progress — or don’t, and risk jeopardizing
the nation’s safety and sovereignty once again.

**Pass the One Big Beautiful Bill and we will:**

-   **Invest in securing our homeland.** We will make the largest-ever
    one-time investment in border security — enough to detain and deport
    at least one million illegals every year and massively expand
    detention capacity.
-   **Give a boost to our frontline heroes.** We will not only give the
    men and women of Border Patrol and ICE a $10,000/year bonus in each
    of the next four years, we will also deliver needed reinforcements
    to finish the job — with funding for 10,000 new ICE personnel, 5,000
    new customs officers, and 3,000 new Border Patrol agents.
-   **Finish President Trump’s border wall. **We will secure full
    operational control of our southern border by constructing hundreds
    of miles of border wall, river barriers, and vehicle and pedestrian
    barriers — critical for repelling future foreign invasion and
    maintaining our national security.

Fail to act, and we risk squandering the historic gains we’ve achieved
and setting the nation back on a course of chaos and vulnerability.
