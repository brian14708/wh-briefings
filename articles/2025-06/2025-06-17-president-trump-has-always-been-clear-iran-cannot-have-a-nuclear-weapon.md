title: 'President Trump Has Always Been Clear: Iran Cannot Have a Nuclear Weapon'
---
 
President Donald J. Trump has [never
wavered](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1934779415256551623) in
his stance that Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon — a
pledge he has made repeatedly, both in office and on the campaign trail.

**Since taking office, President Trump has clearly stated no fewer than
a dozen times that Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon:**

-   “Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. It’s very simple — you don’t
    have to go to too deep into it. They just can’t have a nuclear
    weapon.”
    ([6/17/25](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1934916594095869971))
-   “I want to see no nuclear weapon in Iran and we’re well on our way
    to making sure that happens.”
    ([6/16/25](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1934719628472660085))
-   “You can’t have peace if Iran has a nuclear weapon.”
    ([6/14/25](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/06/trump-interview-iran-israel/683192/))
-   “They can’t have a nuclear weapon. Very simple. They can’t have a
    nuclear weapon. We’re not going to allow that.”
    ([6/11/25](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1932939773984878952))
-   “You have to view them as people and I don’t want it to be a violent
    thing, but they’re not going to have a nuclear weapon.”
    ([5/16/25](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1923503541810815222))
-   “I want them to succeed. I want them to end up being a great
    country, frankly, but they can’t have a nuclear weapon.”
    ([5/15/25](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1922914650338758785))
-   “I want to make a deal with Iran, I want to do something if it’s
    possible, but for that to happen, it must stop sponsoring terror,
    halt its bloody proxy wars, and permanently and verifiably cease its
    pursuit of nuclear weapons.”
    ([5/14/25](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1922570038722081193))
-   “Iran can have a much brighter future — but we’ll never allow
    America and its allies to be threatened with terrorism or a nuclear
    attack. The choice is theirs to make. We really want them to be a
    successful country … but they cannot have a nuclear weapon.”
    ([5/13/25](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1922323295069684217))
-   “We want it to be a great country. Let it be a tremendously
    successful, rich country … but they can’t have a nuclear weapon.”
    ([5/6/25](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1919865319847342516))
-   “I want Iran to be really successful, really great, really fantastic
    — the only thing they can’t have is a nuclear weapon. If they want
    to be successful, that’s OK. I want them to be so successful and,
    you know, the Iranian people are incredible — I just don’t want them
    to have a nuclear weapon because the world will be destroyed.”
    ([5/4/25](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1919124111860625610))
-   “Iran can’t have a nuclear weapon.”
    ([4/17/25](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1912929617201250404))
-   “Iran has to get rid of the concept of a nuclear weapon. They cannot
    have a nuclear weapon.”
    ([4/14/25](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1911817403622695111))
-   “I want Iran to be a wonderful, great, happy country — but they
    can’t have a nuclear weapon.”
    ([4/11/25](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1910867415073804607))
-   “You cannot allow \[Iran\] to have a nuclear weapon.”
    ([2/10/25](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1889107007187148999))
-   “It’s very simple: Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.”
    ([2/4/25](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1886880158923338209))

**President Trump made the same pledge no fewer than 40 times on the
campaign trail and even earlier:**

-   “Iran can’t have a nuclear weapon. Nuclear weapons are the greatest
    single threat to our country, but to the entire world.”
    ([11/3/24](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1934779506411143661))
-   “I would have been very good to Iran. They — I had to have one
    thing, no nuclear weapons. You can’t have nuclear weapon. Nuclear
    weapons are the greatest danger to our country going forward, to the
    world going forward.”
    ([10/29/24](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1934779503970275531))
-   “And all I wanted was Iran can’t have a nuclear weapon … That’s all
    I wanted. Very simple. You can’t have a nuclear weapon.”
    ([10/28/24](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1934779501830881544))

-   “I didn’t want much. I wanted Iran to be very successful. I just
    don’t want them to have a nuclear weapon.”
    ([10/16/24](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1934779499972821206))

    ([10/10/24](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1934779494880989194))
-   “I only wanted one thing. You can’t have a nuclear weapon. You
    cannot let them have a nuclear weapon.”

-   “They can’t have a nuclear weapon — and now they’re very close to
