title: 'Myth vs. Fact: The One Big Beautiful Bill'
---
 
**MYTH:** The One Big Beautiful Bill is “just a tax break for
billionaires.”  
**FACT:** The One Big Beautiful Bill delivers the largest middle- and
working-class tax cut in U.S. history. The President’s legislation will
put more than $10,000 a year back in the pockets of typical hardworking
families. This is the most pro-growth, pro-worker, pro-family
legislation ever crafted.

**MYTH:** The One Big Beautiful Bill “takes from the poor to give to the
rich.”  
**FACT:** Low-income workers stand to receive the largest percentage
reduction in their tax liability. The One Big Beautiful Bill delivers
the largest tax cut in history for working-and-middle class Americans.

**MYTH:** The One Big Beautiful Bill “makes life more unaffordable.”  
**FACT:** The bill delivers bigger paychecks, expanding take-home pay by
over $10,000 per year for a typical family.

**MYTH:** The One Big Beautiful Bill “hurts low-income families.”  
**FACT:** The One Big Beautiful Bill is the most pro-family legislation
ever crafted. It will deliver bigger paychecks, giving more than a
$10,000 boost annually to everyday families. We are also expanding
Opportunity Zones, expanding childcare access, increasing the child tax
credit, and creating newborn savings accounts.

**MYTH:** The One Big Beautiful Bill “is just a handout to
corporations.”  
**FACT:** This bill drives a Blue-Collar BOOM with tax relief for
workers, support for small businesses, and investments in American
manufacturing. The One Big Beautiful Bill delivers the largest middle-
and working-class tax cut in U.S. history.

**MYTH:** The One Big Beautiful Bill “leaves American workers behind.”  
**FACT:** This is the most pro-American worker bill in history. The One
Big Beautiful Bill boosts pay for millions—and with no tax on tips or
overtime, those working hourly and service jobs receive additional tax
relief.

**MYTH:** The One Big Beautiful Bill “hurts small businesses.”  
**FACT:** The One Big Beautiful Bill will make the Trump Tax Cuts
permanent, including the small business deduction—helping Main Street
grow and hire. Failure to pass this legislation would result in a $4
trillion tax hike.

**MYTH:** The One Big Beautiful Bill “kicks American families off
Medicaid.”  
**FACT:** As the President has said numerous times, there will be no
cuts to Medicaid. The One Big Beautiful Bill protects and strengthens
Medicaid for those who rely on it—pregnant women, children, seniors,
people with disabilities, and low-income families—while eliminating
waste, fraud, and abuse. The One Big Beautiful Bill removes illegal
aliens, enforces work requirements, and protects Medicaid for the truly
vulnerable.

**MYTH:** The One Big Beautiful Bill “cuts Medicare.”  
**FACT:** Medicare has not been touched in this bill— absolutely nothing
in the bill reduces spending on Medicare benefits. This legislation does
not make a single cut to welfare programs—it safeguards and protects
these programs for all eligible Americans.

**MYTH:** The One Big Beautiful Bill “will close rural hospitals.”  
**FACT:** Rural hospitals comprise just 7% of all hospital spending on
Medicaid, illustrating that they have not benefited from the massive
increase in waste, fraud, and abuse under the Biden administration. By
strengthening Medicaid, we are making more resources available for
vulnerable populations and safety net providers, like rural hospitals.
We are expanding rural hospital protection, providing targeted funds for
rural care, and giving states flexibility to support local providers.

**MYTH:** “People will literally die” from the One Big Beautiful Bill —
“and millions will be kicked off their healthcare.”  
**FACT:** This is one of the most egregious, deranged attacks from the
Left peddling fear over the facts. The One Big Beautiful Bill protects
eligible Americans on federal welfare – including Medicaid. By
strengthening the integrity of Medicaid by eliminating waste, fraud, and
abuse, its resources can be refocused on providing better care for those
whom the program was designed to serve: pregnant women, children, people
with disabilities, low-income seniors, and other vulnerable low-income
families.

**MYTH:** The One Big Beautiful Bill “will hurt people with
disabilities.”  
**FACT:** The One Big Beautiful Bill protects and strengthens Medicaid
for Americans with disabilities. Rest assured, those with disabilities
receiving Medicaid will receive no loss or change in coverage.

**MYTH:** The One Big Beautiful Bill “punishes vulnerable Americans with
work requirements to receive their benefits.”  
**FACT:** Not true. The 20-hour weekly work requirement applies only to
able-bodied adults without young children and promotes dignity,
stability, and better health outcomes for families. The One Big
Beautiful Bill restores the dignity of work with historically bipartisan
work requirements for able-bodied Americans. We are implementing
commonsense, Clinton-era work, volunteer, education, or training
requirements with broad bipartisan support.

**MYTH:** “There’s no fraud in Medicaid — Republicans are just taking
coverage away from vulnerable populations.”  
**FACT:** In the last 10 years, CMS admitted that improper payments for
Medicaid have exceeded HALF A TRILLION dollars. In just the past year,
taxpayers spent $56 billion on benefits for able-bodied adults abusing
the system—and over a million illegal aliens are receiving free health
care on the backs of taxpayers. The One Big Beautiful Bill removes
illegal aliens, enacts work requirements for able-bodied adults, and
protects Medicaid for the truly vulnerable.

**MYTH:** “SNAP work requirements are unnecessary.”  
**FACT:** Only 28% of able-bodied adults on SNAP work. The One Big
Beautiful Bill promotes work, responsibility, and restores SNAP to serve
the truly needy. SNAP enrollment remains high even in a strong economy,
including millions of able-bodied adults who could work. In fact, almost
three-quarters of able-bodied adults without dependents on SNAP have no
earned income. The mission of the program has failed. SNAP was intended
to be temporary help for those who encounter tough times—we are
strengthening this program to serve those who need it most.

**MYTH:** “Illegal aliens don’t get federal benefits.”  
**FACT:** Illegals burden taxpayers with billions in costs for free
health care and welfare benefits. The One Big Beautiful Bill ends
Medicaid and SNAP fraud and ensures these programs serve only eligible
Americans.

**MYTH:** The One Big Beautiful Bill “doesn’t actually end taxes on
Social Security.”  
**FACT:** The One Big Beautiful Bill delivers historic tax relief to
seniors, with a new tax deduction that, combined with other deductions,
ensures the average Social Security beneficiary will pay zero taxes on
Social Security.

**MYTH:** The One Big Beautiful Bill “increases the deficit.”  
**FACT:** The One Big Beautiful Bill reduces deficits by over $2
trillion by increasing economic growth and cutting waste, fraud, and
abuse across government programs at an unprecedented rate. This
legislation delivers historic levels of mandatory savings. President
Trump’s pro-growth economic formula will reduce the deficit, increase
wages, deliver American jobs, and drive down the cost of living.

**MYTH:** “But the CBO says….”  
**FACT:** The Crooked Budget Office has a terrible record with its
predictions and hasn’t earned the attention the media gives it. The CBO
misreads the economic consequences of not extending the Trump Tax Cuts.
The One Big Beautiful Bill delivers real savings that will unleash our
economy and prevent the largest tax hike in history, resulting in
historic prosperity, while lowering the debt burden.

**MYTH:** “There’s too much ‘pork’ in this bill.”  
**FACT:** There’s no pork in the bill. Every single provision in the One
Big Beautiful Bill is a campaign promise the American people elected
President Trump to deliver. The only new spending in the bill is to
secure the homeland of the United States and save American sovereignty —
which is fully paid for by increased visa fees on foreigners.

**MYTH:** “The One Big Beautiful Bill won’t strengthen national
security.”  
**FACT:** The One Big Beautiful Bill delivers on President Trump’s Peace
Through Strength agenda by funding the Golden Dome missile defense
system and modernizing our military to prioritize lethality and
readiness. It fully equips our war fighters with the resources they need
while modernizing and revolutionizing our equipment and technology.

**MYTH:** The One Big Beautiful Bill “helps ‘Big Oil’ and locks up U.S.
energy resources.”  
**FACT:** Quite the opposite. It unleashes American energy, refills the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and repeals the Green New Scam policies.
The One Big Beautiful Bill unleashes clean, American-made energy and
will reduce the cost of living for Americans nationwide.

**MYTH:** “Manufacturing jobs will still go overseas.”  
**FACT:** The One Big Beautiful Bill delivers 100% expensing for new
domestic factories, revitalizes Opportunity Zones, and incentivizes
companies to keep jobs in America.

**MYTH:** The One Big Beautiful Bill “neglects rural America.”  
**FACT:** This bill invests in rural communities, expands market access,
and delivers historic support to farm families. The One Big Beautiful
Bill provides the certainty America’s farm families need to continue
operating and producing the affordable, safe, and abundant supply of
food, fuel, and fiber that our nation relies on.

**MYTH:** “SNAP is being gutted and cutting food stamps for families,
causing them to go hungry.”  
**FACT:** The One Big Beautiful Bill protects and strengthens SNAP.
Right now, almost three-quarters of able-bodied adults without
dependents on SNAP have no earned income and the fraud rate is high. The
mission of the program has failed: SNAP was intended to be temporary
help for those who encounter tough times. Now, it’s become so bloated
that it is leaving fewer resources for those who truly need help. We are
committed to preserving SNAP for the truly needy.

**MYTH:** “Republicans are shutting Democrats out of the legislative
process.”  
**FACT:** This is not a partisan bill—Democrats shut themselves out by
supporting higher taxes, open borders, and giveaways to illegal
immigrants. The One Big Beautiful Bill delivers on Republican promises
to lower taxes, secure the border, cut spending, and put Americans
first.

**MYTH:** The One Big Beautiful Bill “border package is not necessary
since President Trump has secured the border.”  
**FACT:** We must ensure that the invasion we witnessed as a nation
under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris never happens again. The One Big
Beautiful Bill’s historic investment in our border security ensures we
permanently secure our border and protect our homeland by finishing the
border wall, hiring 10,000 new ICE officers, and funding efforts to stop
the flow of fentanyl.
