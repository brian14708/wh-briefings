title: The One Big Beautiful Bill Is Good for All 50 States
---
 
President Donald J. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill will be an economic
windfall for working and middle-class Americans, delivering the [largest
tax cut in
history](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/06/the-largest-tax-cut-in-history-for-working-and-middle-class-americans/),
higher wages, higher take-home pay, and [much
more](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/06/50-wins-in-the-one-big-beautiful-bill/)
— coupled with generational spending cuts and deficit reduction that
will position the U.S. for real prosperity.  
   
**Its massive benefits will be felt by Americans in all 50 states,
according to a new state-by-state analysis from the Council of Economic
Advisers:**

**Methodological notes:**

-   The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) calculates how investment,
    GDP, and wages increase in response to lower effective tax rates
    (lower statutory rates, bigger deduction for pass-through
    businesses, and full expensing that businesses will enjoy on new
    equipment, R&D, and factories) using standard academic methods that
    were successful in accurately forecasting the effects of the 2017
    Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).
-   Take-home pay — defined as after-tax earnings — increases because
    wages rise and less money is taken out of workers’ paychecks.
-   The CEA also looks at the further boost to GDP from the stronger
    incentive to work (lower taxes boost labor supply) and the greater
    spending power that Americans will have.
-   More about the methodology can be found
    [here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Preserving-and-Expanding-Low-Tax-Rates-to-Create-American-Economic-Prosperity.pdf).
