U.S. Border Patrol didn’t release a single illegal immigrant into the
interior of the U.S. last month, [the *New York Post*
reports](https://nypost.com/2025/06/17/us-news/border-agents-didnt-release-a-single-illegal-migrant-into-the-us-last-month-border-patrol/)
— the latest victory in President Donald J. Trump’s relentless
commitment to securing the homeland and a remarkable turnaround from the
62,000 illegals released into the country under the Biden Administration
just one year ago.

Promises made, promises kept.

**From the *Post*:**

*“Border Patrol agents didn’t release a single migrant into the US last
month — a staggering drop after the Biden administration allowed 62,000
illegal crossers in the country in May 2024, The Post can exclusively
reveal.*

*Agents caught 8,725 migrants crossing illegally at the southern border
last month. That’s a 93% decrease from May 2024, when 117,905 were
nabbed, according to internal data obtained by The Post.*

*And Acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner Pete Flores said
it’s a result of the Trump administration’s tough border policies.”*
