title: Boston Mayor Slanders ICE Heroes Busting Illegal Immigrant Rapists, Killers
  in Her City
---
 
*“Because of dangerous, unhinged smears from the Left, ICE officers are
facing a 413% increase in assaults. President Trump is keeping his
promise to the American people to deport illegal aliens. It’s disturbing
that Democrats like Mayor Wu would side with illegal immigrants over
Americans and stoke hatred against American law enforcement.”* — White
House spokesperson Abigail Jackson

Boston Mayor Michelle Wu [doubled
down](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1930630848832831496) on her
disgusting, dangerous attacks on law enforcement yesterday when she
compared Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to neo-Nazis —
just days after the so-called “sanctuary city” mayor
[smeared](https://x.com/johnfgately/status/1930236238239277080) ICE and
other federal agents as “secret police.”

If the mayor had any shame, she’d be embarrassed for fanning the flames
of hate while ICE agents face
[unprecedented](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/05/06/dhs-makes-common-sense-courthouse-arrests-criminal-illegal-aliens)
[threats](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1929574998961766661) to
themselves and their families — but that’d be asking too much in today’s
Democrat Party.

She’s denigrating the same agents who just removed nearly 1,500 criminal
illegal immigrants from the streets of her state in the
[largest-ever](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/largest-ever-ice-operation-results-nearly-1500-illegals-arrested-blue-state)
immigration enforcement operation — including these sick animals:
