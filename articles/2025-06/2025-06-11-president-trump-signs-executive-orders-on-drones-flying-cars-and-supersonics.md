title: President Trump Signs Executive Orders on Drones, Flying Cars, and Supersonics
---
 
WASHINGTON, DC – President Trump has signed three executive orders that
will accelerate domestic drone production, secure our airspace, and
position America to once again lead the world in supersonic technology.

“Decades of regulatory gridlock have grounded advancements in drones,
flying cars, and supersonic flight in the U.S. With today’s EOs, the
Trump Administration is giving America’s innovators greater ability to
test, develop, and commercialize these cutting-edge aircrafts that will
reshape aviation,” **said White House Office of Science and Technology
Policy Director Michael Kratsios. **“President Trump’s actions will
unleash a new era of American aviation dominance, fostering innovation,
driving economic growth, and protecting our national security.

Burdensome red tape has hindered homegrown drone innovation and grounded
progress in supersonic flight for generations. Today’s executive orders
accelerate domestic drone innovation, secure supply chains, reduce
reliance on adversarial nations, repeal regulations that stalled
supersonic flight, and assert U.S. leadership in emerging aviation
sectors. They also enable routine beyond line-of-sight operations, which
will empower our domestic drone economy to assist with critical
infrastructure, emergency response, and long-distance cargo and medical
delivery.

The executive orders also create a pilot program testing flying cars,
also known as electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft,
for EMS, air taxis, cargo, and defense logistics. The eVTOL pilot
program builds on the successes of President Trump’s 2017 drone pilot
program, highlighting how President Trump’s actions continue to put
America in a position to lead.

Additionally, these orders address the growing threats from criminal,
terrorist, and foreign misuse of drones inside U.S. airspace. This
administration is securing our borders against aerial threats by
cracking down on unlawful drone activity and prioritizing real-time
detection and identification of drones to safeguard national security.
