title: Under President Trump, America is Defeating Inflation
---
 
America is beating inflation as President Donald J. Trump leads the
country into the new Golden Age with lower costs, higher pay, and
economic opportunity for all.

**Here’s what you need to know from the latest Consumer Price Index:**

-   **In May, inflation came in** [**lighter than
    expected**](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/11/cpi-inflation-may-2025.html)
    **for yet another month.**
    -   Since President Trump took office, inflation has come in below
        economists’ expectations every single month.
-   **Core inflation** [**held
    steady**](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CUUR0000SA0L1E?output_view=pct_12mths)
    **and remains at the lowest level since March 2021.**
    -   Under President Trump, core inflation has tracked at just 2.0%
        on an annual basis — levels not seen since the first Trump
        Administration, when prices were low and stable.
-   **Wage growth remains strong under President Trump.**
    -   In May, real wages for production and nonsupervisory workers saw
        the highest monthly increase in nearly a year — and have risen
        each month since President Trump took office, up nearly 2% over
        last year.

    -   The average private sector worker is on track to see their real
        earnings increase by around $1,200, adjusted for inflation.
-   **Prices for everyday Americans continue to fall.**
    -   Energy prices fell by 1.0% over the last month — down 3.5% over
        the past year.

    <!-- -->

    -   Gasoline prices have fallen each month since President Trump
        took office, down 2.6% over the past month and down 12% over the
        past year.

    <!-- -->

    -   Prices in key areas — such as meats, poultry, eggs, airfares,
        used and new cars, and apparel — all went down over the past
        month.

**Here’s what they’re saying:**

-   [**CNN’s Matt
    Egan**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1932785089475178513)**:**
    “We got ANOTHER month of positive inflation news. Despite these
    historic tariffs, the latest numbers do show that inflation remained
    relatively tame in May … This was better than expected … We did see
    a drop in energy prices. In particular, gas prices were low.”
-   [**CNBC’s Mike
    Santoli**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1932786126906871931)**:**
    “There’s no way to look at these numbers and say they’re not welcome
    news.”
-   [**CNBC’s Steve
    Liesman**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1932785355427569895)**:**
    “Not only did we get a decline in inflation expectations earlier
    this week from the important New York Fed report … I do not see
    broader impacts on inflation from the tariffs.”
-   [**CNBC’s Rick
    Santelli**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1932784914300084510)**:** “Inflation
    certainly looks like it is cooling.”
-   [**Fox Business Network’s Maria
    Bartiromo**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1932785417574666521)**:**
    “That is much better than expected.”
-   [**Commentator Adam
    Johnson**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1932785770323927355)**:**
    “Now we’re talking about numbers that are down in the low twos —
    under 2.5% — and we’re seeing that now for three months in a row, so
    this is wonderful news.”
