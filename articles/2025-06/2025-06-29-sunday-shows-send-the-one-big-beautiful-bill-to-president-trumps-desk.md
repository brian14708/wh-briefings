title: "SUNDAY SHOWS: Send the One Big Beautiful Bill to President Trump\u2019s Desk"
---
 
This morning, Members of Congress joined President Donald J. Trump on
the Sunday shows to discuss the overwhelmingly positive impacts of the
One Big Beautiful Bill — which will deliver unprecedented tax relief,
generational welfare reform, and historic spending cuts for the American
people.

**Here’s what you missed:**

#### **President Trump on Sunday Morning Futures**

-   “We’re cutting $1.7 trillion … We’re going to have growth like we’ve
    never seen before.”

-   “It takes care of the border. There’s also No Tax on Tips, No Tax on
    Social Security, No Tax on Overtime.”

#### **Senator Markwayne Mullin on Meet the Press**

-   “This cuts spending. It’s the largest deficit cut by any Congress
    ever in history. It makes tax cuts permanent — which, instead of
    taxes going up January 1 by $4 trillion, it actually restores the
    tax cuts and the average household of four is going to bring home
    pay over $10,000 more a year.”

-   “What we’re doing is cutting the waste, fraud, and abuse out of the
    Medicaid system and make sure it’s for the people that it was
    originally intended for.”

#### **Senator Jim Banks on Fox News Sunday**

-   “This is the biggest spending cut in American history — a $1.6
    trillion spending cut, getting rid of the Green New Deal scams from
    the Biden Administration, and it’s the biggest tax cut in American
    history for working class families.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1939315692563791983))
-   “Everyone in my family is blue collar, working class. They’re all
    going to get socked by another $2,000, on average, every year. They
    already tell me they can’t keep up right now, and the Democrats want
    them to pay more in taxes? … Democrats are focused on screwing the
    working class with higher taxes … President Trump and Republicans
    are serious about cutting taxes on the people who need it the most.”

#### **Senator Katie Britt on State of the Union**

-   “We’re going to make sure that hardworking people can keep more of
    their money. We’re going to make sure that we have secure borders —
    not just now, but for generations to come. We’re going to make sure
    that we have a strong national defense so that our warfighter is the
    best trained, equipped, and ready across the planet. We’re going to
    unleash American energy … We want to make sure that these programs
    are available for the people who need them and we want to make sure
    that people who are working know that we see them and that they have
    a great opportunity to achieve the American Dream — and that’s what
    this bill does.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1939313146331910250))
-   “The reforms in this bill are necessary and we’re going to deliver
    actual solutions to the American people … This bill does No Tax on
    Tips, it does No Tax on Overtime. Real, hardworking Americans are
    going to see results from this.”
