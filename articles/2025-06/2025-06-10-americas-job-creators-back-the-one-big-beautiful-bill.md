Small business owners
[say](https://www.investopedia.com/taxes-now-front-of-mind-for-small-business-owners-11751422)
taxes are their biggest worry right now — but help is on the way.

**In fact, small business owners overwhelmingly back the historic tax
relief in President Donald J. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, according
to** [**new
polling**](https://www.jobcreatorsnetwork.com/press_releases/poll-small-businesses-support-tax-cuts-legislation-by-3-1-margin/)**:**

-   By a four-to-one margin, small business owners support extending the
    Trump Tax Cuts by passing the One Big Beautiful Bill.
-   71% of small businesses support maintaining and expanding the small
    business tax deduction (which the One Big Beautiful Bill does).
-   70% of small businesses say they’re likely to expand or reinvest in
    their business, boost worker wages or benefits, hire more employees,
    or increase charitable giving if the Trump Tax Cuts are extended.
-   64% of small businesses say they’re likely to delay expansion, get a
    loan, reduce inventory, reduce employees, or reduce hours or wages
    if the Trump Tax Cuts expire.
-   63% of small businesses say No Tax on Tips and No Tax on Overtime
    will make it easier to hire workers.

The big beautiful tax bill will bolster small business**

-   “While there are numerous provisions in this bill that would support
    America’s small businesses, the update to Section 199A, the
    qualified business income deduction, would allow small businesses to
    thrive. This deduction is crucial for small businesses, allowing
    owners to deduct qualified business income. For many small
    businesses, this deduction has enabled them to remain afloat despite
    challenging market conditions.”

Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ Offers a Big Tax Win for Small Businesses**

-   “Among its many provisions are an increased tax deduction for
    qualified business income at pass-through companies; a higher
    deduction for state and local taxes; and the extension of various
    other corporate and individual tax cuts that President Trump passed
    during his first term, which are otherwise set to expire at the end
    of this year. The total tax cut included in the bill is estimated to
    be around $4 trillion.”

[**National Federation of Independent
Business**](https://www.nfib.com/news/press-release/the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-is-a-big-beautiful-win-for-small-business/)**:
One Big Beautiful Bill Act is one of the most pro-small business pieces
of legislation in recent history**

-   “The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) supports the
    One Big Beautiful Bill Act because it is one of the most pro-small
    business pieces of legislation in recent history. The bill prevents
    a massive tax hike on over 33 million small business owners, while
    also providing a tax cut for most small business owners.”
