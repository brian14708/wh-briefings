**From the** [***Arizona
Republic***](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/immigration/2025/06/09/us-mexico-border-immigrants/83824441007/)**:**

“Across the entire span of the U.S.-Mexico border, the change is stark —
and it happened nearly overnight. Where Border Patrol agents encountered
well over 100,000 migrants and asylum seekers every month just a year
ago, they now see fewer than 10,000.

More than four months into President Trump’s second term, one of his
signature campaign promises — shutting down the flow of migrants across
the border — seems fulfilled. Reporters with the USA TODAY Network
traveled to 15 sites along the border from the Pacific to the Gulf, from
California to Arizona and Texas, and found much of the same situation in
each: few migrants were attempting to cross; once bustling shelters for
migrants were ghost towns; local officials expressed relief for no
longer having to assist with the flood of people. \[…\]

But as the border itself has gone quiet, Trump maintains that it remains
in a state of crisis while touting the success of his efforts. The
recently passed spending bill by the U.S. House of Representatives
includes $150 billion in new money for immigration enforcement,
including tens of billions for wall construction and facilities along
the border along with tens of billions more for deportation efforts.”
