title: The One Big Beautiful Bill Will Supercharge Our Economy
---
 
Today’s inflation report brought [more welcome
news](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/06/under-president-trump-america-is-defeating-inflation/)
that prices are down and wages are up — and that progress will be
supercharged with President Donald J. Trump’s [One Big Beautiful
Bill](https://www.whitehouse.gov/obbb/).

**Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent told Congress how the One Big
Beautiful Bill — the [largest tax cut in
history](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/06/the-largest-tax-cut-in-history-for-working-and-middle-class-americans/)
— will boost that progress for middle-class Americans and the private
sector without fueling inflation:**

-   “The One Big Beautiful Bill will
    [raise](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Preserving-and-Expanding-Low-Tax-Rates-to-Create-American-Economic-Prosperity.pdf)
    take-home pay between $7,800 and $13,300 for the average family of
    four. It will increase wages between $6,100 to $11,600 for the
    average worker.”

-   “Not only does the One Big Beautiful Bill add $500 to the Child Tax
    Credit, it makes it permanent.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1932872495821984227))
-   “It will cement No Tax on Tips, No Tax on Overtime, and tax cuts for
    seniors.”

-   “The One Big Beautiful Bill will
    [make](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/06/the-largest-tax-cut-in-history-for-working-and-middle-class-americans/)
    the 2017 tax cuts permanent. This will provide individuals and
    businesses with certainty and build economic momentum.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1932808135863054443))
-   “The legislation will provide 100% expensing for new factories, as
    well as existing factories that expand operations and support Made
    in America.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1932808135863054443))
-   “The legislation will provide … the ability to buy a new
    American-made car and deduct the interest.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/SecScottBessent/status/1932830182945271979))
-   “This bill will allow us to prevent our corporate revenues from
    being drained into foreign treasuries — and that is in the hundreds
    of billions of dollars.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/SecScottBessent/status/1932823690489541008))
-   If the One Big Beautiful Bill doesn’t pass, “it would be
    cataclysmic. It would be the largest tax hike in history. It would
    be a disaster for businesses, for working Americans, and for our
    status in the world … We would see increases in taxes of thousands
    of dollars on working Americans, we would see businesses contract
    and we would see a substantial increase in the unemployment rate.”
