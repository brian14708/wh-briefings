title: 'Analysis: One Big Beautiful Bill Will Boost Wages, Lower Deficits'
---
 
President Donald J. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill will boost real
wages, reduce the deficit, produce meaningful economic growth, and bring
stability to the national debt, according to a [new
analysis](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/The-One-Big-Beautiful-Bill-Legislation-for-Historic-Prosperity-and-Deficit-Reduction-1.pdf)
by the Council of Economic Advisers.

**Here are the topline findings:**

-   Real wages for workers will increase by as much as $7,200 per year.
-   After-tax take-home pay for a typical family with two kids will
    increase by as much as $10,900 per year.
-   Real investment will increase by as much as 10%.
-   At least 1.1 percentage points added to annual real GDP growth.
-   7 million jobs will be protected and created.

**Moreover, as a result of President Trump’s economic agenda:**

-   The deficits will be reduced by as much as $11.1 trillion —
    including as much as $5.2 trillion from economic growth, $1.6
    trillion from discretionary spending cuts, $2.8 trillion from tariff
    revenue, and as much as $1.5 trillion from interest savings.
-   The debt-to-GDP will fall to between 88% and 99% — versus rising to
    117% if the Trump Tax Cuts aren’t extended in the One Big Beautiful
    Bill.
