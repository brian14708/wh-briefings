title: 'SUNDAY SHOWS: Pass the One Big Beautiful Bill'
---
 
This morning, officials were out in force talking about the historic
benefits of President Donald J. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, which
will deliver unprecedented tax relief, generational welfare reform, and
historic spending cuts.

**Here’s what you missed:**

-   **Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought:** “It is
    $1.4 trillion in reduced deficits and debt. That’s why this is such
    a paramount, fiscally responsible bill.”

-   **Director Vought:** “The conservatives that have historically used
    the debt limit to sound the alarm have been pushing for the very
    reforms that are in this bill, so we believe that it’s important to
    do it with Republican votes to not have to deal with the Senate
    filibuster, and we want to get it taken care of so that Chuck
    Schumer doesn’t have this hanging over the administration and the
    administration’s agenda over the next several years.”

-   **Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt:** “This bill provides $1.6
    trillion in mandatory savings — and when you combine that with the
    tariff revenue that President Trump’s America First trade agenda is
    bringing in … with the Council of Economic Adviser’s projected
    growth of 3%, we’re going to cut the deficit by $8 trillion over the
    next ten years.”

-   **Speaker Mike Johnson:** “What we’re trying to is help hardworking
    Americans who are trying to provide for their families and make ends
    meet … This is going to be jet fuel to the U.S. economy. All wages
    are going to rise. There’s going to be more jobs and economic
    opportunity for more people. We cannot wait to deliver that.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1931721057720819938))
-   **National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett:** “We put out a
    report from the Council of Economic Advisers that if the bill
    doesn’t pass, then they estimate that this would cause a reduction
    of GDP by 4%, we’d be in a deep recession, we’d lose six or seven
    million jobs.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1931733694580244640))
-   **Director Hassett:** “The Congressional Budget Office put out a
    ten-year estimate that says that the tariff revenue that’s already
    in place right now is going to raise $2.8 trillion over the next ten
    years. That’s more than their own static estimate for the cost of
    this entire bill, so that’s deficit reduction right there.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1931736658510237928))
-   **Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum: “**Permanent lower taxes,
    much lower regulation across the board, it’s pro-energy, it’s
    pro-seniors, it’s pro-farmers, it’s pro-border security — and it
    also cuts a bunch of spending. This thing is fantastic. This is
    Promises made, promises delivered by President Trump.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1931726505802965188))
-   **Senator Rick Scott:** “We’ve got to get this bill passed … We have
    to stop this gigantic tax increase that Democrats are all for. We’ve
    got to secure the border. We’ve got to plus up the military.”
