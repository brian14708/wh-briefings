title: 50 Wins in the One Big Beautiful Bill
---
 
Here are 50 reasons why President Donald J. Trump’s One Big Beautiful
Bill is the best chance in a generation to pass critical reforms for
which Americans voted:

1.  **It delivers the** [**largest tax
    cut**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/04/icymi-president-trumps-largest-tax-cut-in-history/)
    **in American history.** This means an [extra
    $5,000](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Economic-Impact-of-Extending-TCJA-Provisions.pdf)
    in Americans’ pockets with a DOUBLE-DIGIT percent
    [DECREASE](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/x-23-25.pdf)
    to their tax bills. Americans earning between $30,000 and $80,000
    will pay around [15% less in
    taxes](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/05/13/congress/average-taxpayers-tax-bills-set-to-fall-under-house-tax-package-forecasters-say-00347318).
2.  **It makes the Trump Tax Cuts**
    [**permanent**](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/2025/05/14/ways-and-means-votes-to-make-2017-tax-cuts-permanent-provide-additional-relief-for-workers-reward-investment-in-america-and-hold-woke-elites-accountable/#:~:text=Makes%20the%202017%20Trump%20tax%20cuts%20permanent)**,
    preventing the largest tax increase ever.** If the bill doesn’t
    pass, Americans will see the [largest tax
    increase](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/04/heres-what-happens-if-trump-tax-cuts-arent-extended/)
    in history.
3.  **It**
    [**raises**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Preserving-and-Expanding-Low-Tax-Rates-to-Create-American-Economic-Prosperity.pdf)
    **Americans’ take-home pay by as much as $13,300 and wages by as
    much as $11,600.**
4.  **It reverses the spending curse plaguing Washington, D.C.** The
    bill delivers the largest deficit reduction in nearly 30 years, with
    [$1.6 trillion](https://x.com/russvought/status/1923488257888879103)
    in mandatory savings — the largest single reduction in mandatory
    spending in our country’s history.
5.  **It**
    [**delivers**](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/2025/05/22/passed-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-moves-one-step-closer-to-president-trumps-desk/#:~:text=Delivers%20on%20President%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20priorities%20of%20no%20tax%20on%20tips%2C%20overtime%20pay%2C)
    **NO TAX ON TIPS and NO TAX ON OVERTIME.** This makes good on two of
    President Trump’s cornerstone campaign promises and will benefit
    hardworking Americans where they need it the most — their paychecks.
6.  **It provides historic** [**tax
    cuts**](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/2025reconciliation/#:~:text=TAX%20RELIEF%0AFOR%20SENIORS)
    **for seniors.**
7.  **It finishes President Trump’s border wall.** As a result, 701
    miles of primary wall, 900 miles of river barriers, 629 miles of
    secondary barriers, and 141 miles of vehicle and pedestrian barriers
    will be
    [constructed](https://homeland.house.gov/2025/04/29/homeland-republicans-advance-funding-recommendations-to-continue-president-trumps-border-security-victory-bolster-frontline-personnel-for-years-to-come/).
8.  **It**
    [**boosts**](https://homeland.house.gov/2025/04/29/chairman-green-for-realclearpolitics-one-big-beautiful-bill-will-give-americans-a-secure-border/)
    **Border Patrol and ICE agents on the frontlines with the largest
    border security investment in history.** This means funding to hire
    10,000 new ICE personnel, 5,000 new customs officers, and 3,000 new
    Border Patrol agents to detain and deport at least one million
    illegal immigrants annually.
9.  **It**
    [**increases**](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/2025reconciliation/#:~:text=%242%2C500%20CHILD%20TAX%20CREDIT)
    **the child tax credit to $2,500 per family.**
10. **It protects Medicaid for Americans who truly need it.** This bill
    eliminates waste, fraud, and abuse by ending benefits for at least
    [1.4
    million](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/05/15/democrat-messaging-falters-as-they-ask-constituents-to-foot-medicaid-costs-for-1-4-million-illegal-aliens/)
    illegal immigrants who are gaming the system.
11. **It**

    [**popular**](https://paragoninstitute.org/newsletter/american-voters-want-commonsense-medicaid-reforms/)
    **work requirements for able-bodied Americans receiving
    taxpayer-funded benefits.** Through commonsense, Clinton-era work,
    volunteer, education, or training requirements, the One Big
    Beautiful Bill lifts Americans up to find a better quality of life
    through the dignity of work.
12. **It**
    [**eliminates**](https://x.com/ChadPergram/status/1929682527402221840)
    **hundreds of billions of dollars in Green New Scam tax credits.**
    The legislation immediately stops credits from flowing to China,
    saving taxpayers $500+ billion every year.
13. **It**
    [**reverses**](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2025/05/19/trump-big-beautiful-bill-electric-vehicle-tax-credit/83673329007/)
    **electric vehicle mandates that let radical climate activists set
    the standards for American energy.**
14. **It ends Biden’s war on American energy.** The bill finally
    unleashes American energy dominance by
    [opening](https://www.ipaa.org/ipaa-one-big-beautiful-bill-is-a-win-for-american-energy/)
    federal lands and waters to oil, gas, coal, geothermal, and mineral
    leasing.

    security.**

    **and rescinds every “green” corporate welfare subsidy in Democrats’
    so-called “Inflation Reduction Act.”**

    — promoting the growth and success of Main Street.
20. **It**
    [**incentivizes**](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-One-Big-Beautiful-Bill-Fuels-Americas-Growth.pdf)
    **MADE IN AMERICA.** The bill rewards companies that build their
    products in America with lower taxes — and allows Americans who buy
    an American-made vehicle to fully deduct their auto loan interest.
21. **It**
    [**creates**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/05/28/ted-cruz-tax-bill-family-policy-baby-bonus-school-choice/)
    **new Trump Savings Accounts for newborns** — allowing children
    across America to experience the miracle of compounded growth.
22. **It**

    **access to childcare for hardworking American families.**
23. **It**
    [**provides**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1927774145451856102)
    **a historic increase in funding for the U.S. Coast Guard.** This
    will help block illegal drugs and migrants from entering our
    country, protect our sovereignty in the Arctic, and promote our
    national security.
24. **It**
    [**supports**](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-One-Big-Beautiful-Bill-Fuels-Americas-Growth.pdf)
    **building new factories to grow domestic business operations.** The
    bill renews 100% immediate expensing and interest deductions,
    increases the small business deduction, and establishes 100%
    immediate expensing for equipment and machinery.
25. **It**
    [**helps**](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-One-Big-Beautiful-Bill-Make-Rural-America-Great-Again.pdf)
    **American farmers, producers, and ranchers compete and sell
    products in foreign markets.** The bill makes sure American farmers
    aren’t crowded out by foreign imports in liquid fuel production
    markets.
26. **It**
    [**holds**](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/2025/05/21/the-one-big-beautiful-bill-holds-elites-accountable-ends-tax-payer-benefits-for-illegal-immigrants-provides-additional-relief-for-parents/)
    **woke, elitist universities accountable by increasing the endowment
    tax on large universities.**

    unfair** [**student loan
    bailouts**](/Users/CRParent/Work%20Folders/Desktop/One%20Big%20Beautiful%20Bill/Education%20and%20Workforce%20Talking%20Points.html)**.**
28. **It ends taxpayer-funded sex changes.** It
    [reverses](https://d1dth6e84htgma.cloudfront.net/05_13_2025_FCMU_Memorandum_UPDATED_55a74a132a.pdf)
    the [Biden-era
    mandate](https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/issue-brief/the-biden-administrations-final-rule-on-section-1557-non-discrimination-regulations-under-the-aca/)

    so-called “gender transition” procedures — ending the
    taxpayer-funded chemical castration and mutilation of American
    children.
29. **It’s a once-in-a-generation chance to revolutionize our nation’s
    defense capabilities and protect the homeland against new threats by
    funding** **President Trump’s Golden Dome.**
30. **It**
    [**enhances**](https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2025/06/03/revitalizing_shipbuilding_by_expanding_warship_orders_1114085.html)
    **the capacity of America’s naval fleet.** The bill provides
    billions of dollars to revitalize America’s shipbuilding and
    maritime industrial base.
31. **It modernizes air traffic control** — fulfilling President
    Trump’s [plan](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/us-transportation-secretary-sean-p-duffy-unveils-plan-build-brand-new-state-art-air) to
    completely
    [overhaul](https://transportation.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=408584)
    the systems that keep Americans flying safely and efficiently.
32. **It strengthens SNAP benefits.** The legislation
    [requires](https://agriculture.house.gov/uploadedfiles/holding_states_accountable.pdf)
    states to contribute a greater portion of the cost of administering
    benefits, thereby controlling costs, and
    [closes](https://agriculture.house.gov/uploadedfiles/renewing_the_american_dream.pdf)
    the excessively broad loopholes for work requirements.
33. **It**
    [**implements**](https://d1dth6e84htgma.cloudfront.net/05_16_2025_Reconciliation_Messaging_2274c9e051.pdf)
    **critical program integrity and cost containment provisions in
    Medicaid to strengthen it for future generations.** These include
    removing deceased individuals from the program and limiting
    retroactive coverage from three months to one month prior to
    enrollment.
34. **It**
    [**safeguards**](https://thefederalist.com/2025/05/28/heres-what-the-big-beautiful-bill-says-about-suppressors/)

    [**repeals**](https://atr.org/every-house-democrat-just-voted-against-these-tax-cuts/#:~:text=Repeals%20the%20IRS,the%20same%20payer.)
    **Democrats’ insane attack on the gig economy** — ending the
    requirement that Venmo, PayPal, and other gig transactions over $600
    be reported to the IRS.
41. **It** [**reforms and
    streamlines**](https://edworkforce.house.gov/uploadedfiles/4.28.25_ew_reconciliation.pdf)
    **the federal student loan program to drive down tuition costs and
    simplify repayment plans.** This includes reasonable limits on
    amounts students can borrow.
42. **It**
    [**strengthens**](https://edworkforce.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=412433)
    **accountability for students and taxpayers on federal student
    loans.** The bill
    [imposes](https://edworkforce.house.gov/uploadedfiles/4.28.25_ew_reconciliation.pdf)
    “skin in the game” requirements to hold universities financially
    accountable to the government on defaulted federal student loans.
43. **It**
    [**implements**](https://edworkforce.house.gov/uploadedfiles/4.28.25_ew_reconciliation.pdf)
    **critical reforms to Pell Grants to make sure they prioritize
    students who truly need financial assistance while promoting
    completion.** The legislation allows grants to be used for
    short-term, high-quality workforce training programs to support
    Americans who want to learn a trade instead of the traditional
    four-year colleges.
44. **It**
    [**increases**](https://naturalresources.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=417144#:~:text=We%E2%80%99ve%20also%20directed,wildfire%20suppression%20costs.)
    **timber sales on federal lands.** This means an increase in timber
    production and improvement to forest management — improving the
    resilience of timber and saving billions on future wildfire
    suppression costs.
45. **It [authorizes](https://broadbandbreakfast.com/trump-backs-88-billion-house-spectrum-plan/) the
    sale of expanded spectrum MHz to strengthen rural broadband and
    secure America’s technological dominance in AI and other emerging
    technologies.**
46. **It creates permanent fees that illegal immigrants must pay for
    their applications so American taxpayers aren’t saddled with
    covering these costs.** These fees will bring in over $77 billion to
    cover adjudication costs and fund immigration processes and
    enforcement actions.
47. **It protects family farmers.** The bill prevents the greedy death
    tax from hitting two million family-owned farms who would otherwise
    see their exemptions cut in half and [cuts
    taxes](https://x.com/RepJasonSmith/status/1924469450209636454) on
    farmers by over $10 billion.
48. **It**

    **abusive financing practices in Medicaid by freezing existing
    provider taxes and prohibiting new provider taxes.** This ensures
    states cannot [improperly
    increase](https://paragoninstitute.org/medicaid/addressing-medicaid-money-laundering-the-lack-of-integrity-with-medicaid-financing-and-the-need-for-reform/)
    the federal government’s cost-share of a state Medicaid program at
    the expense of taxpayers.
49. **It reins in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.** This
    [brainchild](https://dailycaller.com/2021/09/30/rohit-chopra-cfpb-elizabeth-warren-joe-biden/) of
    Sen. Elizabeth Warren has long functioned as another [woke,
    weaponized](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/02/cfpb-isnt-a-wall-street-regulator-its-a-main-street-regulator/)
    arm of the bureaucracy — with minimal accountability or oversight —
    that leverages its power against certain industries and individuals
    disfavored by the so-called “elites.”
50. **It rolls back harmful Biden-era regulations that increase cost and
    administrative burdens with limited flexibility for states.** These
    burdensome regulations, such as federal staffing mandates at nursing
    homes, [lead
    to](https://www.ahcancal.org/News-and-Communications/Press-Releases/Pages/Analysis-Final-Nursing-Home-Staffing-Rule-Would-Require-102,000-Additional-Caregivers-Cost-$6.5-Billion-Per-Year.aspx)
    closures, reduced access to care, and increased costs, particularly
    in areas already overwhelmed by labor shortages.
