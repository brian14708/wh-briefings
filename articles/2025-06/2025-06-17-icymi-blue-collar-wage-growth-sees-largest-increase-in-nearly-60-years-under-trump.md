title: 'ICYMI: Blue-Collar Wage Growth Sees Largest Increase in Nearly 60 Years Under
  Trump'
---
 
In President Donald J. Trump’s first five months in office, real wages
for hourly workers have seen their largest
[increase](https://x.com/SecScottBessent/status/1934992476105818400)
under any administration in nearly 60 years — and we’re just getting
started with pro-growth, pro-prosperity policies that finally put
America First.

Blue-collar workers have seen real wages grow almost two percent in the
first five months of President Trump’s second term — a stark contrast
from the negative wage growth seen during the first five months of the
Biden Administration.

“The only other time it has been this high … was during President
Trump’s first term,” Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent
[said](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1934988046635618649) in an
[interview](https://nypost.com/2025/06/17/us-news/blue-collar-wage-growth-under-trump-sees-largest-increase-in-nearly-60-years-bessent/)
with the *New York Post*.

“Since Richard Nixon in 1969, Trump has been the only president to
record positive growth for blue-collar workers in his first five months.
He also achieved 1.3% in his first term … The recovery from a 1.7%
decline recorded in Biden’s first five months, as inflation outpaced
earnings, suggests a shift in economic conditions for this financially
stressed segment of the workforce.”
