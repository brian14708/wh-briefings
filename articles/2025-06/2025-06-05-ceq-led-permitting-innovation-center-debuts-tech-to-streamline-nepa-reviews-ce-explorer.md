title: "CEQ-led Permitting Innovation Center Debuts Tech to Streamline NEPA Reviews\
  \ \u2013 CE Explorer"

***The White House continues its momentum to modernize permitting
technology, launching a tool to aid the finding of categorical
exclusions across Federal agencies.***

Today, the White House Council on Environmental Quality unveiled the
Categorical Exclusion Explorer (CE Explorer)**,** a technology tool that
will increase transparency and streamline environmental reviews and
permitting processes by providing a digitized public database of each
Federal agency’s existing categorical exclusions established under the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The CE Explorer is the first
tool developed by the Permitting Innovation Center, established in
response to President Donald J. Trump’s Memorandum, [*Updating
Permitting Technology for the 21st
Century*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/updating-permitting-technology-for-the-21st-century/)*,*
and supports the implementation of the White House [Permitting
Technology Action
Plan](https://permitting.innovation.gov/resources/action-plan) that was
released May 30, 2025.

The CE Explorer’s search functionality will provide states, tribal
officials, project sponsors and stakeholders with seamless access to
view Federal agencies’ categorical exclusions. This digitized,
searchable list will enhance interagency coordination by enabling
agencies to quickly identify relevant categorical exclusions established
by other agencies. The tool will also support other agencies’ adoption
of categorical exclusions, as encouraged by Congress in its 2023
amendments to NEPA, helping to accelerate environmental reviews and
permitting processes.

The data in the CE Explorer is available to download in a
machine-readable format, allowing interested parties to leverage this
technology and data source to build tools to modernize their own NEPA or
permitting review processes.
