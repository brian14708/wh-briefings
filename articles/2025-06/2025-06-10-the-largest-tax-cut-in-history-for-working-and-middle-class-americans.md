the tax policies in the One Big Beautiful Bill are needed and popular —
but they still oppose the bill.

**To be clear, that means they’re opposing:**

-   The largest tax cut in history for working and middle-class
    Americans.
-   A [15% tax

    for Americans making between $30,000 and $80,000 per year.
-   NO TAX ON TIPS and NO TAX ON OVERTIME.
