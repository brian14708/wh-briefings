---
 
**From** [**CBS News
Texas**](https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/doj-lawsuit-texas-in-state-tuition-undocumented/)**:**

*“Texas has agreed to end in-state tuition rates for undocumented
immigrants.*

*The Department of Justice sued Texas on Wednesday over a long-standing
state education policy, which it says illegally favors undocumented
foreign students. The lawsuit accuses Texas of discriminating against
out-of-state American students by offering in-state tuition rates to
undocumented immigrants. *

*That same day, Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a joint motion along
with the Trump administration to end the law.*

*It’s one of the latest efforts by the Trump administration to crack
down on immigration into the country. President Trump issued two
executive orders to prevent ‘benefits or preferential treatments’ from
going to undocumented immigrants.”*
