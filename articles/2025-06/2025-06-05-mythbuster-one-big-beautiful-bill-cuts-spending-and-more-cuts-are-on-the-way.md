  \ on the Way"

### **“Where are the spending cuts?”**

-   **FACT:** President Donald J. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill is just
    one mechanism the Trump Administration is using to cut spending.
-   **FACT: The One Big Beautiful Bill includes $1.7 trillion in
    mandatory savings.** This means that for the [first time since the
    1990s](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1930338521295757542),
    the bill offers a chance to cement real savings on mandatory
    spending programs into law.
    -   OMB Deputy Director Dan Bishop —
        [known](https://thefreedomindex.org/legislator/B001311/votes/report-fi117-3/)
        for his fiscal responsibility — says he “waited for an
        opportunity like this” when he was in Congress to make real,
        substantial spending cuts.
-   **FACT: The One Big Beautiful Bill makes permanent fixes to Medicaid
    and food stamps — and that chance may never come again.** This is an
    opportunity to kick illegal immigrants off the taxpayer-funded
    rolls, cut government funding for sex changes, and restore integrity
    in program spending — saving taxpayers hundreds of billions of
    dollars. This opportunity will likely not come again.

### **“Shouldn’t the One Big Beautiful Bill do *more* to cut spending?”**

-   **FACT: This is a reconciliation bill, which is a procedural
    maneuver that can ONLY be used to make changes to certain mandatory
    spending programs, such as entitlements.** It is
    [NOT](https://x.com/StephenM/status/1930242667025195048) an
    appropriations (discretionary) bill, which is how government
    operations are funded on an annual basis.
-   **FACT: President Trump’s budget proposal makes the most substantial
    spending cuts in a generation** — reducing non-defense spending by
    $163 billion, or 22% below current levels. Adjusted for inflation,
    it’s the lowest non-defense spending in 25 years and will generate
    trillions of dollars in savings over the next decade.
-   **FACT: Another tool the Trump Administration is using to cut
    spending is known as a “rescission,” which cancels funding that has
    already been appropriated by Congress.** Earlier this week,
    President Trump sent his first [rescissions
    package](https://x.com/WHOMB/status/1929991228449312979) to
    Congress, asking them to claw back billions of dollars in wasteful
    foreign aid, bureaucratic fraud and abuse, and federal funding for
    NPR and PBS — and it’s just the first of many such rescissions
    packages.
