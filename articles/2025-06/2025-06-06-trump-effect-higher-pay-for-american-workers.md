title: 'TRUMP EFFECT: Higher Pay for American Workers'
---
 
**“President Trump’s America First Economic Agenda has created a BOOMING
economy — jobs are up, unemployment is down, wages are increasing, and
inflation is dead. More than 139,000 good jobs were added to the private
sector in May, all accounted for by American-born workers. Americans
should continue to trust in President Trump, who continues to beat
expectations.”** — White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt

President Donald J. Trump’s America First agenda is making its mark on
the American economy — with explosive private sector growth, job gains,
and wage increases for American workers.

**Look no further than today’s jobs report for proof:**

-   In May, the U.S.

    139,000 jobs — [smashing
    expectations](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1930972954457698308)
    for the [third straight
    month](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/05/jobs-boom-more-americans-working-for-higher-pay/),
    with the private sector accounting for all net job gains.
    -   Leisure and hospitality: +48,000 new jobs

    <!-- -->

    -   Transportation and warehousing: +5,800 new jobs

    <!-- -->

    -   Construction: +4,000 new jobs — the fourth straight month of job
        increases
-   Wages for everyday Americans [continue to
    rise](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1930972988817424766),
    with real average hourly earnings up by nearly 4% over the past year
    — far higher than economists’ expectations.
    -   Since President Trump took office, real disposable personal
        income has risen at a 7.5% annualized pace — more than three
        times the pace than the final year of the Biden Administration.
-   Native-born American workers now account for ALL job gains since
    President Trump took office in January — reversing the opposite
    trend from the past two years.
-   Since President Trump took office, 99.8% of job gains have been in
    the private sector. During the final two years of the Biden
    Administration, one in four jobs created were in government.

**Here’s what they’re saying:**

-   [Council of Economic Advisers Chair Steve
    Miran](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1930976604819259620):
    “The President is succeeding in creating hundreds of thousands of
    jobs since he came into office — more than half a million jobs since
    he came into office — and they’re all going to native-born
    Americans.”
-   [Economist Steve
    Moore](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1930975686908350491):
    “This is a blockbuster economy we’re seeing … 4.5% GDP for the
    second quarter, low inflation — this is telling us right now the
    jobs are out there for people who want them.”
-   [Job Creators Network CEO Alfredo
    Ortiz](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1930974150543179915):
    “The small business economy is growing and the private economy is
    growing. This is exactly what Donald Trump wanted to do for
    reversing everything that Biden had done … It’s so good to see that
    we’re actually creating private economy jobs again.”
-   [Fox Business Network’s Cheryl
    Casone](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1930973931105599652):
    “The markets might be encouraged by the fact that you aren’t seeing
    job losses … that means that people are maybe going to start spend
    this summer. They might go actually take a trip they weren’t
    planning to take — and look, gas prices are lower right now. We’ve
    got great gas prices, so I think this could be a really good
    economic story.”
-   [ERShares CEO Joel Shulman,
    Ph.D.](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1930974661187149879):
    “There’s optimism here on the horizon … CPI last month was a
    catalyst. I think we’re going to see another catalyst on June 11,
    coupled with this better-than-expected jobs report — so I think
    things are looking more optimistic.”
