title: It is Possible to Support Science and Hold It Accountable at the Same Time
---
 
There are some things that are common sense.

Striving for Gold Standard Science – that all science should be
reproducible, open and transparent, free from conflicts of interest, and
collaborative – is among them. As OSTP Director Michael Kratsios wrote
in an [op-ed
today](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adz9562), ***“Science
and politics need not be in conflict. Ensuring that the science used in
decisions conforms to the highest standards of research integrity makes
these judgments themselves transparent and scientific.”***

Yet some within the science community put partisanship before
professionalism when it comes to the commonsense principles of Gold
Standard Science – for no reason other than politics.

As Science journals Editor-in-Chief Holden Thorp put it in a [piece
today](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adz9553): ***“it is
possible to support science and hold it accountable at the same
time.”***

***“..The defensiveness of investigators and institutions in responding
to problems severely heightens the suspicion. Rather than filing
lawsuits and hiding behind carefully crafted statements, the scientific
community should be engaging in a conversation about problems and
potential solutions.”***

This is exactly why President Trump signed his Restoring Gold Standard
Science executive order. President Trump wants America to return to the
standard of excellence our scientific community is historically known
for.

The simple truth is that there is a disconnect between the American
people and the scientific enterprise. It’s a relationship that needs to
be rebuilt.

Now is the time to work with the Administration towards a solution.
