title: "President Trump\u2019s Leadership, Vision Drives NATO Breakthrough"
---
 
In a defining moment for global security, President Donald J. Trump
achieved a monumental victory for the United States and its allies,
brokering an historic deal to dramatically increase defense
contributions across the NATO alliance — and marking a new era of shared
responsibility and strength against global threats.

**The agreement was met with widespread praise at home and across the
world.**

[NATO Secretary General Mark
Rutte](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_236505.htm#:~:text=No%2C%20I%20don%27t,all%20the%20praise.):
“Would you ever think that this would be the result of this summit if he
would not have been re-elected president? … I think he deserves all the
praise.”

[Finnish President Alexander
Stubb](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1938269374596456898): “We’re
witnessing the birth of a new NATO … This is a big win, I think, for
both President Trump and I think it’s also a big win for Europe.”

[Polish President Andrzej
Duda](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1938254911222743139):
“Without the support and without the leadership of Donald Trump, it
would be impossible.”

[Estonian Prime Minister Kristen
Michal](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1938255096560947600): “It’s
a historic moment that we will be ramping up defense expenditure to five
percent. I strongly, and Estonia strongly, support it.”

[Finnish Minister for Foreign Affairs Elina
Valtonen](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1938252204177060009): “I
think he’s exactly right when he says that Europe needs to spend more.”

[European Union foreign policy chief Kaja
Kallas](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1938253716517490890):
“Allies seem to be united. I think the understanding is everybody needs
to do more for defense because we are living in very turbulent times.”

[Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs Radosław
Sikorski](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1938265677548425241): “We
should give credit where credit is due. President Trump was right in his
first term when he said that allies were not fulfilling their own
commitments from previous summits.”

[CNN’s Joseph Ataman and Clare
Sebastian](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/25/europe/rutte-daddy-trump-nato-ukraine-intl-latam):
“A diplomatic masterstroke.”

[POLITICO.eu](https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-defense-spending-deal-win-us-donald-trump/):
“Big win for Trump”

[Associated
Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-nato-defense-ukraine-143b53c6429e8de256c8ce0b97fdcd7f#:~:text=After%20less%20than%2024%20hours%20on%20the%20ground%20in%20the%20Netherlands%2C%20Trump%20headed%20back%20to%20Washington%20having%20secured%20a%20major%20policy%20change%20he%E2%80%99s%20pushed%20for%20since%202017%3A%20a%20significant%20boost%20in%20defense%20spending%20by%20other%20NATO%20countries%20whom%20the%20president%20has%20for%20years%20accused%20of%20freeloading%20off%20the%20United%20States.):
“After less than 24 hours on the ground in the Netherlands, Trump headed
back to Washington having secured a major policy change he’s pushed for
since 2017: a significant boost in defense spending by other NATO
countries.”

“It’s something that Trump is going to tout as an achievement, and he
wouldn’t be wrong in doing so … It was clear that Trump is the mover and
shaker and that he sets the tone and agenda.”

**A bipartisan group of lawmakers also hailed the news:**

[Speaker Mike
Johnson](https://x.com/SpeakerJohnson/status/1937960004574748907): “NATO
countries bumping defense funding from less than 2% to 5%! No more free
rides for the rest of the world. No more using the American taxpayer as
their own personal piggy banks. THIS is the Trump effect.”

[Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Jim
Risch](https://x.com/SenateForeign/status/1937943645019378077): “@NATO’s
commitment to raise defense spending to 5% is a tremendous achievement.
Thank you to @realDonaldTrump, @SecGenNATO, and our allies who worked to
achieve this outcome. New investments in defense and industrial
cooperation will strengthen the core pillar of NATO. Now, we must
continue to push forward as an alliance and focus on the task of
fulfilling this pledge.”

[Sen. Ted Budd](https://x.com/SenTedBuddNC/status/1937971262493479180):
“Thanks to @POTUS, our NATO Allies have agreed to an increased annual
defense investment of 5% of GDP — long the target. It’s about time
Europe pays its fair share for our collective defense. Investments in
military capabilities will enhance deterrence amid rising threats.”

[Sen. Bill
Cassidy](https://x.com/SenBillCassidy/status/1937985402142343229): “A
stronger alliance makes for a safer world. President Trump successfully
pushed our NATO allies to increase their investment in defense spending
from 2% to 5% of GDP. When America is strong, the world is safer.”

[Sen. Chris
Coons](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/25/world/europe/nato-increase-military-spending-trump.html#:~:text=The%20summit%20won,our%20collective%20security.%E2%80%9D):
“This will be remembered as a landmark summit. The agreement to spend 5
percent is a significant step forward toward a shared commitment to our
collective security.”

[Sen. John Cornyn](https://x.com/JohnCornyn/status/1938184992330313808):
“Astonishing news out of the NATO summit: Allies have agreed to devote
5% of their economies to military spending, up from the current 2%
floor.”

[Sen. Ted Cruz](https://x.com/SenTedCruz/status/1937906937904926940):
“NATO’s commitment to step forward and invest more would’ve never
happened without President Trump’s leadership. Strong American
leadership has returned.”

[Sen. Steve
Daines](https://x.com/SteveDaines/status/1937947185703747843): “A strong
President and a strong America makes a difference yet again on the world
stage: Nearly every NATO nation is pledging to increase defense spending
to 5% of their GDP. The world is safer today thanks to @POTUS.”

[Sen. Lindsey
Graham](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1937907191123447934):
“Congratulations to President Trump and his team on a highly successful
NATO summit. Virtually all NATO nations pledging to increase defense
spending to 5% of their GDP is historic and a game changer, making the
alliance stronger and America safer. Thank you to our NATO allies and
well done, @POTUS.”

[Sen. John
Kennedy](https://x.com/SenJohnKennedy/status/1937990291421859867):
“President Trump has awakened our NATO friends from their slumber—and
they’re finally taking their defense spending goals more seriously.”

[Sen. Dave
McCormick](https://x.com/SenMcCormickPA/status/1938216243623817597): “In
2014, just three of NATO’s member countries met the 2% of GDP defense
spending commitment. Thanks to the leadership of @POTUS, that number is
now 23. The declaration to raise spending to 5% by 2035 will ensure the
future needs of the transatlantic alliance are met and that our allies
are paying their fair share.”

[Sen. Rick
Scott](https://x.com/SenRickScott/status/1937830867193270508): “Great to
see @POTUS’ leadership and great success recognized by @SecGenNATO!
Thanks to President Trump, peace through strength is BACK, and our NATO
allies are paying their fair share to keep the world safe.”

[Sen. Dan
Sullivan](https://x.com/SenDanSullivan/status/1937986067187306954):
“I’ve long said our NATO allies need to pay their fair share and I’m
thankful President Trump is finally getting them to pony up.”

[Sen. Thom
Tillis](https://x.com/SenThomTillis/status/1937865006466695202): “This
is great news. For NATO to be successful, it is important for our allies
and partners to pay their fair share of dues. Yet another victory
secured under @POTUS Trump!”

[Sen. Todd
Young](https://x.com/SenToddYoung/status/1937998767371829390): “NATO is
important to our global security and stability, but the U.S. cannot
shoulder the majority of the burden given the threats we face. Today,
our allies committed to contributing more to our common defense. Thank
you, @POTUS, for leading the way.”

[Rep. Mike Bost](https://x.com/RepBost/status/1938267307618230700):
“President Trump has made clear that all freedom loving nations have a
responsibility to shoulder the load for protecting our values in a
dangerous world. For far too long, the United States carried a
disproportionate financial weight at NATO, while allies failed to pay
their fair share. But that changed yesterday. Thanks to President
Trump’s bold leadership, NATO countries almost universally have
committed to increasing their defense spending to 5% of GDP by 2035.
This is a major victory for American taxpayers and a safer world.”

[Rep. Ken Calvert](https://x.com/KenCalvert/status/1938277220122038688):
“NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte is absolutely correct. President
Trump’s leadership is responsible for strengthening NATO, getting our
European allies to expand their commitments, and improve the security of
our important alliance.”

[Rep. Eli Crane](https://x.com/RepEliCrane/status/1938222153226215751):
“The free ride is over.”

[Rep. Neal
Dunn](https://x.com/DrNealDunnFL2/status/1937876293296758987): “@NATO

GDP. This represents the most decisive move by our allies in more than a
decade. With this action, the Alliance will be stronger than ever!”

[Rep. Pat
Fallon](https://x.com/RepPatFallon/status/1937891264122249468): “A
stronger NATO will stop future conflicts before they start.”

[Rep. Carlos A.
Gimenez](https://x.com/RepCarlos/status/1937858991272386786): “After
four years of Biden-Harris failures, the United States is respected once
again on the world stage. Thank you, @POTUS”

[Rep. Mark
Green](https://x.com/RepMarkGreen/status/1938278149009047866): “The fact
that nearly all of our NATO allies agreed to increase defense spending
to 5% is a major victory for President Trump. This shift in
burden-sharing will ensure that the United States and our allies are
greater prepared to deter Chinese, Russian, and Iranian aggression.”

[Rep. Lance
Gooden](https://x.com/Lancegooden/status/1937951624648925576): “✅ NATO

what is necessary to counter our adversaries. Thank you @POTUS for
leading the charge!”

[Rep. Wesley Hunt](https://x.com/RepWPH/status/1938287168247808075):
“Huge win for the United States comes following the NATO meeting. Other
countries will now contribute 5% toward NATO! The United States will no
longer fund the security of the entire world. President Trump is putting
America FIRST!”

[Rep. Jim
Jordan](https://x.com/Jim_Jordan/status/1937912892395033037): “Thank
goodness we had President Trump at the NATO Summit instead of President
Biden. America is back and more powerful on the world stage!”

[Rep. Frank
Lucas](https://x.com/RepFrankLucas/status/1937957993221357759): “At
today’s NATO summit, @POTUS displayed to the world America’s renewed and
rightful place as the dominant global superpower. He delivered peace to
a region plagued by conflict, leant needed support to our friends in
Israel, and instilled fear in our adversaries. I thank President Trump
for his continued legacy of peacebuilding and for reinforcing that peace
through strength is a necessary component of American foreign policy.”

[Rep. Michael
McCaul](https://x.com/RepMcCaul/status/1937984784426262867): “For too

Trump is making sure Americans no longer have to foot the bill for other
nation’s defense. America First”
