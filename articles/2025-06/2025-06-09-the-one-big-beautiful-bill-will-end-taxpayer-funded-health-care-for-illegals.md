title: The One Big Beautiful Bill Will END Taxpayer-Funded Health Care for Illegals
---
 
More than [1.4
million](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/05/15/democrat-messaging-falters-as-they-ask-constituents-to-foot-medicaid-costs-for-1-4-million-illegal-aliens/)
illegal immigrants — including cold-blooded criminals, like [those
arrested this
weekend](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/06/president-trump-is-stepping-up-where-democrats-wont/)
in Los Angeles — are currently on Medicaid, stealing taxpayer-funded
health care benefits meant for American citizens.

**The One Big Beautiful Bill puts a stop to that.** By passing the One
Big Beautiful Bill, Medicaid will be protected for generations of
American citizens — thwarting Democrats’ attempts at destroying it by
funding benefits for illegals on the backs of hardworking American
taxpayers.

Of course, the One Big Beautiful Bill does even more to make good on
President Trump’s commitment to American citizens by [fully

border security — providing for 10,000 new ICE personnel and 3,000 new
Border Patrol agents to detain and deport at least one million criminal
illegal immigrants annually and

annual bonuses in each of the next four years to our frontline heroes.

**Promises made, promises kept.**
