title: 'MEMO: The One Big Beautiful Bill Improves the Fiscal Trajectory'
---
 
**TO:** White House Communications Staff  
**FROM:** Office of Management and Budget Staff  
**SUBJECT:** The One Big Beautiful Bill Improves the Fiscal Trajectory

**Topline:** The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) significantly
improves our nation’s fiscal trajectory by including $1.7 trillion in
mandatory savings—the most in United States history—and unleashing
economic growth with the implementation of President Trump’s tax
policies. Upon enactment of the OBBB, the Trump Administration will have
embarked on actions that reduce deficits by at least $6.6 trillion over
10 years.

**Highest Level of Mandatory Savings in History:** The OBBB dwarfs the
mandatory savings included in the high-profile deficit reduction bills
of the past. Specifically, it achieves substantially more mandatory
spending reductions than the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 ($140
billion), the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 ($800 billion), the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 ($370 billion), and the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1990 ($440 billion) on an inflation adjusted
basis.

**The One Big Beautiful Bill Reduces the Deficit:** There is no
political universe in which Republicans in Congress would allow a 40%
tax hike by not extending the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA). The
Congressional Budget Office (CBO), using conventions that ignore
political reality, estimated the effects of the TCJA continuation
relative to a baseline that assumed the TCJA would expire, thereby
raising taxes by almost $3.8 trillion. An honest portrayal of current
future deficits adjusts for the continuation of the TCJA:

</figure>

On its own, the OBBB reduces the deficit by over $1.4 trillion. Net
mandatory savings of $1.7 trillion are partly offset by increases in
one-time spending to finally and fully secure the border to defend our
Nation from invasion, and to lower taxes from policies such as no tax on
tips or overtime that are partly offset with loophole closers in the tax
code. The net deficit reduction totals $1.407 trillion, as shown below:

</tr>
</tbody><tfoot>
<tr class="even">

<td><strong>($1,407)</strong></td>
</tr>
</tfoot>

</table>
</figure>

It is important to note that the $1.7 trillion in mandatory savings are
permanent changes in law, which will continue to yield savings long into
the future.

**Trump Administration Policies Cut the Deficit Sharply:** OBBB is just
one aspect—albeit a significant one—of the Trump Administration’s
deficit reduction strategy, which includes increased tariff revenues,
significant discretionary spending cuts, and reversing Biden
administration policies that expanded welfare benefits through
regulations. Including those items, the Administration has in less than
five months started deficit reduction that could exceed $6.7 trillion
over 10 years:

</tfoot>

</table>
</figure>

The reduction in deficits will be even larger if—as the Administration
expects—economic growth from low taxes, regulatory relief, reciprocal
trade, unleashing American energy and cutting spending is significantly
higher than projected by the CBO.

**Bottom Line:** While there is more work to be done to deliver on
President Trump’s commitment to balance the budget, doing so is not
possible without enactment of the OBBB.
