title: Lower Gas Prices Just in Time for Summer Holiday Travel
---
 
Gas prices are falling as millions of Americans hit the road for the
holiday weekend.

**According to**
[**CNBC**](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/28/gas-prices-will-be-the-cheapest-theyve-been-in-years-expert-says.html)**,
“gas is the cheapest it’s ever been.”** Inflation-adjusted gas prices
“are near the lowest levels we’ve seen in the last 20 years” — and with
[rising
incomes](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/06/icymi-blue-collar-wage-growth-sees-largest-increase-in-nearly-60-years-under-trump/),
“Americans are actually spending far less of their income on energy than
they have in quite some time.”

**The good news is being felt across the nation:**

    “If you’re driving, you could be in for a pleasant surprise at the
    pump.”
-   [**New York City, New
    York**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1939676184251424929)**:**
    “It looks like gas prices are about to get cheaper.”
-   [**Toledo,
    Ohio**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1939675728628305956)**:**
    “Summer gas prices are at a surprising four-year low.”
-   [**Columbia, South
    Carolina**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1939680872174915834)**:**
    “If you’re planning to hit the road ahead of the 4th of July

    2021.”
-   [**Jacksonville,
    Florida**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1939681298408194267)**:**
    “Some good news for gas prices — they continue to fall ahead of the
    4th of July holiday.”
-   [**Macon,
    Georgia**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1939681735030997091)**:**
    “If you’re planning to travel this week, gas prices in our area are

    Republic***](https://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/economy/2025/06/30/what-will-affect-gas-prices-in-arizona/84357849007/)***:***“Arizona
    motorists are seeing a relatively cheap summer at the gas pump,
    despite recent conflicts abroad.Oil prices have fluctuated since the
    start of the Israel-Iran war earlier this month. But gas prices have
    remained relatively steady across the nation — and have largely
    declined in Arizona.”

    “They’re pretty low — and they’re trending lower … This would be the
    lowest on Fourth of July for gas since at least 2021 — perhaps even
    since 2020 during COVID. Of course, people are making more money, on
    average, than they did back then, so on an inflation-adjusted basis,
    gasoline is swallowing up a smaller and smaller chunk of paychecks.”

    “Most people traveling right now are traveling by road. Gas prices —
    $3.18/gallon right now, that’s the national average for regular
    unleaded. Last year, that was $3.49/gallon — so significantly
    lower.”

    cooling off. This summer could bring the lowest gas prices in
    years.”

    prices … The last time the cost for drivers was lower in late June
    was in 2021.”

    “The national average for a gallon of regular gasoline, $3.21, is
    about 23 cents cheaper than this time last year … Reduced prices
    would be a boon for consumers during the warmer months when
    Americans drive more. Low energy prices so far this year have
    already contributed to the economy’s resilience and helped keep
    inflation in check.”

    “Looking at gas prices that are the best in four years — and this is
    so important for all of those millions of people who will be hitting
    the roads … 20 cents less than it was a year ago, so that’s six or
    seven bucks extra when you fill up. That’s real money.”
