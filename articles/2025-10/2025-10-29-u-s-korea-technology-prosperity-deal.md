*Recognizing* the importance of deepening ties with strategic partners
across the Pacific as a means to strengthen stability in the region,  
* *  
Have reached the following understandings:  
  
**I. Purpose**  
The purpose of this Memorandum of Understanding (hereinafter “MOU”) is
to enable collaboration towards joint opportunities of mutual interest
in strategic science and technology disciplines.  
  
**II. Areas of Cooperation**  
The Participants aim to collaborate in a number of disciplines,
including but not limited to the following:  
  
**Accelerating AI Adoption and Innovation**  
*AI promises a new Golden Age of Innovation by empowering individuals
and supercharging progress across sectors like healthcare, advanced
manufacturing, and education. The Participants intend to collaborate
closely on developing pro-innovation AI policy frameworks, promoting the
export of trusted AI technology stacks, developing AI-ready datasets,
strengthening the enforcement of technology protection measures,
advancing shared work on industry standards, and fostering our
children’s digital wellbeing. Focus areas for collaboration are intended
to include:*

-   Driving innovative research and development to accelerate the
    application of AI for science, advanced manufacturing,
    biotechnology, and related fields, including through use-inspired
    research opportunities, such as those supported through the U.S.
    National Science Foundation, the National Research Foundation of
    Korea, Institute of Information and Communication Technology
    Planning and Evaluation, and other relevant science funders;
-   Championing pro-innovation AI policy frameworks and efforts to
    support AI technology adoption;
-   Working together to promote U.S. and Korean AI exports across the
    full stack of AI hardware, models, software, applications, and
    standards;
-   Exploring collaboration on AI export deals across Asia and beyond to
    drive the adoption of a shared AI ecosystem in the region;
-   Partnering to strengthen the enforcement of existing AI compute
    protection measures and to discuss the alignment of protection
    measures for critical and emerging technologies;
-   Promoting mutual understanding of guidelines and frameworks for AI
    adoption from the respective Participants, to foster the
    harmonization of practices that encourage interoperability;
-   Collaborating to reduce operational burdens for innovators and
    technology companies, with particular attention to removing barriers
    to innovative, trusted, and privacy-preserving data hosting
    architectures, and ensuring a conducive environment for digital
    application platforms;
-   Advancing and refocusing the partnership between the U.S. Center for
    AI Standards and Innovation and the Korea AI Safety Institute
    towards a shared mission to promote secure AI innovation, including
    through working towards best practices in metrology for AI, industry
    standards development, and improving understanding of both advanced
    AI models and sector-specific applications to drive continued AI
    adoption; and
-   Engaging in discussions to promote education, innovation, and
    technology for children to flourish in the digital era and prepare
    future generations for the workplace of tomorrow, including by
    participating in the Fostering the Future Together global initiative
    established by First Lady Melania Trump.

**Trusted Technology Leadership**  
*The Participants intend to enhance longstanding collaboration on key
technologies and practices to enable technology leadership in the global
arena, including:*

-   **Research Security**  
    Recognizing the importance of shared research security across
    critical and emerging technology research and development, the
    Participants intend to deepen collaboration to protect their
    technologies and their people. The Participants intend to
    collaborate on research security and identify and mitigate threats
    to the research enterprise including: supporting capacity building
    for universities, research organizations, and industry;
    strengthening collaboration in threat analysis in key technology
    areas; and leading allies and partners to adopt similarly rigorous
    practices to facilitate a trusted ecosystem of innovation.
-   **Advanced Radio Access Networks and 6G**  
    Expanding their partnership in telecommunications innovation and
    supply chain resilience, the Participants intend to collaborate on
    building a trusted, interoperable supply chain and enable joint
    research and development in 6G-relevant technologies. This work is
    intended to be supported by joint efforts in standards bodies and
    partnership with industry to shape global telecommunications
    standards in line with the Participants’ shared priorities.
-   **Securing Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology Supply Chains**  
    Highlighting the need to secure their mutual pharmaceutical and
    biotechnology supply chains, intellectual property, and innovation
    ecosystem, the Participants intend to accelerate progress towards
    the identification and remediation of vulnerabilities. The
    Participants intend to collaborate on supply chain security
    throughout all phases of research and development and across
    academic, government, and industry stakeholders, including contract
    research organizations and contract development and manufacturing
    organizations, to support resilient and healthy economies.
-   **Leading Quantum Innovation**  
    Positioning the Participants to be at the forefront of quantum
    innovation while safeguarding critical capabilities, the
    Participants intend to advance trusted and interoperable standards
    for quantum technologies, deepen partnerships between leading
    quantum institutions, and secure the quantum supply chain to foster
    a robust and reliable quantum ecosystem.
-   **Basic Research and STEM Exchange**  
    The Participants intend to strengthen the foundation for bilateral
