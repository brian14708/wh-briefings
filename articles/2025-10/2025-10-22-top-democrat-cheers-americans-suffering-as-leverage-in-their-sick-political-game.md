**Americans’ pain is Democrats’ leverage,** [**according to Rep.
Katherine
Clark**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1981028917789028814)**,
the number two House Democrat:** *“There will be families that are going
to suffer… but it is one of the few leverage times we have.”*

**As Democrats gleefully wield the suffering of Americans as a weapon in
their demented political games, they’ve plunged the nation into chaos.**
More than a million federal employees [aren’t getting
paid](https://thehill.com/homenews/5565204-these-workers-wont-get-paid-friday-if-the-government-shutdown-continues/),
Americans are facing [excruciating
delays](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2025/10/20/government-shutdown-flight-delays-faa-staffing/86799722007/)
at airports, food stamp funding is [drying
up](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1978865799059165440), small
businesses are [teetering on
collapse](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/20/small-businesses-pause-hiring-amid-shutdown),
and tourists are [shut
out](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/12/arts/smithsonian-museums-shutdown.html)
of their nation’s capital.

****Democrats aren’t just ignoring the fallout they’ve unleashed,
they’re celebrating it as they attempt to**
[**appease**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/09/poll-most-americans-say-no-as-radical-left-drives-democrat-shutdown/)
**their Radical Left base. Their own words expose their depravity:****

-   [Sen. Chuck
    Schumer](https://x.com/PressSec/status/1976255131604627497): “Every
    day gets better for us”
-   [Sen. Bernie
    Sanders](https://x.com/kaitlancollins/status/1975486253832241483):
    “\[If\] you reopen the government and we lose our leverage…”
-   [Sen. Martin
    Heinrich](https://x.com/SenateGOP/status/1980674193957032322): “That
    just gives the President more leverage” if we vote to pay troops,
    TSA agents, or law enforcement.
-   [Unnamed Democrat
    Senator](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5561362-liberal-base-backlash-democrats/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CPeople%20are%20going%20to%20get%20hammered%E2%80%9D%20if%20they%20vote%20for%20the%20House%2Dpassed%20bill%20to%20reopen%20the%20government%20and%20keep%20it%20funded%20through%20Nov.%2021%2C%20said%20one%20Democratic%20senator%20who%20requested%20anonymity%20to%20talk%20candidly%20about%20their%20party.):
    “People are going to get hammered” if they vote for the House-passed
    bill to reopen the government.
-   [Unnamed Democrat
    Senator](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5561362-liberal-base-backlash-democrats/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20would%20have%20enough%20votes%E2%80%9D%20to%20reopen%20the%20government%20%E2%80%9Cif%20people%20were%20not%20terrified%20of%20getting%20the%20guillotine%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20second%20person%20said.):
    “We would have enough votes if people were not terrified of getting
    the guillotine.”

    Aide](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/politics/democrats-congress-shutdown-military-pay#:~:text=Another%20senior%20Democratic%20aide%20said%20as%20long%20as%20public%20perception%20is%20in%20their%20favor%2C%20the%20party%20will%20not%20concede%20short%20of%20%E2%80%9Cplanes%20falling%20out%20of%20the%20sky.%E2%80%9D):
    “The party will not concede short of ‘planes falling out of the
    sky.’”

**This is Democrats’ disgusting playbook: inflict maximum pain on
Americans to cling to power.** While President Trump takes decisive
action to ensure service members [get
paid](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-signs-order-pay-troops-during-us-government-shutdown-2025-10-15/) and
critical nutrition assistance programs for low-income women and
children [remain
funded](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/07/white-house-wic-funding-tarriffs-fix-shutdown),
unhinged Democrats are doing [anything they
can](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/15/trump-wic-soldier-troop-pay-democrats-illegal#:~:text=What%20they%27re%20saying,Himes%20(D%2DConn.).)
to stop him.

Don’t be fooled: the Democrat Shutdown isn’t about an honest policy
dispute. It’s a malicious, calculated, twisted assault on our nation and
its citizens — and Democrats must end it.
