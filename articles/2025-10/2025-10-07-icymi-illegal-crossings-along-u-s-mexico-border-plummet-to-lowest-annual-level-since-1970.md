**President Donald J. Trump’s relentless commitment to securing our
homeland has crushed illegal crossings at the southern border to the**
[**lowest level in over 50
years**](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/illegal-crossings-immigration-us-mexico-southern-border-lowest-level-1970-trump-dhs/)
**— another historic victory for American sovereignty and safety under
President Trump’s leadership.**

After Biden-era chaos unleashed a record-shattering invasion, the
seismic turnaround proves that strong leadership can, in fact, stop the
flood of illegal crossings, deadly cartels, and security threats dead in
their tracks.

**According to CBS News:**

*“Unlawful crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border in fiscal year 2025
plummeted to the lowest annual level since the early 1970s, amid the
Trump administration’s sweeping clampdown on illegal immigration,
internal federal statistics obtained by CBS News show.*

*U.S. Border Patrol agents recorded nearly 238,000 apprehensions of
migrants crossing the southern border illegally in fiscal year 2025…*

*It also represents a seismic change from the record-high levels of
Border Patrol apprehensions recorded under the Biden administration,
which faced an unprecedented humanitarian crisis at the U.S.-Mexico
border. In fiscal year 2022, Border Patrol made 2.2 million
apprehensions there — a record, and almost 10 times the levels recorded
in 2025.*

*More than 60% of the apprehensions made by Border Patrol in fiscal year
2025 along the U.S.-Mexico border were recorded in the last full three
months of the Biden administration… Over President Trump’s first full
eight months in office, Border Patrol agents assigned to the southern
border have recorded fewer than 9,000 apprehensions each month — a
number that the agency recorded in 24-hour periods during some days
under former President Joe Biden.”*
