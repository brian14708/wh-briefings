title: "Democrat Shutdown Jeopardizes America\u2019s Skies"
---
 
**Democrats’ reckless government shutdown — now dragging into its third
week — has plunged America’s air traffic control system towards a
tailspin.** While Democrats play political roulette in service of their
demented agenda, the nation’s [13,000 air traffic
controllers](https://x.com/SecDuffy/status/1980620221082677638) —
dedicated patriots keeping our skies safe — are left to scrape by
without paychecks or [take on second
jobs](https://fortune.com/2025/10/20/air-traffic-controllers-gig-jobs-uber-government-shutdown/)
simply to make ends meet.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy took to Capitol Hill today to expose
the fallout of the Democrat-driven crisis, which threatens to upend
Americans’ travel plans and even the future of American aviation itself:

-   **Controllers’ anger boils over:** “They’re angry… They’re
    frustrated that the Congress — at least in the Senate — is focused
    on paying for health care benefits for illegals as opposed to paying
    their paychecks for the great work that they provide to the American
    people.”

-   **Workers abandoned without paychecks:** “Next Tuesday is the first
    paycheck that they will not receive for the work that they did in
    October… I don’t want my air traffic controllers to take a second
    job… I want them coming to their facilities and controlling the
    airspace, but they’re having to make decisions about how they spend
    their time to make sure they put food on their table.”

-   **Flight disruptions threaten holiday travel:** “I can’t guarantee
    you that your flight’s going to be on time. I can’t guarantee you
    that your flight’s not going to be cancelled. It’s going to depend
    on our air traffic controllers coming in to work every single day…
    If they do not, we’ll know whose fault it is.”

-   **Recruitment crisis looms:** “They’re thinking about leaving the
    Academy — smart young men and women — because they don’t want to
    work for a system that won’t pay them, that doesn’t guarantee them a
    paycheck… Problems that ricochet in the months and the years to
    come.”

Each day Democrats delay in doing their jobs is another betrayal to the
hardworking Americans who keep our nation moving — but Democrats don’t
care so long as they can [use them as
“leverage”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/10/top-democrat-cheers-americans-suffering-as-leverage-in-their-sick-political-game/)
in their sick political games.
