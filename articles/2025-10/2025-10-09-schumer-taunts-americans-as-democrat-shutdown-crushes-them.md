title: Schumer Taunts Americans as Democrat Shutdown Crushes Them
---
 
**Chuck Schumer’s disgusting claim that “**[**every day gets
better**](https://x.com/PressSec/status/1976255131604627497)**“ is a
sickening display of elitist indifference as the Democrat Shutdown
plunges hardworking Americans into anxiety, despair, and financial
ruin.** His arrogance lays bare the Democrats’ sick betrayal of service

excruciating delays.

**Democrats should listen to the Americans across the country paying the
price for their political games:**

-   **A military spouse whose** [**family is in
    crisis**](https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2025/10/01/government-shutdown-leaves-jacksonville-military-families-bracing-for-missed-paychecks-local-banks-are-ready-to-help/)
    **as service members go without pay:** “Definitely terrifying
    thinking in my head, ‘Oh God, how are we going to pay for our bills?
    How are we going to afford our rent? How are we going to pay for her
    formula, her diapers, everything?’ Our military, they’re the ones
    that sign the government contract to go fight for our country. But
    our lawmakers who are supposed to be in charge of our country, they
    aren’t really doing what’s best for the American people.”
-   **An air traffic controller who is** [**asked to
    fulfill**](https://nypost.com/2025/10/08/lifestyle/exhausted-unpaid-air-traffic-controllers-warn-of-danger-during-government-shutdown-were-drowning/)
    **their critical job responsibilities without the certainty of their
    next paycheck:** “The financial anxiety doesn’t just hurt morale; it
    directly affects safety. When someone responsible for thousands of
    lives a day is worrying about whether they can pay rent or feed
    their kids, focus suffers. Sometimes that small moment where your
    mind is elsewhere can have serious impacts. Controllers were already
    underwater with pay and staffing before the shutdown. Now, we’re
    drowning.”
-   **A** [**small business
    owner**](https://www.wsj.com/business/government-shutdown-businesses-781fcaa7?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAgBCiP4_yYGk5cdw0U1hVDAhN4-2ZiuFphbOT1fDwWd6kn5xyKthYJPNRYTT5g%3D&gaa_ts=68e7be3a&gaa_sig=oNz-Q1fj7HCqUkCKv99bvfnrljQz3_jSclO2tmZ3jfZER1DPS3dgcvWHwhDatxzQkUBtj19I9_jvdzVGVaXcHQ%3D%3D#:~:text=Small%20government%20subcontractors%20such,one%20of%20its%20projects.)
    **who has already laid off five of his 80 employees after the
    Democrat Shutdown triggered a stop-work order on one of his
    projects:** “That’s a very scary place to be in as an entrepreneur.”

    **for her family is in jeopardy as she stares down a loss of
    income:** “Stop this. Stop messing with people. We have families who
    depend on us… I don’t know how I’m going to feed my kids or pay my
    mortgage.”
-   **A hair salon owner whose** [**livelihood
    depends**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1975931487401984239)
    **on business from the large number of federal employees in the
    area:** “Whether I have clients or not, I still have to pay for the
    business. More people have been calling to reschedule or having to
    cancel their appointments because they don’t know if they’re going
    to get paid… If we don’t get clients, we don’t get paid.”
-   **A TSA agent who is** [**expected to
    work**](https://www.11alive.com/article/news/tsa-workers-at-hartsfield-jackson-continue-working-without-the-promise-of-a-paycheck/85-54d5b994-74a0-4aa8-9c4c-6d344503fb36)
    **without knowing when his next paycheck will come:** “Federal
    employees are feeling like pawns right now in the middle of a game.”
-   **A tourist whose trip to the nation’s capital is**
    [**dashed**](https://www.newsweek.com/dc-tourists-frustrated-as-federal-government-shutdown-impacts-their-visit-10848905)
    **by the closures of iconic government attractions:** “I’m really
    frustrated. I don’t see there’s any reason for it. I mean, the
    demolition of the core values of our society — it’s devastating.
    It’s sad.”
