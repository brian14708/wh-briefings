    infrastructure, hardware, models, software, applications, and
    related standards;
-   Partnering to ensure the rigorous enforcement of existing protection
    measures, strengthen protection measures related to critical and
    sensitive technologies, and enhance supply chain resilience for the
    AI tech stack;
-   Promoting mutual understanding of guidelines and frameworks for AI
    development and adoption from the respective Participants, with the
    goal of harmonizing practices as applicable to encourage
    interoperability;

    towards best practices in metrology for AI and industry standards
    development, improving understanding of both advanced AI models and
    sector-specific applications to drive continued AI adoption; and
-   Promoting education, innovation, and technology for children to
    flourish in the digital era and preparing future generations for the
    workplace of tomorrow.

**Trusted Technology Leadership**  
*The Participants intend to enhance longstanding collaboration on key
technologies and practices to enable technology leadership in the global
arena, including:*

-   **Research Security**  
    Recognizing the importance of shared research security goals across
    critical and emerging technology research and development, the
    Participants intend to deepen collaboration to protect their
    technologies and their people. The Participants intend to
    collaborate on research security and identify and mitigate threats
    to the research enterprise including through supporting capacity
    building for universities, research organizations, and industry; and
    collaborating with allies and partners to share similarly rigorous
    practices to facilitate a trusted ecosystem of innovation.
-   **Advanced Radio Access Networks, Beyond 5G/6G, and Connectivity**  
    Expanding their partnership in telecommunications innovation and
    supply chain resilience, the Participants intend to collaborate on
    building a trusted, interoperable supply chain, using advancements
    such as Open RAN and AI-RAN, through a partnership between the U.S.
    National Telecommunications and Information Administration and
    Japan’s Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications.
    Participants also intend to collaborate on all-photonics networks
    and quantum networks, and to enable joint research and development
    in Beyond 5G/6G-relevant technologies through the U.S. National
    Science Foundation and Japan’s National Institute of Information and
    Communications Technology, and other relevant agencies. This work is
    intended to be supported by joint efforts in standards bodies and in
    close partnership with industry, including in open testbeds, to
