title: "PORTLAND: Fake News Ignores Antifa Violence, Residents\u2019 Pleas for Help"

**For years, an**
[**Antifa-led**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/09/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-designates-antifa-as-a-domestic-terrorist-organization/#:~:text=Antifa%20has%20engaged,must%20be%20stopped.)** hellfire
has turned Portland into a wasteland of firebombs, beatings, and brazen
attacks on** [**federal officers and
property**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/09/president-trump-deploys-federal-resources-to-crush-violent-radical-left-terrorism-in-portland/)
**— yet the Fake News remains in** [**shameful
denial**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1975254876004491792)
**about the Radical Left’s reign of terror.**

That’s why, as President Donald J. Trump
[mobilizes](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1971945514678816887/) federal
resources to safeguard lives and property, the White House is [hosting
today](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/behind-scenes-trumps-anticipated-antifa-roundtable-cabinet-members)
the fearless independent journalists who have long risked their own
safety to shine a light on Portland’s descent into chaos.

**Of course, Portland’s own citizens — betrayed by their leaders — are
sounding the alarm loud and clear, demanding action while the Fake News
turns a blind eye:**

-   “It’s like a war zone. There are times I’ve had to have a gas mask
    on inside my own home,” [says a
    resident](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yenwklgdyo#:~:text=%22It%27s%20like%20a,mask%20to%20sleep.)
    near the ICE facility [under
    siege](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/09/president-trump-deploys-federal-resources-to-crush-violent-radical-left-terrorism-in-portland/)
    in south Portland. “\[Deploying the National Guard\] is one thing I
    support, as far as Trump is concerned, because the city is failing
    us and I don’t want to feel like I’m collateral damage — and my
    rights matter, too.”
-   “115 days of hell. I only come out during the day. You see all the
    black-covered Antifa people aren’t here. They come with the night,”
    [says another Portland
    resident](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yenwklgdyo#:~:text=%22I%20only%20come,from%20this%20earth.%22).
    “In the daytime, it’s all these little old senior people that think
    they’re changing the world before they pass from this earth.”
-   “Yesterday morning, I was broken into again for the tenth time,”
    [says a business owner in downtown
    Portland](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1975932630928707659).
    “We need help here and something needs to be done, so if \[the
    National Guard\] is what we need to do to get our leaders paying
    attention to what’s happening in Portland, then I think it’s a good
    thing. We’ve been struggling for a long time — since 2020.”
-   “We struggle every day, every week, with the crime and the drugs and
    just the unsafeness that comes with being here in our city right
    now. It’s like our leaders have abandoned public safety for us,”
    [says a Portland coffeeshop
    owner](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1975931897646891011).
-   “It may be the only way if our city and state governments are not
    willing to do their jobs… If city governments and police departments
    are not able to protect people, folks are going to look for
    protection from anywhere they can get it,” [says a Portland
    man](https://youtu.be/lBC3Z2REcxQ?si=xYn2ozegQf3ePI3g&t=164) who
    represents retailers ravaged by crime in the city. “For those people
    who do not want federal troops in our streets, I would say start
    clamoring for your local government to protect our property, our
    businesses, and our lives.”
-   “I kind of support it 110% just because I would like to see them
    clean up the city of Portland,” [says a resident of north
    Portland](https://youtu.be/lBC3Z2REcxQ?si=HU75IahTgOXYGBdj&t=125).
    “At least they can do something to help our city.”
-   “Look at our streets — there’s homelessness, they’re full of
    garbage, businesses are leaving. We are not a thriving city. Our
    city is falling. It’s horrible,” [says a Portland
    woman](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6380585990112).

**It’s obvious that what’s happening in Portland isn’t mere protest;
it’s premeditated anarchy — the latest chapter of violence in Portland
at the hands of Antifa and the Radical Left:**
