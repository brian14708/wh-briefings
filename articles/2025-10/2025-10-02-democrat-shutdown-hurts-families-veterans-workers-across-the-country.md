title: Democrat Shutdown Hurts Families, Veterans, Workers Across the Country
---
 
Democrats’ [reckless
push](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/10/fact-democrats-shut-down-government-over-free-healthcare-for-illegals/)
to hold the government hostage over free healthcare for illegal aliens
has forced a crippling shutdown — making essential workers and
servicemembers go unpaid, pushing vital programs like WIC to the brink,
and leaving key services unfunded.

**Across the country, the Radical Left’s political stunt is inflicting
pain:**

### **Arizona**

-   [**KVOA-TV**](https://www.kvoa.com/news/politics/what-is-impacted-locally-by-the-government-shutdown/article_ddd6e7f1-6a0c-472d-8674-aded05c05e9b.html)**:**
    “The VA will stop transition program assistance and career
    counseling, close GI Bill and National Cemetery hotlines and shut
    down benefits regional offices… Visitor services will be reduced,
    with park roads and trails generally remaining open but without
    regular maintenance. Special events requiring permits will be
    halted, and no new permits will be issued. Parks with insufficient
    funds will cease operations, suspending all non-essential
    activities.”

    effects of the shutdown could lead to backups at Phoenix Sky Harbor
    and will force the furlough of thousands of local federal employees…

    and air traffic controllers, will be forced to continue working
    throughout the shutdown, airport operations could be affected.”

    that the closure will last until further notice… The Ocmulgee Mounds
    in Macon is also closed during the tenure of the government
    shutdown.”
