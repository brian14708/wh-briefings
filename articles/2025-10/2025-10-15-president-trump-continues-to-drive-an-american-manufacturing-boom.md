title: President Trump Continues to Drive an American Manufacturing Boom
---
 
**Under President Donald J. Trump’s bold leadership, America’s
manufacturing sector is surging forward with unprecedented momentum.**
In the past week alone, major corporations have unveiled billions of
dollars in new investments to onshore production and create thousands of
high-quality American jobs — building on a wave of commitments that
underscore the Trump Administration’s vision for American economic
dominance.

    **a $13 billion investment in the U.S. — the largest single
    investment in the company’s history.** The automaker plans to expand
    its U.S.-based production by 50% over the next four years,
    re-opening its plant in Belvidere (Illinois), and adding production
    at its Toledo (Ohio), Warren (Michigan), Detroit (Michigan), and
    Kokomo (Indiana) plants. The investment will bring 5,000 new jobs
    and the production of five new vehicles to the U.S.

of other public and private
[investments](https://www.whitehouse.gov/investments/) made in the U.S.
since President Trump took office.

**It’s all part of President Trump’s commitment to revitalizing
manufacturing, onshoring production, and setting the stage for a new era
of American prosperity.** After years of career politicians selling out
American workers for cheap foreign labor, the historic level of
investment secured by the Trump Administration is reinforcing the U.S.
as the global leader of innovation and growth.
