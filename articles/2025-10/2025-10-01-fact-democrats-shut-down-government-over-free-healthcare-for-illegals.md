title: 'FACT: Democrats Shut Down Government Over Free Healthcare for Illegals'
---
 
Democrats and their Fake News allies want you to believe it’s all a lie
that Democrats shut down the government over free healthcare for illegal
aliens.

**Except that’s exactly what happened.** As Vice President JD Vance
[said](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1973369801843044740), *“It’s
not something that we made up. It’s not a talking point. It is in the
text of the bill that they initially gave to us to reopen the
government.”*

**As the White House makes clear in [a new
memo](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WFTCA-Illegal-Immigrant-Healthcare-Memo-FINAL.pdf),
Democrats’ unserious
[proposal](https://www.congress.gov/119/bills/s2882/BILLS-119s2882pcs.pdf#page=56)
takes extraordinary efforts to accommodate illegal aliens while
repealing reforms that strengthen healthcare for American citizens.**

### **Here’s what you need to know:**

-   **FACT:** Democrats’ proposal would result in nearly $200 billion
    spent on healthcare for illegal immigrants and other non-citizens
    over the next decade — enough to fund the entire Children’s Health
    Insurance Program.

-   **FACT:** Democrats’ proposal would once again allow those
    improperly granted asylum and parole under Biden’s open borders
    scheme to receive Medicaid.
-   **FACT:** Democrats’ proposal would require Medicaid to pay *more*
    for emergency care provided to illegal aliens than it does for
    American patients who are disabled, elderly, or children.
-   **FACT:** Democrats’ proposal would allow California to continue
    exploiting a loophole to fund Medicaid for illegal aliens.
-   **FACT:** Democrats’ proposal would reinstate a special Obamacare
    subsidy for non-citizens — for which low-income American citizens
    are not eligible.
-   **FACT:** Democrats’ proposal would repeal a generational $50
    billion investment in rural healthcare.
-   **FACT:** Democrats’ proposal would take Health Savings Accounts
    away from ten million American citizens.
