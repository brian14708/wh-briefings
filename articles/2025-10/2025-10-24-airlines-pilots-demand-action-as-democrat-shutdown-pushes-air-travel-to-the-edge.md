title: Airlines, Pilots Demand Action as Democrat Shutdown Pushes Air Travel to the
  Edge
---
 
As air traffic controllers and TSA agents work without paychecks and
widespread flight disruptions threaten to upend holiday travel,
Democrats’ shameful refusal to end their destructive government shutdown
is plunging the U.S. aviation system into chaos.

Now, the aviation industry is coming together to demand Democrats cease
the sick political gamesmanship and end their shutdown before the
full-blown crisis grounds the nation’s skies.

**The association representing the biggest U.S. airlines — including
American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, and United
Airlines — issued a new statement urging swift resolution through
Republicans’ clean, nonpartisan bill.**

-   **Airlines for America:** “At this time of record air travel and
    increased reliance on cargo shipments, stability and predictability
    for U.S. aviation are more important than ever. Missed paychecks for
    the federal employees charged with the safe and efficient
    facilitation of our national airspace unnecessarily increases stress
    for the thousands of air traffic controllers, TSA officers and CBP
    employees who work every day to keep aviation safe and secure.
    Aviation remains the safest mode of transportation in the world —
    but to maintain that record a system under stress must slow down,
    reducing efficiency and causing delays for travelers and shippers.
    We urge elected leaders to act with an appropriate sense of urgency
    to solve this problem and immediately reopen the federal government.
    The quickest and simplest way to ensure those critical employees are
    paid is by passing a clean CR. Congress recently made a significant
    downpayment on modernizing the FAA’s antiquated air traffic control
    system. The DOT has prioritized ‘supercharging’ hiring to get air
    traffic control facilities fully staffed, and the TSA continues to
    screen historically high numbers of travelers at checkpoints.
    Congress should build on these positive developments and ensure that
    commercial aviation can continue to drive the economy and connect
    Americans with the world.”

**the clean, nonpartisan continuing resolution.**

-   **Coalition of Airline Pilots Association:** “On behalf of the
    Coalition of Airline Pilots Associations (CAPA) and its 30,000
    members, we call on Congress to end the government shutdown by
    passing a clean Continuing Resolution. We as pilots adhere to strict
    procedures promoting safety as our most important priority. We have
    seen the stress and tension this year on the National Airspace
    System due to short-staffed air traffic controllers. This shutdown
    only compounds the pressures they face as they now report to work
    without a paycheck. It’s time to recognize their contributions,
    along with our colleagues at TSA, who ensure we fly in the safest
    skies every day with the trust of the American flying public.
    Congress must support these men and women by ending this shutdown
    immediately.”
-   **Allied Pilots Association President First Officer Nick Silva:**
    “Congress should reconvene and work in a bipartisan manner to pass a
    clean Continuing Resolution to fund and reopen the government. We
    stand with our brothers and sisters in air traffic control and TSA
    who continue to show up to work every day without a paycheck. These
    men and women take their oath seriously to guarantee a safe National
    Airspace System so we the pilots can ensure the flying public
    reaches their destinations in a timely manner and without harm. As
    the shutdown stretches on and airports encounter potential delays,
    it only intensifies the pressure these aviation professionals
    confront in the face of not getting paid. It’s time we support these
    men and women and reopen the federal government.”
-   **NetJets Association of Shared Aircraft Pilots President Capt.
    Pedro Leroux:** “How can we possibly expect our industry peers to be
    fully focused on their responsibilities – chief of which is keeping
    the flying public safe and secure – when many are likely wondering
    how long they are going to go without pay. And, more specifically,
    how do they continue to care for their families – to put food on the
    table? Our members rely on ATC, in particular, to provide critical
    direction and support during all phases of flight. Today is day 23
    of the shutdown, and the strain this is placing on all stakeholders
    – federal employees, flight crews and the traveling public is taking
    a toll. It is indisputable that our system is less safe today than
    it was on Oct. 1 when the shutdown began.”
-   [**Southwest Airlines Pilots Association President Capt. Jody
    Reven**](https://www.swapa.org/news/2025/press-release-swapa-statement-on-continued-government-shutdown/)**:**
    “Considering the strain on our nation’s aviation system, SWAPA
    strongly urges Congress to pass a clean Continuing Resolution to
    fund the government. Our air traffic controllers and the broader air
    traffic system are already operating under immense pressure — a
    government shutdown only compounds that stress and threatens the
    efficiency of our skies as we see the impact of reduced controller
    availability at facilities across the country. Likewise, TSA
    professionals continue to show up every day to safeguard the
    traveling public, even without pay. These men and women deserve our
    full support and the certainty of a paycheck.”

**They join other key industry leaders in calling on Democrats to
immediately end the shutdown and return the country to regular order.**

-   [**Air Line Pilots Association, International President Capt. Jason
    Ambrosi**](https://www.alpa.org/Press-Room/2025/10/Updated-ALPA-Statement-as-Shutdown-Enters-Third-Week)**:**
    “It is time for our leaders to come to the table in good faith to
    make a deal that will reopen the government. Airline pilots stand in
    solidarity with our brothers and sisters at NATCA and with all the
    federal workers who are continuing to work without a paycheck during
    this shutdown. The job of keeping aviation safe and secure is tough
    on an easy day, but forcing them to do it without pay undermines the
    safety and security of our entire system. We are at a critical
    moment in aviation safety, and we need our leaders to be focused on
    the necessary infrastructure and staffing improvements.”
-   [**National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Nick
    Daniels**](https://www.abc15.com/politics/the-president/shutdown-places-unacceptable-distractions-on-air-traffic-controllers-union-president-says)**:**
    “NATCA advocates for every excepted employee, every federal employee
    that’s out there, to be paid no matter what the circumstance, no
    matter what the shutdown. And we’re ensuring that our message is
    loud and clear. There’s one way to do it. And that’s by ending this
    shutdown and putting everybody back to work and having them
    compensated for the work they do day in and day out, especially air
    traffic controllers.”

**It’s hard to overstate the disastrous effects the Democrat Shutdown is
having on the aviation industry.** Every week the shutdown drags on, [$1
billion](https://www.ustravel.org/press/us-travel-association-americas-travel-economy-has-lost-1-billion-and-counting)
in travel-related spending is lost, while the nation’s
