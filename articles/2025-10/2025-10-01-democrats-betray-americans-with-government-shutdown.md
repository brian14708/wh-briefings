title: Democrats Betray Americans with Government Shutdown
---
 
Democrats have [officially brought
on](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1973166617946366142) a
full-blown government shutdown —
[engineered](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/09/poll-most-americans-say-no-as-radical-left-drives-democrat-shutdown/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20clear%20their%20deranged%2C%20Radical%20Left%20base%20is%20driving%20the%20Democrat%20Shutdown%3A)
by the Radical Left lunatics who control of their party.

**As the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans hang in the
balance, Chuck Schumer gives it two thumbs up:**

**The**
[**fallout**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1973368589081051585)
**from the Democrat Shutdown hits Americans where it hurts:** Critical
food assistance for low‑income women, infants, and children will lapse.
Americans will experience travel delays and disruptions to Social
Security services. Funding for inpatient home care and telehealth
services for Medicare patients will be suspended. The list is endless as
the effects ripple across all sectors of the American economy — and it’s
all Democrats’ fault.

**President Trump and Republicans have been clear: Republicans will**
[**not**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1973370695733109187) **be
held hostage by this unserious, shameful political gamesmanship by
Democrats.  **

This shutdown is 100% on Democrats, whose radical agenda is poisoning
our politics and punishing our people.
