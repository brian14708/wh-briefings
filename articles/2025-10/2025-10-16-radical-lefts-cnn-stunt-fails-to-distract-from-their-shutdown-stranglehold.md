title: "Radical Left\u2019s CNN Stunt Fails to Distract from Their Shutdown Stranglehold"
---
 
**Last night’s CNN clown show starring Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and
Crazy Bernie Sanders was nothing more than a desperate smokescreen to
hide the brutal reality of the Democrat Shutdown.** Make no mistake:
Chuck Schumer and his band of obstructionists — on orders from the
Radical Left lunatics [in
control](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/09/poll-most-americans-say-no-as-radical-left-drives-democrat-shutdown/)
of the party — deliberately shuttered the government to extort their
socialist agenda at the expense of hardworking Americans.

President Trump has taken decisive action to ensure service members [get
paid](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-signs-order-pay-troops-during-us-government-shutdown-2025-10-15/)
and critical nutrition assistance programs for low-income women and
children [remain
funded](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/07/white-house-wic-funding-tarriffs-fix-shutdown).
Meanwhile, unhinged Democrats are [threatening
litigation](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/15/trump-wic-soldier-troop-pay-democrats-illegal#:~:text=What%20they%27re%20saying,Himes%20(D%2DConn.).)
rather than doing what they were elected to do.

Their hypocrisy knows no bounds, even as workers go unpaid and essential
services grind to a halt — and last night’s spectacle only reinforced
how hypocritical Democrats really are.

### **Democrats can’t reconcile their** [**once-strenuous objections**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/09/democrats-threaten-a-shutdown-over-radical-left-insanity/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20particularly%20ironic%20considering%20these%20same%20Democrats%20once%20decried%20the%20stakes%20of%20a%20shutdown%20%E2%80%94%20which%20they%E2%80%99re%20doing%20right%20now%3A) **to shutting down the government.**

-   Not only did Crazy Bernie [have no
    answer](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1978631136931656039)
    for why he previously
    [called](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1972604951621935535) a
    government shutdown “a serious and dangerous action that we must do
    everything possible to prevent,” he [was left
    stuttering](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1978641695760662647)
    after a young man pointed out Chuck Schumer’s blistering hypocrisy.

### **Democrats are only interested in blaming Trump.**

-   Crazy Bernie [predictably
    bashed](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1978642717035958781)
    President Trump when a bartender told him she faces losing out on
    her dream home due to the Democrat Shutdown and the inability to
    process her USDA home loan.
-   Ocasio-Cortez
    [told](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1978630535778836575) a
    TSA employee — an essential worker who doesn’t know when her next
    paycheck will come — that “the best thing that we can do is to
    re-open the government.” What she didn’t mention, however, was that
    only Democrats can make that happen — and they’ve refused to do so
    ten times in a row.

### **Democrats can’t explain why they’re holding the government funding — or offer any solutions to the chaos they’ve unleashed.**

-   The pair
    [all-but-admitted](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1978633289742045298)
    they have no substantive answer on what, exactly, Democrats are
    demanding while they refuse to fund essential government services.
-   When an air traffic controller asked how Democrats expect them to
    pay for food when they aren’t receiving a paycheck, Ocasio-Cortez
    [ranted](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1978853342886375780)
    without saying anything.

### **Democrats really are completely unhinged.**

-   Crazy Bernie
    [called](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1978640477168578733)
    ICE raids — in which some of the most dangerous criminals on earth
    have been taken off American streets — “a movement toward
    authoritarianism.”
