title: Inflation Remains Low as Democrat Shutdown Threatens Progress

Today’s new Consumer Price Index reveals inflation

market expectations once again in September — with prices holding steady
and wages beating inflation as President Donald J. Trump ushers America
into a new Golden Age.

**Unfortunately, the Democrat Shutdown risks grinding that progress to a
halt.** Because surveyors cannot deploy to the field, the White House
has learned there will likely NOT be an inflation release next month for
the first time in history — depriving policymakers and markets of
critical data and risking economic calamity.

**Here’s what else you need to know:**

-   Inflation has remained steady since President Trump took office,
    averaging just 2.5% — compared to an average of 5% under Biden.
-   Real private sector wages are on track to rise by $1,151 (+1.8%)
    since President Trump took office — welcome relief after private
    sector wages declined by nearly $3,000 (-4.5%) under Biden.
-   Gasoline prices are on track for an annualized drop of 7.5% since
    President Trump took office — reversing an average annual increase
    of 7.7% under Biden.
-   Gas prices have approached their
    [lowest](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/10/gas-prices-hit-four-year-low-under-trump/)
    average levels in more than four years.
-   The 12-month change in overall shelter costs is at its lowest level
    in four years.
-   Costs are

    for motor vehicle insurance, used cars and trucks, communication
    commodities, propane, fresh fruits, nonprescription drugs, butter,
    apparel, and a host of other items — while egg prices are down 23.7%
    since President Trump took office.

    “These readings will also bolster the Trump administration’s
    argument that inflation is under control and tariffs aren’t
    triggering a cost-of-living surge.”

**Under President Trump, America is back — but inflation is not.**
