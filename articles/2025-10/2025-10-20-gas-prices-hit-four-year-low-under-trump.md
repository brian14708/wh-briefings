title: "Gas Prices Hit Four-Year Low Under President Trump \u26FD"
---
 
**Americans are seeing some of the lowest prices at the gas pump in more
than four years as President Donald J. Trump’s relentless commitment to
American energy production pays off.** GasBuddy
[reports](https://www.gasbuddy.com/go/national-average-falls-below-3-refinery-outage-in-midwest-may-hike-regional-gas-prices)
the nationwide average for gasoline has dropped to $2.98 per gallon —
the [lowest](https://x.com/GasBuddyGuy/status/1980267716029169954)
average intra-day price in four years — with prices expected to remain
that way for the foreseeable future.

*“Currently, 35 states have average gas prices below $2.99/gal, and
GasBuddy even recorded the first $1.99 cash price at a station in Evans,
Colorado, with stations in Oklahoma and Texas not far behind,”*
[according to
GasBuddy](https://www.gasbuddy.com/go/national-average-falls-below-3-refinery-outage-in-midwest-may-hike-regional-gas-prices#:~:text=Currently%2C%2035%20states,next%20few%20months.%E2%80%9D).
*“Barring any major disruptions, gas prices are likely to remain
slightly below year-ago levels and could stay under $3 for much of the
next few months.”*

**President Trump understands that energy dominance is a key driver for
growing our economy and lowering costs — making good on a promise he
repeatedly made on the campaign trail after years of Biden-induced
economic disaster.** In fact, under Biden, average gas prices remained
above $3 per gallon for nearly the

of his presidency.
