title: Trump Energy Agenda Driving Gas Prices Towards Four-Year Lows
---
 
**President Donald J. Trump’s commitment to unleashing American energy
production is bringing relief at the gas pump, with gas prices nearing a
four-year low across the country.**

AAA

the national average for regular gasoline is on track to dip below $3
per gallon for the first time since 2021, reflecting consistent declines
over the past week, month, and year. GasBuddy
[confirms](https://www.gasbuddy.com/go/gas-prices-plunge-toward-2-99-gal-as-oil-slips-below-60)
the trend, citing price declines in nearly every state — and predicting
some areas could even see prices “drop below $2 per gallon in the weeks
ahead.”

**The price decline is being reported in local outlets across the
country:**
