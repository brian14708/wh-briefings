title: 'Peace Through Strength: President Trump Launches Operation Epic Fury to Crush
  Iranian Regime, End Nuclear Threat'
---
 
**In a bold and necessary exercise of American strength, President
Donald J. Trump authorized Operation Epic Fury — a precise, overwhelming
military campaign to eliminate the imminent nuclear threat posed by the
Iranian regime, destroy its ballistic missile arsenal, degrade its proxy
terror networks, and cripple its naval forces.** This operation,
executed in partnership with regional allies, follows exhaustive
diplomatic efforts and comes after 47 years of Iranian aggression —
including attacks on U.S. citizens, sponsorship of global terrorism, and
brutal oppression of its own people.

“We want to say thank you to President Trump. This is the only person
who has supported us in the last 50 years.”
([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2027962925202252033))

“I don’t know how to thank President Trump. I am speechless.”
([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2027938051733741621))

“We are waking up to the hope that this is the dawn of a new season…
That we might actually see the people of Iran freed is just such an
incredible moment for us.”
([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2028124730285293733))

## **Top lawmakers rallied behind Operation Epic Fury on the Sunday morning talk shows:**

[Sen. Tom Cotton on State of the
Union](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2028113137342242971): “I
haven’t heard a single Arkansan express anything but unqualified support
for President Trump and for his decision to finally put America’s foot
down and end 47 years of terror and revolutionary violence by the
Islamic Republic against the United States and our citizens.”

[Sen. Lindsey Graham on Meet the
Press](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2028113630655283382?s=20):
“The mothership of terrorism is sinking. The captain is dead. The
largest state sponsor of terrorism — Iran — is close to collapsing. The
leader of the largest state sponsor of terrorism and his inner team are
dead… Well done, President Trump.”

[Sen. Ted Cruz on Face the
Nation](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2028144026864504890):
“President Trump’s decision to launch this decisive action against Iran
is the single most important decision of his presidency… Iran no longer
being led by a theocratic, murderous dictator — that makes America much,
much safer.”

[Sen. Dave McCormick on Fox News
Sunday](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2028118894498525686?s=20):
“The President acted completely within his Constitutional authority…
What we need to focus on now is continuing to support these great young
Americans that are carrying out this extraordinary mission.”

[Sen. Rick Scott on Sunday Morning
Futures](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2028134172464697560?s=20):
“I want to thank President Trump for having the guts to do this. This is
what other Presidents had not been willing to do… The world is a safer
place.”

[Rep. Brian Mast on Sunday Morning
Futures](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2028136285743743153):
“While maybe not surprising, but very troubling, is most Congressional
Democrats… are going to line up next week and say, ‘We don’t want the
President to have any authority to defend the United States of America
against the imminent threat of Iran.’”

[Rep. Anna Paulina Luna on CNN This
Morning](https://x.com/RepLuna/status/2028144864869621800?s=20): “We
cannot allow them to have a nuclear weapon. As you are seeing, they are
not people that you can negotiate with. They have been operating a
terrorist regime that has been responsible for killing thousands upon
thousands of Americans, not to mention their own people.”

## **Experts, commentators, and others are praising President Trump’s historic action:**

[New York Post Editorial
Board](https://nypost.com/2026/02/28/opinion/trumps-bold-move-to-rid-the-world-of-irans-evil-regime-once-and-for-all/):
“President Trump is taking decisive action instead of hoping to get away
with kicking the can further down the road — after weeks of seeking a
peaceful accommodation, indeed after months and (counting his first
term) years of proving to Iran’s rulers that Washington’s forbearance
was over… He is correct when he claims he is the only president willing
to make this generational move.”

*[The Wall Street Journal Editorial
Board](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/trump-enforces-his-red-line-on-iran-a2ad85ab?mod=e2tw)*:
“The U.S.-Israeli attack on Iran that began Saturday morning is a
necessary act of deterrence against a regime that is the world’s
foremost promoter of terrorism. It carries risks as all wars do, but it
also has the potential to reshape the Middle East for the better and
lead to a safer world.”

[Yorktown Institute President Seth
Cropsey](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/trumps-doctrine-in-iran-and-beyond-728db283?mod=WTRN_pos4):
“Again the president has acted decisively against an exposed partner of
the rival great powers. It did so in Venezuela. It’s doing so in Cuba.
Attacking Iran’s theocrats, ballistic-missile infrastructure and
command-and-control systems leaves the regime weaker than ever. The
assault on Iran, including an Israeli strike that reportedly killed
Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, also solidifies the Trump doctrine,
demonstrating the president’s willingness to use tailored, overwhelming
force to maximize deterrence and achieve long-term strategic benefits…
The Trump doctrine’s military components are one part of its
effectiveness. Donald Trump is another: He has proved to be the only
U.S. president willing to wage a true war of attrition against Tehran.
Both Trump administrations combined crippling sanctions with spectacular
displays of force. This strategy along with Israeli tenacity has left
the Islamic Republic in a state of headlong decline while hollowing out
its regional ‘axis of resistance.’ Operation Epic Fury creates an
opening to complete Iran’s strategic degradation.”

[Commentator Marc
Thiessen](https://x.com/marcthiessen/status/2027785532063838641?s=20):
“Donald Trump has just taken his place alongside Reagan & FDR as one of
the most consequential presidents in American history. Many have
occupied his office, but there are only a handful whose courageous
leadership has quite literally reshaped the world. There will be statues
of him from Caracas to Tehran. He is, as we speak, assuming his place in
the pantheon of our nations greatest leaders.”

[Former Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo](https://x.com/mikepompeo/status/2027787183671701565): “President
Trump has acted to do no less than to preserve Western civilization.
This has never been easy, nor will the days ahead be. But for 250 years,
America has been the most exceptional nation known to man. President
Trump’s actions today extend that role and protect America. God Bless
him and the United States.”

[Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg
(ret.)](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6390221839112): “For this
operation to unfold the way it has, with the strikes occurring and with
the assets we are using, is really quite amazing… We’ve done an
exceptional job. President Trump has done a great job.”

[New York Post columnist Michael
Goodwin](https://nypost.com/2026/02/28/opinion/trump-stood-by-his-words-and-attacked-iran-ending-the-reign-of-khamenei/):
“The death of Ayatollah Khamenei instantly makes Iran and the entire
Middle East a better, safer place… The president had made it abundantly
clear to anyone who cared to listen that the status quo was unacceptable
and that he was prepared to act with overwhelming force. Either Iranian
leaders would change their demonic ways, or the US and Israel would do
it for them. Promises made, promises kept.”

[Foundation for Defense of Democracies Senior Advisor Miad
Maleki](https://x.com/miadmaleki/status/2027708636361842854): “President
Trump is the first American president to come to the rescue of the
Iranian people and stand against this tyranny. That takes courage and
historic vision.”

[Commentator Hugh
Hewitt](https://x.com/hughhewitt/status/2027723339884585311): “The
destruction of this ‘wicked, radical regime’ is being done to protect
future generations says @POTUS, after recounting five decades of attacks
by the fanatics. His clear-eyed statement about the threat to our troops
is sober and necessary. His confidence in their abilities is complete. A
very sober but determined speech by President Trump. Seven of eight
presidents did not take direct, public action against Khomeini/Khamenei
but President Trump has. Bravo and to the soldiers, sailors, airmen and
Marines and our allies carrying out this mission.”

[Gen. Jack Keane
(ret.)](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2510821182647934): “This is a
very comprehensive, well-thought-out campaign that I’ve seen the details
of, and it’s nothing short of remarkable… Let’s credit the leaders for
stepping up and doing it and pushing aside all the naysayers that said
you shouldn’t do it, and let’s credit the troops that are out there
executing this mission.”

[Ronald Reagan Institute Director Roger
Zakheim](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2028123705398665624): “To
me, this is strategic in every aspect. This regime has, for 47 years,
attacked our interests — and because of what took place yesterday, the
leader of that regime was taken out. It will have a major strategic
impact on the region… The United States is safer because of what
happened yesterday. President Trump, because of that courageous
decision, has an opportunity to transform the region. But at the very
least, the status quo, where we are today, is markedly different from
the vulnerable position the United States has been in and our allies
have been in for 47 years. This is, if anything, the most consequential
strategic military action in 47 years.”

[Foundation for Defense of Democracies CEO Mark
Dubowitz](https://x.com/mdubowitz/status/2027865063709688110): “No other
president in the past or the future would have taken out Khamenei,
\[Soleimani\] and their deadly nuclear, missile and terror capabilities.
That’s fact not partisanship”

[NewsNation host Katie
Pavlich](https://x.com/KatiePavlich/status/2027647323979809118?s=20):
“Iran started a war against the United States of America is 1979 and
hasn’t stopped since. Enough.”

[Barstool Sports founder Dave
Portnoy](https://x.com/stoolpresidente/status/2027769003528122715?s=20):
“I always laugh at yo-yo’s who don’t have the 1st clue what information
the President had that forced this decision. Even politicians who
despise him but were briefed on the situation seem to agree with this
operation. I guess lotta podcasters know better. Gotta keep the lights
on somehow. Borderline traitors if you ask me. Iran is a terror nation
with a long history of some of the worst human rights atrocities in the
world. Nobody disputes that fact. They hate Americans. They hate Israel.
They hate all Jews. They hate the West. They would kill us all if given
the chance. They just murdered tens of thousands of their own people.
The rest of the Middle East is on our side. The Iranian people are on
our side.  It isn’t that complicated to support our Troops and our
country this morning. We are on the right side here. God Bless America.”

[Heritage Foundation Vice President Victoria
Coates](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2028138034915365293):
“President Trump has given every opportunity for the regime in Iran to
come to the table and make a reasonable deal… We were having the same
conversation over the course of the last four weeks that we were having
in the lead up to the 12-day war. All the critics were predicting the
president wouldn’t act, he was being tricked by the Iranians —
absolutely not. He was getting everything in place that he needed to
execute this extraordinary strike, and the Iranians now know that
they’re defenseless.”

[Commentator Chris
Stigall](https://x.com/ChrisStigall/status/2027737956971127178?s=20): “I
get it. Lots of people think this is Iraq all over again. President
Trump is a different leader, and Iran is a distinctly different issue.
People conflating our operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with today’s
actions don’t care enough to learn the very specific differences.
President Trump explains well the why of today. You don’t have to like
it.  But be smart enough to know the difference. President Trump isn’t
like past presidents. He’s repeatedly proven that’s true. He has no
appetite for endless war. He wants to end wars and has. Swiftly. I trust
him in this until I have information to suggest otherwise.”

[Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali
Bennett](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2028142944029413684): “The
big lesson is do not mess with President Trump… I think the whole
region, afterwards, will be thankful — and the world will be thankful —
because already now, the world is a safer place compared to yesterday.”

[OutKick founder Clay
Travis](https://x.com/ClayTravis/status/2027721306800607413?s=20): “100%
the right call to take out Iran’s leadership once and for all. Now the
people of Iran have the fate of their country in their hands. Between
Iran, Venezuela and Cuba we are all witnessing a modern day Berlin Wall
falling moment, Trump is standing for freedom like Reagan did.”

[Commentator Mark
Levin](https://x.com/marklevinshow/status/2027657750138732620?s=20):
“God bless our President and armed forces. And he will.”

[Commentator Scott
Jennings](https://x.com/ScottJenningsKY/status/2027739166625169697?s=20):
“God bless the President of the United States and the men and women who
are carrying out this righteous attack on the literal worst people in
the world. The President has made a clear case – watch this entire
video.”

[Newsmax host Rob
Schmitt](https://x.com/SchmittNYC/status/2027712385499468105?s=20):
“Trump stabilizing the Middle East and world thru force.”

[Fox News host Sean
Hannity](https://x.com/seanhannity/status/2027686394538213567?s=20):
“God Bless the Brave Men and Woman of the US Military—the greatest
military on the face of the earth. What makes President Trump so
consequential and transformational is that he understands real evil in
our time, and in this case he has taken the principled stance that the
number one state sponsor of terror cannot have nuclear weapons. The
world will be a safer place as a result. God bless our brave troops.”

[Former Clinton advisor Mark
Penn](https://x.com/Mark_Penn/status/2027691737263562947?s=20): “The
time is now Iran has terrorized the world for nearly 50 years with its
demonization of the west and the creation of a terror state that long
ago lost the support of its own people. They gunned down tens of
thousands of their own people believing they could do it and nothing
would happen to them. The actions of President Trump are a heroic turn
of events in which the regime that had as its ambition to conquer the
region will face destruction and not be allowed to continue to suppress
its own people while threatening the world. While Obama and Biden
enabled Iran, Trump drew a red line and meant it. This is a just cause
and we must all support our military in this effort that has been
clearly planned and thought out as never before. May they be successful
in making this a more peaceful and better world.”

[Commentator Davin
Rubin](https://x.com/RubinReport/status/2027742665849114971?s=20): “As I
said to @LelandVittert the other night, I trust President Trump. He
doesn’t want war, but he understands peace through strength. A new, more
peaceful world is on the horizon, and it was gonna take some grit,
toughness and determination to do it. 🇺🇸🇮🇷”

[Patrick
Bet-David](https://x.com/patrickbetdavid/status/2027725937219965315?s=20):
“For 47 years, Iranians have been waiting for this moment. Presidents on
both sides of the isle avoided this. This is a VERY HEAVY decision on
the President that comes with a ton of burden. If & when we succeed, the
world will be a safer place.”

[Article III Project Founder Mike
Davis](https://x.com/mrddmia/status/2027746473161724124?s=20): “For 47
years, Iran has waged war against the United States. The President of
the United States, as the commander-in-chief, has the Article II
constitutional power and duty to protect American people, assets,
allies, and other interests. Cheers to President Trump for doing this.”

[Bill Ackman](https://x.com/BillAckman/status/2027701079559807120?s=20):
“President @realDonaldTrump will go down in history as one of the
greatest and most consequential presidents we have ever had. His ability
and willingness to make bold and consequential decisions for the benefit
of future generations based on the hard and cold facts at hand rather
than short-term political considerations is one of his greatest
strengths. No longer are we governed by the politics of the weak who
have brought us close to the edge with their weakness and
self-interested short-termism. God bless our nation, our military, and
our president. Let’s all pray for our troops who risk their lives on
behalf of all of us so we can look forward to a world where evil is
eliminated and good prevails. What we do in life echoes in
eternity.”[Conservative Political Action Conference Chairman Matt
Schlapp](https://x.com/mschlapp/status/2027722507801796891?s=20): “It is
a diplomatic disaster to draw a line in the sand and not act when it’s
crossed. President Trump understands that. Dictators the world over are
realizing Trump doesn’t just talk; he will act.”

## **World leaders have expressed their strong support:**

[Australian Prime Minister Anthony
Albanese](https://x.com/AlboMP/status/2027678880220516549?s=20): “For
decades, the Iranian regime has been a destabilising force, through its
ballistic missile and nuclear programs, support for armed proxies, and
brutal acts of violence and intimidation… We support the United States
acting to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and to prevent
Iran continuing to threaten international peace and security.”

[Canadian Prime Minister Mark
Carney](https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/statements/2026/02/28/statement-prime-minister-carney-and-minister-anand-situation-middle-east):
“Canada’s position remains clear: the Islamic Republic of Iran is the
principal source of instability and terror throughout the Middle East,
has one of the world’s worst human rights records, and must never be
allowed to obtain or develop nuclear weapons … Canada supports the
United States acting to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and
to prevent its regime from further threatening international peace and
security.”

[Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu](https://x.com/IsraeliPM/status/2027667005646483945): “I thank
our great friend, President @realDonaldTrump, for his historic
leadership.”

[Albanian Prime Minister Edi
Rama](https://x.com/ediramaal/status/2027714015334432796?s=20): “It’s
high time to cut the rope and go straight to the point. The Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps is a terrorist organization and it must be
treated as such… Not only because we stand firm with Israel and with the
peace-seeking brotherly Arab countries. Not only because we support the
United States in militarily supporting Israel today under the leadership
of President Donald Trump… We fully endorse every decisive effort to
prevent once and for all the murderers in Tehran from acquiring nuclear
or any other military capacity to harm Israel or any other peace-loving
nation in the Middle East. Terrorism must be named. And once named, it
must be stopped.”

[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia](https://x.com/KSAmofaEN/status/2027706699100954895?s=20): “The
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia condemns and denounces in strongest terms the
blatant Iranian aggression and the flagrant violation of the sovereignty
of the UAE, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, and Jordan. The Kingdom affirms its
full solidarity with and unwavering support for the brotherly countries,
and its readiness to place all its capabilities at their disposal in
support of any measures they may undertake.”

[Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelensky](https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/2027742862977200307?s=20):
“It is important that the United States is acting decisively. Whenever
there is American resolve, global criminals weaken.”

[Kosovo President Vjosa
Osmani](https://x.com/VjosaOsmaniPRKS/status/2027717696704463244?s=20):
“The hour of freedom has come for the people of Iran, thanks to the
leadership of the United States and President @realDonaldTrump. As
always, the Republic of Kosovo unwaveringly stands with the United
States and its allies in defending freedom, peace, security, and
stability. We also strongly condemn the attacks of the Iranian regime
against our allies in the Middle East. We will continue to support the
actions undertaken by the United States and other allies to put an end
to the Iranian regime and finally give freedom and peace a chance.”

[British Member of Parliament and Leader of Reform UK Nigel
Farage](https://x.com/Nigel_Farage/status/2027693784310710744?s=20):
“The Prime Minister needs to change his mind on the use of our military
bases and back the Americans in this vital fight against Iran!”

[Canadian Conservative Party Leader Pierre
Poilievre](https://x.com/PierrePoilievre/status/2027741206466154852?s=20):
“The regime in Tehran is the principal source of terror in the Middle
East and around the world… Conservatives support a democratic, free and
permanently-denuclearized Iran that lives in peace and security with its
neighbours. And Conservatives support the United States, Israel, and our
allies across the Gulf to defend their sovereignty and dismantle the
clerical military dictatorship of Iran.”

## **Lawmakers across the political spectrum are backing Operation Epic Fury:**

[Senate Majority Leader John
Thune](https://x.com/LeaderJohnThune/status/2027748879140000019): “For
years, Iran’s relentless nuclear ambitions, its expanded ballistic
missile inventory, and its unwavering support for terror groups in the
region have posed a clear and unacceptable threat to U.S.
servicemembers, citizens in the region, and many of our allies. Despite
the dogged efforts of the president and his administration, the Iranian
regime has refused the diplomatic off-ramps that would peacefully
resolve these national security concerns.”

[Senate Majority Whip John
Barrasso](https://x.com/SenJohnBarrasso/status/2027739131984449590?s=20):
“I applaud President Trump for his decisive action to end the evil
terrorist regime in Iran. This is peace through strength. For 47 years
this murderous regime has waged war against the United States. It chants
‘Death to America.’ It kills innocent people and targets American
citizens. It funds terrorism around the world. May God Bless the Iranian
people in their fight for freedom. May God Bless our Troops and all
those involved in carrying out Operation Epic Fury.”

[Senate Republican Conference Chair Tom
Cotton](https://x.com/SenTomCotton/status/2027718442686480726?s=20): “A
nuclear-weapons program. Thousands of missiles. State sponsorship of
terror. Iran has waged war against the U.S. for 47 years: the hostage
crisis, the Beirut Marine barracks, Khobar Towers, roadside bombs in
Iraq and Afghanistan that killed or maimed thousands of American
soldiers, the attempted assassination of President Trump. The butcher’s
bill has finally come due for the ayatollahs. May God bless and protect
our troops on this vital mission of vengeance, and justice, and safety.”

[Sen. Jim Banks](https://x.com/SenatorBanks/status/2027741890854948870):
“A Trump red line isn’t a warning—it’s a promise.”

[Sen. Marsha
Blackburn](https://x.com/MarshaBlackburn/status/2027750415580750139):
“The Iranian regime has chanted ‘Death to America’ for decades. It’s
time to end the reign of terror.”

[Sen. John
Boozman](https://x.com/JohnBoozman/status/2027752037207732435): “The
world’s leading sponsor of terror can never have nuclear weapons. We are
praying for our courageous servicemembers and the people of Iran who
have suffered under this brutal regime for far too long.”

[Sen. Katie
Britt](https://x.com/SenKatieBritt/status/2027583767955558760?s=20):
“Iran is led by a murderous regime that not only murders innocent
Americans, but is also holding innocent Americans in captivity.
@SecRubio is right. Iran must return every single American. Thankful to
him and @POTUS for continuing to put maximum pressure on the Ayatollah.”

[Sen. Ted Budd](https://x.com/SenTedBuddNC/status/2027745422878318795):
“Today, @POTUS announced a major combat operation in Iran with the goal
of further crippling Iran’s nuclear program and to protect the U.S. and
our allies. For decades, Iran and its terror proxies have repeatedly
targeted American service-members and stoked violence and unrest in the
region. President Trump knows well that the American people do not favor
prolonged conflict, but there is also little doubt that Iran’s reckless
ambition to obtain nuclear weapons and long range missiles represents a
grave threat to our safety and security. A nuclear Iran has always been
an unacceptable outcome. Please join me in prayer for all our men and
women in uniform and our allies and partners around the globe. May God
bless and keep them safe now and always.”

[Sen. Shelley Moore
Capito](https://x.com/SenCapito/status/2027751446574149965?s=20):
“.@POTUS has given the Iranian regime countless opportunities to stand
down, stop killing their people, and abandon their nuclear ambitions.
Instead of choosing a peaceful path, they have doubled down on weapons
designed to threaten the American people. I am following U.S. operations
in Iran very closely, and I look forward to receiving briefings soon. In
the meantime, I will continue to monitor developments as we work to
ensure the safety and security of Americans at home and abroad. My
prayers are with the brave men and women who serve our country in

[Sen. John
Cornyn](https://x.com/JohnCornyn/status/2027735472621912403?s=20): “For
too long, Iran and its tentacles of terror have destabilized the Middle
East and waged war on the West and our values. With today’s strikes by
U.S. forces led by our Commander-in-Chief, President Trump, there is
finally an opening for these dark days to come to an end. It is my hope
that the Iranian people, after years of oppression and being ignored by
previous Democrat administrations, will finally be free, and I’m proud
of the support being provided by President Trump and the United States.
May God bless the men and women of our armed forces, our military
partners, and all those who stand with us in our mission against the
purveyor of terrorism and radical Islam that is the Islamic Republic of
Iran.”

[Sen. Kevin
Cramer](https://x.com/SenKevinCramer/status/2027745783383265636?s=20):
“The leadership of @POTUS at this time is strong & appropriate. Leaders
of peace loving people should join the fight, while the purpetrators
\[sic\] of evil reconsider their positions. All of us should pray to the
God of peace for the people of Iran while the U.S., Israel and hopefully
other allies unite against Iran.”

[Sen. Ted
Cruz](https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-statement-on-us-strikes-against-the-iranian-regime):
“Under President Trump’s leadership, the United States is systematically
acting against American enemies who have undermined our national
security since the Cold War. As the President said again this morning,
the Iranian regime has been terrorizing and murdering Americans for 47
years, including innocent civilians, our servicemembers, and American
leaders. The Ayatollah has repeatedly tried to assassinate President
Trump. Now they are seeking nuclear weapons and the ability to hit the
American homeland. Today’s action will enhance the national security of
the United States and our allies. I applaud our Armed Forces, our
intelligence community, and President Trump for their capabilities and
resolve to eliminate these threats, and I am deeply appreciative that
our Israeli allies are fighting alongside the U.S. on behalf of our
mutual interests and against our mutual enemies. May God protect our
servicemembers.”

[Sen. Steve
Daines](https://x.com/SteveDaines/status/2027756942639419878?s=20): “The
Iranian regime is the world’s largest state sponsor of terror & waged
war against the United States and its allies for nearly 50 years. I
support President Trump’s actions to keep our nation safe and aid the
people of Iran in their fight for liberty. Grateful for the President’s
strong moral clarity and for the men & women in our great military.”

[Sen. Joni
Ernst](https://x.com/SenJoniErnst/status/2027741756968571204?s=20):
“Through Operation Epic Fury, President Trump is standing up for
American lives that have been taken and targeted by the Iranian regime
and its terrorist proxies. This mission is critical to ensuring the
regime that chants ‘Death to America’ never has a nuclear weapon to make
a more peaceful Middle East and world. God bless our troops and keep
them safe.”

[Sen. John
Fetterman](https://x.com/SenFettermanPA/status/2027674658091204808?s=20):

United States, our great military, and Israel.”

[Sen. Deb
Fischer](https://x.com/SenatorFischer/status/2027754831134306769): “I am

ensure Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon. God bless America and the
innocent civilians in Iran, who deserve far better than the regime that
has long oppressed them.”

[Sen. Lindsey
Graham](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/2027675598319964548?s=20):
“God bless @POTUS for planning and now executing Operation Epic Fury,
making America more safe and eventually more prosperous. I seek God’s
protection for all under President Trump’s command, as well as our
allies in Israel. My mind is racing with the thought that the murderous
ayatollah’s regime in Iran will soon be no more. The biggest change in
the Middle East in a thousand years is upon us. The likelihood of
normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel getting back on track is
exceedingly high – a subject I brought up last week to the key players
in the region who concurred if the ayatollah goes down, historic peace
advances. As to the men and women participating in this operation for
our country and Israel, may God bless you and keep you safe. If you are
injured or fall, I believe with all my heart that your sacrifice makes
your country and the world a better and safer place. This moment is why
you chose to serve. This operation has been well-planned. It will be
violent, extensive and I believe, at the end of the day, successful.
Again the demise of the ayatollah’s regime with American blood on its
hands is necessary and more than justified.”

[Sen. Chuck
Grassley](https://x.com/ChuckGrassley/status/2027783021533806895): “I’m

[Sen. Bill
Hagerty](https://x.com/SenatorHagerty/status/2027757524514992278): “The
world knows the death and destruction that Iran has perpetrated for
decades. The regime must be held accountable. @POTUS knows that
strength—not weakness—brings peace. The president will not pass the buck
to avoid necessary decisions to protect the American people. May God
bless America, our Service Members, and our Allies.”

[Sen. Jon
Husted](https://x.com/SenJonHusted/status/2027767498687304087): “For 47
years, the Iranian regime had ample opportunity to be a productive
member of the global community. Instead, it chose to export death,
terrorism, extremism, and instability against America and our allies. It
did all of this while brutally oppressing its own people, who yearned
for the freedom and prosperity that they deserve but the regime has
refused to deliver. Today, the President took action to address the
threat Iran poses to America and global stability. I look forward to
being briefed and learning more from the administration in the coming
days. I pray for our military servicemembers, all Israeli military
personnel, and our allies in harm’s way. May God bless them and keep
them safe.”

[Senator Cindy
Hyde-Smith: ](https://x.com/SenHydeSmith/status/2027785644341162124?s=20)“President
Trump is acting decisively to confront the Iranian regime, a leading
state sponsor of global terrorism and a grave threat to the national
security interests of the United States and our allies. The President is
sending a clear message that we and our allies cannot tolerate Iran’s
extended aggression or destabilization of regions critical to global
peace and security. I look forward to learning more from the
administration about the scope and duration of this operation. I ask all
Americans to join me in praying for our servicemembers. As President
Trump said last night, ‘We ask God to protect all of our heroes in
harm’s way. And we trust that with His help, the men and women of the
armed forces will prevail.’”

of our service members in the Middle East. God Bless our troops and God
Bless America.”

[Sen. James
Lankford](https://x.com/SenatorLankford/status/2027757182884704273?s=20):
“Iran remains the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism and has
long threatened the United States and our allies. Today’s military
actions underscore the seriousness of that threat and the need to
prevent Iran from ever obtaining a nuclear weapon. I’m praying for the
safety of every American service member involved in these operations and
for their families at home. God bless our troops and God bless America.”

[Sen. Cynthia
Lummis](https://x.com/SenLummis/status/2027773618382356554): “In a
dangerous world, we must stand united with our allies to confront the

terrorist regime. Putting America First means leading with strength,
resolve, and clarity.”

[Sen. Dave
McCormick](https://x.com/SenMcCormickPA/status/2027757785090347325?s=20):
“For decades, the Iranian regime has killed Americans, threatened Israel
and our allies in the region with their ballistic missiles and nuclear
ambitions, and butchered tens of thousands of its own people. They are
the world’s number one sponsor of terror. The president has given the
ayatollahs a chance for a deal, and they have rejected a path to peace
and prosperity. I am praying for our brave troops and our steadfast
allies who stand with us during this challenging and noble mission.”

[Sen. Ashley
Moody](https://x.com/SenAshleyMoody/status/2027762753889341561?s=20):
“For decades, this evil Iranian regime has called for the death of
America, the destruction of the West, terrorized its own people and
others, and caused fear and instability in the region. When someone says
they want to destroy you, you should listen, and we have a @POTUS that
did just that. Today, all Americans should be praying for the success
and the safety of our servicemen and women.”

[Sen. Bernie
Moreno](https://x.com/berniemoreno/status/2027773969370136796): “God
bless and protect our troops. President Trump sought for months to avoid
conflict and negotiate with Iran to prevent them from rebuilding their
nuclear program. I fully support his decision to eliminate the threat
once and for all once it became clear there was no other option.
President Trump will always put America’s interests first and defend
American citizens. I have complete trust in him to finally bring peace
to the Middle East.”

[Sen. Markwayne

for your safety in this mission.”

[Sen. Mike
Rounds](https://x.com/SenatorRounds/status/2027877911756214442):
“Congratulations to our Armed Forces under the leadership of President
Trump and to our strong allies in Israel on this opportunity to change
the course of history. The death of Khamenei offers a path for a more
peaceful Middle East, and a chance for the Iranian people to chart a
different course forward.”

[Sen. Rick
Scott](https://x.com/SenRickScott/status/2027722947553611880?s=20): “The
days of the evil Iranian regime chanting ‘Death to America,’ threatening
the very existence of our country and our allies, and oppressing its
people are over. Thank you, @POTUS, for your strong leadership. God
bless @SecWar and the brave men and women in our military. Operation
Epic Fury is peace through strength on full display, and a reminder to
our friends and our enemies: The U.S. will ALWAYS put AMERICA FIRST. We
will always stand with our friend, Israel, and we will NEVER allow Iran
to have a nuclear weapon.”

[Sen. Tim
Scott](https://x.com/SenatorTimScott/status/2027789326445064383): “This
was the ayatollah’s decision, and his regime faced the consequences of
his actions. President Trump warned the regime last summer that any
restarting of its nuclear weapons program would have severe
repercussions. They made their choice, and as a result, this murderous
regime was met with Operation Epic Fury. Many presidents talk. President
Donald J. Trump acts. The pivotal leadership of this administration and
our allies across the region will bring an end to a regime that has for
too long been the world’s chief sponsor of terrorism. Any further
actions by this regime can and will prompt a swift response from the
United States. Iran must de-escalate. I applaud President Trump and
Secretary Marco Rubio for their pursuit of peace, decisive action, and
the defense of American interests. May God bless our service members and
may God bless America.”

[Sen. Tim

country. America has your back.”

[Sen. Dan
Sullivan](https://x.com/SenDanSullivan/status/2027838505477374171):
“Iran has been a catalyst for terrorism, mayhem and violence all over
the Middle East and across the world for decades. The terrorist leaders
of Iran have, in essence, been at war with the United States since the
Ayatollahs took over Iran in 1979. They have killed and maimed thousands
of American service members over the years: the Beirut Marine barracks,
Khobar Towers, and roadside bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan. The regime
has even recently attempted to assassinate President Trump. That’s why a
bipartisan goal of every president since the Iranian revolution has been
to ensure that the largest state sponsor of terrorism doesn’t have
nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. The world is not safe with an
Iran with relentless nuclear and terrorist ambitions, and an expanded
ballistic missile inventory. Julie and I are praying for our brave
service members conducting these dangerous missions, and for all
Americans in the region.”

[Sen. Tommy
Tuberville](https://x.com/SenTuberville/status/2027771609629520232):
“President Trump has shown time and time again, you NEVER threaten
America. God Bless our great troops, God Bless President Trump, and God
Bless America.”

[Sen. Roger
Wicker](https://x.com/SenatorWicker/status/2027752044577079488?s=20):
“Today, our commander-in-chief took decisive action against the threat
posed by the world’s leading proliferator of terrorism, the Iranian
regime. This is a pivotal and necessary operation to protect Americans
and American interests. The President has stated the operation’s goals
clearly: thwart permanently the ayatollahs’ desire to create a nuclear
weapon, degrade their ballistic missile force and their production
capacity, and destroy their naval and terrorism capabilities. These are
the hardest decisions that face any American commander-in-chief, and I
appreciate that President Trump and his team conducted a comprehensive
strategy using all tools of national power and a well-orchestrated
military planning process… Most importantly, I commend the brave men and
women of our armed forces, who continue to demonstrate a level of
operational proficiency unrivaled the world over. That fact will be
evident in the coming days. Thanks to them, Americans are safer – not
just today, but for generations to come.”

[Speaker Mike
Johnson](https://x.com/SpeakerJohnson/status/2027741976632631497?s=20):
Today, Iran is facing the severe consequences of its evil actions.
President Trump and the Administration have made every effort to pursue
peaceful and diplomatic solutions in response to the Iranian regime’s
sustained nuclear ambitions and development, terrorism, and the murder
of Americans—and even their own people. For decades, Iran has defiantly
maintained its nuclear program while arming and funding Hamas,
Hezbollah, and other internationally recognized terrorist organizations.
Iran and its proxies have menaced America and American lives, undermined
our core national interests, systematically destabilized the Middle
East, and threatened the security of the entire West. The Gang of 8 was
briefed in detail earlier this week that military action may become
necessary to protect American troops and American citizens in Iran. I
received updates from Secretary Rubio thereafter, and I will remain in
close contact with the President and the Department of War as this
operation proceeds. We pray for the safety of our brave servicemembers
and our allies involved in Operation Epic Fury. May God bless them, and
may God bless America.”

[House Majority Leader Steve
Scalise](https://x.com/SteveScalise/status/2027758038258458632): “For
years, the Iranian Regime has chanted ‘Death to America,’ targeted our
troops, weaponized their terrorist proxies, and killed tens of thousands
of innocent people, including Americans. Today, President Trump made it
clear: their reign of terror is over. The President has worked
tirelessly to establish a lasting peace through diplomacy with Iran.
Instead, Iran continued to pursue their sinister ambitions, promoting
terrorism, developing missiles, attempting to rebuild their nuclear
program, and posing an imminent threat to the security of the United
States and our allies. We can never allow the world’s number one state
sponsor of terrorism to have a nuclear weapon. This decisive action is
yet another move by President Trump to protect the United States and
sends a message to the world: never doubt America’s resolve or capacity
to defend its interests. May God bless America, the brave men and women
of the U.S. military, and the freedom-loving people of Iran.”

[House Majority Whip Tom
Emmer](https://x.com/GOPMajorityWhip/status/2027722551812620703?s=20):
“This is a bold, decisive act of strength by President Trump. The
Ayatollah is responsible for killing hundreds of U.S. service members
and slaughtering its own people. We pray that because of this
leadership, the U.S. and the world will be a safer place. May God bless
and protect the men and women of our military conducting this mission
and serving in the region.”

[House Republican Chairwoman Lisa
McClain](https://x.com/RepLisaMcClain/status/2027747074448425335?s=20):
“President Trump has taken decisive action against the world’s number
one state sponsor of terror – a regime that has targeted American troops
and called for ‘death to America.’ May God bless our Commander in Chief
and military leaders with wisdom through this operation and may He keep
our troops in His care.”

[Rep. Robert
Aderholt](https://x.com/Robert_Aderholt/status/2027754696186732707?s=20):
“To call the current Iranian regime brutal would be an understatement.
For nearly 50 years, its leaders have called for ‘Death to America’ and
‘Death to Israel.’ They are responsible for the deaths of hundreds of
American service members, including the 241 U.S. Marines murdered in the
1983 Beirut barracks bombing, as well as many other Americans killed
directly and through their terrorist proxies. The current leadership has
also suppressed and killed thousands of Iran’s own people simply for
seeking a voice in their government. I stand with President Trump in
leading America to take decisive action to restore stability to a region
that has lacked it for far too long. The time for the people of Iran is
now. May God bless the men and women of our armed forces and the United
States of America.”

[Rep. Mark
Alford](https://x.com/RepMarkAlford/status/2027746835532517489?s=20):
“Please join Leslie and me in praying for the our troops who are in
harms way. The Iranian regime is the world’s leading state sponsor of
terror, a destabilizing force across the region, and a threat to U.S.
allies, interests, and bases in the Middle East. Tehran is directly
responsible for the deaths of countless Americans over the years. I
support President Trump’s swift and bold action to finally hold the
regime accountable. As I’ve said for weeks, through either the easy way
or the hard way, the Ayatollah needs to go.”

[Rep. Brian
Babin](https://x.com/RepBrianBabin/status/2027728467865862385?s=20):
“For 40 years, Iran’s regime has chanted ‘Death to America,’ funded
terrorists, attacked our troops, and plotted against our allies. That
ends now. President Trump chose strength.”

[Rep. Don
Bacon](https://x.com/RepDonBacon/status/2027745523310985257?s=20): “Iran
has waged war against the United States, our Allies and our national
security interests since 1979. Their attacks include the Beirut Marine
Barracks and U.S. Embassy in 1983, the Khobar Towers in 1996, attempted
assassination against our President, 609 Americans killed in Iraq and
continued cyberattacks. I hate war, but Iran has been at war with us.
After the regime just murdered approximately 50,000 Iranians, it is time
to help the Iranian people get rid of the Ayatollah once and for all.”

[Rep. Michael
Baumgartner](https://x.com/RepBaumgartner/status/2027727127869522284?s=20):
“The Mullahs who control Iran are a messianic death cult who believe
that their version of Shia Islam will be guided by God to conquer the
world. They have supported terrorist groups that have killed thousands
of Americans. Their nuclear and ballistic missile programs are
significant threats to America’s national interests and security. The
sooner Iran’s leaders are in the dustbin of history the better.”

[Rep. Andy
Barr](https://x.com/RepAndyBarr/status/2027751183314477146?s=20): “I’m
fully behind President Trump and our great military as operations begin
in Iran. President Trump gave Iran every chance to give up their nuclear
ambitions, end their financing of terrorism, and stop the slaughter of
innocent civilians. Iran can never have a nuclear weapon. This regime
puts all Americans and our allies at risk. I applaud President Trump for
this bold action that will give the people of Iran the best opportunity
for change in generations. I pray for our military’s success and
safety.”

[Rep. Aaron
Bean](https://x.com/RepAaronBean/status/2027763633489379649?s=20): “God
bless our brave warfighters, and thank you, @POTUS and @SecWar for your
bold leadership. Operation Epic Fury is peace through strength in
action, and sends an unmistakable message: AMERICA FIRST, always. The
United States stands with our ally Israel, and we will not allow Iran’s
hostile regime to gain nuclear power.”

[Rep. Stephanie
Bice](https://x.com/RepBice/status/2027766593397142000?s=20): “For 47
years, the Iranian people have been living under an oppressive regime
who funds terrorism across the globe, chants ‘death to America,’ and has
slaughtered its own citizens. Now is the time for Iranians to stand up
and take back their nation and bring lasting peace to the Middle East.
I’m praying for our military service members who are participating in
Operation Epic Fury and look forward to a future Iran who is free and
prosperous.”

[Rep. Tim

[Rep. Mike
Carey](https://x.com/RepMikeCarey/status/2028142207849382334): “The
Ayatollah, who for more than four decades led a regime marked by
torture, murder, and the oppression of the Iranian people, has finally
been stopped. My hope is that the freedom-loving people of Iran can now
embrace their rich history, see their civilization flourish, and have
their voices be heard without fear. The President demonstrated decisive
action to halt Iran’s nuclear ambitions and its state-sponsored
terrorism around the globe, including attacking American citizens.”

[Rep. Buddy
Carter](https://x.com/RepBuddyCarter/status/2027736728232927570?s=20):
“Iran was given every opportunity to choose diplomacy, with President
Trump leaving the door to peace wide open. Instead, Iran would rather
spread its poisonous, incompatible ideology rooted in extreme hatred.
Any country that chants ‘death to America’ will never obtain nuclear
weapons, certainly not on President Trump’s watch. America, our allies,
and the world are safer because of this President.”

[Rep. Mike
Collins](https://x.com/RepMikeCollins/status/2027744678431379708?s=20):
“Under President Trump, the United States will no longer stand idly by
while our enemies plot against us and chant ‘Death to America.’ My
prayers are with our brave warfighters as they work to rid the world of
the largest state sponsor of global terror and protect America from the
Iranian regime.”

[Rep. Jeff

bomb. That ends now.”

[Rep. Rick
Crawford](https://x.com/RepRickCrawford/status/2027722407763460286?s=20):
“Operation ‘Epic Fury’ was launched against the nation of Iran last
night. Prior to the initiation of this action, in earnest diplomatic
engagements with Iran, President Trump was very clear about his red line
from the start and his expectations of Iran during these negotiations.
Iran absolutely cannot be allowed to maintain a nuclear weapon or
capabilities. The safety and security of Americans and our allies are on
the line. Furthermore, President Trump has given Iran plenty of
opportunities to take the diplomatic route. The United States of America
has the most premier military in the world, and I am confident it will
successfully carry out the very clearly stated goals of this operation.
As the operations continue, we pray for the safety of the U.S. military
forces involved, Americans in the region, and our allies. I would
strongly advise the Iranian regime heed President Trump’s warning.”

[Rep. Dan

“President Trump again doing what needs to be done. In this statement he
said we plan to annihilate their missile sites and obliterate their
Navy. This is the time to weaken them to a point where the Iranian
people can finally beat the regime on their own. Saudi Arabia is even
joining the fight along with Israel. And yes this is America First. The
world’s number one sponsor of terror is finally being held accountable
after 47 years.”

[Rep. Scott

“Please join Amy and me in praying for our military personnel serving
abroad as well as our friends and allies as we begin operations to cut
the head off the snake of the world’s leading sponsor of terrorism and
end Iran’s thirst for nuclear weapons. The Iranian people will finally
have the opportunity to take back control of the government that was
taken from them almost 47 years ago.”

[Rep. Mario

“For nearly five decades, Iranians have endured repression, violence,
and torture at the hands of the evil Iranian regime–a regime that
exports terrorism, brutally suppresses dissent at home, and openly
threatens the United States and our allies. I commend President
@realDonaldTrump for standing in solidarity with the brave Iranian
people, who continue to demand freedom, dignity, and basic human rights
despite ruthless crackdowns. Hundreds of protesters have been killed
simply for exercising those rights. Americans and the world are safer
because of President Trump’s leadership and maximum pressure strategy,
including the removal of terrorist Qasem Soleimani and last year’s
decisive action to obliterate Iran’s nuclear sites–demonstrating that
deterrence and strength, not appeasement, will lead to a safer and more
secure future for all.”

[Rep. Byron

[Rep. Troy

“For decades, the Ayatollah has rejected diplomacy, opting instead to
pursue nuclear armament while chanting death to America. The Iranian
regime and its proxies have American blood on their hands. No President
has possessed the grit to challenge this clear and present danger until
now. God bless our troops in their fight for a lasting peace.”

[Rep. Gabe
Evans](https://x.com/repgabeevans/status/2027935507980665301): “I
applaud the action taken today to eradicate the leading global sponsor
of terrorism, the Iranian regime, and their nuclear and ballistic
missile programs. After nearly five decades terrorizing its own people,
lending aide to organizations like Al Quida, and threatening nations
around the world, the United States has made it clear: that era is over.
We will no longer tolerate what endangers America, our allies, and
global stability.”

[Rep. Pat
Fallon](https://x.com/RepPatFallon/status/2027746722378621059?s=20):
“Operation Epic Fury, in coordination with our allies, is a United
States national security imperative. The Iranian regime, for nearly five
decades, has proven in no uncertain terms to be a force for evil and
instability in the world. Iran’s IRGC, a U.S.-designated Foreign
Terrorist Organization, has repeatedly targeted President Trump in
thwarted assassination plots, including directives in 2024 to surveil
and plan his killing as revenge for the 2020 U.S. strike on Qasem
Soleimani. These efforts extended to Trump administration leaders as
well as U.S. soldiers. The Ayatollah’s regime has also pursued
murder-for-hire schemes and surveillance against American citizens,
including Iranian-American dissidents and others critical of Tehran, all
on U.S. soil. The display of U.S. hard power we are seeing today
constitutes justice for the victims of the Iranian regime’s cruelty, as
well as for the Iranian people who have suffered under decades of
repression. The Iranian regime’s capacity to sow chaos, death, and
destruction must be eliminated once and for all. We pray for the safety
of our brave men and women in uniform.”

“I support President Trump’s decisive actions in response to Iran’s
decades of relentless terrorist activity, its continued pursuit of
nuclear weapons, and the grave threat it poses to the United States and
our allies who seek freedom and peace. We must stand firm against those

oppressive regime, neither the Iranian people nor the broader world can
fully enjoy peace, stability, and prosperity. May God bless our brave

[Rep. Scott
Franklin](https://x.com/RepFranklin/status/2027956760804196685): “From
its inception, the Iranian regime has systematically executed terror
attacks to the fullest extent of its capabilities. As their military
capabilities have increased, so have the scope and scale of their
attacks. We have every reason to take them at their word that, if given
the opportunity, they would wipe Israel off the map and then come for
America. That is why the United States has always been clear that Iran
can NEVER be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon. Every American
president since Ronald Reagan has made this point clear. Yet Iran has
shown steadfast determination to advance its nuclear ambitions, despite
the exhaustive diplomatic efforts of eight presidents. As President
Trump stated so clearly in his message to the American people, ‘we can’t
take it any longer.’ Nor should we… Peace through strength rings hollow
without the resolve to use that strength when diplomacy fails. The
enormous weight of President Trump’s decision to exercise that resolve
cannot be overstated. May God grant him wisdom and judgment, safety for
our fighting men and women, peace in our time, and His continued
blessings for our great nation.”

hundreds of American lives, and threatened our national security. @POTUS

actions against America and our allies. I stand firmly with our brave

“Last night, the United States and Israel took targeted military action
against Iran under Operation Epic Fury after continued threats against
our forces and our allies. The Iranian regime is the world’s top state
sponsor of terrorism and has been responsible for the deaths of hundreds
of Americans. The regime has plotted to assassinate President Trump,
financed and executed terrorist attacks across the globe, and targeted
dissidents on U.S. soil. I’m grateful for our service-members who are
keeping our country safe. As Chairman of the House Homeland Security
Committee, my priority remains protecting the safety and security of the
American people. As we face a heightened threat landscape, it is more
important now than ever that we fully fund the Department of Homeland
Security. We cannot afford delays. We must ensure DHS is operating at

since Ronald Reagan has a president of the United States made such bold

the tyrannical Iranian regime has killed Americans, attacked U.S.
allies, slaughtered its own civilians, and chanted ‘Death to America.’
Iran has failed to cease its state sponsorship of terror and rejected
U.S. diplomatic efforts to establish peace. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei led the aggressive advancement of Iran’s nuclear enrichment
program and its ballistic missile development. These actions posed an
imminent threat to U.S. allies, U.S. service members abroad, and
Americans’ safety at home. I strongly support President Trump’s decisive
actions to protect America’s national security. As this situation

“Enter President Trump’s second term. An incredibly decisive operation
in Midnight Hammer, sending a clear message to Iran. Picking off Maduro
in Venezuela—sending the clearest message to all of the adversaries of
the United States that we are willing to use unprecedented capabilities
and are truly done messing around. And today, Ayatollah Khomeini is
dead. He was an evil man, and American and Israeli airpower sent him
into the next world, straight to Hell. Gone are the days of failed
regime change and capacity building. Gone are the days of kicking the
can down the road and getting nothing done. Gone are the days of
sacrificing our military authority and capabilities on the altar of
political correctness. The world is a dangerous place. When nations
threaten the United States of America or its close allies, President
Trump is very clear: we will seek terms of peace. But if peace is
unobtainable, we are going straight for the jugular, because we are done
getting nothing done. Because the world deserves peace, and to be free
of leaders who oppress and oppose peace. And simply, more than anyone
else in the world by a factor of ten, because we can.”

Middle East. Iran’s refusal to accept a deal left President Trump with
no choice other than to take decisive action to ensure the regime never
possesses a nuclear weapon. There is no peace without strength, and the
United States will not sit by while this regime pursues their nuclear
ambitions, fuels their terrorist proxies, and brutalizes the Iranian
people. I’m praying for our brave troops in the region. May God bless
them, and may God bless the United States.”

[Rep. French
Hill](https://x.com/RepFrenchHill/status/2027741037708644625?s=20): “For
five decades, the Iranian regime has terrorized its own people,
threatened regional stability, and pursued weapons of mass destruction
in defiance of the international community. Decades of sanctions imposed
bilaterally and by the United Nations have failed to stop Iran’s
destructive ambitions. Years of intensive but ultimately futile
negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program accomplished nothing and were
rightly rejected by bipartisan majorities in both the House and Senate
at the end of the Obama Administration. Each year that I have served in
the House, I have spoken directly to the Iranian people, most recently
at the Organization of Iranian American Communities event on Capitol
Hill in December, where I again condemned the brutality of the Iranian
regime and stood with all Iranians fighting for a democratic, secular,
and non-nuclear republic. I have long been a steadfast advocate for the
people of Iran. In the last Congress, my bill—the Holding Iranian
Leaders Accountable Act—was signed into law to expose the regime’s
financial corruption, and this year I cosponsored a bipartisan
resolution condemning the regime’s terrorism and supporting the Iranian
people’s call for democratic change. Throughout my time in Congress, I
have consistently consulted with regional leaders in the Gulf and in our
ally Israel about the Iranian threat and the importance of standing
together against terror, aggression, and nuclear-armed Iran. I pray for
our servicemembers as they carry out these operations, for our allies in
the region, and for the Iranian people. May this be the dawn of a new
day for the Iranian people and a step toward lasting peace in the Middle
East.”

intimidated by foreign threats and that we stand for the dignity and
safety of Iranian citizens. America does not seek aggression, but our
enemies must know we will not stand by at the cost of our security and
that of our closest allies. Leading up to these strikes, the Trump
administration negotiated in good faith with the Iranian regime and gave
them plenty of opportunities to settle this diplomatically. However,
Iran refused to cooperate and remains steadfast in its commitment to
spreading terror throughout the region and threatening the U.S., while
brutally suppressing its own people.  The U.S. is targeting Iranian
military assets to degrade the regime’s ability to acquire nuclear
weapons and threaten our national security and our allies in the region.

“Today’s actions against Iran are a direct response to the escalating
global threat the regime poses to democracy, the United States, and our
allies throughout the region. For decades, Iran has sponsored terrorism,
destabilized the Middle East, and openly called for death to America. As
it moved closer to obtaining nuclear capabilities, the risk to global
security has become too great to ignore. The United States does not seek
conflict, but we will not tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran or continued
aggression against our interests and our allies. Today’s decisive
military action sends a clear message: threats to the safety and
security of the American people and the free world will be met with
strength and resolve. As a former Navy helicopter pilot, I understand
the weight of sending American servicemembers into harm’s way. The men
and women of our Armed Forces represent the very best of our nation.
They deserve our full support, the resources necessary to accomplish
their mission, and the unwavering gratitude of a free people. I stand
firmly behind our troops and remain deeply grateful for their courage

“For decades, the Iranian regime has led a sustained campaign of
violence against the United States and our allies. It has armed proxy
forces that have killed and wounded Americans, targeted our embassies
and military installations, and threatened our homeland. As Iran
continued to advance its nuclear program while driving conflict across
the region, a response became unavoidable. Operation Epic Fury makes
clear that attacks on Americans and our allies will not go unanswered. I
thank President Trump for taking decisive action to defend our national
security. I stand with our armed forces as they confront a regime whose
terrorism and nuclear ambitions endanger the United States and undermine
global stability.”

[Rep. Greg
Landsman](https://landsman.house.gov/posts/landsman-statement-on-iran):
“For most of my life, the regime in Iran has caused bloodshed and
mayhem. At some point, we have to say enough is enough, and begin to
destroy its ability to kill innocent people, including its own citizens…
If it weren’t for the regime, Yemenis, Iraqis, Lebanese, Palestinians,
and Persians might all be free. While diplomacy has always been an
option for the regime, they have yet to show any interest in disarming
or pulling back from funding violence and terror in the region. Instead,
the regime is threatening further attacks on Americans and our allies…
The United States with its many partners in the Middle East may very
well need to take defensive action, targeting military assets in Iran.
Targeted strikes on known ballistic missiles and rocket infrastructure
and other weapons depots, including nuclear assets, may very well save
lives. The region and world would be a much safer place if the regime’s
military capacity was leveled.”

[Rep. Darin

has repeatedly rejected serious diplomatic efforts, despite President
Trump and the United States making it abundantly clear that we will not
allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon or retain the capability to do
so. Rather than engage in good-faith negotiations, the Iranian regime
has continued to fund terrorist organizations, destabilize the Middle
East, murder its own citizens, and threaten the security of the United
States and our allies. Last night’s Operation ‘Epic Fury’ was a direct
consequence of Iran’s actions and its refusal to pursue a peaceful path
forward. President Trump and his team made every effort to provide the
regime with a diplomatic off-ramp, but the safety and security of the
American people must always remain our top priority. We pray for the
safety of our brave servicemembers, Americans in the region, and our

“For months, the Trump Administration worked to negotiate a diplomatic
solution with the Iranian regime to end their nuclear ambitions,
ballistic missile program, and funding of terrorism throughout the
region. But time and time again, the regime offered no concessions and
unrealistic demands. I support the President’s decision to strike Iran.
No longer will the Ayatollah be allowed to engage in terrorism abroad
and violent repression of the Iranian people at home. With this strike,
the Iranian people will finally be able to determine the future of their

support the decisive actions taken by the United States military, in

aggression and continued pursuit of nuclear capability. Iran remains the
world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism and a major threat to the
U.S.—funding proxy militias, threatening our allies, and pursuing
nuclear capabilities while openly chanting ‘Death to America.’ The build
up of its power on terror and nuclear threats cannot be allowed to
define the future of the region, nor put American national security at
risk. I look forward to an in-depth brief from the Administration in the
coming days, and increased Congressional involvement now that military
action has begun. In the meantime, we pray for the safety and security

develop a nuclear weapon, would never hesitate to use it against Israel,
the United States, or any other country. They have proven that life
means nothing to them by recently killing thousands of their own people.
President Trump and his administration have given Tehran every
opportunity to negotiate peace, but, just like they have always done
before, they have delayed and refused to cooperate to buy time to become
a nuclear power. America cannot allow the cancerous threat of Islamic
jihadi ideology to have such a devastating weapon to threaten the
stability and security of our allies and the global community. These
sentiments have been said previously by both Democrat and Republican
Presidents. This should not be a partisan issue. I support this overdue

war against our people and our values for far too long. Under the

Iran’s reign of terror in the Middle East and demonstrating, once again,
the unmatched strength of the American military. I’ve flown combat
missions against the very terrorists funded and directed by the Iranian

and basic human rights. It’s clear: this evil regime seeks to kill and
must be obliterated. The President, and many before him, have given Iran
every opportunity to make a deal for peace to end this long conflict,
but the Iranian regime has time and time again refused. Now, the hour of
freedom is at hand. For the freedom of the Iranian people, and the
safety and security of the entire world, I stand behind President Trump,
Prime Minister Netanyahu, and our U.S. military servicemen and women.
Our world is safer with President Trump as Commander in Chief. Today,
and every day, I pray for our troops and the Iranian freedom fighters.”

[Rep. Maria Elvira
Salazar](https://x.com/RepMariaSalazar/status/2027768138025062911?s=20):
“To echo @POTUS, this is a historic moment for the Iranian people. The
hour of your freedom has come. For decades, the brave people of Iran
have suffered under a theocratic dictatorship that imprisoned, murdered
and silenced them. No American President has had the strength to do what
needed to be done to give the people a chance, until now. Thanks to our
President and to our brave men and women in uniform, 2026 will be the
year the Iranian people finally achieve freedom!”

[Rep. Austin
Scott](https://x.com/AustinScottGA08/status/2027760463660937664): “For
decades the Iranian regime has waged a war of terror against the United
States, its regional partners, and its allies. They have funded and
provided the weapons that killed tens of thousands of Americans. This
regime is even more barbaric towards the people of Iran. It is long
overdue for the Iranian people to take their country back. This is a
complex mission against a military that is better equipped than many we
have faced in the last several decades. As Operation Epic Fury proceeds,
please join me in praying for the safety of all our men and women down
range, Americans in the region, the Iranian peoples effort to remove the
barbaric regime, and our allies.”

[Rep. Keith
Self](https://x.com/RepKeithSelf/status/2027729331464622192?s=20): “Pray
for our military members to prevail in their righteous mission to rid
the people of Iran of their tyrannical, murderous Islamic regime. This
joint operation with Israel may be the start of a major effort by
Western civilization to defend itself against aggressive Islam.”

[Rep. Mike
Simpson](https://x.com/CongMikeSimpson/status/2027744074745139625?s=20):
“For years, the evil Iranian regime has chanted ‘death to America,’
killed American troops, and slaughtered its own people. Iran was given
every opportunity to resolve this peacefully through negotiations but
chose not to. I commend President Trump for taking decisive action
against a regime responsible for decades of terror. May God protect our
men and women in uniform on this vital mission.”

[Rep. Adrian
Smith](https://x.com/RepAdrianSmith/status/2027752197644062734?s=20):
“For years the Iranian regime and its terrorist proxies have waged war
against the lives of Americans, their own people, and millions of others
across the Middle East. Lasting peace can ultimately only be achieved
through strength, and President Trump is taking action to achieve that
goal. May God bless and protect our brave servicemen and women as they
protect our freedom.”

[Rep. Jason
Smith](https://x.com/RepJasonSmith/status/2027790795236073817?s=20):
“Early this morning, the Trump Administration carried out a successful
attack on the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism, Iran. Iran has
financed terror networks around the globe and has been responsible for
taking countless American lives. I’m glad the Trump Administration is
taking their threats to the world seriously and is fighting against the
regime that proudly calls for ‘Death to America’.”

[Rep. Pete
Stauber](https://x.com/RepPeteStauber/status/2027754036540092531?s=20):
“As the largest state sponsor of terror, Iran has been waging a war on
the U.S. and our allies for decades. President Trump gave Iran every
opportunity to end its nuclear and murderous ambitions. Now, the time
has come to free the world from this threat and free the Iranian people
from this oppressive regime. May God protect our troops as they carry
out Operation Epic Fury.”

[Rep. Elise
Stefanik](https://x.com/EliseStefanik/status/2027730917351968823?s=20):
“As a senior Member of the House Armed Services Committee and the House
Select Committee on Intelligence, I have always been consistent that
Iran cannot have nuclear weapons capabilities that would threaten the
national security of the United States. Iran is the world’s largest
sponsor of terror and has targeted, killed, and wounded U.S. service
members and civilians throughout the Middle East over the past decades
including soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division. Additionally, the
sick Iran regime controlled by the blood-thirsty ayatollah terrorists
have destroyed a nation, continued to pursue nuclear weapons threatening
America and all of humanity, slaughtered innocent Iranians, and shed
blood directly and through heinous terrorist proxies across the Middle
East including of Americans. I know President Trump has to make some of
the most difficult decisions imaginable and there is no decision more
serious that military action to protect U.S. national security and
American lives. God Bless our brave men and women in uniform. The
American people are praying for your safety.”

[Rep. Greg
Steube](https://x.com/RepGregSteube/status/2027897495607517321): “To
think that Iran, the world’s leading state sponsor of terror, could
stand before the UN Security Council today and lie about
@realDonaldTrump, speaks to what a joke this entity truly is. These
people shouldn’t even be allowed in our country. Congratulations to our
military on a successful mission and may the Lord of heaven’s army
protect our troops!”

[Rep. Dale
Strong](https://x.com/RepDaleStrong/status/2027782850213285923?s=20):
“Iran has long been the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism and
continues to build up its nuclear capabilities — presenting a threat to
America and our allies. President Trump has made clear that Iran’s
continued and escalating aggression and nuclear aspirations will not be
tolerated. I applaud the President’s commitment to holding Iran
accountable, bringing peace to the region, and protecting the security
of our nation. May God bless our troops, and may God bless the United
States of America.”

[Rep. Marlin
Stutzman](https://x.com/RepStutzman/status/2027751708315595166?s=20):
“Operation Epic Fury has begun and I support President Trump and our
troops. President Trump has been willing to make the hard and necessary
choices to produce real peace in the Middle East. The Iranian people and
the world have endured this evil regime long enough. God bless the
United States, our great military, and pray for the peace of Iran.”

[Rep. Claudia
Tenney](https://x.com/RepTenney/status/2027740402233549265?s=20): “As
the Department of War brilliantly executes Operation Epic Fury against
the despotic Islamist Iranian regime, I pray for the safety of all our
U.S. service members and allies in the region. I hope the brave Iranian
people will take back their country from the brutal mullahs, and the
people of Iran can have a future of peace and prosperity, instead of
tyranny and terrorism.”

[Rep. William
Timmons](https://x.com/RepTimmons/status/2027742518205370542?s=20):
“America is once again leading with strength. President Trump is
protecting our people and standing unshaken against threats to our
security. God bless our troops and God bless the United States of
America.”

[Rep. Derrick Van
Orden](https://x.com/RepVanOrden/status/2027740662569861240?s=20): “For
decades, the Iranian regime has fueled terror and violence across the
world. This regime has operated with impunity for far too long,
spreading chaos while threatening the security of the United States and
our partners. Their hands are stained with the blood of thousands of
Americans. It is long past time for the Iranian regime to be held
accountable for the terror it has exported and the lives it has taken.
May God bless our troops and grant them strength, wisdom, and courage.”

[Rep. Tim
Walberg](https://x.com/RepWalberg/status/2027745793927434713?s=20):
“President Trump sought repeatedly to make a deal with the Iranian
regime, which has continued to be a destabilizing force in the Middle
East. The regime has murdered tens of thousands of innocent civilians in
their own streets, supported terrorist groups that have killed thousands
of Americans, harmed our servicemembers, and threatened our national
security through their pursuit of attaining a nuclear weapon. Today, the
President announced a decisive and strategic operation to restore peace
through strength. May God bless the brave men and women of our military
who are conducting this critical operation.”

[Rep. Randy
Weber](https://x.com/TXRandy14/status/2027741938091225140?s=20): “As
events continue to unfold in the Middle East, I am closely monitoring
the situation. The United States will always defend our national
interests and stand by our allies. God bless our Brave Men and Women in
Uniform, God bless the people of Iran, and God bless America.”

[Rep. Daniel
Webster](https://x.com/RepWebster/status/2027759399905763463?s=20): “The
Iranian regime has time and again proven itself to be in opposition to
U.S. interests, values, and security. I have long agreed with @POTUS
that Iran cannot possess a nuclear weapon. President Trump afforded the
Iranian regime opportunity to secure a deal, but the regime again
crossed the President’s redline. May God be with the brave men and women
of the United States military.”

[Rep. Bruce
Westerman](https://x.com/RepWesterman/status/2027750053360627712?s=20):
“For decades, Iran has been the number one sponsor of terrorism with
actions against Americans and many other nations across the globe while
oppressing and murdering their own people. Their thirst for nuclear
weapons has further threatened regional and global stability, and their
defiance, time and time again, to comply with international standards
continues to threaten democracy around the world. My prayers are with
our brave military as they carry out this mission against a brutal and
dangerous regime.”

[Rep. Joe
Wilson](https://x.com/RepJoeWilson/status/2027749231914602519?s=20):
“The deranged terrorist regime in Tehran has pledged death to America
and Israel for decades. It has armed, funded, and trained terrorists to
commit atrocities on behalf of Iran. It has bombed American barracks,
murdered Americans, and taken Americans hostage. The regime mass exports
drones to murder Ukrainian families and invade NATO skies. Courageous
Iranians have demanded dignity only to be met with cowardly murder at
the hands of Khamenei’s thugs. You cannot negotiate with those acting in
bad faith. May God Bless our Troops and God Bless America and our
allies.”

[Rep. Rob
Wittman](https://x.com/RobWittman/status/2027768932715643285?s=20): “For
decades the Iranian regime has oppressed and murdered its citizens,
supported terror groups that have killed countless Americans, and
destabilized an entire region. In recent years, the regime has
aggressively pursued a nuclear weapon and long-range missiles capable of
striking American interest and our partners and allies. A secular,
democratic, non-nuclear Iran is good for the United States, the Middle
East, and the people of Iran who wish to enjoy the same freedoms we
cherish as Americans. I am grateful for the brave men and women of our
armed forces who have put themselves in harm’s way for the good of our
nation and the world.”

[Rep. Steve
Womack](https://x.com/rep_stevewomack/status/2027750054480506888?s=20):
“For decades, Iran has been the leading state sponsor of terror,
organizing and funding the killing of American citizens around the world
while depriving its own citizens of basic human rights. Operation Epic
Fury comes after the President pursued a peaceful and diplomatic
solution. I commend President Trump for his actions to dismantle Iran’s
global terror network and stand in solidarity with the Iranians fighting
for freedom and democracy. May God bless and protect our troops as they
defend our nation and way of life.”

[Rep. Rudy
Yakym](https://x.com/RepRudyYakym/status/2027734001398489553?s=20):
“Operation Epic Fury is a bold and decisive step by President Trump to
create real peace in the region. May God be with our troops, our allies,
and the Iranian people.”
