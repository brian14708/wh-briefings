title: President Trump Finally Ends the Madness of NPR, PBS
---
 
Last night, President Donald J. Trump [signed an executive
order](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1918134250236461197) ending
the taxpayer subsidization of National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public
Broadcasting Service (PBS) — entities that receive tens of millions of
dollars in taxpayer funds each year to spread radical, woke propaganda
disguised as “news.”

**Here are some
[examples](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1918134384638513313) of
the trash that has passed for “news” at NPR and PBS:**

-   NPR [ran a
    story](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/02/22/515668867/cannibalism-its-perfectly-natural-a-new-scientific-history-argues) titled
    “Cannibalism: It’s ‘Perfectly Natural,’” in which an author
    described eating another human’s placenta: “It was really the prep
    that made it taste good. Granted, the \[husband\] was a chef and so
    he knew how to prepare it osso bucco style and used a really nice
    wine I had brought. It smelled great. It didn’t taste bad.”
-   In 2021, NPR
    [declared](https://www.npr.org/2021/07/02/1011754245/an-npr-tradition-heres-the-reading-of-the-declaration-of-independence)
    the Declaration of Independence to be a document with “flaws and
    deeply ingrained hypocrisies.”
    -   In 2022, NPR
        [scrapped](https://www.foxnews.com/media/4th-july-npr-scraps-declaration-reading-tradition-equality-discussion)
        its decades-long Independence Day tradition of reading the
        Declaration of Independence on air to instead
        [discuss](https://www.npr.org/2022/07/04/1109667557/on-this-july-4th-what-does-equality-mean?utm_campaign=storyshare&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_medium=social)
        “[equality](https://x.com/LeilaFadel/status/1543911485465923585).”
    -   NPR subsequently
        [issued](https://www.npr.org/2019/07/04/733431874/a-july-4-npr-tradition-a-reading-of-the-declaration-of-independence#:~:text=Editor%27s%20note%20on%20July%208%2C%202022%3A%20This%20story%20quotes%20the%20U.S.%20Declaration%20of%20Independence%20%E2%80%94%20a%20document%20that%20contains%20offensive%20language%20about%20Native%20Americans%2C%20including%20a%20racial%20slur.)
        an “editor’s note” warning the Declaration of Independence is “a
        document that contains offensive language.”
-   NPR [apologized](https://x.com/NPR/status/1144659017031135234) for
    calling illegal immigrants
    “[illegal](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/100759/npr-apologizes-for-calling-illegal-immigrants-illegal/).”
-   NPR [sounded the
    alarm](https://www.npr.org/2026/01/01/1198916105/mens-health-masturbation-abstinence)

    [abstain](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/2837806/npr-wants-you-to-be-addicted-to-pornography/)
    from masturbating to pornography.
-   NPR [featured](https://www.npr.org/2024/02/14/1198909355/valentines-day-relationships-gay-animals-nature) a
    Valentine’s Day story centered around “queer animals,” in which it
    suggested the make-believe clownfish in “Finding Nemo” would’ve been
    better off as a female, that “banana slugs are hermaphrodites,” and
    that “some deer are nonbinary.”
-   PBS [devoted a panel](https://www.pbs.org/video/stay-woke-bddifp/)

-   NPR
    [routinely](https://www.npr.org/2023/02/20/1157493433/florida-bans-gender-affirming-care-trans-kids)

    the chemical and surgical mutilation of children as so-called
    “gender-affirming care” without mentioning the irreversible
    [damage](https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/gender-dysphoria-report-release.html)
    caused by these procedures.
-   In 2021, a PBS
    station [aired](https://www.foxnews.com/us/pbs-station-defends-drag-queen-kids?msockid=39cef04a7cdd669717c4e5c87d6467b6) a

    Mess.”

    nation on the “whole community of genderqueer dinosaur enthusiasts”
    and “trans-ceratops.”
-   Then-PBS White House Correspondent Yamiche Alcindor
    [characterized](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/749558/pbs-reporter-mischaracterizes-mount-rushmore-speech-as-love-letter-to-white-resentment/)
    President Trump’s patriotic 2020 Mount Rushmore speech as a love

    that promoted the “myth of America.”

    the “cousin of diet culture” known as “healthism, which is the idea
    that we have to be healthy” — as if that was a bad thing.

-   NPR [suggested](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1067210075?ft=nprml&f=1067210075#:~:text=TAGLE%3A%20We%20might,through%20intuitive%20eating.) doorway

-   PBS [produced an entire
    movie](https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/documentaries/real-boy/) celebrating
    a transgender teenager’s so-called “changing gender identity.”
-   NPR absurdly
    [claimed](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/1830520/npr-makes-a-fool-of-itself-twice-to-defend-men-competing-in-womens-sports/)
    “limited scientific evidence of physical advantage” exists between
    male and female athletes.
-   NPR [lamented](https://www.npr.org/2021/04/03/984008349/opinion-animals-deserve-gender-pronouns-too) that
    “animals deserve pronouns, too.”
-   NPR [ran a
    feature](https://www.npr.org/2022/05/29/1101224759/what-queer-ducks-can-teach-teenagers-about-sexuality-in-the-animal-kingdom) titled
    “What ‘Queer Ducks’ can teach teenagers about sexuality in the
    animal kingdom.”
-   In 2023, PBS’s *Washington Week* roundtable covered up Joe Biden’s
    clear mental decline, with far-left “journalist” Jeffrey
    Goldberg [claiming](https://newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/clay-waters/2023/09/07/pbss-washington-weeks-laugh-line-joe-biden-mentally-hes-quite-acute) Biden

-   NPR [dedicated](https://www.npr.org/2015/07/12/422311437/the-furries-have-landed-and-pittsburgh-is-giving-them-a-bear-hug) an

    [referred](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/24/798994515/president-trump-to-face-friendly-crowd-at-march-for-life)
    to pro-life Americans at the March for Life as “anti-abortion rights
    activists.”

    racial origins of fat phobia.”
-   NPR
    management [asked](https://www.thefp.com/p/npr-editor-how-npr-lost-americas-trust) its

    CNN on a one-sided narrative to “address racism” amid the Black
    Lives Matter riots.

**NPR and PBS have zero tolerance for non-leftist viewpoints:**

-   In 2020, NPR refused to cover
    the [explosive](https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/email-reveals-how-hunter-biden-introduced-ukrainian-biz-man-to-dad/) Hunter
    Biden laptop scandal in the runup to the election,
    baselessly [claiming](https://www.mediaite.com/radio/npr-explains-why-they-havent-covered-hunter-biden-laptop-story-red-flags-on-veracity-and-assertions-dont-amount-to-much/) its
    “assertions don’t amount to much” and
    [writing](https://x.com/NPRpubliceditor/status/1319281101223940096)
    they “don’t want to waste the listeners’ and readers’ time on
    stories that are just pure distractions.”
-   When a 25-year veteran NPR reporter and editor [spoke
    out](https://www.thefp.com/p/npr-editor-how-npr-lost-americas-trust) about
    the network’s obsession with liberal causes,
    they [suspended](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/16/1244962042/npr-editor-uri-berliner-suspended-essay) him.
    -   The
        editor [found](https://www.foxnews.com/media/npr-editor-found-registered-democrats-outnumbered-republicans-87-zero-newsroom) that
        registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans 87 to zero in their
        newsroom.
    -   NPR prolifically reported on the Russian collusion hoax, with
        the
        editor [describing](https://www.thefp.com/p/npr-editor-how-npr-lost-americas-trust) “\[Adam\]
        Schiff talking points” as “the drumbeat of NPR news reports.”
-   NPR CEO Katherine Maher
    once [called](https://archive.is/9Egnx) President Trump
    “racist,” [shared](https://x.com/krmaher/status/1323094291732815872) a
    photo of herself wearing a “Biden for President” campaign
    hat, [serves](https://www.judicialwatch.org/nprs-new-ceo/) on the
    board of a Soros-funded activist group,
    and [described](https://dailycaller.com/2024/04/17/new-npr-ceo-said-reverence-truth-distraction-resurfaced-ted-talk/) “reverence
    for the truth” as a “distraction.”
-   In 2023, a
    study [found](https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/rich-noyes/2023/05/16/study-taxpayer-subsidized-pbs-whacks-gop-85-negative-news) that
    congressional Republicans saw 85% negative coverage while
    congressional Democrats saw 54% positive coverage on PBS’s flagship
    news program.
-   According to a [2024
    study](https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/clay-waters/2024/12/04/pbs-news-hours-extreme-makeover-27-times-more-likely-find-far-right),
    PBS news staff used 162 variations of the term “far-right,” but only
    six variations of “far-left.”
-   Media bias rating agency AllBias — which surveyed nearly 24,000
    readers
    — [found](https://www.allsides.com/news-source/npr-editorial) NPR’s
    bias aligns with “liberal, progressive or left-wing thought and/or
    policy agendas.”
-   NPR repeatedly dismissed the theory that COVID-19 originated in a
    lab — a conclusion now deemed likely by
    the [FBI](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fbi-director-says-covid-pandemic-most-likely-originated-chinese-lab), [CIA](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cia-releases-new-analysis-covid-origins-favoring-lab-leak-theory),

    Energy](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/26/politics/covid-lab-leak-wuhan-china-intelligence/index.html).
