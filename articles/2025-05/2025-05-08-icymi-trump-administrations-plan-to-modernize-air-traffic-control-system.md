title: "ICYMI: Trump Administration\u2019s Plan to Modernize Air Traffic Control System"
---
 
Today, President Donald J. Trump and Secretary of Transportation Sean
Duffy
[unveiled](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1920537933737550087) a
[plan](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/us-transportation-secretary-sean-p-duffy-unveils-plan-build-brand-new-state-art-air)
to completely overhaul the nation’s air traffic control system — taking
action where the Biden Administration refused, despite repeat
[warnings](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-107001).

**The announcement — which builds on the Trump Administration’s
unprecedented actions to secure America’s skies and improve air travel —
was praised by the nation’s major airlines:**

-   **United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby:** “This really is an historic day
    — a day I have been looking forward to my entire career when I felt
    like we have turned the corner and are on the path to give the
    United States the best-in-class air traffic control system that the
    citizens of the United States deserve.”
-   **American Airlines CEO Robert Isom:** “I’ve been in the airline
    business a long time, and that entire time, I’ve known that the U.S.
    air traffic control system was operating on antiquated technology.
    This plan from President Trump and Secretary Duffy is absolutely the
    best opportunity that we’ve had in decades to do something about our
    outdated air traffic control infrastructure and build a
    best-in-class system that our country deserves.”
-   **Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian:** “I want to especially thank
    Secretary Duffy and the Administration for gathering us all here
    today and taking such a strong approach to overhauling our air
    traffic control system in the U.S. This has been a long time
    coming.”
-   **Southwest Airlines CEO Bob Jordan:** “I cannot say enough thanks
    to Secretary Duffy, to the administration, to President Trump for
    the stellar leadership to bring everyone together on this problem.
    This challenge is decades old, but I am absolutely confident that we
    can get this done and that we are finally going to address the real
    problem.”
-   **JetBlue CEO Joanna Geraghty:** “We very much appreciate the
    leadership that you are bringing to this ATC modernization effort …
    This has quite literally been our number one priority for decades. I
    am proud to stand here today with what appears to be a solution and
    path to move forward.”

**Key aspects of the Trump Administration’s**
[**plan**](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/brand-new-air-traffic-control-system-plan)
**include:**

-   Replacing outdated infrastructure with state-of-the-art fiber,
    wireless, and satellite technologies at over 4,600 air traffic
    control sites — including 25,000 new radios, 600+ new radars, and
    475 new voice switches.
-   Building six new air traffic control coordination centers for the
    first time in six decades.
-   Replacing towers and TRACONs and implementing modern hardware and
    software at all air traffic facilities to create a common platform
    throughout the network.
