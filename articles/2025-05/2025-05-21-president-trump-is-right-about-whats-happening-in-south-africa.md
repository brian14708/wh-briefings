title: "President Trump is Right About What\u2019s Happening in South Africa"
---
 
Today, President Donald J. Trump showed the world the shocking treatment
of white farmers in South Africa — including with a [video
montage](https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1925232291220951370) that
highlighted the discrimination and violence targeted at the innocent
minority victims.

**President Trump was exactly right.**

-   “We left because of the attacks. You can’t stay on a farm as a white
    person in South Africa. You know you’ll be killed,”
    [said](https://x.com/WillCainShow_/status/1925289116637278626) one
    South African refugee.

    -   The law is vague, stating that expropriation is allowed in

        interest” to do so.
-   [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjevg2vlwk4o): “Close to
    70,000 South Africans have expressed interest in moving to the US
    following Washington’s offer to resettle people from the country’s

    -   “The political rally was winding down when the brash leader of a
        leftist South African party grabbed the microphone and began to
        stomp and chant. Thousands of supporters joined in, and when he
        reached the climax, they pointed their fingers in the air like
        guns. ‘Kill the Boer!’ Julius Malema chanted, referring to white
        farmers. The crowd in a stadium in Johannesburg on Saturday
        roared back in approval.”
