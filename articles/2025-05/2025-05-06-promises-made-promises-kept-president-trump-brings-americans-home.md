title: 'Promises Made, Promises Kept: President Trump Brings Americans Home'
---
 
Since taking office, President Donald J. Trump and his administration
have secured the release of 47 detained Americans abroad — and that’s
just the beginning as countries around the world respond to our renewed
display of American strength and President Trump’s commitment to leaving
no American behind.

The released American citizens include:

**Ksenia Karelina — an American ballet dancer who was wrongfully
detained in a Russian penal colony for 14 months —** [**returned
home**](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114319263138009661)
**in April.**

-   “Mr. Trump, I’m so, so grateful for you to bring me home and for
    \[the\] American government. And I never felt more blessed to be
    American — and I’m so, so happy to get home. Thank you,” [Karelina
    said](https://www.foxnews.com/us/russian-american-ballerina-ksenia-karelina-has-message-trump-after-release-from-russia).

Trump made to Fogel’s 95-year-old mother, Malphine.**

-   “President Trump is a hero … I will forever be indebted to President
    Trump, to Steve \[Witkoff\] over there — what a dynamic man this guy
    is. When I met him, the energy, the can-do attitude just exudes from
    his body,”
    [Fogel said](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1889521780005503240).

joining Americans Ryan Corbett and William McKenty, who were released on

-   “President Trump — amazing. Thank God he’s in the White House where
    he’s at and thank God he got me out … I’m in debt with everybody
    that was involved in this equation because they got me home. A free
    American individual, free from the hands of these people that
    abducted because of my U.S. passport, basically — and I’m just
    thankful. I got no words to express my gratitude for my liberty, my
    freedom,” [Glezmann
    said](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1903105044523655445).
