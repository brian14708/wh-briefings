title: 'WHAT THEY ARE SAYING: President Trump Unleashes Nuclear Energy to Power the
  Future'
---
 
Today, President Donald J. Trump took a series of executive actions to
unleash nuclear energy in the U.S. as part of the administration’s
effort to secure the energy future of America and unleash American
energy dominance.

**Joining President Trump were some of the top leaders in nuclear
energy:**

-   “We have some of the largest companies in the world — the
    hyper-scalers — who need this energy for AI, who are now working
    with us to fund the development and construction of the
    next-generation nuclear,”

    **Constellation Energy CEO Joseph Dominguez**. “Nuclear is a 24/7
    resource. These datacenters run 24/7. Some of them will cost 2, 300
    billion, and they want to run them all the time so we can’t use
    intermittent resources. We need something that’s always on 24/7 and
    nothing does that better than nuclear … The problem in the industry
    has historically been regulatory delay.”
-   “We’re working on small, next generation reactors that take
    technology America invented, developed, and pioneered, and bringing
    it to the market after it sat on the shelves of history for about 40
    years — and it’s because of the actions that you’re doing today that
    are going to help unleash that. Changing the permitting dynamics is
    going to help things move faster,”
    [**said**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1926000695188095121)
    **Oklo CEO Jacob DeWitte**.
-   “Just like car engines need fuel, nuclear reactors need fuel. Right
    now, the U.S. is completely dependent on other countries to make the
    key step of enrichment in this fuel, and these Executive Orders are
    going to pave the way for the U.S. to regain its lead,”
    [**said**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1925997040271548762)
    **General Matter CEO Scott Nolan**.
