Angel Families — whose lives have been shattered by illegal immigrant
criminals with no right to be in the country — are calling on Congress
to pass President Donald J. Trump’s One, Big, Beautiful Bill, [the *New
York Post*
reports](https://nypost.com/2025/05/21/us-news/angel-families-urge-republicans-to-pass-big-beautiful-bill-and-secure-border-to-prevent-tragedies/).

*“’Angel families’ whose loved ones have been killed by illegal
immigrants and gang members are urging congressional Republicans to pass
President Trump’s ‘big beautiful bill’ to seal the border and fast-track
deportations, The* Post *can exclusively reveal.*

*‘We write to you not as politicians or pundits, but as parents —
mothers and fathers who have buried our children because the United
States government failed to secure its border,’ they said in an open
letter to Congress. ‘There can be no justice for our children, but there
can be accountability. There can be action. And there must be change,’
they added.*

*‘We urge every member of Congress to support the ‘One Big Beautiful
Bill’ and vote to secure the border, protect our communities, and
prevent the next American family from living our nightmare.’*

*More than 60 angel relatives co-signed the letter, including the mother
of Jocelyn Nungaray, whose 12-year-old daughter was allegedly murdered
by two illegal migrants, and the family of Laken Riley, a Georgia
nursing student who was killed by a Tren de Aragua gang member from
Venezuela. \[…\]*

*In their letter, the ‘angel families’ said that for too long they ‘have
been ignored, dismissed, or labeled as political props.’*

*‘Every single one of us is living with a permanent hole in our lives
because an illegal immigrant, who never should have been in this
country, was allowed to stay and take an innocent life,’ they said.*

*‘These were preventable tragedies. And yet, year after year, Washington
offers excuses instead* *of solutions. That must end now.’”*
