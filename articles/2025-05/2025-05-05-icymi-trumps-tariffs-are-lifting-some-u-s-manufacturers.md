President Donald J. Trump’s relentless pursuit of an American
manufacturing renaissance is “boosting demand for some U.S.-made goods,
with smaller players reaping the early benefits,” [writes *The Wall
Street
Journal*](https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/trumps-tariffs-are-lifting-some-u-s-manufacturers-06b4c6e1),
as companies onshore production and buy their products in America.

**Here are a few examples from the**
[**story**](https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/trumps-tariffs-are-lifting-some-u-s-manufacturers-06b4c6e1)**:**

-   “‘We are swamped. We are running 24 hours a day, seven days a week
    in both Chicago and Cleveland,’ said Jack Schron, president of
    Jergens Inc., which makes manufacturing tools, including industrial
    screwdrivers, clamps and hoists. Schron said his factories in Ohio
    and Illinois are ‘going like gangbusters,’ partly owing to new
    orders from customers looking to avoid paying import tariffs.”
-   “Donny Chaplin, president of Grand River Rubber & Plastics in
    Ashtabula, Ohio, said he has seen a rush of new inquiries and
    orders. Two previous customers that had switched to Chinese
    suppliers a few years ago came back in recent days wanting to buy
    rubber gaskets from Grand River again, for the plastic pails they
    manufacture. Three manufacturers of oil filters also got in touch,
    wanting to shift business from China, with two already placing
    orders. All together, the new business will be worth about $5
    million a year if it is completed, or roughly 10% of Grand River’s
    revenue. That might require the company to hire new employees and
    expand production lines.”
-   “The tariffs are a lifeline for the U.S. companies that sprang up
    during the Covid-19 pandemic to produce face masks, rubber gloves
    and other personal protective equipment, after shipments from Asia
    declined. The companies struggled in the pandemic’s aftermath, when
    hospitals and clinics abandoned U.S. manufacturers and returned to
    lower-cost suppliers in China, U.S. executives said. But new U.S.
    tariffs on rubber gloves from China have doubled the price from a
    few months ago, and ‘the folks that are relying on China are
    scrambling for other sources,’ said Alan Rust, chief growth officer
    for SafeSource Direct … ‘We were getting stiffed for a very long
    time, but just recently we’ve been getting a lot more inquiries.’”
-   “Employees for Massachusetts-based AccuRounds are working overtime
    to accommodate rising orders for the company’s shafts, valves and
    other steel components. The company recently added two customers
    that had shifted business from AccuRounds to suppliers in Singapore
    and China in recent years. First-quarter sales were 20% higher from
    a year earlier, said Chief Executive Michael Tamasi.”
-   “Michigan-based Whirlpool, which assembles 80% of its U.S.
    appliances at domestic factories, says its Asian competitors have
    had an unfair advantage, as they manufacture their appliances
    overseas but haven’t been paying import tariffs on them since 2023,
    when one imposed during Trump’s first term expired. Those rivals’
    access to cheaper components and steel in Asia helps give them a
    $150 retail price advantage on washers, Whirlpool says. Chief
    Executive Marc Bitzer said the latest tariffs on imported assembled
    appliances should help close the price gap. ‘The tariffs will
    finally help create a level playing field for Whirlpool,’ he said in
    April during a call with analysts.”

**Meanwhile, *The Washington Post***
[**reports**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/04/trump-tariffs-us-manufacturing/)**:**

-   “At the local Excel Dryer plant, William Gagnon, the chief operating
    officer, is unfazed. In fact, President Donald Trump’s import taxes
    so far have been nothing but good news for one of the world’s
    largest makers of restroom hand dryers. Gagnon, 48, credits Trump’s
    first-term tariffs with changing the math on production location
    decisions … the president’s second-term ‘reciprocal’ tariffs might
    result in the elimination of trade barriers that prevent Excel’s
    high-velocity hand dryers from dominating markets in countries such
    as Brazil and Australia … By making foreign goods more expensive,
    the import taxes make domestic suppliers more competitive while also
    discouraging Americans from purchasing cheap Chinese copies of
    Excel’s hand dryers. The tariffs also offer hope of prying open
    foreign markets … The tariffs Trump imposed on China this year also
    have brought more work home for one of Excel Dryer’s local
    suppliers: Double A Molding in Monson, Massachusetts … As Trump
    escalated his trade spat with China in recent weeks, Double A felt
    the effects.”
