title: "ICYMI: \u201CA Common Sense Budget Reconciliation Bill\u201D"

House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Brett Guthrie [makes the
case](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/a-common-sense-budget-reconciliation-bill-house-energy-and-commerce-committee-d8ab0d71)
in *The Wall Street Journal* for President Donald J. Trump’s top
legislative priorities in the One Big, Beautiful Bill — slashing waste,
strengthening Medicaid, and giving Americans a massive tax cut, to name
a few.

**Rep. Guthrie writes:  
**  
*“When President Trump took the podium for his Second Inaugural Address,
he promised a ‘revolution of common sense’ that would launch a
generation of growth, health and prosperity. Today, our country faces
numerous threats to that goal. Medicaid waste and abuse threatens the
well-being of America’s most vulnerable as the looming expiration of
important 2017 tax reforms throws a shadow over U.S. industry.
Republicans’ best chance to secure the president’s inaugural promise is
this year’s reconciliation bill.”
