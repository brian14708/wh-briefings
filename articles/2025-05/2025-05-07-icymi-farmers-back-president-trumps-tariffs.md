[**latest**](https://ag.purdue.edu/commercialag/ageconomybarometer/farmer-sentiment-improves-as-long-term-optimism-outweighs-tariff-concerns/)
**Purdue University-CME Group Ag Economy Barometer:**

-   70% of farmers expect the President Trump’s tariffs to strengthen
    the agricultural economy in the long-term.
-   Farmer sentiment improved in April, marked by rises in current and
    future expectations.
-   The Farm Capital Investment Index rose to its highest reading since
    May 2021.
    -   “This month, one out of four respondents said it was a good time
        to make large investments, nearly double the percentage of
        respondents who said it was a good time to invest when surveyed
        from May through October of last year.”
-   The Farm Financial Performance Index “marked the fourth month in a
    row that the index was above 100, indicating that producers expect
    financial performance this year to equal or slightly exceed the
    year-ago level.”
