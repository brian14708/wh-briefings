title: 20 Reasons Why Congress Must Unite Behind the One, Big, Beautiful Bill
---
 
Congressional Republicans [MUST
unite](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1923427418913616200) to pass
President Donald J. Trump’s One, Big, Beautiful Bill and take advantage
of the once-in-a-generation opportunity they were given by voters.

**Here are 20 reasons why Congress must unite behind the One, Big,
Beautiful Bill:**

1.  **It delivers the largest tax cut in American history.** This means
    an [extra
    $5,000](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Economic-Impact-of-Extending-TCJA-Provisions.pdf)
    in Americans’ pockets with a DOUBLE-DIGIT percent
    [DECREASE](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/x-23-25.pdf)
    to their tax bills. Americans earning between $30,000 and $80,000
    will pay around [15% less in
    taxes](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/05/13/congress/average-taxpayers-tax-bills-set-to-fall-under-house-tax-package-forecasters-say-00347318).  
2.  **It includes NO TAX ON TIPS and NO TAX ON OVERTIME.** This makes
    good on two of President Trump’s cornerstone campaign promises and
    will benefit hardworking Americans where they need it the most —
    their paychecks.  
3.  **It delivers Big, Beautiful Deportations.** The bill
    [permanently](https://homeland.house.gov/2025/04/27/house-homeland-security-committee-releases-text-for-budget-reconciliation-recommendations/)
    secures our borders by making the largest border security investment
    in history, funding at least one million annual removals of illegal
    immigrants and [ramping

    “mass deportation operations to a level never before seen in
    American history.”  
4.  **It finishes President Trump’s border wall.** As a result, 701
    miles of primary wall, 900 miles of river barriers, 629 miles of
    secondary barriers, and 141 miles of vehicle and pedestrian barriers
    will be
    [constructed](https://homeland.house.gov/2025/04/29/homeland-republicans-advance-funding-recommendations-to-continue-president-trumps-border-security-victory-bolster-frontline-personnel-for-years-to-come/)
    — stopping deadly fentanyl from flowing into our communities and
    securing the border from dangerous illegal immigrant murderers and
    rapists.  
5.  **It boosts Border Patrol and ICE agents on the frontlines.** It
    empowers immigration authorities to carry out their mission by
    hiring 10,000 new ICE personnel, 5,000 new customs officers, and
    3,000 new Border Patrol agents — and gives $10,000 bonuses in each
    of the next four years to agents on the frontlines.  
6.  **It protects Medicaid for Americans by kicking 1.4 million illegals
    off the benefits.** This bill eliminates waste, fraud, and abuse by
    ending benefits for at least [1.4
    million](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/05/15/democrat-messaging-falters-as-they-ask-constituents-to-foot-medicaid-costs-for-1-4-million-illegal-aliens/)
    illegal immigrants who are gaming the system.  
7.  **It requires able-bodied Americans to work if they receive
    benefits.** With 4.8 million able-bodied adults choosing not to
    work, The One, Big, Beautiful Bill puts work requirements in place
    and supports them as they find dignity through employment.  
8.  **It reverses the spending curse plaguing Washington, D.C.** The
    legislation delivers the largest deficit reduction in nearly 30
    years, with [$1.6
    trillion](https://x.com/russvought/status/1923488257888879103) in
    mandatory savings.  
9.  **It ends taxpayer-funded sex change for minors.** It
    [reverses](https://d1dth6e84htgma.cloudfront.net/05_13_2025_FCMU_Memorandum_UPDATED_55a74a132a.pdf)
    the [Biden-era
    mandate](https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/issue-brief/the-biden-administrations-final-rule-on-section-1557-non-discrimination-regulations-under-the-aca/)
    that Medicaid

    so-called “gender transition” procedures for minors — ending the
    taxpayer-funded chemical castration and mutilation of American
    children.  
10. **It provides historic tax relief to Social Security recipients.**
    It slashes taxes on seniors’ Social Security benefits.  
11. **It will give Americans PERMANENT tax relief through the Trump Tax
    Cuts.** If the bill doesn’t pass, Americans will see the largest
    [tax
    increase](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/04/heres-what-happens-if-trump-tax-cuts-arent-extended/)
    in history.  
12. **It finally modernizes air traffic control, fulfilling President
    Trump’s **[**plan**](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/us-transportation-secretary-sean-p-duffy-unveils-plan-build-brand-new-state-art-air)** to
    completely**
    [**overhaul**](https://transportation.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=408584)
    **the systems that keep Americans flying safely and efficiently.**
    This will allow President Trump to update our air traffic control
    systems and act where the Biden Administration failed (despite
    repeated [warnings](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-107001)).  
13. **It ends the taxpayer-funded Green New Scam.** The legislation
    repeals or phases out every “green” corporate welfare subsidy in
    Democrats’ so-called “Inflation Reduction Act,” immediately stops
    credits from flowing to China and saves taxpayers $500+ billion
    every year, and reverses electric vehicle mandates that let radical
    climate activists set the standards for American energy.  
14. **It incentivizes MADE IN AMERICA.** It rewards companies that build
    their products in America with lower taxes — and allows Americans
    who buy an American-made vehicle to fully deduct their auto loan
    interest.  
15. **It is pro-family.** The One, Big, Beautiful Bill increases the
    child tax credit, establishes MAGA Accounts for newborns to start
    saving, and strengthens paid family leave.  
16. **It repeals Democrats’ insane attack on the gig economy.** It
    repeals the requirement that Venmo, PayPal, and other gig
    transactions over $600 be reported to the IRS.  
17. **It protects family farmers.** The bill prevents the greedy death
    tax from hitting two million family-owned farms who would otherwise
    see their exemptions cut in half and [cuts
    taxes](https://x.com/RepJasonSmith/status/1924469450209636454) on
    farmers by over $10 billion.  
18. **It’s a once-in-a-generation chance to revolutionize our nation’s
    defense capabilities and protect the homeland against new threats.**
    It funds President Trump’s Golden Dome, invests in American
    shipbuilding, and modernizes our military.  
19. **It unleashes American energy dominance.** The legislation
    increases onshore and offshore oil and gas leases, which provides
    certainty for energy producers, spurs job growth, and makes energy
    more affordable for American consumers.  
20. **It boosts American mineral development.** This bill increases
    mining of domestic minerals and makes America less dependent on
    foreign adversaries for critical minerals.
