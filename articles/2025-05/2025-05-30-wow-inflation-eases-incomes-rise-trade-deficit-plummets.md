**“This is a GREAT four-month start to any year,”**
[exclaimed](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1928436481044910168) CNBC’s
Rick Santelli as brand new economic indicators show inflation is down,
incomes are up, and the trade deficit is narrowing — shattering
economists’ expectations once again.

-   **INFLATION IS DOWN: **“Inflation rate slipped to 2.1% in April,
    lower than expected, Fed’s preferred gauge shows,” [CNBC
    reports](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/30/inflation-rate-slipped-to-2point1percent-in-april-lower-than-expected-feds-preferred-gauge-shows.html).
-   **INCOME IS UP: **Personal
    income [increased](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1928436481044910168) 0.8%
    in April — “almost TRIPLE the expectations.” “They’re powerful
    numbers — up 0.6% in January, up 0.7% in February, up 0.5% last
    month, up 0.8% this month. This is a GREAT four-month start to any
    year.”
    -   [CNBC](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1928437358594060642):
        “The income numbers, really, for the first four months of year —
        they’re stellar … Why don’t we give credit where credit is due?
        Income really shooting up.”
-   **TRADE DEFICIT NARROWS: **It was the [largest monthly
    decline](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-tariffs-trade-war-0530-2025/card/goods-trade-deficit-plummets-in-april-wB0oMVhzSBFXrMprMSlY?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAilOJGHrEEnoww65Ru9oa_NLJjEGLdHZMN22-e21zC6usAYb-FRzLpLhLxhZNg%3D&gaa_ts=6839b173&gaa_sig=LDOEWY5PAhkA4Ei_Zc5EEzDBgmv2wCS5CdL1VH0rx1_0yag2sk64wO0fWyZotu6qzlhWVjVgpiu-N9a-j5rmaA%3D%3D) in
    the trade deficit on record.
    -   [CNBC](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1928439733048270977):
        “We cut it in HALF!? … This really does underscore how the
        movement of goods and services has really changed due to a
        variety of tariff-related issues.”
