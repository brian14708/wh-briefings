*“This is the second month in a row where the jobs report has beat
expectations. Wages are continuing to rise and labor force participation
is increasing. This is exactly what we want to see. More Americans
working for higher wages. More winning is on the way!”* — Press
Secretary Karoline Leavitt

**Here’s what they’re saying:**

-   [Economist Steve
    Moore](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1918289985943319032):
    “This is an amazing report. The labor force participation rate rose
    — so this is a really strong number.”
-   [Fox Business Network’s Charles
    Payne](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1918289647979151628):
    “Transportation and warehousing — those are the jobs that were
    supposed to be hit, right? Up 29,000 … Maybe some of this
    manufacturing, some of these deals that the White House has
    announced, maybe we’re starting to see that already play out.”
-   [Fox Business Network’s Maria
    Bartiromo](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1918290644625199239):
    “As President Trump would say, ‘It’s going to be the best economy
    anybody has ever seen.’ Look, we’ve got a market that is reflecting
    that.”
-   [ERShares CEO Joel Shulman,
    Ph.D.](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1918290079081996347):
    “This is very encouraging because we’re already seeing many of the
    companies dependent upon foreign suppliers already reshoring some of
    their jobs.”
-   [Former Toys “R” Us CEO Gerald
    Storch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1918290273538277633):
    “We’re going to be in great shape.”
