*“President Trump’s proposed tax cuts, encapsulated in the ‘One, Big,
Beautiful Bill,’ aim to extend the pro-growth and pro-worker legacy of
the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the White House told exclusively
to The National News Desk.*

*The TCJA previously cut taxes across the board for working families,
allowing Americans to allocate more of their earnings toward family,
community, and future investments.*

*This initiative, along with business tax provisions, spurred a
blue-collar boom characterized by record-high income gains, record-low
poverty, and significant wage increases, particularly for low-wage
workers, according to the White House. \[…\]*

*The ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill,’ according to the White House, seeks to
further this growth by creating incentives to expand America’s domestic
manufacturing base and providing targeted relief to workers affected by
high inflation and sectoral declines.*

*Some of the key provisions provided by the Trump administration include
eliminating taxes on tips and overtime, saving workers approximately
$1,675 and up to $1,750 per year.*

*The bill also proposes temporary full expensing for new factories and
lower tax rates on domestic manufacturing to enhance the industrial base
and boost economic opportunities.*

*According to the White House, Enhanced Opportunity Zone incentives are
expected to drive over $100 billion in investment, create more than 1
million new jobs, and lead to the development of hundreds of thousands
of new homes in distressed communities, particularly in rural areas.*

*The Joint Committee on Taxation reported that the percentage decline in
federal taxes is smaller for the top 1 percent under the bill, resulting
in them taking on a greater share of total federal taxes.*

*The White House says that if the bill fails to pass, it could result in
a $4 trillion tax hike, potentially leading to recessionary
challenges.”*
