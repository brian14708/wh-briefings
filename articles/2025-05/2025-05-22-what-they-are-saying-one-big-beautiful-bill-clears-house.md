---
 
President Donald J. Trump‚Äôs One, Big, Beautiful Bill ‚Äî a
once-in-a-generation opportunity to cement an America First agenda of
prosperity, opportunity, and security into law ‚Äî is one step closer to
the finish line following its passage by the House of Representatives.

**Here‚Äôs what they‚Äôre saying about the One, Big, Beautiful Bill:**

[American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy
Duvall](https://www.fb.org/news-release/farm-bureau-applauds-house-passage-of-reconciliation-package):
‚ÄúFarm Bureau applauds the House passage of H.R.1, which modernizes farm
bill programs and extends and improves critical tax provisions that
benefit America‚Äôs small farmers and ranchers. Updated reference prices
will provide more certainty for farmers struggling through tough
economic times. Making business tax deductions permanent and continuing
current estate tax exemptions will ensure thousands of families will be
able to pass their farms to the next generation. We urge the Senate to
work together and swiftly pass legislation to deliver much-needed relief
to America‚Äôs farm and ranch families.‚Äù

[U.S. Chamber of Commerce Executive Vice President Neil
Bradley](https://www.uschamber.com/taxes/u-s-chamber-applauds-house-passage-of-one-big-beautiful-bill-act):
‚ÄúThe House sent a clear message today‚ÄîAmerican workers and businesses
want and need permanent tax relief. A competitive, pro-growth tax code
doesn‚Äôt just grow the overall U.S. economy, it raises wages for workers
and improves the lives of Americans. The legislation passed out of the
House this morning contains critical measures that support main street
businesses, enhance America‚Äôs global competitiveness, and bolster
sustained economic growth. The Chamber commends Speaker Johnson for his
leadership and commitment to ensuring the permanence of President
Trump‚Äôs pro-growth tax reforms, and applauds the lawmakers involved in
driving this effort forward. We encourage the Senate to continue to move
the legislative process forward to deliver lasting benefits for American
workers and businesses.‚Äù

[Airlines for
America](https://www.airlines.org/news-update/statement-from-airlines-for-america-4/):
‚ÄúA4A commends the House for passing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act which
includes a critical investment of $12.5 billion for modernizing the
Federal Aviation Administration‚Äôs air traffic facilities, systems and
infrastructure. ATC staffing shortages and antiquated equipment, such as
copper wires, floppy disks and paper strips, have been a serious concern
for years‚Äîwe are past time to make meaningful change and ensure that the
United States has a world-class aviation system. This funding is a vital
down payment on updating the system that guides 27,000 flights, 2.7
million passengers and 61,000 tons of cargo every day. The legislation
also makes smart, strategic investments in Customs and Border Protection
personnel and training for the aviation workforce of tomorrow while
supporting American energy dominance in aviation fuel production. We
encourage the Senate to move swiftly to pass this bill and send it to
the President.‚Äù

[National Cattlemen‚Äôs Beef Association President Buck
Wehrbein](https://www.ncba.org/news-media/news/details/43152/ncba-priorities-approved-in-house-reconciliation-bill):
‚ÄúCattle farmers and ranchers need Congress to invest in cattle health,
strengthen our resources against foreign animal disease, support
producers recovering from disasters or depredation, and pass tax relief
that protects family farms and ranches for future generations.
Thankfully, this reconciliation bill includes all these key priorities.
NCBA was proud to help pass this bill in the House and we will continue
pushing for these key policies until the bill is signed into law.‚Äù

[Uber CEO Dara
Khosrowshahi](https://x.com/dkhos/status/1925546174184137000): ‚ÄúBig news
from DC‚Äîthe House just passed President Trump‚Äôs tax bill, bringing No
Tax On Tips one step closer to the finish line. While it still needs to
clear the Senate, this is a big win for hardworking @Uber drivers and
couriers across the country üëè‚Äù

[Job Creators Network CEO Alfredo
Ortiz](https://x.com/JobCreatorsUSA/status/1925533044443648236):
‚ÄúCongratulations to President Trump and Speaker Johnson for passing
their reconciliation bill in the House. This bill offers historic tax
cuts for small businesses and ordinary Americans. By making the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act permanent and expanding key provisions, such as the small
business tax deduction, which Job Creators Network was the loudest voice
for, this bill offers significant tax relief for decades to come. It
will allow small businesses, the backbone of the American economy, to
expand, hire, raise wages, and reinvest in their communities, ushering
in a new economic Golden Age. On behalf of all small businesses, JCN
thanks President Trump and Speaker Johnson for their leadership in
passing this bill, which the media said couldn‚Äôt be done on this
aggressive timeline. Now it‚Äôs time for the Senate to follow suit and
pass similar legislation, which includes the House‚Äôs key small business
tax cuts, as soon as possible.‚Äù

‚ÄúToday‚Äôs House passage of this historic legislation marks a major
victory for manufacturers across America. This pro-growth legislation
preserves crucial tax policies that will enable manufacturers to create
jobs, invest in their communities, grow here at home and compete
globally. In short, this is a manufacturers‚Äô bill ‚Ä¶ This is a pivotal
moment. It‚Äôs time to double down on policies that encourage
manufacturers to invest and create jobs in America and keep our industry
strong and our nation competitive on the world stage‚Äîbecause when
manufacturing wins, America wins.‚Äù

[Business Roundtable President and COO Kristen
Silverberg](https://www.businessroundtable.org/business-roundtable-applauds-house-passage-of-reconciliation-bill):

milestone toward extending and strengthening President Trump‚Äôs historic
tax reform. Business Roundtable commends the House on taking a giant
step forward to protect and boost the economic benefits that tax reform
delivered for American businesses, workers and families. By maintaining
a competitive corporate tax rate and enhancing essential domestic and
international tax provisions, the House budget reconciliation bill will
help fuel U.S. investment, innovation and economic growth. As the Senate
prepares to act, we stand ready to continue working with Congress and
the Administration to pass the most competitive, pro-growth tax package
possible.‚Äù

[American Petroleum Institute President and CEO Mike

‚ÄúWe applaud the House of Representatives for passing the One Big
Beautiful Bill Act to help restore American energy dominance. By
preserving competitive tax policies, beginning to reverse the ‚Äòmethane
fee,‚Äô opening lease sales and advancing important progress on
permitting, this historic legislation is a win for our nation‚Äôs energy
future. We look forward to working with the Senate to strengthen
pro-investment provisions and keep America at the forefront of energy
innovation.‚Äù

[National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors CEO Eric
Hoplin](https://www.naw.org/naw-applauds-house-passage-of-the-one-big-beautiful-bill/):

leadership for championing this pro-business, pro-worker legislation.
This is a win for the people who roll up their sleeves every day to
power our economy, entrepreneurs who build businesses from the ground
up, and the workers who keep them running. We urge the Senate to act
swiftly and send this bill to the President‚Äôs desk so America‚Äôs job
creators and workers can keep driving our economy forward. The bill
makes the 199A deduction permanent and expands it to 23%, helping
millions of small businesses, including most wholesaler-distributors. It
raises the death tax exemption, protecting family-owned businesses, and
restores vital incentives that encourage investment, innovation, and
long-term economic growth.‚Äù

[Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council President and CEO Karen
Kerrigan](https://sbecouncil.org/2025/05/22/sbe-council-cheers-u-s-house-passage-of-one-big-beautiful-bill-urges-prompt-senate-action/):
‚ÄúH.R. 1 delivers a big, beautiful boost to U.S. entrepreneurship and
small businesses. SBE Council applauds U.S. House passage of this
critically important legislation. In addition to permanent tax relief
and incentives that will help entrepreneurs and small business owners
grow their firms, level up their businesses, and support their
employees, various measures in the legislation correctly right-fit
various federal programs and functions that have gone awry and
consequently have undermined fiscal accountability and the private
sector. Time is of the essence in getting the One Big Beautiful Bill to
President Trump‚Äôs desk, and we urge the U.S. Senate to move post haste
on the work that must be done to deliver the big benefits of the package
to small business owners, all taxpayers, and the U.S. economy.‚Äù

infrastructure and strengthening the controller workforce to enhance
safety and efficiency in the National Airspace System. Business
aviation‚Äôs ability to serve citizens, companies and communities is only
possible because the U.S. leads the world in aviation ‚Ä¶ As the House

forward to working with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to advance
these forward-looking provisions that bolster an essential industry,
support countless workers and promote American competitiveness.‚Äù

unions‚Äô not-for-profit tax status as part of H.R. 1 and recognizing the
industry‚Äôs importance to strong Main Streets across the country. More
than 142 million Americans trust and rely on credit unions to achieve
their American Dream, and this bill allows them to continue on their

the credit union tax status as they consider this legislation.‚Äù

Long](https://x.com/GOPMajorityWhip/status/1924850977774920034): ‚ÄúThese

Maietta](https://www.ahla.com/news/ahla-statement-us-house-passed-reconciliation-package):
‚ÄúThis is a win for Main Street businesses. We commend lawmakers for
including critical tax provisions in the budget reconciliation bill that
will prevent a tax increase on American workers and the small businesses
that are the backbone of America‚Äôs hotel and lodging industry. This is a
critical step to stave off the expiration of important tax provisions
that will provide our members, the majority of whom are small business
owners, the level of certainty they need to effectively operate their
businesses. We urge the U.S. Senate to swiftly pass this legislation and
send it to President Trump‚Äôs desk.‚Äù

lawmakers who stand boldly behind parents. We will continue to stand
with them to achieve this goal.‚Äù

especially pleased to see the preservation of Section 1031 like-kind
exchanges, which play a vital role in fueling real estate investment,
promoting property improvements and driving local economic growth.
Provisions supporting homeownership, including those related to mortgage
interest and capital gains exclusions, help provide certainty for

you to the House and the leadership of President Trump in passing the
Big Beautiful Bill. This Bill will add infrastructure and technology to
make our gains on the borders permanent. It puts more boots on the
ground to target cartel activity, alien smuggling, child trafficking and
drug smuggling.¬† It will provide the needed funds and manpower to
increase the great work of ICE on our deportation operations nationwide.
We have many more public safety and national security threats to remove.
This funding will allow ICE to vastly increase these efforts and keep
the promise to America that we will enforce immigration law against
those that are in this country illegally.¬† Now the Senate needs to step
up. Border Security and National Security should not be a partisan
issue. Let‚Äôs get this done!‚Äù
