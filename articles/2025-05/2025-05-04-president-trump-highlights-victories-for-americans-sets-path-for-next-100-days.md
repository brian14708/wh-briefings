title: President Trump Highlights Victories for Americans, Sets Path For Next 100
  Days
---
 
President Donald J. Trump, in an exclusive interview on Meet the Press,
outlined the historic successes of his first 100 days — and charted the
course for many more victories to come. President Trump sent a clear
message: he will not relent in his mandate to secure our borders, rid
our country of dangerous criminals, lower prices, end the globalist
trade policies that have ripped off American workers and businesses for
decades, and Make America Great Again.

**Here are the top moments you missed:**

    prices**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1919045057820168238)**:**
    “Prices are down on groceries. Prices are down for oil. Prices are
    down for all energy. Prices are down at tremendous numbers for
    gasoline.”
-   [**On securing the
    border**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1919021066699075897)**:**
    “It’s really secure. When you say that, doesn’t it just sound good
    after being abused for years by an incompetent President?”
-   [**On protecting Medicaid, Medicare, and Social
    Security**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1919028908466315314)**:**

    immigrants**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1919022289397452899)**:**
    “We have thousands of people … some of the worst, most dangerous on
    earth — and I was elected to get them the hell out of here, and the
    courts are holding me from doing it.”
-   [**On
    tariffs**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1919105674165833752)**:**
    “Remember — there are no tariffs if you build your product here.

-   [**On the auto
    industry**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1919023203856286203)**:**
    “What about the car business? They’re going to make a fortune
    because of the tariffs. The head of the union, who was no fan of
    mine … He’s saying, ‘Wow, what Trump’s done for the automobile, I
    can’t believe it … We’ve been waiting 40 years for somebody to do
    what Trump is doing.’”
-   [**On
    Iran**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1919124111860625610)**:**
    “I want Iran to be really successful, really great, really
    fantastic. The only thing they can’t have is a nuclear weapon … The
    Iranian people are incredible, I just don’t want them to have a
    nuclear weapon because the world will be destroyed.”

    he’s done an amazing job. I think his people have done an incredible
    job … We’re not finished yet … He’s leaving behind some very
    brilliant people.”
-   [**On the border
    emergency**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1919020763912220928)**:**
    “The big emergency right now is that we have thousands of people
    that we want to take out — and we have some judges that want
    everybody to go to court … We have millions of people. We’re going
    to have millions of court cases?”
-   [**On
    trade**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1919021725146140677)**:**
    “We’re making a lot of money. We’re doing great. Again, we were
    losing more than $5 billion a day … We’re going to be at a point
    soon where we’re making money every day.”
-   [**On peace in
    Ukraine**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1919025431648346599)**:**

    men.”

    tariffs**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1919046509900751019)**:**

    never do business with them — and they want to do business very
    much. Their economy is really doing badly. Their economy is
    collapsing.”
