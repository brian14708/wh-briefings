title: Every Democrat Just Voted Against Tax Cuts, Pay Raises, and More
---
 
The One, Big, Beautiful Bill has
[PASSED](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1925517225810690401) the
House of Representatives — without a single Democrat voting to cut
taxes, secure the border, or protect taxpayer-funded benefits for
Americans who need them.

**Here are only a few of the policies Democrats just unanimously
opposed:**

-   **The largest tax cut in history.** This means
    [$13,300](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Preserving-and-Expanding-Low-Tax-Rates-to-Create-American-Economic-Prosperity.pdf)
    more for American families and wage increases up to
    [$11,000](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Preserving-and-Expanding-Low-Tax-Rates-to-Create-American-Economic-Prosperity.pdf)
    for workers with a double-digit percent
    [decrease](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/x-23-25.pdf)
    to their tax bills — plus NO TAX ON TIPS, NO TAX ON OVERTIME, a tax
    cut on seniors’ Social Security benefits, an expanded child tax
    credit, and a tax deduction on American-made vehicles. Americans
    making between $30,000 and $80,000 per year will see their taxes
    [cut by
    15%](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/05/13/congress/average-taxpayers-tax-bills-set-to-fall-under-house-tax-package-forecasters-say-00347318)
    next year.  
      
-   **Raising wages.** American workers will see wage
    [increases](https://x.com/CEA47/status/1924575019738230959) of up to
    $11,600; a typical family with two kids will see take-home pay rise
    by up to $13,300.  
      
-   **Strong border security.** This makes President Trump’s border
    crackdown
    [permanent](https://homeland.house.gov/2025/04/27/house-homeland-security-committee-releases-text-for-budget-reconciliation-recommendations/)
    with the largest investment ever — funding AT LEAST one million
    illegal immigrant deportations per year, thousands of miles of new
    border wall and barriers, 18,000+ new immigration officials, and pay
    raises for our great ICE and Border Patrol agents.  
      
-   **Protecting Medicaid for American citizens who need it.** This ENDS
    taxpayer-funded benefits for at least [1.4
    million](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/05/15/democrat-messaging-falters-as-they-ask-constituents-to-foot-medicaid-costs-for-1-4-million-illegal-aliens/)
    illegal immigrants who are gaming the system and
    [requires](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1925527328253252074)
    able-bodied Americans to work if they receive benefits.  
      
-   **Pay raises for troops.** This increases special pay for
    servicemembers and gives them higher allowances for housing,
    healthcare, and family assistance.  
      
-   **Ending taxpayer-funded chemical castration and mutilation.** It
    [reverses](https://d1dth6e84htgma.cloudfront.net/05_13_2025_FCMU_Memorandum_UPDATED_55a74a132a.pdf)
    the [Biden-era
    mandate](https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/issue-brief/the-biden-administrations-final-rule-on-section-1557-non-discrimination-regulations-under-the-aca/)

    so-called “gender transition” procedures.  
      
-   **Modernizing air traffic control.** This will allow President Trump
    to act where the Biden Administration
    [failed](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-107001) by

    [overhauling](https://transportation.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=408584)
    the systems that keep Americans flying safely and efficiently.  
      
-   **Revolutionizing the nation’s defense.** This funds President
    Trump’s [Golden
    Dome](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/the-iron-dome-for-america/)
    missile defense shield, restocks America’s arsenal, expands our
    naval fleet, and improves military readiness to meet the needs of a
    changing world.  
      
-   **Protecting family farmers.** The bill prevents the greedy death
    tax from hitting two million family-owned farms that would otherwise
    see their exemptions cut in half and [cuts
    taxes](https://x.com/RepJasonSmith/status/1924469450209636454) on
    farmers by over $10 billion.  
      
-   **Unleashing American energy dominance.** The bill increases onshore
    and offshore oil and gas leases, spurs job growth, makes energy more
    affordable, and makes America less dependent on foreign
    adversaries.  
      
-   **Reversing runaway spending.** This delivers [$1.6
    trillion](https://x.com/russvought/status/1923488257888879103) in
    mandatory savings  — the
    [most](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1925171668005036465) in
    U.S. history and the largest deficit reduction in nearly 30 years.
