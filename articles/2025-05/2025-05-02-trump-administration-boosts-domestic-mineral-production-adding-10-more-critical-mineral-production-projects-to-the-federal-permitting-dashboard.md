title: "Trump Administration Boosts Domestic Mineral Production\u2014Adding 10 More\
  \ Critical Mineral Production Projects to the Federal Permitting Dashboard"
---
 
Today, the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (Permitting
Council) announced the second installment of critical mineral production
projects to be featured as FAST-41 transparency projects. This second
batch of projects is part of an ongoing series of critical projects
receiving the transparency of the Federal Permitting Dashboard in
response to President Trump’s Executive Order, [*Immediate Measures to
Increase American Mineral
Production*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-measures-to-increase-american-mineral-production/).

“The Permitting Council is excited to grow our portfolio of critical
mineral production projects with this latest tranche,” says **Manisha
Patel, Permitting Council Acting Executive Director**. “The transparency
that these projects will receive as a result of being featured on the
Federal Permitting Dashboard will be transformative, allowing
stakeholders across government and industry the ability to track the
progress of these projects, ensuring a level of accountability in
environmental review that is often missing from the traditional
process.” 

The chair of the National Energy Dominance Council (NEDC) submitted this
second batch of critical minerals production projects to the Permitting
Council Acting Executive Director in response to President Trump’s
Executive Order, *Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral
Production*. NEDC submitted the initial group of 10 projects on April 4,
2025, and they were added to the Federal Permitting Dashboard on [April
18,
2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/04/trump-administration-advances-first-wave-of-critical-mineral-production-projects/).
This second batch is part of a continual process to provide these
critical projects with the transparency afforded by FAST-41 and more
projects are scheduled to be added in the coming weeks.

Inclusion on the Permitting Dashboard as a transparency project makes
the environmental review and authorizations schedule for these vital
mineral production projects publicly available and allows all of
these projects to benefit from increased transparency. The public nature
of the dashboard ensures that all stakeholders, from project sponsors
and community members to federal agency leaders have up-to-date
accounting of where each project stands in the review process. This
transparency leads to greater accountability, ensuring a more efficient
process.
