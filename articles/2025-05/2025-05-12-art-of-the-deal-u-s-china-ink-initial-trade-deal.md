President Donald J. Trump and his administration have secured another
good deal for the American people — an [initial trade
deal](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/05/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-secures-a-historic-trade-win-for-the-united-states/)
with China that reduces tariffs, ends retaliation, and sets Americans on
the path for truly free, fair trade.

It’s the second significant trade breakthrough of the past week
following President Trump’s [landmark trade
deal](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/05/fact-sheet-u-s-uk-reach-historic-trade-deal/)
with the United Kingdom — and comes as President Trump enacts his
transformational vision for liberating Americans from the unfair trade
practices that have gripped workers and businesses for decades.

**At a press conference in Geneva, Secretary of the Treasury Scott
Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer laid out
the details of the initial agreement:**

-   [Secretary
    Bessent](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1921866107452846100):
    “We have reached an agreement on a 90-day pause and substantially
    moved down the tariff levels — both sides, on the reciprocal
    tariffs, will move their tariffs down 115%.”
-   [Ambassador
    Greer](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1921870077567078747):
    “Both the Chinese and the United States agreed to work
    constructively together on fentanyl and there’s a positive path
    forward there, as well.”
-   [Secretary
    Bessent](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1921871995945222398):
    “The upside surprise for me from this weekend was the level of
    Chinese engagement on the fentanyl crisis in the United States. They
    brought the Deputy Minister for Public Safety … and he had a very
    robust and highly detailed discussion.”
-   [Ambassador Greer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INzZpqIpK_Q): “We
    are going to have our economy continue taking off as we put
    structure around these negotiations and get global trade into a
    better place.”

**Secretary Bessent then made the rounds on television to inform the
American people of the landmark deal:**

-   [On
    negotiations](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1921884661971607969):
    “It was always respectful. We had the two largest economies in the
    world. We were firm — and we moved forward … We came with a list of
    problems that we were trying to solve and I think we did a good job
    on that.”
-   [On stopping precursors of fentanyl from
    China](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1921886945459749258):
    “This is a priority for President Trump and, indeed, the whole
    administration … Hundreds of thousands of Americans die every year
    and I think that we saw here in Geneva that the Chinese are now
    serious about assisting the U.S. in stopping the flow of precursor
    drugs.”
-   [On non-tariff
    barriers](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1921893232486584681):
    “We’ve had free trade, and as you said, that has not worked for the
    American people. There’s something called the ‘China shock,’ which
    has gutted our manufacturing sector … They subsidize labor, they
    subsidize capital goods, and they have exported that to us and to
    the rest of the world. We have put up tariffs to push back on that,
    so it will be a matter of what is the equilibrium level on tariffs
    and also getting China to open their markets for American
    companies.”
-   [On supply
    chains](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1921898801406566854):
    “Bringing back our important strategic industries can be a result of
    tariffs, but it’s also a result of national will — so this
    administration is running full speed to make sure that what we saw
    during COVID never happens again.”
-   [On past
    agreements](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1921896843610403005):
    “In January 2020, President Trump produced a template — we had an
    excellent trade agreement with China, and the Biden Administration
    chose not to enforce it. The Chinese delegation basically told us
    that once President Biden came into office, they just ignored their
    obligations.”
