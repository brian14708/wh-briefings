title: The One, Big, Beautiful Bill is a Once-in-a-Generation Chance
---
 
Here are five reasons why President Donald J. Trump’s One, Big,
Beautiful Bill is a generational opportunity to deliver the long-term
changes Americans voted for:

### **1. It’s the largest tax cut in American history.**

-   **It delivers PERMANENT tax cuts and bigger paychecks.** This means
    an [extra
    $5,000](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Economic-Impact-of-Extending-TCJA-Provisions.pdf)
    in Americans’ pockets with a DOUBLE-DIGIT percent
    [DECREASE](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/x-23-25.pdf)
    to their tax bills*.* Americans earning between $30,000 and $80,000
    will pay around [15% less in
    taxes](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/05/13/congress/average-taxpayers-tax-bills-set-to-fall-under-house-tax-package-forecasters-say-00347318).
-   **It includes NO TAX ON TIPS and NO TAX ON OVERTIME.** This makes
    good on two of President Trump’s cornerstone campaign promises and
    benefits hardworking Americans where they need it the most — their
    paychecks.
-   **It provides historic tax relief to Social Security recipients.**
    It slashes taxes on seniors’ Social Security benefits.

### **2. It protects Medicaid for Americans by removing 1.4 million illegals.**

-   **It kicks illegal immigrants off taxpayer-funded Medicaid
    benefits.** This bill eliminates waste, fraud, and abuse by ending
    benefits for at least 1.4 million illegal immigrants who are gaming
    the system.

### **3. It makes President Trump’s border security permanent.**

-   **It funds President Trump’s border wall.** As a result, 701 miles
    of primary wall, 900 miles of river barriers, 629 miles of secondary
    barriers, and 141 miles of vehicle and pedestrian barriers will be
    [constructed](https://homeland.house.gov/2025/04/29/homeland-republicans-advance-funding-recommendations-to-continue-president-trumps-border-security-victory-bolster-frontline-personnel-for-years-to-come/)
    — along with cutting-edge technology that will secure our homeland
    for generations to come.
-   **It boosts Border Patrol and ICE agents on the frontlines.** It
    will empower border officials with adequate resources to finally
    carry out their core mission by funding at least one million annual
    removals and hiring 10,000 new ICE personnel, 5,000 new customs
    officers, and 3,000 new Border Patrol agents.

### **4. It finally modernizes air traffic control.**

-   **It fulfills President
    Trump’s **[**plan**](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/us-transportation-secretary-sean-p-duffy-unveils-plan-build-brand-new-state-art-air)** to
    completely**
    [**overhaul**](https://transportation.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=408584)
    **the systems that keep Americans flying safely and efficiently.**
    This will allow President Trump to update our air traffic control
    systems and act where the Biden Administration failed (despite
    repeated [warnings](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-107001)).

### **5. It ends taxpayer-funded sex changes for minors.**

-   **The One, Big, Beautiful Bill restores sanity to government.** It
    [prohibits](https://d1dth6e84htgma.cloudfront.net/05_13_2025_FCMU_Memorandum_UPDATED_55a74a132a.pdf)
    Medicaid funding for gender transition procedures for minors.
