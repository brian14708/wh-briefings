title: In Riyadh, President Trump Charts the Course for a Prosperous Future in the
  Middle East
---
 
President Donald J. Trump just wrapped up a [major
address](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj1QOz3iuCE) in Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia, where he outlined an optimistic vision for the future of the
Middle East and his approach to achieving a more stable region and
peaceful world.

**Here are the top moments:**

-   “Exactly eight years ago this month, I stood in this very room and
    looked forward to a future in which the nations of this region would
    drive out the forces of terrorism and extremism … and take your
    place among the proudest, most prosperous, most successful nations
    anywhere in the world as leaders of a modern and rising Middle
    East.”

-   “Before our eyes, a new generation of leaders is transcending the
    ancient conflicts and tired divisions of the past, and forging a
    future where the Middle East is defined by commerce, not chaos;
    where it exports technology, not terrorism; and where people of
    different nations, religions, and creeds are building cities
    together — not bombing each other out of existence.”

-   “This great transformation has not come from Western
    interventionists … giving you lectures on how to live or how to
    govern your own affairs. No, the gleaming marvels of Riyadh and Abu
    Dhabi were not created by the so-called ‘nation-builders,’
    ‘neo-cons,’ or ‘liberal non-profits,’ like those who spent trillions
    failing to develop Kabul and Baghdad, so many other cities. Instead,
    the birth of a modern Middle East has been brought about by the
    people of the region themselves … developing your own sovereign
    countries, pursuing your own unique visions, and charting your own
    destinies.”

-   “In the end, the so-called ‘nation-builders’ wrecked far more
    nations than they built — and the interventionists were intervening
    in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves.”

-   “After so many decades of conflict, finally it is within our grasp
    to reach the future that generations before us could only dream
    about — a land of peace, safety, harmony, opportunity, innovation,
    and achievement right here in the Middle East.”

-   “I am here today not merely to condemn the past chaos of Iran’s
    leaders, but to offer them a new path and a much better path toward
    a far better and more hopeful future.”
    [***(Watch)***](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1922323321082778024)
-   “As I have shown repeatedly, I am willing to end past conflicts and
    forge new partnerships for a better and more stable world, even if
    our differences may be very profound.”
    [***(Watch)***](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1922323321082778024)
-   “My preference will always be for peace and partnership, whenever
    those outcomes can be achieved. Always.”
    [***(Watch)***](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1922339178903228908)
-   “In recent years, far too many American presidents have been
    afflicted with the notion that it’s our job to look into the souls
    of foreign leaders and use U.S. policy to dispense justice for their
    sins … I believe it is God’s job to sit in judgement — my job \[is\]
    to defend America and to promote the fundamental interests of
    stability, prosperity, and peace.”
    [***(Watch)***](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1922325565987537046)
-   “Following repeated attacks on American ships and freedom of
    navigation in the Red Sea, the United States military launched more
    than 1,100 strikes on the Houthis in Yemen. As a result, the Houthis
    agreed to stop … We hit them hard, we got what we came for — and
    then we got out.”

-   “My administration stands ready to help Lebanon create a future of
    economic development and peace with its neighbors.”

-   “In Syria, which has seen so much misery and death, there is a new
    government that will hopefully succeed in stabilizing the country
    and keeping peace.”
    [***(Watch)***](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1922327334863946039)
-   “If the responsible nations of this region seize this moment, put
    aside your differences and focus on the interests that unite you,
    then all of humanity will soon be amazed at what they will see right
    here in this geographic center of the world … and the spiritual
    heart of its greatest faiths.”
