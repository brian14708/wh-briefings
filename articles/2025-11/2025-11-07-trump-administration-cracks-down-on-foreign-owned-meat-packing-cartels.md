title: Trump Administration Cracks Down on Foreign-Owned Meat Packing Cartels
---
 
**Today, President Donald J. Trump**
[**directed**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1986896555723403434)
**the Department of Justice to launch an investigation into the nation’s
largest meat packing companies for potential collusion, price fixing,
and price manipulation.** This decisive action targets the
foreign-dominated conglomerates that control America’s meat supply and
have been accused of artificially inflating prices at the expense of
farmers, ranchers, and working families.

****It’s time to protect AMERICAN CONSUMERS.****

**Here’s what you need to know:**

-   **For too long, a handful of giant meat packers have squeezed
    America’s cattle producers, shrunk herds, and jacked up prices at
    the grocery store.** By examining whether these companies have
    violated antitrust laws through coordinated pricing or capacity
    restrictions, this investigation will root out any illegal
    collusion, restore fair competition, and protect our food security.
-   **The “Big Four” meat packers — JBS (Brazil), Cargill, Tyson Foods,
    and National Beef —** [**currently
    dominate**](https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2024/january/concentration-in-u-s-meatpacking-industry-and-how-it-affects-competition-and-cattle-prices)
    **85% of the U.S. beef processing market, up from just 36% in
    1980.** Two of these companies, including the largest meat packer in
    the world, are either foreign-owned or have significant foreign
    ownership and control.
-   **Industry consolidation has crushed competition and hammered cattle
    producers.** In the 1980s, the top four packers
    [purchased](https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2024/january/concentration-in-u-s-meatpacking-industry-and-how-it-affects-competition-and-cattle-prices)
    one-third of all fed cattle; by the mid-1990s, that share exploded
    to over 80% and has only grown more concentrated since.
-   **This has led to the exploitation of American consumers, farmers,
    and ranchers.** In fact, mounting evidence shows this monopoly power
    has slashed payments to ranchers, reduced herd sizes, driven up
    consumer prices, and threatened America’s food supply chain.

**President Trump will ALWAYS have the backs of our Great American
Farmers.**
