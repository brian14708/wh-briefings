### **Here the top moments you may have missed:**

-   [**On ending the Democrat
    Shutdown**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1985145498915733619)**:**
    “We keep voting. I mean, the Republicans are voting almost
    unanimously to end it — and the Democrats keep voting against ending
    it… They’ve lost their way.”
-   [**On
    Obamacare**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1985145822107914523)**:**
    “Obamacare is terrible. It’s bad healthcare at far too high a price.
    We should fix that. We should fix it, and we can fix it with the
    Democrats. All they have to do is let the country open, and we’ll
    fix it. They have to let the country open and I’ll sit down with the
    Democrats and we’ll fix it.”
-   [**On
    healthcare**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1985145962545713294)**:**
    “We can make it much less expensive for people and give them much
    better healthcare — and I’d be willing to work with the Democrats on
    it, \[but\] the problem is they want to give money to prisoners, to
    drug dealers, to all these millions of people that were allowed to
    come in with an open border from Biden, and nobody can do that. Not
    one Republican would ever do that.”
-   [**On negotiating with
    Democrats**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1985147553822671070)**:**
    “We can fix \[healthcare\]… but I’m not going to do it by extortion.
    I’m not going to do it by being extorted by the Democrats who have
    lost their way… It’s going to get solved. Eventually, they’re going
    to have to vote — I think they have to. And if they don’t vote,
    that’s their problem. I think we should do the nuclear option… it’s
    called ending the filibuster.”
-   [**On illegal
    immigration**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1985090914184790232)**:**
    “The policy has to be ‘you came into the country illegally; you’re
    going to go out.’ However, you’ve also seen, you’re going to go out,
    we’re going to work with you, and you’re going to come back into our
    country legally.”
-   [**On the next three
    years**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1985152915292430548)**:**
    “We have been acknowledged as having the greatest nine months in the
    history of the presidency — so if I can keep that going, I’ll be
    very happy.”
-   [**On the Supreme Court’s tariffs
    case**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1985146890636407201)**:**
    “Because of tariffs, we have the highest stock market we’ve ever
    had. Because of tariffs, 401(k)s are at the highest level — and this
    is millions of people — than we’ve ever had… I think it’s the most
    important subject discussed by the Supreme Court in 100 years.”
-   [**On
    “retribution”**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1985149287869853883)**:**
    “It’s the opposite. I think I’ve been very mild mannered. You’re
    looking at a man who was indicted many times and I had to beat the
    rap otherwise I couldn’t have run for President. They tried to get
    me not to run for President by going after me and by indicting me!”
-   [**On nuclear weapons
    testing**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1985150050599891091)**:**
    “We have more nuclear weapons than any other country. I think we
    should do something about denuclearization… we’re the only country
    that doesn’t test — and I don’t want to be the only country that
    doesn’t test.”
-   [**On the ceasefire in
    Gaza**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1985152278442238222)**:**
    “It’s very solid. You hear about Hamas, but Hamas could be taken out
    immediately if they don’t behave. They know that. If they don’t
    behave, they’re going to be taken out immediately.”
-   [**On crime in Democrat-run
    cities**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1985147968517820835)**:**
    “If you had to send in the Army or send in the Marines, I’d do that
    in a heartbeat… but I haven’t chosen to do it because I haven’t felt
    we need it.”
-   [**On
    China**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1985151489044816122)**:**
    “It’s like everybody else. We’re a threat to them, too… This is a
    very competitive world, especially when it comes to the China and
    the U.S. We’re always watching them and they’re always watching us.
    In the meantime, I think we get along very well, and I think we can
    be bigger, better, and stronger by working with them as opposed to
    just knocking them out.”
-   [**On
    Venezuela**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1985152282745549002)**:**
    “They’ve been treating us very badly — not only on drugs, they’ve
    dumped hundreds of thousands of people into our country that we
    didn’t want. People from prisons; they emptied their prisons into
    our country. They emptied their mental institutions and their insane
    asylums into the United States of America.”
