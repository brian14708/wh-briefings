title: "72 Arrests Wasn\u2019t Enough \u2014 Democrats Let Him Burn Her Alive"

**How many more innocent Americans have to be victimized before Democrat
politicians admit their sick, soft-on-crime insanity is a blood-soaked
catastrophe?**

Last week in Democrat-run Chicago, a [26-year-old
woman](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/woman-set-ablaze-chicago-transit-train-identified-rcna245669)
was riding the ‘L’ train when a career criminal with [72 prior
arrests](https://abc7chicago.com/post/lawrence-reed-chicago-cta-blue-line-attack-suspect-due-court-friday-terrorism-charge/18184410/#:~:text=Reed%2C%20meanwhile%2C%20has,the%20Thompson%20Center.)
— including eight felony convictions and seven misdemeanors — doused her
in gasoline, chased her screaming through the train car, and set her on
fire in broad daylight. She’s now fighting for her life with horrific
burns because the predator who did this was walking free.

**This animal was walking free because of the radical, dangerous “no
cash bail” law** [**proudly signed by Governor JB
Pritzker**](https://www.npr.org/2021/02/22/970378490/illinois-becomes-first-state-to-eliminate-cash-bail)
**and celebrated by Chicago’s defund-the-police Mayor Brandon Johnson.**
Just three months ago, after this same monster was arrested for another
violent crime, a county judge [cut him
loose](https://www.foxnews.com/us/chicago-train-attack-suspect-repeatedly-violated-curfew-movement-restrictions-records-show)
on electronic monitoring — a condition he [repeatedly
violated](https://www.foxnews.com/us/chicago-train-attack-suspect-repeatedly-violated-curfew-movement-restrictions-records-show)
with zero consequences right up to the day he lit an innocent woman on
fire.

While President Trump fights tooth and nail to make America’s cities
safe again —
[crushing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/08/taking-steps-to-end-cashless-bail-to-protect-americans/)

[resources](https://abcnews.go.com/US/federal-agents-make-130-arrests-48-hours-immigration/story?id=127591461)
into the neighborhoods Democrats have abandoned — delusional politicians
like Pritzker and Johnson arrogantly double down on the same failed
policies that handed a violent thug a can of gasoline and a match.

**Enough is enough. President Trump is taking our streets back from the
savages who terrorize them and from the Democrats who keep setting them
free.**
