title: More Relief on the Way as Economic Wins Bring Savings to Gas Pump, Thanksgiving
  Table
---
 
**As millions of American families prepare to gather for Thanksgiving,
they’re seeing a dose of the economic relief President Donald J. Trump
is fighting to deliver.** After inheriting the worst inflation crisis in
40 years from Joe Biden and Democrats, the Trump Administration’s
actions to unleash American energy, slash regulations, and crush
inflation are translating into
[lower](https://www.gasbuddy.com/go/thanksgiving-travel-2025) gas prices
in many states and a
[decrease](https://www.fb.org/news-release/cost-of-thanksgiving-dinner-declines)
in the cost of Thanksgiving dinner.

**Make no mistake: this is not “mission accomplished.”** Americans are
still paying far too much after four years of reckless Democrat spending
and regulation — and that’s why the Trump Administration is relentlessly
fighting to deliver the bold, structural changes that will bring lasting
relief to all American families.

**Here’s what local news outlets are reporting as those signs of change
start to appear:**
