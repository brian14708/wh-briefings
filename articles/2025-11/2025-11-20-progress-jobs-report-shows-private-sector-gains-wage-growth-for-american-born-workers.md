title: 'PROGRESS: Jobs Report Shows Private Sector Gains, Wage Growth for American-Born
  Workers'
---
 
> ***“The September jobs report more than doubled market expectations —
> adding 119,000 new jobs to the American economy. In stark contrast to
> the disastrous Biden economy, almost all of these new jobs were in the
> private sector and went to American-born workers instead of illegal
> aliens. Wages for workers are continuing to rise, a reversal of the
> Biden years where private sector wages declined by about $3,000
> because of the Democrats’ inflation crisis. This strong report is more
> proof that President Trump’s pro-growth, America First agenda is
> already making great progress, and it will continue to deliver
> positive results for American families and businesses.”***

**The latest jobs report**

**once again, adding** [**119,000 new
jobs**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1991504542903726567) **in
September as wages grow and more Americans enter the workforce.** It’s
another step in the right direction as President Donald J. Trump works
tirelessly to reverse the Biden-era inflation crisis that brought the
country to the brink of economic ruin.

**Here’s what you need to know:**

-   **September’s jobs report more than doubled economists’
    expectations.** The job growth was driven almost entirely by private
    sector job gains (+97,000), including 43,000 new jobs in the health
    care sector and 19,000 new jobs in the construction sector.
-   **Americans’ wages are up 3.8% over the year.** Since President
    Trump took office, workers’ real wages are up $700 and are on track
    for a $1,000 increase after his first year — meaning Americans are
    on track to make up one-third of the $3,000 in wages lost under
    Biden.
-   **Americans are working.** Labor force participation increased,
    average weekly hours for production workers increased, and long-term
    unemployment fell sharply — proof that a growing share of the
    American people see the opportunity in President Trump’s economic
    comeback.
-   **Under President Trump, all job gains have gone to native-born
    Americans — reversing the Biden-era trend.** Over the past year,
    more than 2.5 million native-born Americans
    [gained](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNU02073413?output_view=net_12mths)
    employment, while 670,000 foreign-born workers
    [lost](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNU02073395?output_view=net_12mths)
    employment.
-   **Economists got it wrong (again).** In fact, the jobs increase
    “[beat](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-11-20/us-employment-report-for-september?cursorId=691F1A27BC4800E3)
    all 67 forecasts in Bloomberg’s survey.”
-   **There is more good news to come, with the Atlanta Fed GDPNow model
    now**
    [**projecting**](https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow)
    **a blockbuster 4.2% GDP growth figure for the third quarter.** That
    means more jobs and higher incomes for Americans.

**Here’s what they’re saying:**

-   [**Economist Steve
    Moore**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1991504602311909389?s=20)**:**
    “I think people are under-hyping this economy big time. I mean,
    we’re seeing huge investment numbers. We’re seeing great consumer
    spending numbers… I am very happy about this report and I think
    investors should be, too.”
-   [**ABC News’s Alexis
    Christoforous**](https://youtu.be/lCANV3x8Os8?si=hIfvS0SBI6b46ZQs&t=28)**:**
    “Heading into that historic government shutdown, the job market was
    healthier than we thought. The expectation was for 50,000 jobs to
    have been added in the month of September; we got more than double
    that.”
-   [**Christoforous**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1991520526112813547)**:**
    “If the economy added so many jobs, why did the unemployment rate go
    up? It’s because more people came off the sidelines and were
    actively looking for work… When you’re looking for work, you’re
    actually counted among the unemployed.”
-   [**Bloomberg’s Enda
    Curran**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-11-20/us-employment-report-for-september?cursorId=691F1808BC480012)**:**
    “That’s a big upside surprise on the headline number.”
-   [**Strategic Wealth Partners CEO Mark
    Tepper**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1991504969573495098?s=20)**:**
    “Not only is the consumer still spending, the consumer is paying
    their bills on time. When you look at credit card delinquencies,
    they’re at only 1.3% — and they’re ticking lower… We’re in a good
    situation.”
-   [***The New York Times’s* Lydia
    DePillis**](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/business/jobs-report-economy/what-to-know-about-the-report?smid=url-share)**:**
    “Employers notched a very respectable month of hiring in September.”
