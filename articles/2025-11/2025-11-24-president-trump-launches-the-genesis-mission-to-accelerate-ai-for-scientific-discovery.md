title: President Trump Launches the Genesis Mission to Accelerate AI for Scientific
  Discovery
---
 
Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an [Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/11/launching-the-genesis-mission/)
launching [The Genesis
Mission](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/11/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-unveils-the-genesis-missionto-accelerate-ai-for-scientific-discovery/),
a bold national initiative that aims to accelerate scientific
breakthroughs using AI. Inspired by the legacy of the Apollo Program,
The Genesis Mission brings together the unmatched power of our National
Laboratories’ supercomputers and top scientific minds to transform the
way science and research are conducted.

This whole-of-government approach represents a historic mobilization of
resources, tasking the Department of Energy to integrate its world-class
supercomputers and datasets into a unified, closed-loop AI platform.
Integrating this data, The Genesis Mission leverages the power of AI to
automate experiment design, accelerate simulations, and generate
predictive models that accelerate federal research and development
productivity.

The Executive Order directs the Assistant to the President for Science
and Technology to spearhead coordination with key federal agencies,
including the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST), and National Institutes of Health (NIH)
as AI unlocks scientific findings from datasets spanning from energy,
health, and manufacturing.

“President Trump is taking a revolutionary approach to scientific
research, harnessing the power of AI to propel America into the Golden
Age of Innovation. The Genesis Mission connects world-class scientific
data with the most advanced American AI to unlock breakthroughs in
medicine, energy, materials science, and beyond,” **said Michael
Kratsios, Assistant to the President for Science and Technology and
Director of the White House of Science and Technology Policy.**
