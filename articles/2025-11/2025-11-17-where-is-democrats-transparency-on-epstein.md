title: "Where Is Democrats\u2019 Transparency on Epstein?"
---
 
As President Donald J. Trump
[said](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115562626931599548),
“House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we
have nothing to hide, and it’s time to move on from this Democrat Hoax
perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics in order to deflect from the Great
Success of the Republican Party.”

**Why haven’t Democrats shown the same transparency — and what else are
they hiding?**

-   Why aren’t Democrats talking about the fact that Del. Stacey
    Plaskett (D-U.S. Virgin Islands)
    [solicited](https://www.businessinsider.com/jeffrey-epstein-island-politics-stacey-plaskett-2023-6)
    (and was given) $30,000 from Epstein for the DCCC *after* he was
    already a convicted sex offender? Or the fact that Plaskett herself
    [accepted](https://www.businessinsider.com/jeffrey-epstein-island-politics-stacey-plaskett-2023-6#:~:text=She%20did%2C%20however,cycle%20as%20well.)
    maxed out donations from Epstein for her own campaign? Or the fact
    that the wife of the former Democrat governor of the U.S. Virgin
    Islands
    [told](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23857490-we-would-have-a-friend-in-stacey)
    Epstein “we would have a friend in Stacey” if he made said
    donations? Or the
    [fact](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/11/14/epstein-text-messages-cohen-house-hearing/)
    that Plaskett was literally texting Epstein during a committee
    hearing?
-   Why aren’t Democrats talking about the fact that former President
    Bill Clinton traveled on Epstein’s aircraft [26
    times](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/08/the-epstein-connections-fueling-conspiracy-theories/)?
    Or the fact that one of Epstein’s victims
    [wrote](https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-jeffrey-epstein-accuser-virginia-roberts-unsealed-memoir-2019-8?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com#:~:text=Giuffre%20was%20also,page%20110).)
    that she saw Clinton on Epstein’s island with two young women? Or
    the fact that Clinton’s visit to the island was
    [corroborated](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/12/confessions-of-a-clintonworld-exile?srsltid=AfmBOoq0w_a0o47tS-pOaysfswVwIAR6ep_1um2Ndu2FK2tJTtr80INP)
    by one of his former top aides?
-   Why aren’t Democrats talking about the “[long
    relationship](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/11/17/summers-epstein-wing-man-woman-described-as-mentee/#:~:text=Summers%E2%80%99%20long%20relationship,for%20New%E2%80%99s%20work.)”
    and [storied
    friendship](https://www.wsj.com/tech/jeffrey-epstein-documents-woody-allen-larry-summers-edb3e9b2?mod=us_more_pos1#:~:text=of%20their%20children.%E2%80%9D-,Lawrence%20Summers,-Epstein%20donated%20millions)
    that Larry Summers — ex-Harvard President, Clinton Treasury
    Secretary, and prominent Democrat — had with Epstein, who
    [described](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/11/17/summers-epstein-wing-man-woman-described-as-mentee/)
    himself as Summers’ “wing man”?
-   Why aren’t Democrats talking about the
    [fact](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10037351/Katie-Courics-new-book-sparks-outrage-rips-ex-boyfriends-former-NBC-CBS-colleagues.html#:~:text=MIXING%20WITH%20THE,started%20rolling%20in.%27)
    that Democrat so-called “journalist” Katie Couric had dinner at
    Epstein’s residence *after* he was already a convicted sex offender
    who had served jail time?
-   Why aren’t Democrats talking about the fact that Reid Hoffman —
    billionaire Democrat megadonor —
    [visited](https://nypost.com/2023/05/03/linkedins-reid-hoffman-visited-jeffrey-epsteins-private-island/)
    Epstein’s “pedophile island,” attended a dinner with him, and even
    planned to stay at his New York mansion?
-   Why aren’t Democrats talking about the fact that the Democrat
    National Committee
    [refused](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hold-dnc-holds-onto-decades-old-jeffrey-epstein-donations-after-other-democrats-returned-theirs)
    to return $32,000 in donations from Epstein?
-   Why aren’t Democrats talking about the
    [fact](https://nypost.com/2025/11/13/us-news/michael-wolff-encouraged-jeffrey-epstein-to-blackmail-donald-trump-emails-reveal/)
    that Michael Wolff “encouraged Jeffrey Epstein to blackmail
    then-presidential candidate Donald Trump — insisting the convicted
    pedophile could generate a ‘debt’ from him”?

**It’s time for Democrats to answer for their longstanding ties to
Epstein.** Then, we can get back to what matters to the American people.
