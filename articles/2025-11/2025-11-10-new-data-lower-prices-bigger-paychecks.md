**confirming that inflation has been tamed, everyday prices are
beginning to drop, and wages are growing.**

**Here are the main takeaways:**

### **President Trump has tamed inflation.**

-   The Breakfast Basics Index — which measures the price of three eggs,
    a glass of milk, a bagel, and an avocado — decreased 14% between
    March and September and 1.7% over the past year.
-   The Everyday Essentials Index — which measures the price of
    toothpaste, shampoo, toilet paper, laundry detergent, pain medicine,
    and diapers — fell over the past year.

### **Americans are beginning to see price declines.**

-   Over the past year, prices actually declined for cheese, cereals &
    bars, fresh fruits, frozen meals, packaged meals, condiments,
    batteries, computers & accessories, phones & accessories, medicines,
    oral care, vitamins & supplements, outdoor products, and toys &
    games.

### **President Trump’s policies are fueling wage growth.**

-   Nationally, wage growth is outpacing restaurant price increases —
    including at the city level in half of the cities studied.

### **Local economies are resilient.**

-   56% of consumers say they’ve seen fewer businesses close in their
    communities over the past year.
-   Overall food spend has increased by nearly 5% over last year —
    faster than prices have risen, suggesting “consumers are buying more
    from businesses in their communities.”
