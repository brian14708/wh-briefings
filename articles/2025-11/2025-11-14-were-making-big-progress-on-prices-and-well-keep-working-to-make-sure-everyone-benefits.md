**President Donald J. Trump inherited an economic mess when he took
office.** Years of mismanagement under Biden, his incompetent
Administration, and Democrats in Congress — who spent years insisting
inflation was “transitory” while doling out trillions in new spending
and dramatically upscaling government — brought the country to the brink
of economic ruin.

Since Day One, the Trump Administration has been on a mission to tame
Biden’s inflation crisis, stop the sky-high Biden price increases, and
lower costs for everyday families — and while it can’t happen overnight,
evidence shows the trend is in the right direction.

### **President Trump tamed Biden’s inflation crisis.**

-   Under Biden, inflation averaged nearly 5% — [hitting
    9.1%](https://x.com/PressSec/status/1989005388671496604) during the
    worst inflation crisis in decades, fueled by Radical Left spending.
-   In President Trump’s second term, inflation has dropped to an
    average of just 2.7% — the critical first step in reversing
    Democrats’ cost-of-living disaster. In fact, under President Trump,
    Americans have even seen the [first overall price
    decline](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/04/trump-effect-americans-see-first-price-relief-in-years/)
    since 2020.

### **Americans have made real wage gains, but there’s still work to do.**

-   Under Biden, workers lost over $2,900 in purchasing power — meaning
    inflation rose faster than wages.
-   In President Trump’s second term, even after accounting for higher
    prices, Americans’ real wages have grown by nearly $700 and are on
    track to increase by nearly $1,200 after his first full year in
    office.

### **Gas prices are falling.**

-   Under Biden, the average gas price was the [highest it has ever
    been](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3289436/biden-term-highest-gas-prices-us-history/)
    during a presidential term, reaching its
    [highest-ever](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=emm_epmr_pte_nus_dpg&f=m)
    price — even after he drained our strategic reserves to artificially
    decrease prices.
-   In President Trump’s second term, Americans have seen the [lowest
    average gas
    price](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/10/gas-prices-hit-four-year-low-under-trump/)
    in more than four years and are on track to spend the [lowest
    amount](https://san.com/cc/americans-on-pace-to-spend-lowest-amount-on-gasoline-in-last-two-decades/#:~:text=WHILE%20FEARS%20ABOUT%20INFLATION%20AND,OF%20THE%20COVID%2D19%20PANDEMIC.&text=THE%20MAIN%20**DRIVER**,THE%20STRAIGHT%20ARROW%20NEWS%20APP.)
    of their disposable income on gas in the last two decades. As
    President Trump’s energy dominance vision continues to come to
    fruition, energy prices will fall further — igniting other price
    declines.

### **Grocery prices and housing prices are trending in the right direction.**

-   **Prices for everyday staples are starting to see declines.** Under
    President Trump, prices for eggs, butter, ice cream, fresh fruit,
    cereal, fish, seafood, rice, pasta, and ham have all seen declines —
    and more help is on the way.
-   **Housing costs are moderating.** Under Biden, mortgage rates hit
    their [highest in
    decades](https://fortune.com/2023/09/29/mortgage-rates-two-decade-high-housing-market-home-sales-drag/);
    in President Trump’s second term, the average 30-year fixed mortgage
    rate was [6.17%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE30US) at
    the end of October — 12% lower than when he took office. According
    to the Consumer Price Index, the 12-month change in overall shelter
    costs is at its lowest level in four years.

### **Other efforts will continue driving prices down, ramping up take-home pay, and strengthening our economy.**

-   **President Trump’s deregulatory efforts are**
    [**saving**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/president-trumps-deregulation-effort-has-already-saved-families-thousands-of-dollars/)
    **Americans a collective $180 billion — or $2,100 per family of
    four.** For example, President Trump
    [halted](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/president-trump-is-undoing-bidens-economic-damage/)
    burdensome Biden-era efficiency standards that jacked up the price
    of everyday appliances.
-   **President Trump signed into law the largest tax cuts in American
    history.** This includes No Tax on Tips, No Tax on Overtime, and No
    Tax on Social Security — all of which will save Americans money in
    their tax returns; the landmark legislation will
    [raise](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Preserving-and-Expanding-Low-Tax-Rates-to-Create-American-Economic-Prosperity.pdf) Americans’
    take-home pay by as much as $13,300 and wages by as much as $11,600.
-   **President Trump is bringing jobs and investment back to the U.S.**
    Since President Trump took office, companies have
    [invested](https://www.whitehouse.gov/investments/) trillions of
    dollars into their U.S.-based operations — onshoring and creating
    hundreds of thousands of new jobs for Americans.
-   **President Trump is reducing the deficit.** A combination of
    spending cuts, interest savings, economic growth, and tariff
    revenues are
    [expected](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/The-One-Big-Beautiful-Bill-Legislation-for-Historic-Prosperity-and-Deficit-Reduction-1.pdf)
    to reduce the deficit by trillions of dollars — resulting in higher
    take-home pay, lower interest rates, and a stronger economy.
-   **1.9 million more American-born workers are employed today than
    when President Trump took office**. Right now, the U.S. has more
    people working now than at any time in the history of our country.

**The Trump Administration will not rest until the high prices that
resulted from Democrat policies are fully reined in.** We’re making
progress — and the best is yet to come.
