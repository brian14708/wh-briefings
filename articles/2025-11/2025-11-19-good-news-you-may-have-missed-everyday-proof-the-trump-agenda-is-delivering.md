title: 'Good News You May Have Missed: Everyday Proof the Trump Agenda Is Delivering'
---
 
**Since Day One, President Donald J. Trump has been laser-focused on
delivering for the forgotten men and women of this country.** While
reversing four years of open borders, high taxes, and weak leadership
isn’t instantaneous, the early results are undeniable — and they’re
getting bigger every week.

**From reclaiming spots for American students on college campuses to the
largest tax-refund season in history on the horizon, here is some good
news you may have missed:**

**🧑‍🎓** **New foreign student enrollment at U.S. colleges and
universities** [**is down by
17%**](https://www.ft.com/content/7a4860bc-061c-40d0-bf3b-2385977b84d7)
**over last year:** “American universities have suffered one of the
sharpest ever declines in foreign enrollments in the face of tough
policies from President Donald Trump, with the number of new
international students falling 17 percent this year.”

**💰 Tax refunds in 2026 are**
[**projected**](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/2025/11/17/big-beautiful-success-story-2026-tax-refunds-projected-to-be-largest-ever/)
**to be the largest ever:** “Tax filers could expect an extra $1,000
bump to their tax refund next year, in what could be a record-breaking
tax refund season. In total, the working families tax cuts will give
American taxpayers $191 billion in net new tax relief… For the 2026 tax
filing season, taxpayers are expected to take home an additional $91
billion in refunds and keep an additional $30 billion in their paychecks
from reduced withholdings.”

**📚** **Public schools are** [**seeing a dramatic
drop**](https://apnews.com/article/immigrant-student-enrollment-trump-82faaaec6d9246e24a09cbc837bedb67)
**in immigrant students:** “From Miami to San Diego, schools around the
U.S. are seeing big drops in enrollment of students from immigrant
families. In some cases, parents have been deported or voluntarily
returned to their home countries, driven out by President Donald Trump’s
sweeping immigration crackdown… In many school systems, the biggest
factor is that far fewer families are coming from other countries. As
fewer people cross the U.S. border, administrators in small towns and
big cities alike are reporting fewer newcomer students than usual.”

**🦃** **Prices for the Thanksgiving meal are**
[**down**](https://www.fb.org/news-release/cost-of-thanksgiving-dinner-declines)
**over last year:** “Cooking a Thanksgiving dinner for your friends and
family will cost less than last year… The centerpiece on most
Thanksgiving tables — the turkey — dramatically decreased in price,
which helped bring down the overall cost of dinner. The average price
for a 16-pound frozen turkey is $21.50. That is $1.34 per pound, down
more than 16% from last year.”

“…the trend had been upward in the preceding four years. However, since
January 2025 the trend has been in the other direction, declining nearly
2.23 million since the start of this year. This is a huge and
statistically significant decline, indicating something has
fundamentally changed. This is by far the largest six-month decline that
has ever occurred within the same year.”
