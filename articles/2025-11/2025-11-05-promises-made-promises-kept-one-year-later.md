**One year ago today, the American people delivered a resounding mandate
to President Donald J. Trump when they overwhelmingly re-elected him to
an historic second term.** In just ten months since his inauguration as
the 47th President of the United States, he has moved with unprecedented
speed and resolve to secure the border, drive down costs, restore public
safety, and unleash American energy and prosperity — and momentum is
building for even greater achievements ahead.

**Here are just some of President Trump’s PROMISES MADE, PROMISES
KEPT:**

## Stopping the migrant invasion

-   **PROMISE MADE:** “We will close the border. We will stop the
    invasion of illegals into our
    country.” ([10/12/24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xguaneoZ5A&t=4624s))
-   **✅ PROMISE KEPT:** Under President Trump, the number of illegal
    immigrants crossing the southern border are at [historic
    lows](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/06/icymi-for-the-first-time-in-decades-the-us-mexico-border-is-silent/)
    after his rapid action to close the border on Day One, with illegal
    crossings
    [plummeting](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/illegal-crossings-plunge-to-levels-not-seen-in-decades-amid-trump-crackdown/)
    to levels not seen in
    [decades](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/04/illegal-border-crossings-february-decline-trump)
    and virtually no illegal aliens being released into the country’s
    interior.  
      
-   **PROMISE MADE:** “I will immediately end the Biden border nightmare
    that traffickers are using to exploit vulnerable women and
    children.” ([7/21/23](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-vlog-death-penalty-for-human-traffickers-agenda47-july-21-2023/#7))
-   **✅ PROMISE KEPT:** The number of unaccompanied illegal immigrant
    children crossing into the country has
    [reached](https://www.dailysignal.com/2025/04/04/exclusive-number-unaccompanied-children-arriving-border-reaches-record-low-under-trump/) a
    record low. At its peak under Biden, 4.6% of illegal border
    crossings were unaccompanied minors — many of whom were victims of
    trafficking. In the first two weeks of March under President Trump,
    that percentage had already fallen to just [0.4% of illegal
    crossings](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1901701247377252421).  
      
-   **PROMISE MADE: **“325,000 children are missing or dead. They came
    through the border… 325,000 children went through her stupid open
    border, and now they’re either missing, dead, or slaves. If you want
    to end this disaster, you must get out and vote.”

    than 13,000 of them — fulfilling President

    do everything possible to save child victims of human trafficking.  
      
-   **PROMISE MADE:** “Under my leadership, we will seal it up and

    with [dozens of
    miles](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1887203939981947079) of
    new construction underway — including new border barrier projects
    underway in [El
    Paso](https://x.com/CBP/status/1945844840731754583) and the [Rio
    Grande
    Valley](https://www.borderreport.com/immigration/the-border-wall/new-border-wall-going-up-over-existing-barrier-in-rio-grande-valley/).  
      
-   **PROMISE MADE:** “I will end

    illegal immigrants, deported [139,000+ illegal
    immigrants](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1916840980700971135),
    and [released](https://x.com/RealTomHoman/status/1907574940246880739) just
    nine illegal immigrants into the U.S. — a staggering 99.99% decrease
    over the same period last year under Biden.  
      
-   **PROMISE MADE:** “We will reinstate my Remain in Mexico policy.”
    ([1/20/25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFvLorAL5-8&t=748s))
-   **✅ PROMISE KEPT:** Soon after taking office, President Trump
    [reinstated](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-administration-reinstating-remain-mexico-program-2025-01-21/)
    the “Remain in Mexico” policy — ensuring would-be illegal border
    crossers are not able to wait with little consequence in the U.S.
    for the resolution of their cases.  
      
-   **PROMISE MADE:** “Kamala’s app for illegals will be shut down
    immediately — within 24
    hours.” ([10/12/24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xguaneoZ5A&t=3232s))

    [ended](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/trump-shuts-cbp-one-immigration-app-dashing-migrants-hopes-entering-us-rcna188448)
    the app’s use almost immediately after taking office — eventually
    [repurposing](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/cbp-launches-enhanced-cbp-home-mobile-app-new-report-departure)
    it to allow migrants to self-deport.  
      
-   **PROMISE MADE:** “On Day One of the Trump Presidency, I will…
    suspend refugee admissions, stop the resettlement, and keep the
    terrorists the hell out of our country.”
    ([7/27/24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3uY9gE8s7g&t=4666s))

    [suspended](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/realigning-the-united-states-refugee-admissions-program/)

    [lowered](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/03/nx-s1-5595950/trump-is-slashing-the-number-of-refugees-what-does-that-mean)
    the number of refugees allowed into the country — ensuring the U.S.
    does not become a safe haven to those who hate us.  
      
-   **PROMISE MADE:** “To further deter illegal immigration, I will sign
    on Day One, executive order, ending automatic citizenship for the

    supply chains, and protect U.S. national security. After decades of
    weak trade policies that allowed foreign nations to exploit our
    economy, close off certain markets to U.S. exports, and flood
    American markets with dumped goods, America is finally getting tough
    on trade and delivering results thanks to President Trump.

    and its precursor chemicals in their tracks — and securing
    agreements with the two countries to work together to protect our

-   **PROMISE MADE:** “\[China is\] sending fentanyl into our country —
    and because of that, they’re causing us hundreds of thousands of
    deaths, so China is going to end up paying a tariff also for that…
    China has to stop sending fentanyl into our country and killing our
    people.”

    the U.S. to stop the flow of fentanyl and precursor chemicals —
    culminating in an historic meeting with President Xi Jinping, where
    the two leaders pledged cooperation on solving the problem.

## Revitalizing American manufacturing

## Ending the weaponization of government

-   **PROMISE MADE:** “Biden has worked to persecute political
    dissidents, including conservatives, Catholics and other Christians,
    and opponents of his weaponized state … This abuse will be

    and [launched](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/gregg-jarrett-cia-report-makes-clear-trump-framed) full-scale
