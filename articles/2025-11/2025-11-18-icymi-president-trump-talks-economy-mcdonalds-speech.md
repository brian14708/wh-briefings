**Here’s what you missed:**

-   “I’m honored to stand before you as the very first former McDonald’s
    fry cook ever to become President of the United States.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1990561057618739288?s=20))
-   “My pledge to every family and every small business is that I will
    not rest until you are richer, stronger, more successful, happier,
    until you’ve gotten a piece of the American Dream… That begins with
    making America affordable.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1990566304999264256?s=20))
-   “There’s still a lot of work to do — and we’re making tremendous
    progress. 1.9 million more American-born workers are employed today
    than when I took office… Wages for hourly workers are rising at the
    fastest pace in 60 years.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1990564881293324452?s=20))
-   “I’m fighting every day to support small businesses like yours and
    the citizens that we all serve — and together, we’re fighting for an
    economy where everyone can win, from the cashier starting her first
    job, to the franchisee opening his first location, to the young
    family in a drive-thru line.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1990564191573282963))
-   “The Biden Administration started the affordability crisis — and my
    Administration is ending it… In the past six months, the price of
    breakfast items has fallen 14%, bread prices are down, dairy prices
    are down; the price of eggs has declined 86% since March.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1990569207499796792?s=20))
-   “While Democrats wanted to give Americans the largest tax hike in
    history, in July, I proudly gave you the largest tax cuts in
    American history and signed the One Big Beautiful Bill into law.
    That includes No Tax on Tips, No Tax on Overtime, and No Tax on
    Social Security for our great seniors. That is a big deal.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1990568566324932886?s=20))
-   “We slashed more than $1 trillion worth of regulations, burdens on
    the U.S. economy — in particular, on businesses and people that
    employ people. Combining our regulatory and tax cuts, we’ve reduced
    the effective burden on franchisees by more than 37%.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1990570444999852233?s=20))
-   “In my first term, I also stopped a mortal threat to the franchise
    business model by terminating Obama’s infamous ‘joint employer
    rule…’ As long as I’m President, I’ll always defend your right to
    run your own small businesses, and do it well.”
    ([Watch](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1990571528858316898?s=20))
-   “As you may have heard, I’m also one of your all-time most loyal
    customers… While other politicians fly around on campaign planes
    stocked with expensive catering, on Trump Force One… we serve only
    McDonald’s almost every time.”
