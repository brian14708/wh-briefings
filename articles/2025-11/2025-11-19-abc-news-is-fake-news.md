**ABC “News” is not journalism — it’s a Democrat spin operation
masquerading as a broadcast network.** The network’s longstanding
commitment to hoaxes, character assassinations, and outright fiction
targeting only one side of the political aisle is a deliberate deception
to wage war on President Trump and the millions of Americans who elected
him to multiple terms.

**ABC “News” has a long, rich tradition of peddling lies, conspiracies,
and outright opinion thinly veiled as fact:**

-   In 2017, ABC
    [suspended](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/abc-news-reporter-brian-ross-suspended-serious-error-flynn-reporting-n825966)
    investigative reporter Brian Ross after he falsely reported that
    President Trump had directed Michael Flynn to contact Russian
    officials before the 2016 election.
-   In 2020, ABC
    [suspended](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/26/abc-news-suspends-journalist-project-veritas-remarks-117708#:~:text=They%20had%20especially,parent%20company%20Disney.)
    veteran correspondent David Wright after he was
    [caught](https://www.projectveritas.com/2020/02/26/breaking-senior-abc-correspondent-david-wright-on-hidden-camera-how-bosses-dont-see-an-upside-for-reporting-news-the-truth-suffers-says-abc-doesn/)
    identifying himself as a “socialist” and admitting the network
    pushes an anti-Trump agenda and airs stories designed for profit,
    not news.
-   In 2020, George Stephanopoulos — [longtime Democrat
    operative](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/05/who-is-george-stephanopoulos/74310868007/)
    turned wannabe “journalist” —
    [failed](https://newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/curtis-houck/2020/10/15/censorship-abc-holds-bidens-hand-refuses-ask-him-about-hunter)
    to ask Joe Biden about his son Hunter’s infamous laptop or the
    swirling allegations of impropriety.
-   In 2024, Stephanopoulos repeatedly lied about President Trump’s
    legal cases. After being sued for promoting these defamatory lies,
    the network agreed to
    [settle](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/12/21/abc-news-settlement-trump-media-threats-00195761)
    for $16 million and
    [issue](https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/12/14/abc-news-trump-defamation-lawsuit-stephanopoulos/#:~:text=As%20part%20of,E.%20Jean%20Carroll.)
    a statement of regret.
-   In October 2024, the network erroneously “fact checked” President
    Trump [at least five
    times](https://nypost.com/2024/09/11/us-news/trump-was-fact-checked-by-abc-moderators-5-times-while-harris-was-left-alone/)
    during the presidential debate — but failed to call out his opponent
    a single time.
-   Following President Trump’s historic 2024 election victory, [90% of
    the network’s
    coverage](https://newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/bill-dagostino/2024/12/19/study-broadcast-transition-coverage-aimed-sinking-trumps-picks)
    of his cabinet nominees was negative.
-   In January, ABC News gave [27 times more
    coverage](https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/bill-dagostino/2025/01/27/abc-cbs-nbc-give-trumps-pardons-15x-more-time-bidens)
    to President Trump’s pardons of January 6 defendants than of Biden’s
    last-minute pardons to his corrupt family members.
-   In January, ABC News
    [editorialized](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-moved-quickly-exact-retribution-revenge-analysis/story?id=118180327)
    in a partisan way that President Trump’s personnel directives were
    “retribution.”
-   In February, ABC News
    [mischaracterized](https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/alex-christy/2025/02/15/abc-claims-attack-civil-servants-attack-veterans)
    the Trump Administration’s effort to eliminate waste, fraud, and
    abuse in the bloated federal bureaucracy as an “attack on veterans.”
-   In April, ABC News
    [peddled](https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/jorge-bonilla/2025/04/28/abc-news-insists-pushing-debunked-deported-citizen-babies-hoax)
    the debunked lie that the Trump Administration was unilaterally
    deporting U.S. citizen babies.
-   In June, ABC News’s senior national correspondent Terry Moran
    [smeared](https://x.com/PressSec/status/1931687759447556395?lang=en)
    White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller as a “world-class
    hater” whose “hatreds are his spiritual nourishment” — just one
    entry in a long series of [Moran’s obvious liberal
    bias](https://newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/geoffrey-dickens/2025/04/28/terrible-terry-interview-trump-worst-abcs-moran)
    during his tenure.
-   In June, ABC News
    [aired](https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/ashley-taylor/2025/06/26/abc-shows-footage-ice-arrest-omits-clip-showing-attack-agents)
    what it called a “violent Border Patrol detention” — but failed to
    mention the detained illegal immigrant had been chasing federal
    agents with a weed whacker.
-   In June, ABC News
    [praised](https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/curtis-houck/2025/06/11/abc-praises-la-rioters-self-policing-nbc-admits-businesses-are)
    violent Los Angeles rioters for “self-policing” — as local
    businesses and property were being harmed — during coverage critical
    of President Trump’s National Guard deployment.
-   In July, ABC News
    [used](https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/curtis-houck/2025/07/03/abc-breaks-special-report-dump-big-beautiful-bill-passage)
    its special coverage of the One Big Beautiful Bill signing ceremony
    to falsely claim the legislation would “mostly” benefit “the
    wealthiest Americans” and repeat the debunked talking point that
    millions of Americans would “lose their healthcare.”
-   In July, ABC News
    [refused](https://www.foxnews.com/media/legacy-media-outlets-largely-silent-tulsi-gabbards-bombshell-obama-administration-claims#:~:text=ABC%20News%20and%20NBC%20News%20failed%20to%20cover%20the%20story%20on%2Dair%20through%20Sunday%2C%20according%20to%20a%20search%20of%20transcripts%20using%20Grabien%20Media.%20%C2%A0)
    to cover the Office of National Intelligence’s announcement of a
    landmark investigation into Obama-era politicization and
    manufacturing of intelligence assessments.
-   In July, ABC News
    [dismissed](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1940454923482943866)
    the vicious MS-13 gang — whose motto is literally “kill, rape,
    control” — as a “clique.”
-   In September, Stephanopoulos repeatedly — and falsely —
    [insisted](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1970477118388834737)
    that people had somehow “died” because of the Trump Administration’s
    decision to shutter a bloated, wasteful bureaucratic agency.
