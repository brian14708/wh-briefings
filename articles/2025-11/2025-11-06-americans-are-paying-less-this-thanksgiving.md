title: "Americans Are Paying Less This Thanksgiving \U0001F983"
---
 
**President Donald J. Trump promised to crush inflation and lower prices
— and he’s delivering this Thanksgiving, with the classic holiday feast
about 3% cheaper than last year, according to a** [**brand new
report**](https://www.wellsfargo.com/com/insights/agri-food-intelligence/thanksgiving-food-report/)**.**
Americans are seeing across-the-board price declines for the holiday
staples, with dinner rolls [down
22%](https://www.usatoday.com/story/grocery/2025/11/06/cost-of-thanksgiving-gone-down-why-turkey/87014435007/#:~:text=Private%20brand%20dinner%20rolls%20had%20the%20biggest%20savings%20with%20a%2022%25%20price%20decrease%20this%20year),
frozen vegetables [down
15%](https://www.usatoday.com/story/grocery/2025/11/06/cost-of-thanksgiving-gone-down-why-turkey/87014435007/#:~:text=National%20name%20brand%20frozen%20vegetables%20are%20down%2015%25),
and items like turkeys, stuffing, gravy mix, fresh cranberries, and
pumpkin pies [all costing
less](https://www.usatoday.com/story/grocery/2025/11/06/cost-of-thanksgiving-gone-down-why-turkey/87014435007/#:~:text=Cranberries%2C%20gravy%2C%20rolls%20and,1.5%25%20from%20last%20year.).

It’s proof that under President Trump’s leadership, America is winning
the war on high prices — even as Democrats grind the country to a halt
with their deranged, reckless government shutdown.

years:**
