title: 'ICYMI: Migrants on Terror Watchlist Received Medicaid'

**From the [Department of Government
Efficiency](https://x.com/DOGE/status/1910440762254250085):**

“Under the Biden administration, it was routine for Border Patrol to
admit aliens into the United States with no legal status and minimal
screening. So far, CBP identified a subset of 6.3k individuals paroled
into the United States since 2023 on the FBI’s Terrorist Screening
Center watchlist or with criminal records. These paroles have since been
terminated with immediate effect.

Despite having no other legal status, paroled aliens are able to file
for work authorization and receive social security numbers. Among these
6.3k paroled aliens with criminal or terrorist records (all have a
social security number):

– 905 collecting Medicaid (including 4 on the terrorist watch list).
$276k was paid out  
– 41 collecting Unemployment Insurance, receiving $42k in benefits  
– 22 received federal student loans totaling $280k  
– 409 received {net} tax refunds (2024 only) for $751k  
– Several (final number TBD) received SNAP (food stamp) benefits”
