title: 'PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT: Border Security Achieved in Fewer Than 100 Days'
---
 
Since President Donald J. Trump took office, he and his administration
have ushered in the most secure border in modern American history — and
he didn’t need legislation to do it. President Trump has made good on
the promises he made on the campaign trail to usher in an unprecedented
era of homeland security.

Here are a few of those promises:

**PROMISE MADE:** “We will close the border. We will stop the invasion
of illegals into our country.” *([10/12/24, Aurora,
CO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xguaneoZ5A&t=4624s))*

**PROMISE KEPT:**

    [down](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1916836225131958670) by
