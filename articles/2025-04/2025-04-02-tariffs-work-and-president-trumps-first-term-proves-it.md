title: "Tariffs Work \u2014 and President Trump\u2019s First Term Proves It"
---
 
For the first time in decades, the United States will see fair trade as
President Donald J. Trump announces tariffs to level the playing field
for American workers and businesses.

**Despite the rhetoric from politicians and the media, studies have
repeatedly shown tariffs are an effective tool for achieving economic
and strategic objectives — just as they did in President Trump’s first
term.**

-   A [2024 study](https://archive.ph/MbSab) on the effects of President
    Trump’s tariffs in his first term found that they “strengthened the
    U.S. economy” and “led to significant reshoring” in industries like
    manufacturing and steel production.
-   A [2023 report](https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub5405.pdf)
    by the U.S. International Trade Commission — which analyzed the
    effects of President Trump’s Section 232 and 301 tariffs on more
    than $300 billion of U.S. imports —
    [found](https://archive.ph/QXsNB) the tariffs reduced imports from
    China, effectively stimulated more U.S. production of the affected
    goods, and had very minor effects on downstream prices.
-   According to the [Economic Policy
    Institute](https://www.epi.org/blog/tariff-increases-did-not-cause-inflation-and-their-removal-would-undermine-domestic-supply-chains/),
    the tariffs implemented by President Trump during his first term
    “clearly show\[ed\] no correlation with inflation” and had only a
    fleeting effect on overall prices.
    -   [Economic Policy
        Institute](https://www.epi.org/publication/why-global-steel-surpluses-warrant-u-s-section-232-import-measures/):
        “Following implementation of Sec. 232 measures in 2018—and prior
        to the global downturn in 2020—U.S. steel output, employment,
        capital investment, and financial performance all improved. In
        particular, U.S. steel producers announced plans to invest more
        than $15.7 billion in new or upgraded steel facilities, creating
        at least 3,200 direct new jobs, many of which are now poised to
        come online.”
-   An analysis by the [Atlantic
    Council](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Explainer-US-Tariffs-on-Mexico-2025.pdf)
    found that “tariffs would create new incentives for US consumers to
    buy US-made products.”
-   Former Biden Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen
    [affirmed](https://x.com/NewsHour/status/1790510913436487745) last
    year that tariffs do not raise prices: “I don’t believe that
    American consumers will see any meaningful increase in the prices
    that they face.”
-   A [2024 economic analysis](https://archive.ph/NwKHa) found that a
    global tariff of 10% would grow the economy by $728 billion, create
    2.8 million jobs, and increase real household incomes by 5.7%.

    -   “With steel imports down, America’s steelmakers have started
        investing at home. In addition to Nucor and US Steel, companies
        like Cleveland-Cliffs, Steel Dynamics, CMC, and AK Steel have
        invested billions of dollars in at least 16 major new projects
        throughout the nation. The top five US steel companies more than
        doubled their total annual investments between 2017 to 2019,
        from $1.5 billion to $4.2 billion.”

**Predictably, the media was wrong.**

    (2018): “Trump tariffs may imperil a delicate global economic
    rebound”**
    -   “President Donald Trump’s announcement Thursday that the United
        States would impose heavy tariffs on imported steel and aluminum
        — with some countries potentially exempted — suddenly raised a
        fear that few had anticipated: That U.S. tariffs could trigger a
        chain of tit-for-tat retaliation by America’s trading partners
        that could erupt into a full-blown trade war and possibly
        threaten the global economy.”

    (2018): “Trump Plan To Impose Tariffs on Steel, Aluminum Raises
    Trade War Fears”**
    -   “Chad Bown, an economist and trade specialist, says the tariffs
        will drive up the price of steel and aluminum for the multiple
        other industries that use the metals. Those industries actually
        employ more people than the steel and aluminum sectors, he says,
        ‘so this is a really big concern, just from an economic
        perspective.’”

    Reality”**
    -   “What we do know for sure is that, the longer Donald Trump
        persists in his trade war, the greater the chances are of an
        outright slump developing.”

    aluminum tariffs”**
    -   President Donald Trump’s decision to impose tariffs of 25
        percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum reverberated
        across the world Thursday, spurring retaliatory threats from
        some of the nation’s closest allies and sending stock prices
        plummeting on investors’ fears of the global economic fallout.”
