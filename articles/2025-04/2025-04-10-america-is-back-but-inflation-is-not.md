title: "America Is Back \u2014 But Inflation Is Not"

Today’s new Consumer Price Index reveals
inflation [fell](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/10/inflation-rate-eases-to-2point4percent-in-march-lower-than-expected.html) to
2.4% in March, [smashing
expectations](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/10/inflation-rate-eases-to-2point4percent-in-march-lower-than-expected.html) for
the second straight month — **and the first drop in consumer prices in
several years.**

[CNN’s coverage
noted](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1910317558302941380): “This
was actually a DROP of .1% — that’s the first time we’ve seen that since
COVID. Year-over-year, the annual inflation rate was at 2.4%. This was
also better than expected and a six-month low, moving in the right
direction.”

**Under President Trump, America is back — but inflation is not.**

President Trump is making good on his promise to deliver lower costs for
Americans, with prices for everyday goods seeing across-the-board
declines.

-   Prescription drug prices saw the largest monthly decline on record.
-   Prices for airfare, used vehicles, and car insurance all decreased.
-   Energy prices fell 2.4% in March, driven by plummeting gas prices
    across the country.

As President Trump pursues the [largest tax cuts in
history](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/04/heres-what-happens-if-trump-tax-cuts-arent-extended/),
an [unprecedented deregulatory
agenda](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/04/president-trumps-actions-will-save-nearly-11000-per-family-of-four-over-the-coming-years/),
and a [manufacturing
boom](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/president-trump-is-remaking-america-into-a-manufacturing-superpower/),
the American economy is poised to prosper like never before.
