title: NYT Smear Attempt Omits Its Own Critical Context
---
 
*The New York Times’s*
[story](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/health/rfk-jr-maha-tour.html#:~:text=Health%20Secretary%20Robert%20F.%20Kennedy%20Jr.%20kicked%20off%20a%20tour%20through%20southwestern%20states%20on%20Monday%20by%20calling%20on%20states%20to%20ban%20fluoride%20in%20drinking%20water%20supplies%2C%20a%20move%20that%20would%20reverse%20what%20some%20medical%20experts%20consider%20one%20of%20the%20most%20important%20public%20health%20practices%20in%20the%20country%E2%80%99s%20history.)
on Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.’s review of fluoride recommendations
is another thinly veiled attempt to falsely portray the Trump
Administration as anti-science and anti-health — a characterization that
couldn’t be farther from the truth.

In January, *The New York Times* itself
[reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/health/fluoride-children-iq.html)
that “fluoride may be linked to lower I.Q. scores in children.” Why did
the *Times* not note its own prior reporting in its article on Secretary
Kennedy?

Or these facts:

-   Fluoride is the only chemical added to drinking water that does not
    treat the water; it is added to water only for [medicinal
    purposes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12749628/).
-   Most industrialized nations, including much of Europe, [do
    not](https://archive.ph/mIpA6) add fluoride to their water — and it
    has had [no discernible
    detriment](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2001050/) on
    their dental health.
-   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now
    [concedes](https://x.com/michaelpconnett/status/1856321229461885407)
    that fluoride’s predominant dental benefit comes from topical
    contact with the outside of the teeth, not ingestion — making it
    unnecessary to ingest fluoride.
-   In August 2024, the Department of Health and Human Service’s
    National Toxicology Program
    [concluded](https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/sites/default/files/2024-08/fluoride_final_508.pdf)
    with “moderate confidence” that fluoride in water at just 1.5 mg/L
    is “consistently associated with lower IQ in children.”
-   Recent studies of CDC’s National Health and Nutrition Examination
    Surveys have found significant associations between low levels of
    fluoride and various indicators of chronic disease, including
    [reduced testosterone levels in
    boys](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38063965/), increased
    [inflammation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36289513/), altered
    [kidney and liver
    function](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31402058/), and increased
    [sleep problems](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31818308/).
