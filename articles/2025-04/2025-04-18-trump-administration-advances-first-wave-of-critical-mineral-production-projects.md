title: Trump Administration Advances First Wave of Critical Mineral Production Projects
---
 
Today, the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (Permitting
Council) announced increased transparency, accountability, and
predictability for the permitting review process for the first wave of
critical mineral production projects—with many more projects on the
way—in response to President Trump’s Executive Order, *[Immediate
Measures to Increase American Mineral
Production](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-measures-to-increase-american-mineral-production/)*.
Identifying these transparency projects under the Permitting Council’s
statutory program advances the President’s directive to take immediate
action to facilitate domestic production of America’s vast mineral
resources to create jobs, fuel prosperity, and significantly reduce our
reliance on foreign nations.

“This is the first use of the Permitting Council’s transparency
authority, and we look forward to showcasing the many benefits the
Federal Permitting Dashboard can bring to critical infrastructure
projects as part of President Trump’s Executive Order on increasing
American mineral production,” **said Manisha Patel, Acting Executive
Director at the Permitting Council**. “The Federal Permitting Dashboard
is a vital tool in enhancing interagency coordination and efficient
decision making and will play an invaluable role in ensuring that these
projects receive the most efficient review and authorization process
possible in order to bring the benefits of next generation
infrastructure to communities across the nation.”

In response to the *Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral
Production* Executive Order, the chair of the National Energy Dominance
Council (NEDC) submitted the first in a series of lists of mineral
production projects to be identified as transparency projects on the
Federal Permitting Dashboard to the Permitting Council Acting Executive
Director. This is just the beginning—many more projects are expected to
be added to the list on a rolling basis over the next few weeks.
Inclusion on the Permitting Dashboard as a transparency project makes
the environmental review and authorizations schedule for these vital
mineral production projects publicly available and allows all of these
projects to benefit from increased transparency. The public nature of
the dashboard ensures that all stakeholders, from project sponsors and
community members to federal agency leaders have up-to-date accounting
of where each project stands in the review process. This transparency
leads to greater accountability, ensuring a more efficient process.

**Initial selected projects include:**

• Resolution Copper Project  
• Stibnite Gold Project  
• Warrior Met Coal Mines  
• McDermitt Exploration Project  
• South West Arkansas Project  
• Caldwell Canyon Mine Project  
• Libby Exploration Project  
• Lisbon Valley Copper Project  
• Silver Peak Lithium Mine  
• Michigan Potash
