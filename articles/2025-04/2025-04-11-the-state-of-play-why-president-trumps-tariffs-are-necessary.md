title: "The State of Play: Why President Trump\u2019s Tariffs Are Necessary"
---
 
It’s cliché, yet true — the definition of insanity is repeating the same
thing over and expecting a different result.  
  
The trade policies of the past several decades have failed this nation,
its workers, and our communities.  
  
Twenty years ago, [*The New York Times* Editorial
Board](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/14/opinion/dangerous-deficits.html?searchResultPosition=11)
responded to the January 2005 trade deficit of $58.3 billion by writing
an editorial entitled “Dangerous deficits.” Deficits are certainly
dangerous; former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker
[said](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/feb/05/volcker-blames-recession-on-trade-imbalances/)
trade deficits were to blame for the Great Recession.  
  
The *Times* wrote in 2005: “At $58.3 billion, the U.S. trade deficit for
January exceeded everyone’s worst expectations… The trade deficit is the
single most important factor in measuring the extent to which the United
States lives beyond its means.”  
  
Since then, our trade deficit has more than DOUBLED. The U.S. [trade
deficit](https://www.bea.gov/news/2025/us-international-trade-goods-and-services-january-2025)
in January totaled a whopping $131.4 billion.  
  
The impact has been seen everywhere.  
  
Since 1990, manufacturing employment has
[decreased](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NYMFG) by 59% in New York
and [decreased](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/OHMFGN) by 35% in
Ohio.  
  
The loss of these jobs killed innocent Americans and destroyed towns.
[Multiple](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aeri.20180396)
[studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352827319300096)
show the loss of jobs due to bad trade deals led to an increase in drug
overdoses.  
  
However, liberal commentators have lost interest in fixing this problem.
In fact, they are offended at the suggestion that industry should return
to America.  
  
Chris Matthews was inexplicably stunned on MSNBC and
[asked](https://x.com/townhallcom/status/1909966727754268917), “What are
we going to do? Have more lumber made in the United States now!?” Yes,
we are. [President Donald J. Trump even signed an executive
order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-expansion-of-american-timber-production/)
to expand American timber production.  
  
Likewise, Nia Malika-Henderson on CNN ridiculously
[asked](https://x.com/devorydarkins/status/1910018727887908969), “Is it
worth it to upend the global economy for HVAC jobs?” Apparently, Nia
Malika-Henderson thinks preserving low-wage jobs in China is more
important than creating high-wage jobs in America.  
  
The loss of American industry means we struggle to build
[ships](https://www.wsj.com/world/trumps-arctic-goals-demand-icebreakers-but-u-s-struggles-to-build-them-e13a33b9),
[medicine](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/china-has-cornered-the-market-on-antibiotics-so-the-u-s-must-rebuild-its-manufacturing-capacity-11619640612),
and other essential goods. This is a national security emergency.  
  
Fortunately, we are already seeing progress in reshoring American
industry. President Trump remains undeterred in his mission to Make
America Wealthy Again.
