title: "ICYMI: President Trump\u2019s Steel Tariffs Mean American Jobs"
---
 
President Donald J. Trump’s tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum
imports are a big win for American workers and manufacturing — just like
[they
were](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/04/tariffs-work-and-president-trumps-first-term-proves-it/)
during President Trump’s first term.

**“We’re in favor of the tariffs because we make everything in America.
Our factories are in Baltimore, Indiana, and Michigan. We use American
steel and American workers … Our challenge is that we’re competing
against governments, like the Chinese government,”** Drew Greenblatt,
CEO of Baltimore-based Marlin Steel Wire Products, [said on CBS Morning
News](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1894045973225017530). **“If
we have a fair and level playing field, our American factory workers
will thrive and prosper. We can really pull people from poverty, bring
them into the middle
class.”**[](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1894045973225017530)

**“Our goal is that we’re going to sell millions more dollars so we have
to hire many more people. If we do that, we’re going to hire them at
very good jobs with very good pay,”** [Greenblatt told CNN’s Jake
Tapper](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1909360170934673653).
**“There’s going to be an overwhelming surge of hiring in America as
things level out, as American factories ramp up … This is a very
exciting time for the American manufacturing
worker.”**[](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1909360170934673653)
