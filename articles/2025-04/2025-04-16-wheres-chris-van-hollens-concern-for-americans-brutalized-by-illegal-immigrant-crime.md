title: "Where\u2019s Chris Van Hollen\u2019s Concern for Americans Brutalized by Illegal\
  \ Immigrant Crime?"
---
 
Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) is currently in El Salvador out of concern
for an illegal immigrant MS-13 gang member and human trafficker, for
whom he [“won’t stop fighting until he’s
home.”](https://x.com/ChrisVanHollen/status/1912447452117942763)

**The criminal illegal immigrant is *already *home — he’s a Salvadoran
citizen.**

Where was the Maryland senator’s concern when one of his own
constituents, Rachel Morin — an innocent mother of five — was brutally
murdered by an illegal immigrant? Van Hollen [didn’t even
bother](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1912470477081018717) to
contact her family.

Where was his concern when an accused killer
was [allowed](https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/ice-arrests-guatemalan-alien-charged-murder-assault-after-release-noncooperative) to
roam free due to the [so-called “sanctuary”
policies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/04/sanctuary-policies-put-accused-killer-back-on-the-streets/) of
his state’s second-most populous county? Van Hollen didn’t say a word
about the radical policies that put his constituents at risk.

**And where was his concern for Maryland constituents put at risk by the
many other illegal immigrants allowed to roam free until now? **Here is
a tiny sample of the criminal illegal immigrants arrested by ICE in
Maryland in recent days:
