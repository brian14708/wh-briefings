title: The NPR, PBS Grift Has Ripped Us Off for Too Long
---
 
For years, American taxpayers have been on the hook for subsidizing
National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS),
which spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as “news.”  
  
As [President Trump has
stated](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1904610620659687944),
taxpayer funding of NPR’s and PBS’s biased content is a waste.  
  
**Here are some examples of the trash that passes for “news” at NPR and
PBS:**

-   In 2024, NPR
    [ran](https://www.npr.org/2024/02/14/1198909355/valentines-day-relationships-gay-animals-nature)
    a Valentine’s Day feature around “queer animals,” in which it
    suggested the make-believe clownfish in Finding Nemo would’ve been
    better off as a female, that “banana slugs are hermaphrodites,” and
    that “some deer are nonbinary.”
-   In 2024, PBS
    [produced](https://www.pbs.org/video/the-cost-of-inheritance-bdzmlq/)
    a documentary making the case for reparations.
-   In 2023, PBS’s *Washington Week* roundtable covered up Joe Biden’s
    clear mental decline, with far-left “journalist” Jeff Goldberg
    [claiming](https://newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/clay-waters/2023/09/07/pbss-washington-weeks-laugh-line-joe-biden-mentally-hes-quite-acute)
    Biden is actually “quite acute.”
-   In 2022, NPR
    [educated](https://www.wbur.org/endlessthread/2022/01/14/fight-for-dinosaur-emoji#:~:text=Riley%3A%20Many%20people,Trans%2Dceratops.)
    the nation on the “whole community of genderqueer dinosaur
    enthusiasts” and “trans-ceratops.”
-   In 2021, a PBS station
    [aired](https://www.foxnews.com/us/pbs-station-defends-drag-queen-kids?msockid=39cef04a7cdd669717c4e5c87d6467b6)
    a “children’s program” that featured a drag queen named “Lil’ Miss
    Hot Mess.”
-   In 2021, NPR
    [reported](https://www.npr.org/2021/12/23/1067210075/what-if-the-best-diet-is-to-reject-diet-culture#:~:text=%22A%20cousin%20of,their%20weight%20itself.%22)
    on the “cousin of diet culture” known as “healthism, which is the
    idea that we have to be healthy” — as if that was a bad thing.
-   In 2021, NPR
    [suggested](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1067210075?ft=nprml&f=1067210075#:~:text=TAGLE%3A%20We%20might,through%20intuitive%20eating.)
    doorway sizes are based on “latent fatphobia.”
-   In 2021, NPR
    [lamented](https://www.npr.org/2021/04/03/984008349/opinion-animals-deserve-gender-pronouns-too)
    that “animals deserve pronouns, too.”
-   In 2022, NPR [ran a
    feature](https://www.npr.org/2022/05/29/1101224759/what-queer-ducks-can-teach-teenagers-about-sexuality-in-the-animal-kingdom)
    titled “What ‘Queer Ducks’ can teach teenagers about sexuality in
    the animal kingdom.”
-   In 2020, PBS show Sesame Street
    [partnered](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/02/us/cnn-sesame-street-standing-up-to-racism/index.html)
    with CNN for a town hall aimed presenting children with a one-sided
    narrative to “address racism” amid the Black Lives Matter riots.
-   In 2020, NPR
    [explored](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/893006538#:~:text=As%20Sabrina%20Strings%20explains%20in,still%20dealing%20with%20the%20consequences.)
    “the racial origins of fat phobia.”
-   In 2017, NPR [ran a
    story](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/02/22/515668867/cannibalism-its-perfectly-natural-a-new-scientific-history-argues)
    titled “Cannibalism: It’s ‘Perfectly Natural,’” in which an author
    describes eating another human’s placenta: “It was really the prep
    that made it taste good. Granted, the \[husband\] was a chef and so
    he knew how to prepare it osso bucco style and used a really nice
    wine I had brought. It smelled great. It didn’t taste bad.”
-   In 2017, PBS [aired a
    panel](https://www.pbs.org/video/stay-woke-bddifp/) devoted to what
    it “mean\[s\] to be woke” and “white privilege.”
-   In 2017, PBS [produced an entire
    movie](https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/documentaries/real-boy/)
    celebrating a transgender teenager’s so-called “changing gender
    identity.”
-   In 2015, NPR
    [dedicated](https://www.npr.org/2015/07/12/422311437/the-furries-have-landed-and-pittsburgh-is-giving-them-a-bear-hug)
    an entire segment to the “population of anthropomorphic animal
    enthusiasts known as ‘furries.’” 

**NPR and PBS have zero tolerance for non-leftist viewpoints:**

-   In 2020, NPR refused to cover the
    [explosive](https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/email-reveals-how-hunter-biden-introduced-ukrainian-biz-man-to-dad/)
    Hunter Biden laptop scandal in the runup to the election, baselessly
    [claiming](https://www.mediaite.com/radio/npr-explains-why-they-havent-covered-hunter-biden-laptop-story-red-flags-on-veracity-and-assertions-dont-amount-to-much/)
    there were “many, many red flags” and its “assertions don’t amount
    to much.”
    -   NPR
        [wrote](https://x.com/NPRpubliceditor/status/1319281101223940096):
        “We don’t want to waste our time on stories that are not really
        stories, and we don’t want to waste the listeners’ and readers’
        time on stories that are just pure distractions.”
-   When a 25-year veteran NPR reporter and editor [spoke
    out](https://www.thefp.com/p/npr-editor-how-npr-lost-americas-trust)
    about the network’s refusal to report on the Hunter Biden laptop —
    and their obsession with liberal causes — they
    [suspended](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/16/1244962042/npr-editor-uri-berliner-suspended-essay)
    him.
    -   The editor
        [found](https://www.foxnews.com/media/npr-editor-found-registered-democrats-outnumbered-republicans-87-zero-newsroom)
        that registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans 87 to zero in
        their newsroom.
    -   NPR prolifically reported on the Russian collusion hoax, with
        the editor
        [describing](https://www.thefp.com/p/npr-editor-how-npr-lost-americas-trust)
        “\[Adam\] Schiff talking points” as “the drumbeat of NPR news
        reports.”
    -   NPR management
        [asked](https://www.thefp.com/p/npr-editor-how-npr-lost-americas-trust)
        its editors to avoid the term “biological sex” when discussing
        transgender issues.
-   NPR CEO Katherine Maher once [called](https://archive.is/9Egnx)
    President Trump “racist,”
    [shared](https://x.com/krmaher/status/1323094291732815872) a photo
    of herself wearing a “Biden for President” campaign hat,
    [serves](https://www.judicialwatch.org/nprs-new-ceo/) on the board
    of a Soros-funded activist group, and
    [described](https://dailycaller.com/2024/04/17/new-npr-ceo-said-reverence-truth-distraction-resurfaced-ted-talk/)
    the “reverence for the truth” as a “distraction.”
-   In 2023, a study
    [found](https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/rich-noyes/2023/05/16/study-taxpayer-subsidized-pbs-whacks-gop-85-negative-news)
    that congressional Republicans saw 85% negative coverage while
    congressional Democrats saw 54% positive coverage on PBS’s flagship
    news program.
-   According to a [2024
    study](https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/clay-waters/2024/12/04/pbs-news-hours-extreme-makeover-27-times-more-likely-find-far-right),
    PBS news staff used 162 variations of the term “far-right,” but only
    six variations of “far-left.”
-   Media bias rating agency AllBias — which surveyed nearly 24,000
    readers —
    [found](https://www.allsides.com/news-source/npr-editorial) NPR’s
    bias aligns with “liberal, progressive or left-wing thought and/or
    policy agendas.”
-   In 2010, NPR terminated journalist Juan Williams, who
    [said](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2010/10/21/130729461/npr-ombudsman-williams-should-have-been-given-choice)
    it was because he was not a “predictable, black liberal.”
-   NPR repeatedly dismissed the theory that COVID-19 originated in a
    lab — a conclusion now deemed likely by the
    [FBI](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fbi-director-says-covid-pandemic-most-likely-originated-chinese-lab),
    [CIA](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cia-releases-new-analysis-covid-origins-favoring-lab-leak-theory),
    and [Department of
    Energy](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/26/politics/covid-lab-leak-wuhan-china-intelligence/index.html).
