title: "SUNDAY SHOWS: President Trump\u2019s Bold Vision for Economic Prosperity"
---
 
This morning, officials from the Trump Administration took to the
networks to outline President Donald J. Trump’s reciprocal trade plan as
he ends the globalist policies of economic destruction that have shipped
American jobs and industries overseas at the expense of American
workers.

**Here’s what you missed:**

Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent on Meet the Press

-   [On tariffs during President Trump’s first
    term](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1908880979780862016): “A
    20% tariff on China led to a 0.7% price level increase over four
    years. I think that’s pretty good — if we can take in 20% in tariffs
    and it’s a 0.7% increase … Households saw real net wages go up, so
    if wages go up faster than prices — which is not what happened over
    the past four years.”
-   [On making goods in
    America](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1908879320199680061):
    “We saw during COVID that \[our\] supply chains are not resilient …
    President Trump has decided that we cannot be at risk like that for
    our crucial medicines, for our semiconductors, for shipping.”

Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick on Face the Nation

-   [On trade as an issue of national
    security](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1908892078492234008):
    “We don’t make medicine in this country anymore. We don’t make
    ships. We don’t have enough steel and aluminum to fight a battle …
    We got to stop having all the countries of the world ripping us
    off.”
-   [On trade
    imbalances](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1908894715736367457):
    “In 1980, we were a net investor, meaning we owned more of the rest
    of the world than they owned of us — and now, they own $18 trillion
    of us, net … Eventually, we’re not going to own America and we are
    going to be owned by the rest of the world.”

National Economic Director Kevin Hassett on This Week

-   [On so-called free
    trade](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1908883023090659708):
    “China entered the WTO in 2000. In the 15 years that followed, real
    incomes declined about $1,200 cumulatively over that time … We got
    the cheap goods at the grocery store, but then we had fewer jobs.”

Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins on State of the Union

-   [On using tariffs to level the playing
    field](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1908871077519933705):
    “This whole concept is about rebuilding an American economy around
    American goods, around American industry … Mexico won’t take our
    corn. Australia won’t take our beef … It is time for a change.”
-   [On the EU’s refusal to take American ag
    exports](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1908872153388241221):
    “They are using fake science and unsubstantiated claims to not take
    our products … We produce the safest, the most secure, the best food
    in the world.”
-   [On the agricultural trade
    deficit](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1908877745926308245):
    “In the last four years, the cost of inputs for our farmers went up
    30%. In the last four years, we had an agricultural export deficit
    that increased from zero when President Trump left to $49 billion.”

Attorney General Pam Bondi on Fox News Sunday

-   [On
    lawfare](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1908885035815448728):
    “Just since January 20th, we’ve had over 170 lawsuits filed against
    us. That should be the constitutional crisis right there — 50
    injunctions … trying to control his executive power.”

Senior Counselor Peter Navarro on Sunday Morning Futures

-   [On the need for
    tariffs](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1908889065010708884):
    “It’s all these things that these foreign countries do that are
    designed, explicitly, to cheat us, and are sanctioned by the WTO.
    So, President Trump says, ‘No more’ … We’re headed towards a strong
    America that makes things again.”
