title: The White House Council on Environmental Quality Establishes Permitting Innovation
  Center
---
 
Today, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) issued a
memorandum to heads of Federal agencies establishing an interagency
Permitting Innovation Center. The creation of the Permitting Innovation
Center delivers on President Trump’s Memorandum, *[Updating Permitting
Technology for the 21st
Century](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/updating-permitting-technology-for-the-21st-century/)*,
which directs the Federal government to leverage modern technology to
effectively and efficiently conduct environmental reviews and evaluate
permits for infrastructure projects of all kinds.

Under President Trump’s leadership, the CEQ-led Permitting Innovation
Center will consult with the National Energy Dominance Council (NEDC)
and relevant permitting agencies to issue a Permitting Technology Action
Plan that will provide technology guidance to agencies, while developing
an initial National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) data and technology
standard.

In addition, the Permitting Innovation Center will collaborate with the
General Services Administration (GSA) to design and test prototype
software systems for potential implementation by agencies pursuant to
the Permitting Technology Action Plan.

“The Trump Administration is making unprecedented progress toward
modernizing permitting,” said **Katherine Scarlett, Chief of Staff at
the White House Council on Environmental Quality**. “The establishment
of the Permitting Innovation Center is a major milestone on the road to
permitting reform and demonstrates this Administration’s commitment to
expediting the environmental review and permitting process through
emerging technologies, providing much needed efficiency and transparency
for project sponsors.”

“GSA’s Technology Transformation Services (TTS) is committed to
advancing the President’s agenda by supporting the accelerated
development and building of the Permitting Innovation Center,” said
**Thomas Shedd, Technology Transformation Services Director at General
Services Administration**. “We look forward to working across the
agencies involved in this process, and leveraging our Presidential
Innovation Fellowship program to ensure that each agency’s technology
requirements are understood and met. TTS remains a preferred shared
service provider of software and services to advance critical White
House initiatives such as this one.”
