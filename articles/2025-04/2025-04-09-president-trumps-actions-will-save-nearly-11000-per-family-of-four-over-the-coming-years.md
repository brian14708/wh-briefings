**SUBJECT: President Trump’s Actions Will Save Nearly $11,000 Per Family
of Four Over the Coming Years**  
   
President Donald J. Trump has taken major steps to reduce the size of
the administrative state and reduce the volume of regulations impacting
American households and businesses. The administration expects major
cost savings from the President’s aggressive deregulatory agenda as
firms respond to the improved business environment over the next several
years. Upon taking office, President Trump immediately

all unfinalized Biden era rules, saving Americans over [$180 billion —

and launched a bold, [multi-agency
effort](https://whitehouse.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dace49741569f7585670378b3&id=289710eaa6&e=40024b103d)
to roll back existing federal regulations that drive up the cost of
living. This effort is projected to yield significant cost savings in
the coming months, including the EPA’s rollback of tailpipe emission
rules for light-duty and medium-duty vehicles ([$667 billion in total
savings](https://whitehouse.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dace49741569f7585670378b3&id=2649762d42&e=40024b103d))
and the Department of Transportation’s latest Corporate Average Fuel
Economy
([CAFE](https://whitehouse.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dace49741569f7585670378b3&id=7c9ae2b380&e=40024b103d))
standards ([$88 billion in
savings](https://whitehouse.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dace49741569f7585670378b3&id=4ba4ab2c73&e=40024b103d)).
These two efforts alone yield $755 billion in total savings or over
$8,800 per family of four. The combined savings from all of these
actions equal just over **$935 billion or nearly $11,000 per family of
four** over the coming years.  
  
The Trump Administration has implemented an aggressive [10-to-1
deregulatory
initiative](https://whitehouse.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dace49741569f7585670378b3&id=74ea3bc131&e=40024b103d),
which requires that whenever an agency proposes a new rule or guidance
document, it must eliminate 10 existing rules or guidance documents.
This effort builds on the successful [deregulatory initiative introduced
in President Trump’s first
term](https://whitehouse.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dace49741569f7585670378b3&id=c366c74f8f&e=40024b103d),
which required the repeal of at least two existing regulations for each
new rule, and in practice [eliminated 5.5 rules for each new significant
rule](https://whitehouse.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dace49741569f7585670378b3&id=c7f1e9a32a&e=40024b103d).

    to reduce the cost of housing, healthcare, consumer appliances,
    food, and energy.
-   The removal of barriers to American leadership in [artificial

-   The elimination of rules [thwarting innovation in digital assets and

resources.
