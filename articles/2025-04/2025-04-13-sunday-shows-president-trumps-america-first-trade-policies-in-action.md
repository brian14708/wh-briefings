title: "SUNDAY SHOWS: President Trump\u2019s America First Trade Policies in Action"
---
 
This morning, the Trump Administration’s top officials took to the
Sunday shows to discuss the state of President Donald J. Trump’s
reciprocal tariffs, how negotiations are progressing, and the results
they’ve already delivered on behalf of American workers and businesses.

**Here’s what you missed:**

#### **Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick on This Week**

-   [On tariffs for certain
    electronics](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1911414924628161023):
    “Those products are going to be part of the semiconductor sectoral
    tariffs, which are coming … We need to have these things made in
    America.”
-   [On the constitutionality of
    tariffs](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1911417298503483759):
    “Congress has passed laws that gave the president the ability to
    protect our national security … If we just run gigantic trade
    deficits and sell our soul to the rest of the world, eventually we
    are going to be the worker for the rest of the world.”
-   [On expanding market
    access](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1911416300301168651):
    “Our farmers are finally going to have access to the world’s
    markets. Our farmers have never had the opportunity to sell corn in
    India — so what’s going to happen is as they sell more and more
    products, prices will come down.”

#### **Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing Peter Navarro on Meet the Press**

-   [On tariffs
    negotiations](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1911407993310032185):
    “This is unfolding exactly like we thought it would … We have a
    strategy here where the president says we’re going to charge them
    what they charge us … knowing full well that a lot of countries
    would come right to us and want to bargain.”
-   [On semiconductor
    tariffs](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1911420597898273179):
    “The policy is no exemptions, no exclusions … What the Secretary of
    Commerce, Howard Lutnick, is going to do — and he’s doing it as we
    speak — is an investigation of the chips supply chain. The goal is
    stability and resilience.”
-   [On
    inflation](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1911409853425148225):
    “We had really good news on the inflation front — both the Producer
    Price Index, which is your wholesale prices, and Consumer Price
    Index had the lowest print since fall of 2023.”

#### **National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett on State of the Union**

-   [On
    China](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1911411658867499045):
    “In the 15 years after China entered the WTO, real wages went down —
    so wages went down by more than prices as we thought these cheap
    goods were going to revolutionize America. In fact, it was the
    opposite.”

#### **U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer on Face the Nation**

-   [On trade deal
    negotiations](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1911432130766258212):
    “My goal is to get meaningful deals before 90 days — and I think
    we’re going to be there with several countries in the next few
    weeks.”
-   [On the response to reciprocal
    tariffs](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1911432434983264487):
    “President Trump has a global program to try to reshore American
    manufacturing and address the trade deficit. It’s a global issue.
    The only reason we’re really in this position right now is because
    China chose to retaliate.”
-   [On tariffs
    exemptions](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1911430559621853669):
    “For the national security tariffs, you have to do an investigation
    in order to impose the tariffs … That’s why they don’t have a tariff
    covered right now because you have to go through the investigation …
    We expect there will have to be some kind of tariff.”

#### **Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins on Fox News Sunday**

-   [On
    trade](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1911412061973684671):
    “For decades, the way we have been treated in this country and
    especially our farmers and ranchers is absolutely stunning. We have
    been living under a tariff regime but it has been the regime of
    other countries … The president is working to fix it.”
-   [On ethanol
    production](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1911413221463933430):
    “Ethanol is a very important part of our energy independence
    strategy. President Trump has been unequivocal in his support for
    ethanol.”

#### **Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on Sunday Morning Futures**

-   [On the Panama
    Canal](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1911422449889038628):
    “What President Trump said in his State of the Union address is that
    China has too much influence over the Panama Canal and America’s
    going to take it back — and that’s exactly what I was charged to do
    … Chinese influence cannot control our own backyard.”
-   [On Iran](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1911424740796825761):
    “\[President Trump is\] dead serious that Iran cannot have a nuclear
    weapon … He’s also dead serious that if we can’t figure this out at
    the negotiating table, then there are other options.”

#### **White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller on Sunday Morning Futures**

-   [On
    tariffs](http://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1911428087989911764):
    “When the president issued his reciprocal tariffs, our government at
    the time specifically said that chips and semiconductors, which are
    critical components of our national security, were going to be dealt
    with through a separate Commerce authority known as a 232. That was
    always the plan because those components are so essential to our
    national security. We need to have a separate process for dealing
    with how to reshore those essential industries … There are no
    exemptions.”
-   [On President Trump’s historic
    actions](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1911429174968885751):
    “History will record that the actions President Trump has taken in
    recent days were the beginning of saving the West from complete
    economic domination by another power.”
