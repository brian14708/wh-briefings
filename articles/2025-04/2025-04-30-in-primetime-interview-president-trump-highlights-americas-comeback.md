In a commanding primetime
[interview](https://abcnews.go.com/US/full-transcript-trumps-exclusive-100-days-broadcast-interview/story?id=121291672)
on ABC, President Donald J. Trump delivered a powerful recap of his
first 100 days in office — showcasing his transformative achievements
and confronting the mainstream media’s distortions head-on. From
securing the border to slashing billions in waste, President Trump laid
out why the nation is rallying behind the America First agenda.

    **the single biggest accomplishment of his first 100 days:** “The
    border is the most significant because our country was really going
    bad … You had murderers coming in, you had everybody coming in …
    Now, it’s totally closed down … Nobody thought that could happen,
    and it happened quickly.”

    **the media for covering up Biden’s decline:** “We had a President
    that couldn’t walk up a flight of stairs, couldn’t walk down a
    flight of stairs, couldn’t walk across the stage without falling. We
    had a President that was grossly incompetent. You knew it, I knew
    it, and everybody knew it, but you guys didn’t want to write it
    because you’re fake news — and, by the way, ABC is one of the
    worst.”

    [**distilled**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1917385367872852387)
    **his first 100 days to a single statement:** “I’m doing one thing:
    I’m Making America Great Again … Our country suffered greatly — and
    now, our country is coming back like nobody can believe.”
-   **President Trump**

    **prices are already moderating in his first 100 days:** “Our
    country had inflation that was worse than they’ve ever had it before
    … Why don’t you mention that? … Now, grocery prices are coming down,
    the energy prices are coming down…”

    **the interviewer on deported criminal illegal immigrant Kilmar
    Abrego Garcia:** “This is an MS-13 gang member … Beat the hell out
    of his wife … This is not an ‘innocent, wonderful gentleman from
    Maryland … He came into our country ILLEGALLY!”
-   **President Trump**
    [**outlined**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1917371894224900219)
    **the stakes of his trade policy:** “This is what I campaigned on. I
    said that we’ve been abused by other countries at levels that
    nobody’s ever seen before … I could’ve left it that way — and at
    some point, there would’ve been an implosion … but I said, ‘No. We
    have to fix it.’”
-   **President Trump**
    [**discussed**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1917376053615509561)
    **his success in securing the homeland:** “We’re doing something
    that has to be done … They’ve allowed 21 million people to pour into
    our country. Many of these people are criminals … We’re getting them
    out, and I was elected to get them out.”
-   **President Trump**
    [**described**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1917378646219554972)
    **meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy at the Vatican:** “The
    moment was a moment of solace in a sense because tremendous numbers
    of people are dying … and I feel very badly about it. That’s a war
    that would’ve never happened if I were president.”
-   **President Trump**
    [**praised**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1917381806048903615)
    **DOGE:** “We saved $150 billion — BILLION. That’s a lot of money …
    There are things that I’m considering right now putting back, but
    overall, we saved hundreds of billions of dollars … We also found
    tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse.”
-   **President Trump**
    [**addressed**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1917381864806875145)
    **the measles vaccine:** “I recommend it. Do I mandate it? No.”
