title: New Data Reveals Strong Economic Momentum
---
 
“*It’s no surprise the leftovers of Biden’s economic disaster have been
a drag on economic growth, but the underlying numbers tell the real
story of the strong momentum President Trump is delivering. Robust core
GDP, the highest gross domestic investment in four years, job growth,
and trillions of dollars in new investments secured by President Trump
are fueling an economic boom and setting the stage for unprecedented
growth as President Trump ushers in the new Golden Age.”* — Press
Secretary Karoline Leavitt

**Here are the facts:**

-   **GDP is a backward-looking indicator.** Today’s *headline* figure
    reflects the end of the Biden economic disaster, not the beginning
    of the economic boom that President Trump is delivering.
    -   January growth, especially in consumer spending — which has an
        outsized weight on the Q1 figure — was hampered by
        colder-than-usual weather and California wildfires, and mostly
        occurred before President Trump took office.
-   **Core GDP grew at a robust 3.0%.** This signals strong underlying
    economic momentum that occurred after President Trump’s
    inauguration.
-   **Gross domestic investment soared by 22%.** This is the highest in
    four years and comes as businesses and consumers — bolstered by
    rising take-home pay — fuel an economic boom.
-   **Monthly indicators, which capture growth trends at a much higher
    frequency, all point to accelerating growth AFTER President Trump
    took office.** Private employment gains, consumer spending, capital
    investment, and aggregate hours worked have all accelerated since
    January, while inflation has decelerated.
-   **An unprecedented surge in imports due to tariff frontrunning
    contributed to most of the decline.**
-   **The forward-looking indicators highlight the momentum that has
    occurred in anticipation of President Trump’s economic agenda.**
    Exports still rose at a healthy 1.8% rate, implying no major
    disruption to flow of U.S. goods and services to our trading
    partners abroad.
