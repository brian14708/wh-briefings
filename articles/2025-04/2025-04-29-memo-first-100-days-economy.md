title: 'MEMO: First 100 Days Economy'
---
 
**TO:** White House Communications Staff  
**FROM:** Council of Economic Advisers Staff  
**SUBJECT:** First 100 Days Economy Memo

### **Jobs Statistics:**

-   President Trump has created 345,000 jobs since taking office in
    January.
    -   188,000 (54%) of these were in non-government and
        government-adjacent sectors. This is a dramatic improvement from
        the last two years of the Biden Administration, when
        three-fourths of all new jobs were in government or
        government-adjacent sectors.
        -   2,000 of which were mining and logging jobs.
        -   27,000 of which were construction jobs.
        -   9,000 manufacturing jobs were created (compared to the 6,000
            manufacturing jobs lost per month from Jan 2023 to Dec
            2024).
    -   At the same time that there were large private sector job gains,
        15,000 federal government jobs were cut.
-   The labor force participation rate for those without a high school
    diploma is up by 0.7% since President Trump took office.
-   The veteran unemployment rate is down from 4.2% in January to 3.8%
    in March.
-   228,000 jobs were created in March alone, well above expectations.
    -   This was the fourth best month in the last two years for private
        payroll growth.
-   Remote work among federal employees has fallen over 16 percentage
    points from March last year to March this year, showcasing the
    success of President Trump’s initiative to bring federal workers
    back to the office.
    -   Federal telework numbers are now in-line with the private
        sector.

### **Inflation Statistics:**

-   Prescription drug prices are down over 2% since President Trump took
    office. 
-   Last month’s drop in the price of prescription drugs was the largest
    ever recorded.
-   Gasoline prices, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), are
    down 7% since President Trump took office.
-   Energy prices are down 2% since President Trump took office.
-   Wholesale egg prices down are about 50% since President Trump took
    office. Most consumers have seen relief in prices on the shelf, but
    all consumers should see it within the next month or two.
-   February inflation (the month prior to the most recent data) showed
    the smallest annual increase in core inflation in over four years
    (since March 2021).
-   Both of the last two CPI inflation prints came in below
    expectations.
-   Last month’s (March) decline was only the second monthly decline in
    inflation (CPI) in the last two-and-a-half years.
-   These price declines are in contrast to the persistently high
    inflation under President Biden, which reached the highest annual
    rate in the past 40 years. After suffering for years under Biden
    Administration inflation, consumers are now getting welcome relief.
    On Biden’s watch, grocery prices rose 23%, and energy prices rose
    34%.
-   As a result of biting inflation, real wages in President Biden’s
    term were down about 2.4%.
-   Moreover, in the most recent inflation print from March, airfare,
    used motor vehicles, and motor insurance all saw price decreases.
-   Prices for wholesale goods fell nearly 1% last month and prices for
    wholesale services fell 0.2% last month, which will eventually lead
    to lower consumer prices.
-   Last month, retail egg price inflation continued to slow.

### **Misc. Economic Statistics:**

-   Real average hourly earnings for middle- and low-income workers are
    up 0.4% and up 1% for workers in the manufacturing sector since
    President Trump took office.
-   The automotive sector is growing: under President Trump, we already
    had the biggest one-month increase in auto sales in March in more
    than a year.
-   Mortgage rates have declined roughly four-tenths of a percentage
    point since President Trump took office.
    -   Assuming the most recent median home price in the U.S., a new
        homebuyer making a 20% down payment on a 30-year mortgage would
        save roughly $32,400 over the course of the loan, or about
        $1,080 per year.
-   Industrial production was at the seventh-highest monthly level ever
    recorded in March. The only higher monthly levels occurred during
    the first Trump Administration in 2018 and in February of this year.
-   Since the beginning of the Trump Administration, at least $5
    trillion in new investment in the U.S. has been pledged from both
    foreign governments and private companies.

### **Economic Policy Wins:**

-   Upon taking office, President Trump immediately blocked all
    unfinalized Biden-era rules, saving Americans over $180 billion —
    $2,100 per family of four over the next decade — and launched a
    bold, multi-agency effort to roll back existing federal regulations
    that drive up the cost of living. This effort is projected to yield
    significant cost savings in the coming months, including the EPA’s
    rollback of tailpipe emission rules for light-duty and medium-duty
    vehicles ($667 billion in total savings) and the Department of
    Transportation’s latest Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)
    standards ($88 billion in savings). These two efforts alone yield
    $755 billion in total savings or over $8,800 per family of four over
    the next decade. The combined savings from all of these actions
    equal just over **$935 billion or nearly $11,000 per family of
    four** over the coming decade.
-   The Trump Administration has implemented an aggressive 10-to-1
    deregulatory initiative, which requires that whenever an agency
    proposes a new rule or guidance document, it must eliminate 10
    existing rules or guidance documents. This effort builds on the
    successful deregulatory initiative introduced in President Trump’s
    first term, which required the repeal of at least two existing
    regulations for each new rule, and in practice eliminated 5.5 rules
    for each new significant rule.
-   To date, President Trump has issued over 20 significant deregulatory
    presidential actions (i.e., executive orders, presidential
    memoranda, and presidential proclamations).
