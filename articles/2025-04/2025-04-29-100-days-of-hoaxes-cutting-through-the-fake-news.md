title: '100 DAYS OF HOAXES: Cutting Through the Fake News'
---
 
Since President Donald J. Trump took office 100 days ago, it has been a
nonstop deluge of hoaxes and lies from Democrats and their allies in the
Fake News suffering from terminal cases of Trump Derangement Syndrome.

**In no particular order, here are some of the most egregious hoaxes
peddled by the usual suspects so far in President Trump’s second term:**

-   **HOAX:** Fake News CNN
    [attempted](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/04/politics/fact-check-trump-address-congress/index.html#:~:text=DOGE%20and%20transgender,among%20transgender%20women.)
    to “fact check” President Trump’s claim that the Biden
    Administration spent millions on “making mice transgender.”
-   **FACT:** After their so-called “fact check” was [thoroughly
    debunked](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/yes-biden-spent-millions-on-transgender-animal-experiments/),
    they were [forced to update
    it](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1897443256679428309) in
    disgrace and admit the claim was, in fact, true.  
      
-   **HOAX:** The Fake News
    [claimed](https://x.com/JohnJHarwood/status/1902801023036543001) the
    Department of Defense removed Gen. Colin Powell’s name from a list
    of notable Americans buried at Arlington Cemetery.
-   **FACT:** No service members’ names were
    [removed](https://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/Media/News/Post/14651/Website-Content-Update)
    from that section — and Gen. Powell’s name remains among those
    listed.  
      
-   **HOAX:** Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA)
    [claimed](https://x.com/RepSwalwell/status/1891446500435075093) “no
    president” presided over more plane crashes during their first month
    in office as President Trump.
-   **FACT:** “There were 55 aviation accidents in the U.S. between
    Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 21, 2021, and Feb. 17, 2021, compared
    to 35 during the same period for Trump,” [Fox News
    reported](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/government-data-torpedoes-swalwells-viral-claim-plane-crashes-trumps-watch-habitual-liar).  
      
-   **HOAX:** [Gov. JB Pritzker
    (D-IL)](https://x.com/GovPritzker/status/1882900706132402318) and
    [Chicago Public Schools
    officials](https://www.dailywire.com/news/latest-anti-trump-hoax-chicago-school-district-falsely-claims-ice-came-to-elementary-campus)
    [claimed](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1884606006002368657),
    without bothering to
    [verify](https://x.com/BillMelugin_/status/1882913021435269289),
    that ICE agents had conducted a “raid” at an elementary school — a
    false claim echoed by media outlets, including the [*Chicago
    Tribune*](https://x.com/nellbsalzman/status/1882892888914468924).
-   **FACT:** It was
    [actually](https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/secret-service-sheds-light-on-what-happened-at-chicago-school/3656417/)
    the U.S. Secret Service investigating a threat unrelated to
    immigration.  
      
-   **HOAX:** Far-left influencers and other leftist hacks falsely
    [claimed](https://x.com/NoLieWithBTC/status/1901783769628962982) the
    Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and Elon Musk were out to
    “cut Social Security.”
-   **FACT:** They were referencing an interview in which Musk was
    [clearly
    referring](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1899518379263770746)
    to the [tremendous
    amount](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1899433971890470916) of
    waste, fraud, and abuse within entitlement programs.  
      
-   **HOAX:** The media
    [smeared](https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-young-engineers/)
    DOGE as “young, inexperienced engineers” engineering a “government
    takeover.”
-   **FACT:** In reality, DOGE is led by [seasoned industry
    professionals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7kQNwJ4H_w),
    including successful CEOs who paused their lives to aid in the
    effort of streamlining government and holding the bureaucracy
    accountable.  
      
-   **HOAX:** NBC’s Peter Alexander
    [peddled](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1892960080028450933)
    the lie that “constituents in some traditionally red districts” were
    unhappy with President Trump’s effort to cut waste, fraud, and abuse
    in government.
-   **FACT:** The same “protests” cited by the Fake News were [funded
    and
    organized](https://freebeacon.com/media/mainstream-media-outlets-cited-red-district-doge-protests-as-proof-of-broad-musk-backlash-soros-funded-liberal-groups-organized-them/)
    by far-left special interest groups.  
      
-   **HOAX:** NPR
    [claimed](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/28/nx-s1-5278636/iss-astronaut-rescue-spacex-trump)
    NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore — who were
    [stuck](https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/crew9-astronauts-williams-wilmore-1.7497999)
    on the International Space Station for more than nine months
    following problems with their spacecraft — were “not stranded.”
-   **FACT:** NPR itself had
    [described](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/24/nx-s1-5087892/nasa-starliner-astronaut-return-iss-spacex)
    the astronauts as stranded in prior reporting, and only seemed to
    take issue with the description once President Trump and Elon Musk
    [made](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/global-trends/us-news-sunita-williams-butch-wilmore-given-me-no-reason-nasa-astronauts-thank-trump-elon-musk-after-286-day-space-ordeal/articleshow/119864766.cms?from=mdr)
    it a priority to bring them home.  
      
-   **HOAX:** A foreign Fake News outlet
    [reported](https://x.com/CTVNews/status/1895221192614912407) that
    President Trump “shut down” the British prime minister during a news
    conference.
-   **FACT:** In reality, President Trump was simply [moving
    on](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1895222543776379051) from a
    reporter who was trying to goad the two leaders into division.  
      
-   **HOAX:** NPR falsely
    [claimed](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/21/nx-s1-5371312/trump-white-house-pete-hegseth-defense-department)
    the White House was actively searching for a new secretary of
    defense.
-   **FACT:** This lie was immediately [shut
    down](https://x.com/PressSec/status/1914371752685076757) by multiple
    Trump Administration officials, including [President Trump
    himself](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1914343481218039866).  
      
-   **HOAX:** The Fake News
    [attempted](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/an-administrative-error-sends-a-man-to-a-salvadoran-prison/682254/)
    to paint illegal immigrant gang member Kilmar Abrego Garcia as an
    innocent “Maryland father” who was unjustly deported by the Trump
    Administration — and [actively
    censored](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1913279325358411781)
    the truth about him.
-   **FACT:** Abrego Garcia is a citizen of El Salvador and was deported
    to his home country amid [overwhelming
    evidence](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/04/16/kilmar-abrego-garcia-ms-13-gang-member-history-violence)
    of his gang affiliation.  
      
-   **HOAX:** Deranged “filmmaker” Michael Moore
    [questioned](https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/media/michael-moore-says-deported-migrants-could-have-cured-cancer/)
    whether deported illegal immigrants would go on to cure cancer or
    stop “that asteroid (sic) that’s gonna hit us.”
-   **FACT:** Moore’s statement was a [strong early
    contender](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-fires-back-progressive-filmmaker-dumbest-statement-year)
    for the dumbest, most ridiculous statement of the year considering
    those deported illegal immigrants were [violent
    criminals](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/02/illegal-immigrant-killers-rapists-arent-scholars-theyre-criminals/).  
      
-   **HOAX:** The Fake News
    [portrayed](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/politics/mahmoud-khalil-legal-resident-deportation.html)
    Mahmoud Khalil, a pro-Hamas radical who led violent protests at
    Columbia, as an innocent graduate student with an absolute right to
    remain in the U.S.
-   **FACT:** An immigration judge
    [ruled](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/13/us/mahmoud-khalil-deportation-ruling-appeals/index.html)
    Khalil — who is not a U.S. citizen — can be deported.  
      
-   **HOAX:** The *Financial Times*
    [reported](https://financialpost.com/financial-times/u-s-official-pushes-cut-canada-five-eyes-intelligence-group)
    that Senior White House Counselor Peter Navarro wanted to remove
    Canada from the “Five Eyes” intelligence sharing network.
-   **FACT:** Mr. Navarro immediately [shut
    down](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1894434053392146762) this
    fake story.  
      
-   **HOAX:** A foreign Fake News reporter
    [claimed](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1912932657052422644)
    President Trump referred to European nations as “parasites.”
-   **FACT:** President Trump immediately [pushed
    back](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1912932657052422644) on
    this ridiculous claim — as did the Italian prime minister.  
      
-   **HOAX:** Fake News CNN’s Brianna Keilar
    [implied](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1891944423853867267)
    the Trump Administration was somehow wrong for stopping illegal
    immigrants from stealing taxpayer dollars in the form of welfare
    benefits.
-   **FACT:** Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller summarily
    [embarrassed](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1891944423853867267)
    her with the facts: “The federal government will find EVERY illegal
    alien who is stealing American taxpayer dollars — and that’s what
    Americans expect to happen. I don’t even fathom the premise of your
    question.”  
      
-   **HOAX:** A [favorite
    refrain](https://www.npr.org/2024/12/03/nx-s1-5198506/rfk-jr-anti-vaccine-chd-lawsuits)
    of the Fake News is that Secretary of Health and Human Services
    Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., is
    “[anti-vaccine.](https://x.com/calleymeans/status/1884610468565631299)”
-   **FACT:** Kennedy
    [debunked](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1884630138995802623)
    the lie in his confirmation hearings: “This has been repeatedly
    debunked … Bringing this up right now is dishonest.”  
      
-   **HOAX:** WIRED falsely
    [claimed](https://x.com/WIRED/status/1910749751819010172) the Social
    Security Administration is “shifting its public communication
    exclusively to X” under President Trump.
-   **FACT:** [Not
    happening.](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1910807705956077884)  
      
-   **HOAX:** Reuters falsely
    [reported](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1894074813901164881) that
    the Trump Administration “stalled a United Nations program in Mexico
    aimed at stopping imported fentanyl chemicals from reaching the
    country’s drug cartels.”
-   **FACT:** The Department of State is actually
    [trying](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1894215678174912744)
    to expand the initiative.  
      
-   **FACT:** The Fake News frequently
    [pushed](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1884739769738874949)
    the lie that as part of the Trump administration, Secretary Kennedy
    would implement a national abortion ban and “restrict or even ban
    medication abortion without a single act of Congress.”
-   **FACT:** Secretary Kennedy consistently
    [pledged](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1884739772196835593)
    to implement President Trump’s policies — which include leaving
    abortion to the states, ending barbaric late-term abortions,
    protecting conscientious objections, and ending federal funding for
    abortions.  
      
-   **HOAX:** Fake News savant Tara Palmeri falsely
    [reported](https://x.com/tarapalmeri/status/1886971675410907541)
    that President Trump’s proposal for Gaza was conceived by Jared
    Kushner.
-   **FACT:** This lie was immediately and summarily
    [debunked](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1886982566055432465)
    by the Trump Administration: “The worst reporter in America makes up
    fake news for clout because she has no real sources. Sit down,
    dummy.”  
      
-   **HOAX:** Sen. Chris Murphy, Rep. Jasmine Crockett, and media
    outlets
    [claimed](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1884605914897940489)
    President Trump’s directive to pause radical, wasteful government
    spending meant an end to Medicaid, food assistance, and other
    individual assistance programs.
-   **FACT:** Individual assistance programs — Social Security,
    Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, etc. — were explicitly excluded, as was
    [made
    clear](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1884605983915123131) by
    Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt and the Office of Management and
    Budget. Only unnecessary spending — DEI, Green New Scam, NGOs that
    undermine the national interest — were included in the directive.  
      
-   **HOAX:** A “physicians advocacy group” was [widely
    cited](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/rfk-jr-health-secretary-doctors-urge-senate-block-trump-administration-rcna186807)
    as opposing President Trump’s nomination of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.,
    to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.
-   **FACT:** The “advocacy group” was really an astroturfed partisan
    organization funded by prominent left-wing donors — and [accepted
    fake
    signatures](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/27/doctors-committee-opposing-rfk-is-bill-gates-backed-astroturf-with-fake-names/).  
      
-   **HOAX:** Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) and other Democrats
    [pushed](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1891156990568640556)
    the lie that DOGE posted “classified information” on their website.
-   **FACT:** That alleged “classified information” was really just an
    employment headcount — which has been publicly available for
    years.  
      
-   **HOAX:** Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL)
    [claimed](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1887193851804156224)
    Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem called all Venezuelan
    immigrants “dirtbags.”
-   **FACT:** Secretary Noem [actually
    called](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/29/kristi-noem-tps-venezuela-00201390)
    illegal immigrant members of the vicious Tren de Aragua gang
    “dirtbags,” which is true.  
      
-   **HOAX:** *The New York Times*
    [wrote](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/health/rfk-jr-maha-tour.html#:~:text=Health%20Secretary%20Robert%20F.%20Kennedy%20Jr.%20kicked%20off%20a%20tour%20through%20southwestern%20states%20on%20Monday%20by%20calling%20on%20states%20to%20ban%20fluoride%20in%20drinking%20water%20supplies%2C%20a%20move%20that%20would%20reverse%20what%20some%20medical%20experts%20consider%20one%20of%20the%20most%20important%20public%20health%20practices%20in%20the%20country%E2%80%99s%20history.)
    that Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., wanted to “ban fluoride in
    drinking water” and “reverse … one of the most important public
    health practices in the country’s history.”
-   **FACT:** New York Times made no mention of their [own
    reporting](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/08/health/fluoride-children-iq.html)
    that fluoride may be “linked to lower IQ scores in children.”  
      
-   **HOAX:** Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) repeatedly
    [lied](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1910670680913277034)
    about President Trump “going after” Social Security.
-   **FACT:** President Trump has repeatedly
    [pledged](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1910670685304729882)
    to protect Social Security and make it more robust for American
    citizens.  
      
-   **HOAX:** Sen. Mark Kelley (D-AZ) attempted to scare veterans by
    shamelessly
    [claiming](https://x.com/SenMarkKelly/status/1914809739633971342)
    their care was in jeopardy due to “layoffs” at VA hospitals.
-   **FACT:** The lie was debunked by Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug
    Collins: “What changes are you talking about? We’ve not had those
    layoffs… I put $360 million back into community care… It’s
    concerning to me that a veteran would actually tell stories to
    veterans that are not true.”  
      
-   **HOAX:** Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) exploited the Ronald Reagan
    Washington National Airport plane crash tragedy by
    [claiming](https://x.com/RepJasmine/status/1885064458650726612)
    President Trump “froze the hiring” of air traffic controllers.
-   **FACT:** Air traffic controllers were
    [exempt](https://chcoc.gov/sites/default/files/OMB-OPM%20Federal%20Civilian%20Hiring%20Freeze%20Guidance%201-20-2025%20FINAL.pdf)
    from the federal hiring freeze.  
      
-   **HOAX:** Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX)
    [implied](https://x.com/RepJasmine/status/1885064461716725931) that
    “cutting” members of an aviation advisory committee was somehow a
    cause of the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport plane crash
    tragedy.
-   **FACT:** The advisory group [hadn’t
    met](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1885337680856117739) since
    2023 and was comprised of business and union leaders who gave
    “advice” to the TSA and had nothing to do with actual air travel.  
      
-   **HOAX:** A far-left writer
    [claimed](https://x.com/calebhecarma/status/1886427604984516806)
    Elon Musk and DOGE staffers “illegally installed a commercial server
    to control federal HR databases that contain sensitive personal
    information, including SSNs, home addresses, and medical histories.”
-   **FACT:** A top official
    [confirmed](https://x.com/katierosemiller/status/1886509859778286055)
    “there’s nothing illegal and no server, just more made up tall tales
    from uninformed career bureaucrats.”  
      
-   **HOAX:** *The Washington Post*
    [alleged](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/01/26/ice-arrests-raids-trump-quota/)
    the Trump Administration was setting “quotas” for immigration
    authorities — and
    [gave](https://x.com/StevenCheung47/status/1883603447590850945) the
    administration just four minutes to comment before publishing.
-   **FACT:** As usual, this was a [fake
    story](https://x.com/StevenCheung47/status/1883603447590850945).  
      
-   **HOAX:** Online liberal activists
    [claimed](https://x.com/ChrisDJackson/status/1910770146634850396)
    President Trump “took down” President Obama’s portrait in the White
    House.
-   **FACT:** Obama’s portrait was not taken down — it was simply
    [moved](https://x.com/StevenCheung47/status/1910781811208118650)
    only feet away from its previous location.  
      
-   **HOAX:** Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI)
    [claimed](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1887539854235283949)
    Attorney General Pam Bondi created a “weaponizing task force.”
-   **FACT:** It was a task force to
    [END](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/bondi-to-probe-doj-weaponization-target-sanctuary-cities)
    weaponization at the Department of Justice.

    [reported](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hegseth-orders-makeup-studio-installed-pentagon/?ftag=CNM-00-10aab8d&linkId=804289612)
    that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth ordered a “makeup studio” be
    installed inside the Pentagon.
-   **FACT:** It was a “[totally fake
    story,](https://x.com/PeteHegseth/status/1915180944157196773)” and
    the alleged studio [was
    really](https://x.com/DODResponse/status/1915123461631918529) an
    existing green room with no frills.  
      
-   **HOAX:** Politico
    [reported](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/23/white-house-debating-lifting-sanctions-on-russian-energy-assets-00306486)
    the Trump Administration was debating lifting sanctions on Russian
    energy assets, including the Nord Stream pipeline.
-   **FACT:** This was debunked by both [Secretary of State Marco
    Rubio](https://x.com/SecRubio/status/1915237747809206618) and
    [Special Envoy Steve
    Witkoff](https://x.com/SE_MiddleEast/status/1915252635801682035).  
      
-   **HOAX:** An illegal immigrant in U.S. custody “simply disappeared,”
    [*The New York Times*
    reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/venezuela-immigrant-disappear-deport-ice.html).
-   **FACT:** The illegal immigrant was a [confirmed
    member](https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1914776912150380560) of the
    vicious Tren de Aragua gang. An immigration judge
    [ordered](https://x.com/TriciaOhio/status/1914769029878644935) his
    removal, and he was deported along with other threats to national
    security.  
      
-   **HOAX:** *The Wall Street Journal*
    [alleged](https://x.com/PressSec/status/1904872597197578617) that
    Special Envoy Steve Witkoff was receiving sensitive information on a
    personal phone while in Moscow and that Russian Intelligence must’ve
    had access to the information.
-   **FACT:** This was a total fabrication. Special Envoy Witkoff [did
    not even
    have](https://x.com/SteveWitkoff/status/1904886084879720683) a
    personal phone with him in Russia. He had only a government phone; a
    secure line of communication.  
      
-   **HOAX:** *The Wall Street Journal*
    [claimed](https://x.com/WSJ/status/1912956997701427370) the Trump
    Administration “sought to portray” deported criminal illegal
    immigrant gang member Kilmar Abrego Garcia as “violent.”
-   **FACT:** Abrego Garcia’s own wife
    [filed](https://x.com/BillMelugin_/status/1912654921196843357) an
    order of protection against him and testified that he brutally beat
    her.  
      
-   **HOAX:** An AP reporter
    [claimed](https://x.com/TaraCopp/status/1891489757886030136) that
    FAA staff who worked on “radar, landing and navigational aid
    maintenance, among others” were “harassed on Facebook” by DOGE.
-   **FACT:** That was a [total
    lie](https://x.com/PressSec/status/1891613906621100044). DOGE
    doesn’t have a Facebook page and no professionals who perform
    critical safety functions were fired.

    [claimed](https://x.com/thedailybeast/status/1914786456075223536)
    Vice President JD Vance “broke one of the most notorious Vatican
    rules during his Easter weekend visit” by being photographed in the
    Sistine Chapel.
-   **FACT:** Buried all the way down in the 14th paragraph, The Daily
    Beast
    [admitted](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1915454895320387611)
    the vice president was given special permission by the Vatican to

    fake, AI-generated audio of Vice President Vance “disparaging Elon
    Musk in private.”
-   **FACT:** The audio was

    fake.  
      
-   **HOAX:** *The New York Times*
    [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/health/womens-health-initiative-cuts.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare)
    that funding for the Women’s Health Initiative was being slashed by
    the Department of Health and Human Services.
-   **FACT:** Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., himself
    [declared](https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1915528409800655151) this
    Fake News and recognized the project is “mission critical.”  
      
-   **HOAX:** Fox News’s Jennifer Griffin [gave
    legitimacy](https://x.com/JenGriffinFNC/status/1887989765754044484)
    to a hoax from delusional Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) and
    Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth requested
    nearly $140,000 in “upgrades” to his government residence.
-   **FACT:** This lie was
    [debunked](https://x.com/PeteHegseth/status/1888034973325869486) by
    Secretary Hegseth — and it was so outrageous, even the AP was
    [forced to

    it was completely fake.  
      
-   **HOAX:** Rep. Don Beyer (D-VA) and many others
    [claimed](https://x.com/RepDonBeyer/status/1911818221885280330) the
    Supreme Court ordered the return of illegal immigrant gang member
    Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States.
-   **FACT:** Even CNN
    [admitted](https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/1912188308765229556)
    that’s not what happened: “They did not order the administration to
    return him to the United States … they could’ve said ‘we order him
    returned,’ but they didn’t do that.”  
      
-   **HOAX:** Joe Biden
    [accused](https://x.com/MSNBC/status/1912282138520469908) the Trump
    Administration of “taking aim at Social Security.”
-   **FACT:** As usual, he was
    [lying](https://x.com/SocialSecurity/status/1912275243927789976) —
    President Trump has repeatedly pledged to protect Social Security.  
      
-   **HOAX:** Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA)
    [claimed](https://x.com/RepRoKhanna/status/1915828834022068447) the
    arrest of a Milwaukee judge who helped an illegal immigrant evade
    arrest was “unprecedented.”
-   **FACT:** It wasn’t; it has [happened
    before](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1915854663800311957).

    [called](https://x.com/MollyBeck/status/1915806949439897673) the
    arrest of a Milwaukee judge who helped an illegal immigrant evade
    arrest a “gravely serious and drastic move.”
-   **FACT:** The judge [violated the
    law](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1915816561144721667) by
    obstructing an ICE arrest of an illegal immigrant.  
      
-   **HOAX:** Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN)
    [claimed](https://x.com/amyklobuchar/status/1915823476826362143) the
    arrest of the Milwaukee judge who obstructed an apprehension of a
    criminal illegal immigrant “threatens the rule of law.”
-   **FACT:** It literally does the opposite because no one is above the
    law.  
      
-   **HOAX:** Politico
    [claimed](https://x.com/politico/status/1915724352093384750) the
    Trump Administration “wipe\[d\] out firefighter health and safety
    programs.”

-   **HOAX:** Sen. Elizabeth Warren
    [claimed](https://x.com/MediasLies/status/1909986087088382348) that
    President Trump’s policies make it so “no one wants to make
    investments in the United States.”
-   **FACT:** President Trump has
    [secured](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/foreign-domestic-investments-totaling-over-5t-under-trump-adds-451k-jobs-americans)
    more than $5 trillion in

    [peddled](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/two-children-us-citizens-4-and-7-year-old-deported-honduras-rcna203208)
    a Fake News hoax that the Trump Administration was deporting

    attempt at a hoax by
    [highlighting](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1916486345360343395)

    [accused](https://x.com/MediasLies/status/1886820298734842348)
    President Trump of taking teachers’ salaries and giving them to
    “billionaires” by cutting the Department of Education.
-   **FACT:** President Trump has repeatedly
    [called](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1902822619134488730)
    teachers “the most important people in this country” who should be
    paid more, not less. The federal government does not pay the
    salaries of teachers; state and local governments do.  
      
-   **HOAX:** The Fake News and their predictable
    [allies](https://x.com/FrankLuntz/status/1913968958929338775) ran
    with a
    [story](https://www.azpm.org/p/headlines/2025/4/18/224512-us-citizen-in-arizona-detained-by-immigration-officials-for-10-days/)
    that claimed an American citizen was detained by authorities after
    he informed them he was, in fact, a citizen.
-   **FACT:** That’s not [what
    happened](https://x.com/TriciaOhio/status/1914302528780435882). The
    individual “approached Border Patrol in Tucson and stated he had
    entered the U.S. illegally through Nogales. He said he wanted to
    turn himself in and completed a sworn statement identifying as a
    Mexican citizen who had entered unlawfully … A few days later, his
    family presented documents showing U.S. citizenship. The charges
    were dismissed, and he was released to his family.”  
      
-   **HOAX:** PBS News claimed “DOGE operatives attempted to gain access
    to secure spaces,” implying they attempted to access classified
    information without approval.

    true](https://x.com/StevenCheung47/status/1886169925774901559).

    Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said President Trump
    is “very good friends” with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
-   **FACT:** The AP was humiliatingly
    [forced](https://www.foxnews.com/media/associated-press-removes-story-wrongly-claiming-tulsi-gabbard-said-trump-putin-very-good-friends)
    to retract its story, admitting they were wrong. Stephanie Ruhle

    had](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/media/article-14516393/msnbc-host-apologize-tulsi-gabbard-stephanie-ruhle.html)

    relationship with Indian PM Narendra Modi.

    [unfettered
    access](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/07/trump-student-visas-deportation)
    to do whatever they want in the United States.
-   **FACT:** Wrong. As Secretary of State Marco Rubio
    [said](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1901290182672007192),
    “When you apply to enter the United States and you get a visa, you
    are a guest… If you tell us when you apply for a visa ‘I’m coming to
    the U.S. to participate in pro-Hamas events,’ that runs counter to
    the foreign policy interest of the United States… If you had told us
    you were going to do that, we never would have given you the visa.”
