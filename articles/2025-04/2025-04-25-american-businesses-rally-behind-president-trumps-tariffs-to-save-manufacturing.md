title: "American Businesses Rally Behind President Trump\u2019s Tariffs to Save Manufacturing"
---
 
President Donald J. Trump’s decisive trade policies are igniting a
resurgence in American manufacturing — earning fervent support from
family-owned businesses and others nationwide who have suffered from
decades of unfair trade practices. From steel forges to moldmakers,
their voices echo a powerful truth: these policies aren’t just
protecting jobs — they’re reviving the heart of American industry.

**Here’s what they’re saying:**

***Walker Forge, a third-generation family-owned business in
Clintonville, Wisconsin, manufactures forgings out of steel for a
variety of industries, including the defense industry.***

-   **Will Walker (President):** “This is the first time in generations
    that we have a President who puts American manufacturing first.
    That’s what these tariffs do — put America first. The tariffs send a
    clear message that companies cannot undercut our U.S. industrial
    base anymore.”

***Franchino Mold & Engineering, based in Lansing, Michigan, designs,
engineers, builds, maintains, and repairs plastic injection molds.***

-   **Mike Hetherington (President):** “I represent Franchino Mold &
    Engineering, and we are proud to be celebrating 70 years as a U.S.
    moldmaker this year. I find it extremely unfair that I can buy a
    complete injection mold from China for less than it costs me to
    purchase the raw materials to build it here in the United States. We
    are held to a high standard for labor, safety, quality, and
    environmental standards, which we proudly meet while competing
    against companies in China that don’t play by the same rules. They
    benefit from heavy government subsidies, lax labor standards, and
    artificially low prices that make it impossible for U.S. moldmakers
    to compete with China on price. Tariffs help level the playing field
    for U.S. moldmakers and force companies to look to U.S. moldmakers
    to supply them with products that meet their cost, quality and
    delivery needs. We are not asking for protection — we are asking for
    fairness!”

***ELLWOOD, a 115-year-old family-owned business in Ellwood City,
Pennsylvania, manufactures quality metals and custom engineered
components for the world’s most demanding applications ranging from our
nation’s defense to aerospace.***

-   **Ben Huffman (President and CEO):** “ELLWOOD supports President
    Trump’s efforts to reshape the global trading system to a fair
    system. The current unbalanced system puts U.S. manufacturing at a
    significant disadvantage. Unfair, country-subsidized trading
    practices that are occurring all over the globe continue to do
    significant harm to ELLWOOD and the historically damaging trade
    practices must be reversed.”

***Dyersville Die Cast, based in Dyersville, Iowa, specializes in custom
aluminum and zinc die cast manufacturing and secondary services, such as
CNC machining and powder coat paint.***

-   **Robert Willits (President):** “I have been in my role for over 24
    years — and during that time, I have witnessed many events that have
    convinced me that President Trump is 100% correct on tariffs. I
    fully support his fight to protect American manufacturers. God bless
    President Trump for keeping his promises.”

***TK Mold & Engineering, Inc., based in Romeo, Michigan, builds
prototype and production molds for the consumer goods and automotive
industries.***

-   **Tom Barr (President):** “TK Mold & Engineering, Inc., is proud to
    be situated in the heart of America’s automotive sector. Thanks to
    recent tariff policies, we’re seeing a renewed interest in
    U.S.-based manufacturing. In just the past three days, we’ve
    received three requests for quotes specifically aimed at reshoring
    mold and molding production back to the United States. These tariffs
    are creating real opportunities for American businesses like ours by
    encouraging companies to bring work back home. We’re grateful for
    policies that support Main Street and help revitalize essential
    trades like moldmaking.”

***Industrial Molds, Inc., a family-owned business in Rockford,
Illinois, is a tool and die shop with 52 employees.***

-   **Andy Peterson (CEO):** “The implementation of tariffs has caused
    our customers to completely rethink their supply chains and source
    more work domestically. This has completely changed our forecast for
    the year to the better and we are looking to add more employees
    quickly.”

***Legacy Precision Molds, Inc., based in Grandville, Michigan,
specializes in the design and manufacturing of tight-tolerance plastic
injection molds.  ***

-   **Tyler VanRee (Vice President):** “The recent tariffs have had a
    noticeable and positive impact on our business. We’ve seen a
    significant increase in quote activity, have been awarded new work,
    and are seeing growing interest from companies exploring reshoring
    opportunities. At their current levels, the tariffs are driving real
    momentum toward U.S.-based manufacturing. We appreciate the
    administration’s commitment to strengthening American industry and
    we encourage them to continue to explore long-term solutions to help
    strengthen and rebuild American manufacturing again.”

***Campbell Press Repair, based in Lansing, Michigan, is a
second-generation family business servicing the metal forging and
stamping industries with repair, rebuilding work on heavy machinery,
modernization, automation, and new equipment, with 28 highly-talented
employees.***

-   **Pete Campbell (President):** “Who knew about the tariff imbalances
    before President Trump brought them to light? As a small businessman
    competing in a world market, these things matter.”

***Westminster Tool, Inc., based in Plainfield, Connecticut, is a
plastic injection mold manufacturer that specializes in complex medical
and surgical devices.***

-   **Hillary Thomas (Vice President):** “The manufacturing tariffs
    imposed by President Trump and his administration have benefited our
    business, similar to the wide-scale tariff effort in 2018. Following
    the recent announcement, our quote requests rose 25% in one month.
    These tariffs, particularly against China and other international
    competitors, help level the global manufacturing playing field for
    the moldmaking industry. We strongly support and encourage
    maintaining international tariffs that promote manufacturing here in
    the country.”

***Metallus, Inc., based in Canton, Ohio, is a leading U.S. manufacturer
of high-performance specialty metals made from recycled scrap metal for
the industrial, automotive, aerospace, and defense and energy
markets.***

-   **Michael S. Williams (President and CEO):** “We support the
    enforcement and expansion of 232 tariffs on steel products, as they
    align with our long-standing commitment to fair trade and addressing
    market imbalances. As a domestic steel producer, we view tariffs as
    a victory for both Metallus and the broader American steel
    industry.”

***Twin Cities Die Casting, based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, is a
106-year-old, employee-owned die casting company with three locations in
the Midwest and 175 employees.***

-   **Todd Olson (CEO):** “Our industry — and our company, specifically
    — has been greatly impacted by the increase in foreign competition,
    much of it with unfair support of other countries, over the last ten
    years. While the U.S. die casting market has grown over that time
    period, the U.S. industry has shrunk and production in low-cost
    countries has grown immensely.”
