title: "Unfair Trade Policies Destroyed Lives \u2014 And There\u2019s Empirical Proof"
---
 
When career politicians sold American workers out to foreign countries,
not only were [entire communities
destroyed](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1907845560024842280) —
Americans’ lives were also shattered by higher rates of alcohol abuse,
drug overdose, and suicide.

**Studies have repeatedly shown the human impact of bad trade
policies:**

-   A [2020
    study](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aeri.20180396) in
    *American Economic Review: Insights* found that “areas more exposed
    to a plausibly exogenous change in international trade policy
    exhibit relative increases in fatal drug overdoses, specifically
    among whites,” concluding that there is “a relationship between a
    plausibly exogenous change in US trade policy and drug overdose
    fatalities among working-age whites, helping to explain the alarming
    rise in ‘deaths of despair’ among this group since 2000.”  
-   A [2019
    study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352827319300096)
    in *SSM-Population Health* found that from 1999 to 2015, “job loss
    due to international trade is positively associated with opioid
    overdose mortality at the county-level.”
    -   “In general, the loss of 1,000 trade-related jobs was associated
        with a 2.7 percent increase in opioid-related deaths.”
    -   “When fentanyl was present, the same number of job losses was
        associated with a 11.3 percent increase in such deaths.”  
-   A [2018
    article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022199618301181)
    in the *Journal of International Economics* found that “data from
    the U.S. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program reveal that,
    across locations, one extra TAA trade-displaced worker is associated
    with the overall employment falling by about two workers amidst
    muted geographic mobility.”  
-   A [2020 article](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7725949/)
    in *SSM-Population Health* noted “several recent studies have
    suggested a link between economic deterioration in labor markets and
    increased opioid deaths. Monnat (2018), found a cross-sectional
    association between manufacturing dependence and average
    drug-related mortality rates across U.S. counties. In a separate
    analysis, Monnat (2019) found that drug mortality rates for
    non-Hispanic whites are larger in counties designated as service
    sector-dependent in comparison to counties designated as
    non-specialized.”
    -   [Monnat
        (2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749379718300722?via=ihub):
        “Counties reliant on heavy manual labor industries, like mining
        and manufacturing, that have suffered substantial employment
        downturns and wage stagnation in recent decades, may have higher
        drug-related mortality rates.”
