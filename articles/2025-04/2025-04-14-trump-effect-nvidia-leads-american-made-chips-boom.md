title: 'TRUMP EFFECT: NVIDIA Leads American-Made Chips Boom'
---
 
For the first time ever, chipmaking giant NVIDIA will manufacture its AI
supercomputers entirely in the U.S., the
company [announced](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-manufacture-american-made-ai-supercomputers-us/) today
— part of its pledge to produce $500 billion of AI infrastructure in the
U.S. over the next four years.

The company will build and test its advanced chips in Arizona and its AI
supercomputers in Texas over a million square feet of new manufacturing
space.

**It’s the Trump Effect in action.**

President Donald J. Trump has made U.S.-based chips manufacturing a
priority as part of his relentless pursuit of an American manufacturing
renaissance, and it’s paying off — with trillions of dollars in new
investments secured in the tech sector alone.

Earlier this year, President
Trump [announced](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-announces-major-ai-infrastructure-investment) a
$500 billion private investment in AI infrastructure led by OpenAI,
Oracle, and Softbank, while
Apple [announced](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/) a
$500 billion investment and
TSMC [announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/another-historic-investment-secured-under-president-trump/) a
$100 billion investment in chips manufacturing.

Onshoring these industries is good for the American worker, good for the
American economy, and good for American national security — and the best
is yet to come.
