---
 
WASHINGTON D.C — Today, the White House Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) is delivering on President Trump’s [decisive Executive Order to
remove barriers to American
leadership](https://webdevelopmentgroup.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6821469cd180710d53bfc94d1&id=fe64a551d4&e=f395826b19)
in Artificial Intelligence (AI) by releasing two revised policies on
Federal Agency Use of AI and Federal Procurement. These memos were
revised at the direction of the Executive Order and in coordination with
the Assistant to the President on Science and Technology and the Office
of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP).    
  
Under President Trump’s leadership, America is well positioned to
maintain our global dominance in AI. To better serve the public, the
Federal Government must capitalize on the advantages of American
innovation while maintaining strong protections for Americans’ privacy,
civil rights, and civil liberties.  
  
“President Trump recognizes that AI is a technology that will define the
future. This administration is focused on encouraging and promoting
American AI innovation and global leadership, which starts with
utilizing these emerging technologies within the Federal Government.
Today’s revised memos offer much needed guidance on AI adoption and
procurement that will remove unnecessary bureaucratic restrictions,
allow agencies to be more efficient and cost-effective, and support a
competitive American AI marketplace,” **said Lynne Parker, Principal
Deputy Director of the White House OSTP.**  
  
**The Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer’s Greg Barbaccia**
continued, stating that “Federal agencies have experienced a widening
gap in adopting AI and modernizing government technology, largely due to
unnecessary bureaucracy and outdated procurement processes. OMB’s new
policies demonstrate that the government is committed to spending
American taxpayer dollars efficiently and responsibly, while increasing
public trust through the Federal use of AI.”
