title: 'JOBS, JOBS, JOBS: Explosive Job Growth in March as Trump Economy Booms'
---
 
Today’s jobs report shows the private sector is roaring back under
President Donald J. Trump — smashing expectations for the [second
straight
month](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/manufacturing-is-roaring-back-under-president-donald-j-trump/)
as the Golden Age of America is well on its way.

**In March, the U.S. added 228,000 jobs — nearly 100,000 more jobs than
economists predicted and the fourth-highest month for private payroll
growth in the past two years.** In fact, last month’s jobs increase is
roughly twice the pace of the previous two months.

**The report highlights a resilient labor market as companies
aggressively onshore jobs amid President Trump’s bold trade and economic
agenda.**

-   Private employment grew by 209,000 jobs — well above the
    pre-election 12-month average of 124,000 jobs:
    -   \+ 23,700 jobs in retail trade.

    <!-- -->

    -   \+ 22,900 jobs in transportation and warehousing.

    <!-- -->

    -   \+ 13,000 jobs in construction.
-   The number of full-time workers increased by a remarkable 459,000
    over last month, while labor force participation grew by 232,000 as
    more Americans seek jobs.
-   Americans’ wages are up, with nominal hourly wages rising by nearly
    4% over the past year.
-   Under Biden, government and government-adjacent employment accounted
    for nearly three-fourths of new employment. Under President Trump,
    that number dropped to just 42% in March.
