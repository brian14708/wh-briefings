title: "\u201CSanctuary\u201D Policies Put Accused Killer Back on the Streets"
---
 
So-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions endanger the lives of the Americans
who live there.  
  
The latest example comes in Prince George’s County, Maryland, where an
illegal immigrant was arrested, charged with murder and assault, then
[released](https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/ice-arrests-guatemalan-alien-charged-murder-assault-after-release-noncooperative)
back onto the streets despite an ICE immigration detainer request — a
result of the county’s insane “sanctuary” policies.  
  
Fortunately, ICE eventually
[arrested](https://x.com/BillMelugin_/status/1912181516169285762) the
illegal immigrant and he’ll soon be on his way back to Guatemala.  
  
**The negligence of leftist politicians is putting lives at risk.**

    about “not participating in immigration enforcement” and [claimed in
    2024](https://x.com/realgarycollins/status/1819482255623877025) that
    immigration enforcement “should not be the responsibility of local
    governments.”
-   In 2019, then-Prince George’s County Council Member Deni Taveras —
    now a member of the Maryland House of Delegates —
    [said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/prince-georges-council-considers-law-barring-agencies-from-working-with-ice/2019/11/19/250085e4-0aca-11ea-8397-a955cd542d00_story.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThere%20is%20an%20incredible%20amount%20of%20fear%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20council%20member%20Deni%20Taveras%20(D%2DDistrict%202)%2C%20who%20sponsored%20the%20legislation.%20%E2%80%9CThese%20people%20pay%20taxes%20.%E2%80%89.%E2%80%89.%20we%20need%20to%20be%20doing%20better%20at%20all%20levels%20of%20government%20in%20terms%20of%20protecting%20them.%E2%80%9D)
    “there is an incredible amount of fear” about immigration
    enforcement.
-   Acting Prince George’s County Executive Tara Jackson
    [said](https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/politics-power/local-government/ice-enforcement-counties-RJPLOSXTJZH67GINEA4IMW2PEU/):
    “The Prince George’s County Police Department does not engage in
    federal immigration enforcement actions … Our focus is on ensuring
    public safety and building trust with all members of our community,
    regardless of their immigration status.”
-   Maryland State Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s)
    [introduced](https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/politics/maryland-lawmaker-wants-to-limit-cooperation-between-local-and-state-police-departments-and-ice-287g/65-163b5716-cb1d-4828-ae4a-bcca15239e85)
    a bill to ban local law enforcement agencies from cooperating with
    ICE: “People would not feel safe in terms of reporting actual crime
    that is taking place within their communities.”
-   Maryland State Sen. Alonzo Washington (D-Prince George’s)
    [said](https://dbknews.com/2025/02/13/pg-county-executive-debate-budget-deficit/)
    local law enforcement should not be enforcing immigration laws:
    “We’re going to build a better relationship with our immigrant
    community so we know exactly who they are and we can protect them.”
