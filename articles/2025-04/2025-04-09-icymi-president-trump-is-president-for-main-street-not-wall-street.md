title: "ICYMI: President Trump Is \u201CPresident for Main Street, Not Wall Street\u201D"

Last night, President Donald J. Trump made clear whose side he is on —
everyday Americans, not the globalist politicians who have spent decades
selling out American workers to foreign countries.

**Here’s what you missed during President Trump’s speech:**

-   [**President Trump on his
    motivations**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1909761917352108218):
    “I’m proud to be the president for the workers, not the outsourcers;
    the president who stands up for Main Street, not Wall Street; who
    protects the middle class, not the political class; and who defends
    America, not trade cheaters all over the globe.”
-   [**President Trump on the America First
    agenda**](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/04/08/trump-proud-to-be-the-president-for-the-workers-and-middle-class/#:~:text=%E2%80%9COur%20opponents%20are,country%20is%20unthinkable.%E2%80%9D):
    “Our opponents are not afraid that our America First policies will
    fail, they’re terrified that our strategy will succeed and we’re
    going to get bigger and stronger and better … and that is what’s
    happening … We’re going to prove that all of their treasonous years
    of betrayal will not be forgotten.”
-   [**President Trump on
    trade**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1909760332458856561):
    “The shrill voices that you’re hearing this week about tariffs are
    the same scoundrels and frauds who never thought twice about when
    the United States lost 90,000 factories and plants … since NAFTA.”
-   [**President Trump on deporting foreign
    terrorists**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1909770634592133283):
    “Last month, we officially designated Tren de Aragua, MS-13 and the
    Mexican drug cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations. And thanks
    to the Supreme Court yesterday … We will continue to deport these
    monsters under the Alien Enemies Act.”
-   [**President Trump on his second
    term**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1909755748659118103):
    “I had somebody say the most successful first month in the history —
    now they say the most successful 100 days in the history of our
    country, and I believe that’s right, and we’re going to continue
    that way, if not more so.”
-   [**Keith Siegel, an American held hostage by Hamas, delivered moving
    remarks**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1909775445165285532):
    “I am here and I am alive. President Trump, you saved my life. You
    saved the life of 33 hostages because of your efforts.”
