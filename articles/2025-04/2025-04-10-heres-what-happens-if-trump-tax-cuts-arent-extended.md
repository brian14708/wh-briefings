Democrat Rep. Steve Horsford [actually
said](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1910087368314388538)
delivering “the biggest tax cut in history” would “screw America.”

What would “screw America” is failing to act.
[**A**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Economic-Impact-of-Extending-TCJA-Provisions.pdf)
[**new report from the Council of Economic
Advisers**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Economic-Impact-of-Extending-TCJA-Provisions.pdf)
**shows that extending the Trump Tax Cuts will deliver needed relief to
Americans after years of unending Bidenflation:**

-   Real wages will go up by as much as $3,300/year.
-   Take-home pay for median-income households will increase by as much
    as $5,000/year.
-   Short-run real GDP will be boosted by 3.3-3.8% and long-run real GDP
    by 2.6-3.2%.
-   Save 4.1 million jobs from being destroyed.
-   Distressed communities will see as much as $100 billion in
    investment.

**If Congress doesn’t extend the Trump Tax Cuts, Americans will be stuck
with the largest tax hike in history:**

-   The average taxpayer will see a [22% tax
    hike](https://x.com/HouseGOP/status/1909631176777634041) ([$4
    trillion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Economic-Impact-of-Extending-TCJA-Provisions.pdf)).
-   The average family of four will see a [$1,700 tax
    hike](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/2025/02/25/house-passes-budget-resolution-to-advance-one-big-beautiful-bill-that-will-deliver-tax-relief-to-working-families/).
-   The Child Tax Credit will be cut in half for [40 million
    families](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/2024/12/11/40-million-families-at-risk-of-seeing-child-tax-credit-slashed-in-half/).
-   Nearly every taxpayer will see their guaranteed deduction [slashed
    in
    half](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/2024/12/13/91-percent-of-americans-could-lose-half-of-their-guaranteed-deduction/).
-   26 million small businesses will be saddled with a [massive tax
    increase](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/2024/12/17/top-federal-tax-rate-will-increase-to-43-4-for-26-million-small-businesses-if-congress-fails-to-act/).
-   Even liberal economists
    [admit](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/unpacking-tcja-who-benefits-and-who-loses-extending-major-provisions#:~:text=on%20average%2C%20all%20income%20groups%20would%20get%20a%20tax%20cut)
    “all income groups would get a tax cut.”

**President Trump is calling on Congress to immediately “**[**pass the
one, big, beautiful
bill**](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114307883361614427)**”
and unleash a soaring economy, surging jobs market, manufacturing boom,
and prosperity like never before.**

It’s time to get it done.
