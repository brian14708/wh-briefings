title: President Trump Is Standing Up to Terrorism and Protecting International Commerce
---
 
It has been over a year since a U.S.-flagged commercial ship safely
sailed through the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, or the Gulf of Aden. No
terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from
freely sailing the Waterways of the World.  
  
Our economic and national security have been under attack by the Houthis
for too long. Today, President Trump’s action and leadership are moving
to end this.

**<span style="text-decoration: underline">Shipping Disruption</span>**

-   Houthi attacks against shipping since 2023 have caused a sustained
    negative effect on global trade and the economic security of the
    United States. A 2024 [Defense Intelligence Agency
    report](https://www.dia.mil/Portals/110/Images/News/Military_Powers_Publications/YEM_Houthi-Attacks-Pressuring-International-Trade.pdf) detailed
    how container shipping through the Red Sea has precipitously
    declined due to Houthi attacks.
-   Before their attacks, 25,000 merchant ships passed through the Red
    Sea annually. The current number has dropped to around 10,000 ships
    annually.
-   Imports of consumer goods and cars to the United States, as well as
    agricultural exports from our own Gulf of America, have been
    rerouted due to the Houthi attacks.
-   In November 2023, the Houthis seized the ship M/V Galaxy Leader and
    began to attack commercial ships with anti-ship missiles and
    unmanned vehicles.
-   Houthi attacks caused approximately 75% of U.S.- and UK-affiliated
    vessels to reroute around Africa instead of transiting the Red Sea.
    Traveling around Africa takes an average of ten days longer than
    sailing through the Red Sea. Additional fuel costs are roughly one
    million dollars more for each voyage around Africa.
-   Higher shipping rates caused by Houthi attacks probably increased
    global consumer goods inflation between 0.6 and 0.7 percent in 2024.

**<span style="text-decoration: underline">Impacts to Allies and
Partners</span>**

-   The Red Sea serves a primary conduit for trade between Europe and
    Asia. Around 95% of ships traveling between Europe and Asia normally
    would go through the Red Sea.
-   Out of the top ten importers (by value) of trade through the Red
    Sea, five are EU nations.
-   Houthi attacks caused approximately 60% of EU-affiliated vessels to
    reroute around Africa instead of transiting the Red Sea

U.S. warships 174 times and commercial vessels 145 times since 2023.**

    helicopters engaged, resulting in the sinking of three Houthi boats.
-   December 30, 2023: Houthi forces fired anti-ship ballistic missiles

    interests, was attacked by Houthi missiles in the Gulf of Aden,
    causing a fire onboard.

    tanker M/V Sounion, threatening a massive oil-spill and followed by
    a months-long salvage effort.  
-   September 27, 2024: The USS Spruance, USS Stockdale, and USS
    Indianapolis were targeted by a barrage of missiles and drones
    launched by Houthi forces in the Red Sea. All threats were

-   November 11, 2024: Houthi forces launched a coordinated attack
    involving drones, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles against
    the USS Spruance and USS Stockdale in the Bab al-Mandeb Strait. The
    U.S. destroyers successfully intercepted all incoming threats.
-   December 1, 2024: While escorting U.S.-flagged merchant vessels in
    the Gulf of Aden, the USS Stockdale and USS O’Kane intercepted
    multiple missiles and drones launched by Houthi forces, ensuring the
    safety of the convoy.
-   December 9–10, 2024: The USS Stockdale and USS O’Kane again faced
    Houthi-launched drones and missiles while escorting merchant vessels
    in the Gulf of Aden. All threats were neutralized without any
    damage.
