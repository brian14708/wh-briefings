title: President Trump Delivers Justice for Terrorists, Security for Americans
---
 
This weekend, the Trump Administration
[deported](https://x.com/PressSec/status/1901261105483137501) ruthless
terrorist gang members — illegal immigrants who invaded our country and
brought unspeakable devastation to our communities — as part of
President Donald J. Trump’s utilization of every possible tool to
protect the safety and security of the American people and reverse the
damage done by years of feckless Democrat leadership.  
   
**This bold, necessary action was immediately heralded by administration
officials, members of Congress, and the American people:**  
   
[**Vice President JD
Vance**](https://x.com/JDVance/status/1901441626116870156): “There were
violent criminals and rapists in our country. Democrats fought to keep
them here. President Trump deported them.”  
   
[**Secretary of State Marco
Rubio**](https://x.com/SecRubio/status/1901241933302825470): “We have
sent 2 dangerous top MS-13 leaders plus 21 of its most wanted back to
face justice in El Salvador. Also, as promised by @POTUS, we sent over
250 alien enemy members of Tren de Aragua which El Salvador has agreed
to hold in their very good jails at a fair price that will also save our
taxpayer dollars. President @nayibbukele is not only the strongest
security leader in our region, he’s also a great friend of the U.S.
Thank you!”  
   
[**Border Czar Tom
Homan**](https://x.com/RealTomHoman/status/1901294938199073009): “The
Biden Administration released thousands of Venezuelan Tren de Aragua
criminals into the US.  They have committed armed robberies, sex
trafficked young girls, attacked US citizens, assaulted our police and
raped and murdered young women and children. But now, thanks to the
American people, we have President Trump!  Last night, 238 Tren de
Aragua members along with 21 MS13 gang members, were deported from this
country adding to the thousands of criminal aliens already deported.
Under President Trump’s leadership, this country is becoming safer every
day.  With each criminal illegal alien being deported, neighborhoods are
becoming safer.   Criminal illegal aliens, gang members and national
security threats can try to hide with the help of sanctuary cities,
however, know this, ICE will not stop until they are found and deported.
This important work, that ICE is doing will continue while Attorney
General Pam Bondi takes the sanctuary jurisdictions to court.  We have
much more to do AND IT WILL BE DONE!!!”  
   
[**Sen. John
Barrasso**](https://x.com/SenJohnBarrasso/status/1901637902724919524):
“Deporting violent criminals, rapists, terrorists, and drug dealers who
came to America illegally is commonsense. Thank you President Trump for
making America safer.”  
   
[**Sen. Tom
Cotton**](https://x.com/SenTomCotton/status/1901640271810470053):
“President Trump campaigned and won on making Americans safer. The
deportation of depraved Tren de Aragua savages is the first step towards
repairing our country after years of open border policies.”  
   
[**Sen. Chuck
Grassley**](https://x.com/ChuckGrassley/status/1901269822987506157):
“Another day, another judge unilaterally deciding policy for the whole
country. This time to benefit foreign gang members If the Supreme Court
or Congress doesn’t fix, we’re headed towards a constitutional crisis.
Senate Judiciary Cmte taking action”  
   
[**Sen. Mike
Lee**](https://x.com/BasedMikeLee/status/1901395937475309880): “Do you
miss the foreign terrorists now that Trump has deported them? I don’t”  
   
[**Sen. Markwayne
Mullin**](https://x.com/SenMullin/status/1901333756612313429): “You’d
think everyone would believe this, but we’re facing another 80/20 issue…
I 100% support the Trump admin’s effort to deport violent illegal aliens
from the United States of America. This includes Venezuelan gang
members.”  
   
[**Sen. Eric
Schmitt**](https://x.com/Eric_Schmitt/status/1901344554000793658):
“While you slept, your government sent three planes full of Tren de
Aragua and MS-13 thugs to the beautiful prisons of El Salvador. Thanks
to the leadership of this administration—and our friend
@nayibbukele—America is safer today than it was yesterday.”  
   
[**Rep. Brian
Babin**](https://x.com/RepBrianBabin/status/1901377327461982455): “Judge
Boasberg is endangering Americans! He blocked the deportation of violent
Tren de Aragua gang members—rapists, murderers, and thugs. No judge
should have the power to override @POTUS’ national security
decisions.”  
   
[**Rep. Lauren
Boebert**](https://x.com/RepBoebert/status/1901316275814449494):
“Democrats in Colorado called the threat of Tren De Aragua a ‘figment of
imagination.’ Thank you @POTUS and President @NayibBukele for doing
what’s necessary to keep Americans safe!”  
   
[**Rep. Andrew
Clyde**](https://x.com/Rep_Clyde/status/1901417737122959446): “Let me
get this straight… Joe Biden could blatantly violate our immigration
laws to flood our country with criminal illegal aliens—but President
Trump can’t deport them?”  
   
[**Rep. Mike
Collins**](https://x.com/RepMikeCollins/status/1901403536229114097):
“It’s ridiculous that a Democratic president can import violent gang
members, but a Republican president can’t deport them.”  
   
[**Rep. Eli
Crane**](https://x.com/RepEliCrane/status/1901428111146729818): “The
activist judges were suspiciously quiet when Joe Biden enacted all the
policies that led to gang members ENTERING America. How’s that work?
Only vocal when President Trump DEPORTS them?”  
   
[**Rep. Byron
Donalds**](https://x.com/RepDonaldsPress/status/1901617685407887579):
“These are criminal aliens to our nation. These are gang members,
murderers, and rapists. Under President Trump, they are rightly being
arrested and deported, but the left wants them to stay. We are Making
America Safe Again”  
   
[**Rep. Lance
Gooden**](https://x.com/Lancegooden/status/1901622159983714641):
“Democrats gave illegal criminals luxury hotels. President Trump gave
illegal gang members a one-way ticket to the world’s most feared prison.
Thank you, President @nayibbukele and El Salvador!”  
   
[**Rep. Wesley Hunt**](https://x.com/RepWPH/status/1901623212204556303):
“It is incredible to see Democrats defend Tren De Aragua and MS-13
members. Tom Homan says these flights will continue. The Trump
administration will NOT stop until every last criminal alien is out of
this country!”  
   
[**Rep. Darrell
Issa**](https://x.com/repdarrellissa/status/1901637739876868194): “The
day @realDonaldTrump returned to the White House, America started
sending criminal illegals out of our country.”  
   
[**Rep. Nick
Langworthy**](https://x.com/RepLangworthy/status/1901628090138124514):
“Radical Left Democrats put our country in danger every single day and
made every state a border state. That ended the day President Trump took
his oath. He is cleaning up our country and making America safe
again.”  
   
[**Rep. Nicole
Malliotakis**](https://x.com/RepNicole/status/1901600921219416503):
“Thank you to President Trump & El Salvador President Bukele for getting
these dangerous gang members removed from the United States. Shame on
ACLU for working to shield these foreign gangs who have wreaked havoc &
committed heinous crimes in our country from deportation.”  
   
[**Rep. Addison
McDowell**](https://x.com/RepMcDowell/status/1901385624101249466):
“Yesterday, an Obama-appointed judge ruled that two flights carrying
rapists and murderers from the Tren de Aragua gang be turned around &
brought back to the U.S. This is flat out disgusting and I’m glad
@realdonaldtrump is moving full steam ahead.”  
   
[**Rep. Mary
Miller**](https://x.com/RepMaryMiller/status/1901437103654748180): “The
government’s first duty is to protect its people. President Trump stands
in sharp contrast to the Biden regime and the entire Democrat
Clan—they’ve completely failed America. Now, they’re watching what real
leadership looks like. This is how it’s done”  
   
[**Rep. Ralph
Norman**](https://x.com/RepRalphNorman/status/1901639595533435278):
“These are gang leaders, rapists, and murderers who thought they could
find refuge in America. NOT ANYMORE!!”  
   
[**Rep. Scott
Perry**](https://x.com/RepScottPerry/status/1901630983184548244): “Why
did an activist judge try to stop the deportation of illegal, criminal
migrants – hardcore rapists, gang members, and cartel / drug traffickers
– who not only broke laws in their own country before invading our
Nation, but came here to break ours as well?”  
   
[**Rep. Chip Roy**](https://x.com/chiproytx/status/1901091521077686506):
“Judge Boasberg should be on a plane to Houston to sit with Alexis
Nungaray & explain why we must keep TDA gang members who killed her
daughter. Radical progressive Dems endangered us by fueling an invasion
of our communities. Trump is right to take quick action to reverse
it.”  
   
[**Rep. María Elvira
Salazar**](https://x.com/RepMariaSalazar/status/1901355940860866894):
“BRAVO @nayibbukele and President Trump! Bukele is an expert at LOCKING
UP every gang member, murderer and criminal. It’s great to see us
working with our allies in the hemisphere again to get the thugs out of
the USA.”  
   
[**Rep. Keith
Self**](https://x.com/RepKeithSelf/status/1901647736631357527):
“Incredible. All we needed was a new President.”  
   
[**Rep. Greg
Steube**](https://x.com/RepGregSteube/status/1901342091168620653):
“Thank you, President Trump and President Bukele, for taking a
zero-tolerance approach to criminal illegal immigrants and terrorists.
The Trump administration secured a deal with El Salvador to extradite
and imprison Tren de Aragua gang members who exploited Biden’s
open-border disaster. No country should tolerate terrorists and
criminals roaming free. This is how you lead with strength.”  
   
[**Rep. Marlin
Stutzman**](https://x.com/RepStutzman/status/1901433720441086143):
“Cartel members who engaged in kidnapping, sexual abuse of children,
robbery, and aggravated assault on a police officers belong in prison.
Anyone standing in the way of their deportation and jailing is no friend
of our country. Glad these criminals are off of our streets.”  
   
[**Rep. Tom
Tiffany**](https://x.com/RepTiffany/status/1901644627758682201): “First,
Democrats allowed Tren de Aragua members into our country. Now, a rogue
judge and Democrats are fighting to keep them here. Why are they
protecting illegal gang members instead of U.S. citizens?”  
   
[**Rep. Derrick Van
Orden**](https://x.com/derrickvanorden/status/1901446692571906095): “I
am not sure Americans understand how amazingly terrible this rogue
judge’s ruling was. He wanted to keep violent criminal illegal aliens,
including rapist, in the United States. @realDonaldTrump & @JDVance are
protecting Americans.”  
   
[**Rep. Randy
Weber**](https://x.com/TXRandy14/status/1901636653812208065): “The only
words Democrats should be saying right now are: ‘Thank you, President
Trump, for taking action to get terrorists out of our country.’ These
are dangerous thugs who despise everything America stands for. God bless
President Trump.”  
   
[**Virginia Attorney General Jason
Miyares**](https://x.com/JasonMiyaresVA/status/1901642938767102036):
“Radicals want you to believe Trump is acting illegally by deporting
Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang. These aren’t U.S. citizens—they’re
violent criminals who exploited Biden’s border failures to terrorize
Americans. I’ll always fight for the rule of law.”  
   
[**America First
Legal**](https://x.com/America1stLegal/status/1901442251504353788):
“President Trump has deported 238 criminals in the violent Venezuelan
gang Tren de Aragua to El Salvador to be imprisoned in CECOT, the
country’s maximum-security prison. Tren de Aragua is a real and present
danger, and President Trump’s decisive action will protect Americans.”  
   
[**Retired CIA Senior Operations Officer Rick de la
Torre**](https://x.com/vrk_rick/status/1901624470487302198)**:**
“President Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to expel Tren de
Aragua (TdA) gang members from U.S. soil is not only the right move—it’s
a long-overdue strike against a growing national security threat.”  
   
[**Attorney Mike
Davis**](https://x.com/mrddmia/status/1901623339073867976): “Amen. For 4
years, Democrats pretended grandmas trespassing into the Capitol were a
graver threat than foreign terrorists invading America. Robbers,
rapists, and murderers. President Trump is fulfilling his constitutional
duty, as commander-in-chief, to repel foreign invasion.”  
   
[**Commentator Joe
Pagliarulo**](https://x.com/JoeTalkShow/status/1901325819798000000)**:**
“The Trump Administration is sending back violent gang members …
Everybody in the United States, no matter which side you are on
politically, should agree that they should go back.”  
   
[**Discovery Institute Senior Journalism Fellow Jonathan
Choe**](https://x.com/choeshow/status/1901363426166976810): “This is
what awaits violent criminal illegals in America. Look at this recent
batch of Tren De Aragua gang members deported to an El Salvadoran
prison.”  
   
[**The Conservative Caucus’s Jim
Pfaff**](https://x.com/jimpfaff/status/1901342834851979741): “Trump took
action. While a judge blocked the deportation of Tren de Aragua
criminals to Venezuela, Nayib Bukele agreed to take them into his
Salvadoran prisons which are much worse for them than anything they
faced In Venezuela.”
