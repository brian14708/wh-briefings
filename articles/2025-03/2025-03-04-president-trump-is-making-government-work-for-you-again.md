title: President Trump is Making Government Work for You Again
---
 
President Donald J. Trump immediately undertook a bold, necessary effort
to downsize the federal government by ending the waste, fraud, and abuse
that has permeated virtually all aspects of the bureaucracy — making
sure government works for the taxpayers who fund it.

-   President
    Trump [established](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/establishing-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency/) the
    Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to maximize government
    productivity and ensure the best use of taxpayer funds — which has
    already achieved [billions of dollars in
    savings](https://doge.gov/savings) for taxpayers.
-   President
    Trump [commenced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-workforce-optimization-initiative/) his
    plan to downsize the federal bureaucracy and eliminate waste, bloat,
    and insularity.
    -   President
        Trump [ordered](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/return-to-in-person-work/) federal
        workers to return to the office five days a week.
    -   President
        Trump [ordered](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-workforce-optimization-initiative/) federal
        agencies hire no more than one employee for every four employees
        who leave.
    -   President
        Trump [ended](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/eliminating-the-federal-executive-institute/) the
        wasteful Federal Executive Institute, which had become a
        training ground for bureaucrats.
    -   President
        Trump [ordered](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/06/trump-politico-subscriptions-doge-elon-musk) the
        termination of all federal Fake News media contracts.

    bureaucrats.

        USAID](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/at-usaid-waste-and-abuse-runs-deep/) —
        ensuring taxpayers are no longer on the hook for funding the pet
        projects of entrenched bureaucrats, such as sex changes in
        Guatemala.
    -   President
        Trump [ordered](https://apnews.com/article/trump-consumer-protection-cease-1b93c60a773b6b5ee629e769ae6850e9) the
        Consumer Financial Protection Bureau — the brainchild of
        Elizabeth Warren,
        which [funneled](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1889001002201743481) cash
        to left-wing advocacy groups — to halt operations.
    -   The Environmental Protection
        Agency [canceled](https://x.com/epaleezeldin/status/1890080377940926637) tens
        of millions of dollars in contracts to left-wing advocacy
        groups, [announced](https://x.com/epaleezeldin/status/1889840040622321778) an
        investigation into a scheme by Biden EPA staffers to shield
        billions of dollars from oversight and accountability,
        and [put](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/climate/epa-environmental-justice-workers-leave.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--fy2Dk0nnE6ITJAn4IeeFsIm30PasSS9RS1ZqU7aLy_9KgYWiwa9yk37ERXSNLn7kctfgxZCPoQ9pfT5Bv8Q2aYyGKoVrchVBoleMeuH9QiqRsLok&_hsmi=346251961&utm_content=346251961&utm_source=hs_email) 168

            15,000 grants worth $60 billion for potential elimination.

        grants to ensure accountability and efficiency.
