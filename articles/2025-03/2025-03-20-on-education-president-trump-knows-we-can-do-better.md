title: On Education, President Trump Knows We Can Do Better
---
 
Since 1979, the U.S. Department of Education has spent over [$3
trillion](https://www.ed.gov/about/ed-overview/annual-performance-reports/budget/us-department-of-education-budget-history)
with virtually nothing to show for it. **Despite per-pupil spending
having**
[**increased**](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d22/tables/dt22_236.55.asp)
**by more than 245% over that period, there has been virtually no
measurable improvement in student achievement:**

-   Math and reading scores for 13-year-olds are at the [lowest level in
    decades](https://www.npr.org/2023/06/21/1183445544/u-s-reading-and-math-scores-drop-to-lowest-level-in-decades).
-   Six-in-ten fourth graders and nearly three-quarters of eighth
    graders are [not
    proficient](https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/reports/mathematics/2024/g4_8/?grade=4)
    in math.
-   Seven-in-ten fourth and eighth graders are [not
    proficient](https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/reports/reading/2024/g4_8/?grade=4)
    in reading, while 40% of fourth grade students don’t even meet basic
    reading levels.
-   Standardized test scores have [remained
    flat](https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/ltt/?age=9) for decades.
-   U.S. students
    [rank](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/04/24/most-americans-think-us-k-12-stem-education-isnt-above-average-but-test-results-paint-a-mixed-picture/)
    28 out of 37 OECD member countries in math.

**President Donald J. Trump and his administration believe we can, and
must, be better.**

Instead of maintaining the status quo that is failing American students,
the Trump Administration’s bold plan will return education where it
belongs — with individual states, which are best positioned to
administer effective programs and services that benefit their own unique
populations and needs.

Instead of a bloated federal system that burdens schools with
regulations and paperwork, the Trump Administration believes states
should be empowered to expand educational freedom and opportunity for
all families.

**Why would we keep doing the same thing over and over again and expect
a different result?**
