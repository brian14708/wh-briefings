title: President Trump is Securing Our Homeland
---
 
After four years of Biden’s open borders, President Donald J. Trump
launched an unprecedented crackdown on the illegal immigrants and deadly
drugs allowed to enter our country to remarkable success — and he
[didn’t need legislation to do
it](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1896922571637227913).

-   In February — President Trump’s first month in office — illegal
    border crossings
    [fell](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1895906606900240806) to
    the lowest level ever recorded, [down
    94%](https://www.breitbart.com/border/2025/03/02/trump-effect-migrant-encounters-at-southern-border-hit-lowest-ever-mark-down-94-percent-from-last-february/)
    from last February and [down
    96%](https://x.com/BillMelugin_/status/1895908261691617706) from the
    all-time high of the Biden Administration.
    -   ICE arrests of illegal immigrants have
        [surged](https://x.com/Sec_Noem/status/1894837641167655107)
        627%.
