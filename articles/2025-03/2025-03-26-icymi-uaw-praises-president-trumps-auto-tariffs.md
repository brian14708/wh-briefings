title: "ICYMI: UAW Praises President Trump\u2019s Auto Tariffs"
---
 
Today, President Donald J.
Trump [imposed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/adjusting-imports-of-automobiles-and-autombile-parts-into-the-united-states/) a
25% tariff on foreign automobiles imported into the United States — a
continuation of President Trump’s Made in America renaissance.

The move was [immediately
hailed](https://x.com/UAW/status/1905034035081986053) by the United Auto
Workers — one of the country’s largest labor unions — as a “victory for
autoworkers.”

“We applaud the Trump administration for stepping up to end the free
trade disaster that has devastated working class communities for
decades. Ending the race to the bottom in the auto industry starts with
fixing our broken trade deals, and the Trump administration has made
history with today’s actions. … The UAW and the working class in general
couldn’t care less about party politics; working people expect leaders
to work together to deliver results. The UAW has been clear: we will
work with any politician, regardless of party, who is willing to reverse
decades of working-class people going backwards in the most profitable
times in our nation’s history. These tariffs are a major step in the
right direction for autoworkers and blue-collar communities across the
country, and it is now on the automakers, from the Big Three to
Volkswagen and beyond, to bring back good union jobs to the U.S.”
