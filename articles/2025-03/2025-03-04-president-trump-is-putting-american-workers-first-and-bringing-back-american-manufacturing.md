  \ American Manufacturing"

President Donald J. Trump is standing up for American workers,
strengthening American industries, and making clear to the world that
America will no longer be ripped off — a push that has already delivered
historic results.

**President Trump is leveling the playing field for American workers.**

-   President
    Trump [restored](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/adjusting-imports-of-steel-into-the-united-states/) a
    25% tariff on steel imports
    and [elevated](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/adjusting-imports-of-aluminum-into-the-united-states/) the
    tariff to 25% on aluminum imports to protect these critical American
    industries from unfair foreign competition.
    -   The move was praised by the [Steel Manufacturers
        Association](https://steelnet.org/steel-manufacturers-association-welcomes-tariff-on-steel-imports/),
        the [Aluminum
        Association](https://www.aluminum.org/news/strong-trade-enforcement-access-metal-vital-continued-aluminum-industry-growth),
        and [businesses](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1890423699288785165) across
        the country.
    -   Robert Simon, CEO of JSW Steel
        USA, [praised](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-tariffs-spark-exciting-time-ohio-steel-plant-ceo-eyes-adding-jobs-boosting-productivity) the
        steel and aluminum tariffs “as a project that will flood the
        U.S. with jobs as trading partners move their industries to U.S.
        soil to avoid tariffs.”
-   President
    Trump [unveiled](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1890123797283631253) a
    plan for fair and reciprocal trade, making clear to the world that
    the United States will no longer tolerate being [ripped
    off](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1890122201741111406) — a
    plan met with
    [praise](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/02/president-trump-demands-fair-reciprocal-trade/)
    across the board.
    -   [American Iron and Steel
        Institute:](https://www.steel.org/2025/02/aisi-statement-on-president-trumps-memo-on-reciprocal-trade/) “American
        steel producers know well the negative impact of foreign unfair
        trade practices, including subsidies, currency manipulation and
        other unfair and discriminatory policies and practices, on
        domestic industries and their workers.”
    -   [Renewable Fuels
        Association:](https://ethanolrfa.org/media-and-news/category/news-releases/article/2025/02/rfa-thanks-president-trump-for-taking-action-to-counter-brazil-ethanol-tariff) “For
        almost a decade now, we have spent precious time and resources
        fighting back against an unfair and unjustified tariff regime
        imposed by Brazil’s government on U.S. ethanol imports … We
        thank President Trump for taking this action and hope this
        reciprocal tariff will help encourage a return to free and fair
        ethanol trade relationship with Brazil.”

**President Trump is securing historic investments as companies seek to
make their products in America instead of paying tariffs.**

-   Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida said President Trump’s tariffs
    could [push](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/top-automaker-could-move-some-production-out-mexico-amid-trump-tariff-talks-ceo-says) the
    car manufacturer to move its production from Mexico to the U.S.
