---
 
Last night, members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)
team [joined](https://x.com/BretBaier/status/1905393918977393099) Bret
Baier on Special Report — a compelling segment on their efforts to
fulfill President Donald J. Trump’s mission of making government work
for the people again.

**Here’s what you missed:**

-   [**Tom Krause on restoring fiscal
    responsibility**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1905396404920475652)**:**
    “We’re changing the culture … There’s $500 billion of fraud every
    year, there’s hundreds of billions of dollars of improper payments,
    and we can’t pass an audit … If I was a public company CFO, I would
    effectively be removed.”
-   [**Aram Moghaddassi on improving Social Security
    benefits**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1905385850201944499)**:**
    “The two improvements that we’re trying to make to Social Security
    are helping people that legitimately get benefits protect them from
    fraud that they experience every day on a routine basis, and also
    make the experience better … At Social Security, one of the first
    things we learned is that they get phone calls every day of people
    trying to change direct deposit information … We learned 40% of the
    phone calls that they get are from fraudsters … Almost half.”
-   [**Elon Musk on cracking down on fraudulent
    payments**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1905396083582263336)**:**
    “There were over $300M of Small Business Administration loans that
    have been given out to people under the age of 11 … $300 million to
    over the age of 120 … The youngest recipient of a Small Business
    Administration loan is a nine-month-old.”
-   [**Brad Smith on enhancing health
    care**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1905399160200659114)**:**
    “There’s 700 different IT systems today at NIH … They can’t speak to
    each other. They have 27 different CIOs. And so when you think about
    making great medical discoveries, you have to connect the data.”
-   [**Joe Gebbia on making government retirement more
    efficient**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1905384966734619042)**:**
    “The process takes many months — and we’re going to make it just
    many days.”
-   [**Elon Musk on waste, fraud, and
    abuse**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1905382369743302900)**:**
    “The sheer amount of waste and fraud in the government, it is
    astonishing — it’s mind blowing. We routinely encounter wastes of $1
    billion or more — casually.”
-   [**Elon Musk on DOGE’s core
    mission**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1905395508396331277)**:**
    “At the end of the day, America is going to be in much better shape.
    America will be solvent. The critical programs that people depend
    upon will work and it’s going to be a fantastic future.”
