title: Trump Administration Takes Down Top MS-13 Gang Leader
---
 
Early this morning, the Trump Administration
[directed](https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/1905229078614995199) the
successful apprehension of a key leader of the brutal MS-13 gang in
Virginia — an [illegal immigrant from El
Salvador](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1905237189211926621) who
was one of the top three MS-13 leaders in the United States. Thanks to a
coordinated effort by federal law enforcement and state and local law
enforcement in Virginia, this gang leader is no longer terrorizing our
streets.

**Here’s what you need to know:**

-   [**Attorney General Pam
    Bondi**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1905237397786239383)**:**
    “America is safer today because one of the top domestic terrorists
    in MS-13, he is off the streets. This has been an ongoing directive
    of President Trump. His directive to me when I became Attorney
    General of the United States was very simple: keep America safe.”
-   [**Virginia Governor Glenn
    Youngkin**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1905238286345421104)**:**
    “It’s this effort that has been enabled by the Trump Administration.
    President Trump said, ‘Get the bad guys.’ I’ve been working on this
    — literally — for the first three years of our administration with
    little to no help from the senior leadership in the federal
    government in the Biden Administration. On Day One \[of President
    Trump’s second term\], we went to work signing a 287(g) memorandum.”
-   [**FBI Director Kash
    Patel**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1905239069514248336)**:**
    “This is what happens when you let good cops be cops and we’re going
    to continue to let good cops be cops across this country. President
    Trump gave us the executive decision to go after and safeguard our
    communities … We are returning our communities to safety.”
-   [**Attorney General
    Bondi**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1905241257867194757)**:**
    “From the second Donald Trump took office, he said he is going to
    make America safe. He shut down our borders — and now it’s our job
    to get these people out of our country as fast as we can … We will
    not have another Laken Riley.”
-   [**FBI Director
    Patel**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1905240804567761339)**:**
    “This task force is going to go everywhere as needed across the
    United States to bring the form of justice and measured security and
    safety that our American citizens deserve … If you are here
    illegally, you will not be here any longer — and if you are going to
    continue to commit acts of violent crime, you will meet the same
    fate that this individual did this morning.”
-   [**Governor
    Youngkin**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1905242201916842106)**:**
    “This task force was designed in the White House … architected in a
    very quick period of time and stood up immediately … I cannot
    emphasize enough the collaboration and support and leadership out of
    the new administration that is so different than what we saw \[under
    the Biden Administration\].”
