This morning, President Donald J. Trump and his administration were on
the airwaves in force as they explained how, in just seven weeks, the
Golden Age of America is here.

**Here’s what you missed:**

#### **President Trump on Sunday Morning Futures **

-   [On pausing tariffs on certain
    imports](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1898740983631687750):
    “I wanted to help the American car makers — until April 2nd. April
    2nd, it becomes all reciprocal — what they charge us, we charge
    them.”
-   [On Democrats’ disgusting behavior during his joint
    address](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1898743096914935818): “There’s
    something wrong with them. I can’t even believe it … They were
    talking about men playing in women’s sports … Republicans were going
    wild and the Democrats were having their little signs up — their
    little signs, their little, tiny signs … It’s unbelievable. They
    don’t get it.”
-   [On resurrecting American
    shipbuilding](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1898745138916036940):
    “What we’re doing is we’re building a tremendous foundation for the
    future … You just saw one of the biggest shipbuilders in the world
    in the Oval Office … He’s announcing a $20 billion investment in the
    United States.”
-   [On Ukrainian President
    Zelensky](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1898747206384927231):

    “Nobody has been tougher on Russia than Donald Trump … The biggest

    did I do? I stopped it.”
-   [On the Panama
    Canal](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1898752137405862310):

    the fraud out, and therefore you’ll make it better.”
-   [On DOGE](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1898755049607545095):
    “What \[Elon Musk\] has done is unbelievable … He has found hundreds

    border](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1898767374880481533):
    “President Biden didn’t follow the law. He didn’t follow the law in
    the fact that it’s always been equally applied until his
    administration and then he made decisions to ignore federal law in
    how he handled immigration and enforcement within our borders.”
-   [On holding Mexico and Canada accountable for

#### **National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett on This Week**

-   [On the February jobs
    report](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1898732852054786191):
    “In just one month alone, after losing 110,000 manufacturing jobs,

    never grown before. You are going to see over the next two years the
    greatest set of growth coming from America.”

#### **Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Fox & Friends Weekend**

-   [On government
    funding](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1898729230264877472):
    \[The continuing resolution\] “freezes spending while allowing the
    government to continue to function, allowing ICE agents and Border
    Patrol to continue their mass deportation effort, allows President
    Trump’s cabinet continue to identify waste, fraud, and abuse across
    the federal bureaucracy — so the president supports this CR, and
    we’re hopeful and expect Republicans to get on board so we can pass
    it and continue moving forward implementing President Trump’s
    agenda.”
