title: 'SUNDAY SHOWS: American Strength Is Back Under President Trump'
---
 
This morning, the Trump Administration took to the TV networks to make
clear to the country and world that American strength is back – and no
longer will terrorist attacks on U.S. troops and vital international
commerce be tolerated.

**Here’s what you missed:  
  
President Trump on Full Measure**

-   [On securing the
    border](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1901280982168166905): “You
    just needed a new president … I said, ‘close the border’ — and they
    closed the border.”
-   [On
    tariffs](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1901279594474299612): “We
    have companies moving into the United States at levels that has
    never been seen before.”

**Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Face the Nation**

-   [On Houthi terrorist attacks in the Red
    Sea](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1901286204701884540): “In
    the last 18 months, the Houthis have struck or attacked … the U.S.
    Navy 174 times, and 145 times, they’ve attacked commercial shipping.
    So, we basically have a band of pirates with guided precision
    anti-ship weaponry exacting a toll system in one of the most
    important shipping lanes in the world. That’s just not sustainable.”
-   [On revoking visas for terrorist
    sympathizers](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1901290182672007192):
    “When you apply to enter the United States and you get a visa, you
    are a guest … If you tell us when you apply for a visa, ‘I’m coming
    to the U.S. to participate in pro-Hamas events,’ that runs counter
    to the foreign policy interest of the United States … If you had
    told us you were going to do that, we never would have given you the
    visa.”
-   [On
    tariffs](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1901289789707428273):
    “I understand why these countries don’t like it — because the status
    quo of trade is good for them. It benefits them … We are going to
    set a new status quo … We have de-industrialized the United States
    of America. There are things we can no longer make.”

**Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on Sunday Morning Futures**

-   [On U.S. strikes against Houthi
    terrorists](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1901275512955166838):
    “An era of peace through strength is back … This campaign is about
    freedom of navigation and restoring deterrence … The minute the
    Houthis say ‘we’ll stop shooting at your ships, we’ll stop shooting
    at your drones,’ this campaign will end. But until then, it will be
    unrelenting.”
-   [On President Trump’s
    agenda](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1901278463685759376):
    “Shipbuilding, long-range munitions, hypersonics, long-range drones,
    a Golden Dome, southern border – the president has laid out very
    clearly his agenda to rebuild the U.S. military … We have revived
    the warrior ethos.”

**National Security Advisor Mike Waltz on This Week**

-   [On U.S. strikes against Houthi
    terrorists](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1901281133569909038):
    “These were not pinprick, back and forth, what ultimately proved to
    be feckless attacks. This was an overwhelming response that actually
    targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out.”

**National Security Advisor Mike Waltz on Fox News Sunday**

-   [On negotiations for peace in
    Ukraine](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1901290924128223376):
    “As both President Putin and Zelensky said on our first call just a
    few weeks ago, only President Trump could drive this to an end … We
    know who we’re dealing with on all sides.”

**Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent on Meet the Press**

-   [On President Trump’s economic
    agenda](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1901266814425813120):
    “One week does not the market make… It would have been very easy for
    us to come in, run these reckless policies that have been happening
    before. We’ve got these large government deficits… We are bringing
    those down in a responsible way.”
-   [On
    tariffs](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1901269937320042522):
    “Chinese manufacturers will eat the price … I believe that the
    currency adjusts … If we’re de-regulating, if we’re getting energy
    prices down, then if we look across the spectrum, Americans will
    realize lower prices and better affordability.”

**Special Envoy Steve Witkoff on State of the Union**

-   [On negotiations to end the war in
    Ukraine](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1901261646409932860):
    “Before this visit, there was another visit, and before that visit,
    the two sides were miles apart … The two sides are, today, a lot
    closer … We’ve narrowed the differences.”
-   [On when a deal to end the war could be
    possible](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1901262972975984987):
    “The president uses the timeframe weeks — and I don’t disagree with
    him. I am really hopeful that we’re going to see some real progress
    here.”
-   [On dealing with
    Hamas](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1901264833028174222):
    “What happened with the Houthis yesterday, what happened with our
    strike, ought to inform as to where we stand with the regard to
    terrorism and our tolerance level for terrorist actions — and I
    would encourage Hamas to get much more sensible.”

**Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Sunday Morning Futures**

-   [On securing our
    homeland](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1901296158196031975):
    “The president signed a proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act
    against Tren de Aragua members who have invaded our country … The
    president invoked this authority to deport nearly 300 of them who
    are now in El Salvador, where they will be behind bars where they
    belong.”
-   [On activist legal
    challenges](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1901282649177526363):
    “President Trump is not shy of resistance … Clearly, there are
    left-wing activists who sit behind a bench in a courthouse who don’t
    like this president and his policies, but the fact is everything
    President Trump is doing is within his executive authority.”
