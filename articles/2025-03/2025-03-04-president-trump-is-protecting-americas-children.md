title: "President Trump is Protecting America\u2019s Children"
---
 
President Donald J. Trump knows America’s children are our future — and
he’ll never stop fighting for their right to a healthy, productive
upbringing and childhood. That’s why President Trump immediately took
action to undo the damaging policies of the Biden Administration on
indoctrinating America’s most vulnerable with dangerous, radical
policies.

-   President Trump made it the [official
    policy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/) of
    the U.S. government that there are only two sexes.
-   President
    Trump [ended](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/keeping-men-out-of-womens-sports/) the
    unfair, demeaning practice of forcing women to compete against men
    in sports —
    which [resulted](https://www.ncaa.org/news/2025/2/6/media-center-ncaa-announces-transgender-student-athlete-participation-policy-change.aspx#:~:text=Today%2C%20the%20NCAA%20announced%20the,assigned%20female%20at%20birth%20only.) in
    the NCAA changing its rules.
    -   The Department of
        Education [launched](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-launches-title-ix-investigations-two-athletic-associations) investigations
        into the California Interscholastic Federation and the Minnesota
        State High School League over
        their [failures](https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-high-school-league-under-federal-investigation-over-transgender-executive-order/601221147) to
        comply.
-   Health systems across the nation stopped or downsized their sex
    change programs for minors following President Trump’s “[Protecting
    Children from Chemical and Surgical
    Mutilation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/)”
    executive order.
    -   In Illinois, Chicago’s Lurie Children’s
        Hospital [paused](https://abc7chicago.com/post/chicago-lurie-childrens-hospital-pauses-gender-surgeries-patients-19-trump-executive-order-transgender-care/15879712/) sex-change
        surgeries for patients under 19 as it “work\[s\] to understand
        the rapidly evolving environment.”

        Health [announced](https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/hospitals-pause-gender-affirming-care-trump-transgender-order-rcna190164) it
        would stop performing sex change surgeries on minor children,
        while UCHealth said it
        was [ending](https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/local-politics/denver-health-pauses-gender-affirming-surgeries-minors-federal-funding/73-e61f598b-e32d-474e-94b4-4b11d4c5c8af) so-called
        “gender-affirming care” for all minors.
    -   In Washington, D.C., Children’s National Hospital
        “[paused](https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/hospitals-pause-gender-affirming-care-trump-transgender-order-rcna190164)”

    vaccine mandates at schools that receive federal funding.
