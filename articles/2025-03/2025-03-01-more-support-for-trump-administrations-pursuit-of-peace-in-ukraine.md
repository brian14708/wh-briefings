title: "More Support for Trump Administration\u2019s Pursuit of Peace in Ukraine"
---
 
Support continues to roll in for the unwavering commitment of President
Donald J. Trump and Vice President Vance to the American people and the
Trump Administration’s relentless pursuit of peace.  
   
[**Speaker Mike
Johnson**](https://x.com/SpeakerJohnson/status/1895587277792829938)**:**
“Thanks to President Trump – the days of America being taken advantage
of and disrespected are OVER. The death and destruction of the
Russian-provoked war needs to stop immediately, and only our American
President can put these two countries on a path to lasting peace.
President Zelenskyy needed to acknowledge that, and accept the
extraordinary mineral rights partnership proposal that President Trump
put on the table. What we witnessed in the Oval Office today was an
American President putting America first.”  
   
[**Secretary of State Marco
Rubio**](https://x.com/townhallcom/status/1895664016774889614)**:** “The
only person on the planet who is actively trying to bring an end to this
conflict is named Donald Trump, the President of the United States.”  
   
[**National Security Advisor Mike
Waltz**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1895852082219139573)**:**
“It’s not clear that Zelenskyy truly wants to stop the fighting. He came
in, even though he was warned not to, determined to litigate all of that
… This was the wrong approach, wrong time in history, and definitely the
wrong president to try to do this.”  
   
[**Director of National Intelligence Tulsi
Gabbard**](https://x.com/TulsiGabbard/status/1895615743535776181)**:**
“Thank you @realDonaldTrump for your unwavering leadership in standing
up for the interests of the American people, and peace. What you said is
absolutely true: Zelensky has been trying to drag the United States into
a nuclear war with Russia/WW3 for years now, and no one has called him
on it. Thank you, Vice President @JDVance for speaking out so forcefully
and clearly, about the necessity of diplomacy.”  
   
[**UN Ambassador-designate Elise
Stefanik**](https://x.com/RepStefanik/status/1895581865580667051)**:**
“President Trump will ALWAYS stand up for the American people –
especially in the Oval Office. Peace through strength is back on the
world stage because of President Trump’s bold and strong leadership.”  
   
[**Sen. Eric
Schmitt**](https://x.com/Eric_Schmitt/status/1895643334661849332):
“Zelensky was probably used to talking this way to American leaders.
Apparently, no one told him that things have changed. The age of America
Last foreign policy is over. From this day forward, it’s going to be
only America First.”  
   
[**Sen. Lindsey
Graham**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1895562247570931834): “I
have never been more proud of the president. I was very proud of JD
Vance, standing up for our country.”  
   
[**CNN’s Scott
Jennings**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1895858044216774806)**:**
“All Zelenskyy had to do today was put on a tie, show up, smile, say
thank you, sign the papers, and have lunch. That’s it — and he couldn’t
do that.”  
   
[**Marc
Thiessen**](https://x.com/marcthiessen/status/1895675484177879253)**:**
“There was no ambush. Z was set up for success. All he had to do was not
get into a public fight and sign the minerals deal.  Not hard. A lot of
work went into making a successful moment possible and he blew it and
then refused to apologize.”  
   
[**Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen
Miller**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1895651604923367673)**:**
“The way that President Trump defended Americans after YEARS of being
fleeced and abused and taken advantage of and taken for granted —
millions of American hearts swelled with overflowing pride today to
watch President Trump put Zelenskyy in his place.”  
   
[**Press Secretary Karoline
Leavitt**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1895655537343389872)**:**
“\[Zelenskyy\] refuses to recognize the practical reality of this war.
It has been going on for years, his countrymen are dying, and the people
who have been funding this effort — the American people — are sick and
tired of footing this bill.”  
   
[**Rep. Victoria
Spartz**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1895657708290015583)**:**
“It’s such a disservice to the Ukrainian people to play hero and
politics and trying to increase his rating … Being so insulting to the
American people after how much was done by us for Ukraine and for
Europe, I can’t believe it.”  
   
[**Rep. Kevin
Hern**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1895591764171661809)**:**
“President Trump is determined to end the war in Ukraine. He is
determined for the world to get back at peace, as it was when he was in
office before.”
