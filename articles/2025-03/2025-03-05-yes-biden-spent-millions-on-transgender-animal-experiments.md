title: Yes, Biden Spent Millions on Transgender Animal Experiments
---
 
Last night, President Donald J. Trump
[highlighted](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1897118092481945763)
many of the egregious examples of waste, fraud, and abuse funded by
American taxpayers, including $8 million spent by the Biden
Administration “for making mice transgender.”

millions of dollars in taxpayer-funded
[grants](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Transgender-mice-WCW-12-2024-v2.docx.pdf)
for institutions across the country to perform transgender experiments
on mice.
