title: The Staggering Cost of the Illicit Opioid Epidemic in the United States
---
 
## Summary

Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 50 times more potent than heroin, is
cheaper to produce and easier to smuggle across borders, fueling the
illicit opioid epidemic in the United States with devastating
consequences. In 2023 alone, illicit opioids, primarily fentanyl, cost
Americans an estimated $2.7 trillion (in December 2024 dollars),
equivalent to 9.7 percent of GDP. Of this total cost, 41 percent ($1.1
trillion) is attributed to deaths, 49 percent ($1.34 trillion) to lost
quality of life, and 10 percent ($277 billion) to other costs such as
healthcare, reduced labor productivity, and crime-related expenses.
Alarmingly, 93 percent of opioid deaths are caused by powerful synthetic
opioids like fentanyl, which typically originate in China and are
trafficked through Mexico.

This number dwarfs even pessimistic estimates of the effects of tariffs,
like that of Goldman Sachs, who estimated losses of [0.4 percent of
GDP](https://publishing.gs.com/content/research/en/reports/2025/02/02/01f5b969-d377-4bb2-a6f8-57969353ada8.pdf).

The [CEA previously studied this
issue](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/articles/full-cost-opioid-crisis-2-5-trillion-four-years/)
and came up with a smaller number. The primary reasons are because it
did not include the cost of reduced quality of life and because the
number of deaths in 2015 was 33,000.

## Details

Our cost estimates are based on a [2017 CDC
study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8091480/) which we have
updated to account for inflation and the sharp rise in opioid deaths and
opioid use disorder (OUD) since then. According to the DEA, an estimated
[74,702 Americans
died](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2024/20240515.htm)
in 2023, a staggering 1.6 times more than in 2017. Additionally, the
number of Americans living with OUD increased by 2.7 times to [5.7
million](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/reports/rpt47095/National%20Report/National%20Report/2023-nsduh-annual-national.pdf)
during the same period. We have adjusted the calculations to reflect
current prices as well as the alarming rise in opioid addiction and
deaths. We scale up the loss of life estimates based on the increase in
fatalities, while we scale up the other estimates to reflect the
increase in the prevalence of those living with OUD. The breakdown of
the cost estimates, all expressed in December 2024 dollars, is as
follows:

-   **Loss of life:** $1.11 trillion. This estimate is calculated by
    multiplying the number of lives lost (74,702) by the value of
    statistical life in the United States and then adding productivity
    and healthcare costs that arise due to opioid fatalities. We
    inflation adjusted the $10.1 million value of a statistical life
    number provided by [NIH
    (2017)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8091480/) to 2025
    dollars ($13.0 million per life). The value of a loss of life is
    based on market and survey based evidence on what amount of money
    people are willing to forgo to change the probability of death. For
    example, many estimates rely on the value of life implied by the
    increase in wages required for people to take jobs with higher
    mortality risk.
-   **Loss of quality of life:** $1.34 trillion. This estimate is the
    product of three factors. First is a survey-based measure for the
    loss in quality of life for individuals with opioid use disorder
    (OUD) compared to those in full health. The measure shows that life
    with OUD has about 60 percent (0.626) of the quality of life of
    those in full health. Second is a measure of how much Americans
    value a year of life in full health. Adjusted for inflation, this
    value is estimated at $624,410 per person per year. Together these
    values imply that the lost quality of life costs $234,478 per year
    for each person living with OUD. We then multiply this value by the
    prevalence of OUD, estimated to be 5.7 million in 2023.
-   **Healthcare system:** $107 billion. This estimate represents [the
    additional annual costs
    incurred](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27623005/) by the
    healthcare system for treating individuals with opioid use disorder
    (OUD) relative to the average annual costs of treating those without
    OUD. This amounts to $19,000 additional dollars per year per person
    with OUD. These costs were primarily borne by private insurers,
    Medicaid, and hospitals providing uncompensated care. Ultimately,
    these costs are passed on to all Americans through higher insurance
    premiums, taxes, and healthcare expenses.
-   **Loss of labor force productivity:** $107 billion. This estimate is
    calculated by multiplying the number of productive work hours lost
    due to opioid-related deaths, OUD, and incarceration by the average
    hourly total compensation (wages and benefits) for American workers.
-   **Crime-related:** $63 billion. This figure represents the sum of
    costs incurred for additional police protection, judicial
    activities, correctional facilities, and property loss resulting
    from opioid-related crime.

## Conclusion

The enormous economic cost of the illicit opioid epidemic to Americans,
estimated at $2.7 trillion in 2023 alone, underscores the urgent need to
control the flow of lethal drugs pouring in from foreign countries. The
human suffering and financial burden inflicted by this epidemic are
unsustainable.
