title: Another Democrat Lawmaker Roots Against American Success
---
 
Today, disgraced Rep. Eugene Vindman
[said](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1897691211009229292) he is
“hard pressed to think of a worse 45 days” in American history than the
first six weeks of President Donald J. Trump’s second term.

What a stupid, moronic statement.

According to Vindman, there is nothing “worse” than [record
low](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/illegal-crossings-plunge-to-levels-not-seen-in-decades-amid-trump-crackdown/)
illegal border crossings,
[getting](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/president-trump-is-removing-killers-rapists-and-drug-dealers-from-our-streets/)
killers and rapists off the streets,
[freeing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/president-trump-is-leading-with-peace-through-strength/#:~:text=President%20Trump%20secured,Trump%20to%2011.)
American hostages,
[protecting](https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ncaa-officially-bans-trans-athletes-from-womens-sports-1-day-after-trump-signs-executive-order)
women and girls,
[securing](https://www.dailysignal.com/2025/03/04/trump-3-trillion-investment-american-economy/)
“$3 trillion in investments and trade commitments,”
[saving](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/president-trump-is-making-government-work-for-you-again/)
taxpayers billions of dollars in wasteful spending,
[pursuing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/president-trump-is-leading-with-peace-through-strength/)
world peace, and
[capturing](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-states-arrests-isis-k-attack-planner-role-killing-us-military-service-members-abbey)
terrorists.

Vindman has a terminal case of Trump Derangement Syndrome — and it
shows.

According to this moron, there's nothing worse than record low illegal
border crossings, freeing hostages, securing ~$2T in U.S. investment,
pursuing world peace, restoring gov't transparency… <a
