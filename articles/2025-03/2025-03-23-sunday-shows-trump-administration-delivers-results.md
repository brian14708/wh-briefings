---
 
This morning, officials from the Trump Administration took to the
airwaves to update the American people on [another week of
success](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/week-nine-wins-president-trump-puts-america-first/)
— from reforming education to ensuring the safety and security of the
American people.

**Here’s what you missed:**

#### **Secretary of Education Linda McMahon on State of the Union**

-   [On the Trump Administration’s goal for
    education](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1903803492914823331):
    “Our goal is to make sure that we are providing the best education
    for students in our country. We cannot be last in the world in
    education … It is up to us and our responsibility to make sure we
    are giving them the best access to education.”
-   [On local control in
    education](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1903803139913896185):
    “Am I, the secretary of education sitting in Washington, going to
    have a view into a school room where a teacher is trying to take
    care of a student with special needs? Or is that going to happen
    better at the local level?”
-   [On school
    choice](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1903800569304658104):
    “\[President Trump\] wants to make sure that there is equal access
    to quality education for every student in our country — which is why
    he is such a proponent of school choice … He doesn’t believe that
    ANY child should be trapped in a failing school.”

#### **Attorney General Pam Bondi on Fox News Sunday**

-   [On overreach by activist
    judges](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1903813318189408610):
    “This is an out-of-control judge … trying to control our entire
    foreign policy, and he cannot do it… There are 261 reasons why
    Americans are safer today, and that’s because those people are now
    in an El Salvador prison … We are going to follow the law and we are
    going to protect Americans.”

#### **National Security Advisor Mike Waltz on Face the Nation**

-   [On strikes against Houthi terrorists in
    Yemen](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1898768890869555342):
    “75% of our U.S.-flagged shipping now has to go around the southern
    coast of Africa rather than going through the Suez Canal. Keeping
    the sea lanes open, keeping trade and commerce open, is a
    fundamental aspect of our national security. The last administration
    was not effective. The Trump Administration and President Trump have
    decided to do something much harder, much tougher.”
-   [On Iran’s nuclear
    program](https://grabien.com/file/getmedia?id=2856224&key=97c74d2c46994fc28a52b02c7ade2377&userid=17087):
    “Iran has to give up its program in a way that the entire world can
    see. As President Trump has said, this is coming to a head. All
    options are on the table, and it is time for Iran to walk away
    completely from its desire to have a nuclear weapon.”

#### **Special Envoy Steve Witkoff on Fox News Sunday**

-   [On talks to end the war in
    Ukraine](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1903820461185671587):
    “I’m not sure how anyone would expect an end to a conflict when
    you’re not communicating … \[President Trump’s\] philosophy of peace
    through strength brings people to the table to clear up
    misconceptions and to get peace deals done.”

#### **Border Czar Tom Homan on This Week**

-   [On deporting illegal immigrant Tren de Aragua gang
    members](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1898732852054786191):
    “We’re actually using the laws on the books to enforce immigration
    law and secure the border … We’re not making this up. Everything
    we’ve done is based on a statute that was enacted by Congress and
    signed by a president.”
-   [On illegal border
    crossings](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1903817159647564164):
    “We’ll use these assets as long as we can until we get to the point
    that we have total operational control of the border and national
    security threats have no avenue into this country.”
