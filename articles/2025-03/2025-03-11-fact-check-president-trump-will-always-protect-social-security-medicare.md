title: 'FACT CHECK: President Trump Will Always Protect Social Security, Medicare'
---
 
The Trump Administration will not cut Social Security, Medicare, or
Medicaid benefits. President Trump himself has [said
it](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1898754137161965642)
([over](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1892045754178420930) and
[over](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1887955364349358383) and
[over](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1894802469445591437) again).

Elon Musk didn’t say that, either. Fake Sherman is [lying
again](https://x.com/JakeSherman/status/1899377148718116889).

Here is Musk’s [direct
quote](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1899429354804806052): *“The
**waste and fraud** in entitlement spending — which is most of the
federal spending is entitlements — so, that’s, like, the big one to
eliminate. That’s the, sort of **half-trillion, maybe $6-700 billion a
year.**”*

And he’s exactly right.

-   **FACT:** The U.S. Government Accountability Office
    [estimates](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-105833) taxpayers
    lose as much as $521 billion annually to fraud — and [most of
    that](https://www.gao.gov/blog/federal-government-made-236-billion-improper-payments-last-fiscal-year)
    is within entitlement programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid.
-   **FACT:** Over the past two decades, the federal government has made
    an estimated $2.7 trillion in “improper payments” — the
    [majority](https://www.gao.gov/blog/federal-government-made-236-billion-improper-payments-last-fiscal-year#:~:text=More%20than%20%24175%20billion%20(74%25)%20of%20errors%20were%20overpayments%E2%80%94for%20example%2C%20payments%20to%20deceased%20individuals%20or%20those%20no%20longer%20eligible%20for%20government%20programs)
    of which come in the form of “payments to deceased individuals or
    those who no longer \[are\] eligible for government programs.”
-   **FACT:** The Social Security Administration
    [made](https://oig.ssa.gov/news-releases/2024-08-19-ig-reports-nearly-72-billion-improperly-paid-recommended-improvements-go-unimplemented/#:~:text=From%20FYs%202015%20through%202022,overpayment%20balance%20of%20%2423%20billion.)
    an estimated $72 billion in improper payments between 2015 and 2022.
-   **FACT:** The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
    [estimated](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/fiscal-year-2024-improper-payments-fact-sheet)
    it made $140+ billion in improper payments in 2024 alone.

What kind of a person doesn’t support eliminating waste, fraud, and
abuse in government spending that ultimately costs taxpayers more?
