In the latest indication of success from President Donald J. Trump’s
unprecedented effort to secure the homeland, the *Los Angeles
Times *[writes](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-03-30/with-few-migrants-arriving-at-california-mexico-border-nonprofits-border-patrol-pivot) that
“migrant crossings have slowed to near a halt” along the

**From
the **[**article**](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-03-30/with-few-migrants-arriving-at-california-mexico-border-nonprofits-border-patrol-pivot)**:**

“But migrant crossings have slowed to a near halt, bringing a striking
change to the landscape along the southernmost stretch of California.

migrants waited for processing are barren, and nonprofits have begun

facing deportation, or migrants stuck in southern Mexico.

\[…\]

Border Patrol agents in the San Diego sector are now making about 30 to
40 arrests per day, according to the agency. That’s down from more than
1,200 per day during the height of migrant arrivals to the region in
April.”
