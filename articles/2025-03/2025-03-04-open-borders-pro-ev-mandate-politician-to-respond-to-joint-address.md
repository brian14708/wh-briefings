title: Open Borders, Pro EV Mandate Politician to Respond to Joint Address
---
 
Elissa Slotkin will respond to President Donald J. Trump’s Joint Address
to Congress tonight. Senator Slotkin stands opposed to President Trump’s
agenda to lower costs, bring back manufacturing, and secure our borders.

Slotkin voted against overturning Biden’s tailpipe emissions rule, a
rule that would force automakers to sell more electric vehicles, killing
auto manufacturing jobs. President Trump stood up for American consumers
and autoworkers and
[repealed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/initial-rescissions-of-harmful-executive-orders-and-actions/)
this de facto electric vehicle mandate.

-   Slotkin [voted](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2024438?Page=9)
    against congressional disapproval of Biden’s EPA rule seeking to
    limit tailpipe emissions.
    -   The House Budget Committee
        [called](https://budget.house.gov/press-release/bidens-new-epa-tailpipe-rule-penalizes-american-energy-independence)
        the regulation “a de facto ban on the sale of gas-powered and
        traditional hybrid vehicles.”
    -   Research shows that EV mandates would kill thousands of jobs:

            Institute](https://americafirstpolicy.com/issues/new-report-exposes-biden-harriss-proposed-ev-mandates-to-cost-200000-american-jobs):
            New Report Exposes Biden-Harris’s Proposed EV Mandates to
            Cost 200,000 American Jobs
            -   “The Midwest will suffer the most, with Michigan
                (-37,000), Indiana (-24,000), and Ohio (-21,000) facing
                the highest job losses.”
-   A UAW [study](https://archive.ph/KFp4s#selection-5987.1-5987.179)
    from 2019 projected that EVs would kill 35,000 jobs at its plants.

Slotkin has repeatedly voted for open borders. President Trump has moved
swiftly to secure our borders with attempted crossings in February at
the lowest number
[ever](https://cbsaustin.com/news/nation-world/trump-administrations-immigration-crackdown-leads-to-historic-low-border-apprehensions)
recorded.

-   In May 2023, Slotkin [voted](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2023209)
    against the H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act.
-   In February 2019, Slotkin
    [voted](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/201994) to terminate President
    Trump’s declaration of an emergency at the southern border.
    -   In March 2019, Slotkin again
        [voted](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2019127) again to
        terminate the declaration in an attempt to override President
        Trump’s veto.
-   In July 2024, Slotkin
    [voted](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2024400?Page=2) against a
    resolution “Strongly condemning the Biden Administration and its
    Border Czar, Kamala Harris’s, failure to secure the United States
    border.”
-   Slotkin
    [said](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2019/01/16/government-shutdown-elissa-slotkin/2594926002/),
    “I don’t believe that anyone really thinks a wall from sea to
    shining sea is needed to make us safer.”

**Slotkin is just another out-of-touch politician that wants to hollow
out American manufacturing and let criminals flood into our
communities.**
