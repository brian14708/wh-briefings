title: "Trump Administration\u2019s Actions Made Houthi Terrorists Pay"
---
 
Democrats and their media allies have seemingly forgotten that President
Donald J. Trump and his National Security team successfully killed
terrorists who have targeted U.S. troops and disrupted one of the most
consequential shipping routes in the world. **This is a coordinated
effort to distract from the successful actions taken by President Trump
and his administration to make America’s enemies pay and keep Americans
safe.**

The Biden Administration sat back as a band of pirates — with
precision-guided, Iran-provided weaponry — exacted a toll system in one
of the most important shipping lanes in the world.

In fact, since 2023, Houthi terrorists
[attacked](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1901286204701884540)
U.S. Navy warships 174 times and attacked commercial shipping vessels
145 times — and as a result, 75% of U.S.-flagged shipping has been
[forced](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1903821767392588178) to
navigate the southern coast of Africa rather than through the Suez
Canal.  
**Biden’s weakness invited these unacceptable attacks — while President
Trump put these terrorists on notice:**

    the Houthis as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.

    successful, large-scale strikes against the Houthis, eliminating
    senior terrorists within the organization and putting the world on
    notice.

The Trump Administration’s actions to hold the Houthis accountable has
been a massive success — and nothing can distract from that unrelenting
action to keep Americans safe.
