title: "President Trump is Undoing Biden\u2019s Economic Damage"
---
 
President Donald J. Trump took office on a promise to lower costs for
the American people — and the actions he has taken are already paying
off while the work continues to turn back the economic plague unleashed
by the Biden Administration.

-   President Trump [put into
    action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/02/icymi-secretary-brooke-rollins-outlines-plan-to-lower-egg-prices/)
    a comprehensive plan to lower egg prices.
-   President
    Trump [directed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/delivering-emergency-price-relief-for-american-families-and-defeating-the-cost-of-living-crisis/) the
    heads of all executive departments and agencies to “deliver
    emergency price relief … to the American people and increase the
    prosperity of the American worker.”
-   President
    Trump [established](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-establishes-the-national-energy-dominance-council/) the
    National Energy Dominance Council to maximize use of the U.S.’
    extensive energy resources — thereby enabling lower energy prices.
    -   Crude oil prices
        have [fallen](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/crude-oil) over
        5% since President Trump took office.
-   The Trump Administration postponed burdensome Biden-era efficiency
    standard rules for the following appliances, saving American
    consumers large sums:
    -   Central air conditioners: Biden rules were slated
        to [make](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/consumer-group-exposes-costs-biden-admins-war-home-appliances) air
        conditioners $1,100 more expensive.
    -   Gas water heaters: Biden rules were slated
        to [make](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/consumer-group-exposes-costs-biden-admins-war-home-appliances) water
        heaters $2,800 more expensive.
    -   Gas stoves: Biden rules were slated to
        [make](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/consumer-group-exposes-costs-biden-admins-war-home-appliances)
        stoves $3,250 more expensive.
    -   Clothes washers and dryers: Biden rules were slated
        to [make](https://x.com/for_consumers/status/1717545440600621271/photo/1) washers
        $200 more expensive.
    -   Light bulbs: Biden rules were slated
        to [make](https://x.com/for_consumers/status/1717545440600621271/photo/1) light
        bulbs $140 more expensive.
-   The Trump Administration is
    [requiring](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-launches-massive-10-to-1-deregulation-initiative/)
    agencies to identify at least ten existing rules or regulations to
    be repealed for every one new rule or regulation they promulgate —
    putting the country on track to severely reduce costs for everyday
    Americans.
    -   In 2023, the total cost of federal regulations was a
        record-breaking $2.1 trillion, or $15,788 per U.S.
        household, [according to one
        analysis](https://cei.org/citations/2-1-trillion-hidden-tax-cost-of-federal-regulations-hit-record-high-in-2023-report-says/)
        — while another
        [found](https://nam.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Regulations-Exec-Summary.pdf) the
        cost of federal regulations was even greater at $3.079 trillion
        in 2022.
-   President Trump directed the Department of Government Efficiency
    (DOGE) to root out bureaucratic waste — and within weeks, it has
    already [saved](https://doge.gov/savings) taxpayers billions of
    dollars.
-   The Trump Administration eliminated the overbearing Biden-era
    electric vehicle mandate by resetting Corporate Average Fuel Economy
    (CAFE) standards.
    -   NBER economist Mark R. Jacobsen
        [estimates](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26309/w26309.pdf) that
        “a one-mpg increase in CAFE standards costs consumers of all
        income levels approximately 0.5% of their income in the first
        year of the increase. By the 10th year following the increase,
        however, this cost becomes regressive, as the increase drives up
        the price of used cars. A one-mpg increase in CAFE standards
        costs consumers earning less than $25,000 per year 1.12% of
        their income, but only costs consumers earning more than $75,000
        per year 0.41% of their income.”
