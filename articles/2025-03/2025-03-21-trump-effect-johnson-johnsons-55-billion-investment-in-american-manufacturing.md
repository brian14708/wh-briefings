Today, Johnson & Johnson
[announced](https://www.jnj.com/media-center/press-releases/johnson-johnson-increases-u-s-investment-to-more-than-55-billion-over-the-next-four-years)
a new $55 billion investment in the United States over the next four
years in manufacturing, research and development, and technology — the
latest massive victory in President Donald J. Trump’s [unrelenting
pursuit](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/president-trump-is-remaking-america-into-a-manufacturing-superpower/)
of American manufacturing dominance.

The company
[said](https://www.jnj.com/media-center/press-releases/johnson-johnson-increases-u-s-investment-to-more-than-55-billion-over-the-next-four-years#:~:text=25%25%20increase%20in%20investment%20compared%20to%20the%20previous%20four%20years%20and%20builds%20upon%20the%20Company%E2%80%99s%20already%20elevated%20U.S.%20investment%20levels%20resulting%20from%20the%20passage%20of%20the%202017%20Tax%20Cuts%20%26%20Jobs%20Act.)
it represents a “25% increase in investment compared to the previous
four years” and builds on their “already elevated U.S. investment levels
resulting from the passage of the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act” under
