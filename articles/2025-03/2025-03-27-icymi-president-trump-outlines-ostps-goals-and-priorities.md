title: "ICYMI: President Trump Outlines OSTP\u2019s Goals and Priorities"
---
 
**In case you missed it**, President Trump signed a letter to Assistant
to the President and OSTP Director Michael Kratsios outlining the road
ahead to the Golden Age of American Innovation.  
   
The President outlined three main goals:

-   How can the United States secure its position as the unrivaled world
    leader in critical and emerging technologies — such as artificial
    intelligence, quantum information science, and nuclear technology —
    maintaining our advantage over potential adversaries?

<!-- -->

-   How can we revitalize America’s science and technology enterprise –
    pursuing truth, reducing administrative burdens, and empowering
    researchers to achieve groundbreaking discoveries?

<!-- -->

-   How can we ensure that scientific progress and technological
    innovation fuel economic growth and better the lives of all
    Americans?

President Trump writes, “now, after 4 long years of weakness and
complacency, we must set our sights even higher. I am calling upon you
to blaze a trail to the next frontiers of science. We have the
opportunity to cement America’s global technological leadership and
usher in the Golden Age of American Innovation. We are not just
competing with other nations; we are seeking, striving, fighting to make
America greater than ever before.”

“by accelerating U.S. tech leadership, restoring our scientific
enterprise, and promoting opportunity for all Americans, we will usher
in a Golden Age of innovation. When FDR gave his science advisor
Vannevar Bush a mandate to chart a course for U.S. research and
development, American boots soon left their mark on the moon. Today,
with President Trump’s agenda for American science and technology, we
will achieve future triumphs and explore new frontiers. “
