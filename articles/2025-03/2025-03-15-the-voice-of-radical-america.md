title: The Voice of Radical America

President Donald J. Trump’s [executive
order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/continuing-the-reduction-of-the-federal-bureaucracy/) on
Friday will ensure that taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical
propaganda.

Dan Robinson, a 34-year veteran of Voice of America and its former White
House correspondent, [wrote last
year](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/nov/27/voice-america-global-media-agency-rightly-budget-c/):
“I have monitored the agency’s bureaucracy along with many of its
reporters and concluded that it has essentially become a hubris-filled
rogue operation often reflecting a leftist bias aligned with partisan
national media. It has sought to avoid accountability for violations of
journalistic standards and mismanagement.”

-   Voice of America’s
    management [told](https://www.nationalreview.com/2023/10/voice-of-america-staff-ordered-not-to-call-hamas-terrorists/) staff
    not to call Hamas and its members terrorists, “except when quoting
    statements.”
-   [Daily
    Caller](https://dailycaller.com/2019/07/28/voice-of-america-trump-reporters/):
    “Multiple Voice Of America Reporters Have Posted Anti-Trump Content
    On Social Media”
    -   “Multiple Voice of America (VOA) reporters have repeatedly
        posted anti-Trump comments on their professional Twitter
        accounts, despite a social media policy requiring employee
        impartiality on social media platforms.”
-   Rep. Scott
    Perry [wrote](https://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Rep.-Perry-3.25.22-Letter-to-USAGM-FINAL.pdf) in
    a 2022 letter that Voice of America has “grown exceedingly partisan
    over the past several years.”
    -   A 2016 report from Office of Personnel Management cited by Rep.
        Perry revealed that Voice of America Persian employees said that
        outlet tolerated “coercion for partisan political purposes.”

        Beacon](https://freebeacon.com/media/voa-misallocates-funds-and-suppresses-negative-stories-about-iran-this-lawmaker-wants-to-investigate/)*:
        “VOA Misallocates Funds and Suppresses Negative Stories About
        Iran. This Lawmaker Wants To Investigate.”
-   [Voice of
    America](https://www.voanews.com/a/usa_race-america_what-white-privilege-and-whom-does-it-help/6191291.html):
    “What Is ‘White Privilege’ and Whom Does It Help?”
    -   “Today, the phrase is used passionately and widely in the
        context of racial profiling — police treatment of people as
        criminal suspects based on their race.”
-   A
    2022 [lawsuit](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/03/27/exclusive-watchdog-sues-voice-of-america-news-for-alleged-anti-american-pro-islamist-reporting/) claimed
    Voice of America has “been infiltrated by anti-American, pro-Islamic
    state interests, and that the message of VOA had been compromised in
    a manner that was biased toward the Islamic state factions in Iran.”
-   In October 2020, Voice of
    America [wrote](https://www.voanews.com/a/2020-usa-votes_trump-campaign-focuses-hunter-biden-emails-october-surprise/6197711.html) that
    the “allegations that Russia played a role in perpetuating the
    scandal to benefit Trump could undermine the emails’ credibility”
    downplaying the validity of the Hunter Biden laptop story.
-   In July 2020, Voice of America
    faced [criticism](https://www.foxnews.com/media/taxpayer-funded-voa-sharing-biden-video) for
    “sharing a story and video appearing too favorable to presumptive
    Democratic nominee Joe Biden.”
-   In September 2019, the Daily
    Caller [reported](https://dailycaller.com/2019/09/02/voice-of-america-former-russian-propagandist/) that
    Voice of America employed a Russian anti-U.S. propagandist.
-   In May 2019, Voice of
    America [fired](https://freebeacon.com/national-security/voa-fires-two-more-reporters-for-chinese-dissident-interview/) reporters
    for their roles in canceling a broadcast midstream after pressure
    from the Chinese government.
-   In March 2019, Voice of America ran
    a [segment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN78g2MpboE) about
    transgender migrants seeking asylum in the United States.
