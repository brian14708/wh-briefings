title: President Trump Positions U.S. as Global Superpower in Manufacturing
---
 
Nvidia, the world’s undisputed leader in chipmaking,
[says](https://www.ft.com/content/3fd3a717-2fbf-42ef-bb08-5baecdeb1985)
it will invest hundreds of billions of dollars over the next four years
on its U.S.-based manufacturing operations — part of the manufacturing
renaissance under President Donald J. Trump as he solidifies the U.S. as
the global leader in artificial intelligence.

**“Having the support of an administration who cares about the success
of this industry and not allowing energy to be an obstacle is a
phenomenal result for AI in the U.S.,”** [said Nvidia CEO Jensen
Huang](https://www.ft.com/content/3fd3a717-2fbf-42ef-bb08-5baecdeb1985#:~:text=%E2%80%9CHaving%20the%20support%20of%20an%20administration%20who%20cares%20about%20the%20success%20of%20this%20industry%20and%20not%20allowing%20energy%20to%20be%20an%20obstacle%20is%20a%20phenomenal%20result%20for%20AI%20in%20the%20US%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said.).

**Here’s what they’re saying:**

-   [**Axios**](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/20/nvidia-spend-hundreds-billions-us-during-trump-term)**:**
    “It’s another win for President Trump’s push to increase U.S.
    manufacturing, with a parade of corporations announcing American
    expansion.”
-   [***The
    Guardian***](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/20/nvidia-us-manufacturing-ceo-jensen-huang-donald-trump)**:**
    “Chipmaker’s promise is a sign that Trump’s ‘America First’ policy
    is affecting investment”
-   [**Financial
    Times**](https://www.ft.com/content/3fd3a717-2fbf-42ef-bb08-5baecdeb1985)**:**
    “The huge spending projection from the world’s most valuable
    semiconductor group follows multibillion-dollar US investment plans
    announced by other technology companies including Apple, as the
    impact of Trump’s ‘America First’ trade policies ripples through the
    global economy.”
-   [**Yahoo
    Finance**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-considers-massive-us-supply-113944497.html)**:**
    “…the latest company to consider plans to expand in the country as
    the Trump administration pushes forward with tariffs.”

**That’s in addition to the trillions of dollars in new investments
President Trump has [already
secured](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/president-trump-is-remaking-america-into-a-manufacturing-superpower/)
in tech-based manufacturing.** In January, President
Trump [announced](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-announces-major-ai-infrastructure-investment) a
$500 billion private investment in AI infrastructure led by OpenAI,
Oracle, and Softbank, while Apple
[announced](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/) a
$500 billion investment and
TSMC [announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/another-historic-investment-secured-under-president-trump/) a
$100 billion investment in chips manufacturing last month.

**It goes well beyond tech as companies make plans to onshore their
operations amid President Trump’s America First trade policy.** This
week, a Canadian furniture manufacturer
[opted](https://www.furnituretoday.com/tariffs/furniture-manufacturer-shuts-down-canadian-operations-moves-production-to-n-carolina/)
to move its production to the U.S., while the biggest toymaker in the
U.S.
[said](https://nypost.com/2025/03/13/business/uss-biggest-toy-maker-cra-z-art-to-expand-domestic-factories/)
it will move a “large percentage” of its China-based manufacturing back
home.

In the auto sector,
Stellantis [announced](https://apnews.com/article/stellantis-uaw-union-illinois-trump-c61f162889384fc7e1337dd5613692d6) a
$5 billion investment in its U.S. manufacturing network as it
[pledges](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/stellantis-pledges-more-american-cars-thanks-trump-one-month-tariff-exemption-2025-03-06/) to
build more vehicles domestically, Hyundai Motor

“localize production in the U.S,” Nissan
is [considering](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/top-automaker-could-move-some-production-out-mexico-amid-trump-tariff-talks-ceo-says) moving
production from Mexico to the U.S., and Honda
is [expected](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/honda-produce-next-civic-indiana-not-mexico-due-us-tariffs-sources-say-2025-03-03/) to
produce its next-generation Civic hybrid model in Indiana.

The [list of manufacturing

is endless.
