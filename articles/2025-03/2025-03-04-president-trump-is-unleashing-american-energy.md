title: President Trump is Unleashing American Energy
---
 
President Donald J. Trump knows American energy is the cornerstone of
the American advantage — and that having efficient, reliable, and
affordable energy is the key to American security.

-   President
    Trump [declared](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-energy-emergency/) a
    National Energy Emergency to unlock America’s full energy potential
    and bring down costs for American families.
-   The U.S. is now the
    [largest](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1890509566728683823)
    net exporter of natural gas in the world.
-   President
    Trump [established](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-establishes-the-national-energy-dominance-council/) the
    National Energy Dominance Council to maximize use of America’s
    extensive energy resources.
-   President
    Trump [rescinded](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/the-first-100-hours-historic-action-to-kick-off-americas-golden-age/) every
    one of the Biden Administration’s job-killing, pro-China,
    anti-American energy regulations.
-   President
    Trump [terminated](https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/01/remarks-by-president-trump-at-the-world-economic-forum/) the
    job-killing “Green New Scam.”
-   President
    Trump [withdrew](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/putting-america-first-in-international-environmental-agreements/) from
    the disastrous Paris Climate Agreement, which unfairly ripped off
    our country.
-   President
    Trump [paused](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/temporary-withdrawal-of-all-areas-on-the-outer-continental-shelf-from-offshore-wind-leasing-and-review-of-the-federal-governments-leasing-and-permitting-practices-for-wind-projects/) federal
    permitting for massive wind farms, which degrade our natural
    landscapes and fail to serve American consumers.
-   President
    Trump [reversed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-alaskas-extraordinary-resource-potential/) bureaucratic
    regulations that impeded Alaska’s ability to develop its vast
    natural resources.
-   President
    Trump [re-opened](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1890507745486406108) 625
    million acres for offshore drilling, which Biden banned in his
    waning days, in order to “drill, baby, drill.”
-   President
    Trump [scrapped](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/) an
    Obama-era rule on greenhouse gases.
-   President
    Trump [ended](https://www.energy.gov/articles/us-department-energy-reverses-biden-lng-pause-restores-trump-energy-dominance-agenda) the
    Liquefied Natural Gas pause
    and [approved](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-14/trump-to-approve-gas-export-project-after-lifting-biden-s-pause) the
    first LNG project since the Biden Administration banned them last
    year.
