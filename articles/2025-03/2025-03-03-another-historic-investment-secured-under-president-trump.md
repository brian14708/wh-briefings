title: Another Historic Investment Secured Under President Trump
---
 
Today, President Donald J. Trump joined Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company (TSMC) CEO C.C. Wei to
[announce](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1896648385542963549) a
historic $100 billion investment by TSMC in its Arizona-based
semiconductor chips manufacturing operation — the largest foreign direct
investment in U.S. history.

-   [**President
    Trump**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1896648385542963549):
    “This $100 billion in new investment will go into building five
    cutting-edge fabrication facilities in the great state that we just
    discussed, Arizona, and will create thousands of jobs — many
    thousands of jobs, and they’re high-paying jobs. In total, today’s
    announcement brings Taiwan Semiconductor’s investment to about $165
    billion.”
-   [**TSMC CEO C.C.
    Wei**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1896651175388389764):
    “It’s going to create thousands of high-paying jobs … We are going
    to produce many chips to support AI’s progress and to support the
    smartphone’s progress. I want to thank President Trump again for his
    support.”
-   [**Secretary of Commerce Howard
    Lutnick**](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1896650482749489551)**:**
    “President Trump has made it a fundamental objective to bring
    semiconductor chip manufacturing home to America … You’re seeing the
    power of Donald Trump’s presidency because TSMC, the greatest
    manufacturer of chips in the world, is coming to America with a $100
    billion investment.”

Since taking office, President Trump has secured nearly $2 trillion in
U.S.-based investment — and the best is yet to come.
