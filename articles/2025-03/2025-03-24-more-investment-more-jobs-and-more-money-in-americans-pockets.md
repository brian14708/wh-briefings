Today, Hyundai
[announced](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/24/south-korea-hyundai-us-investment.html)

for a [new steel
plant](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1904240895488078062) in
Louisiana, which will create nearly 1,500 jobs. The investment, which
builds on Hyundai’s
[pledge](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/hyundai-motor-q4-profit-falls-17-discounts-weigh-2025-01-23/)
