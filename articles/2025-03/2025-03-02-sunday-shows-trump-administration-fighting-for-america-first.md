title: 'SUNDAY SHOWS: Trump Administration Fighting for America First'
---
 
This morning, the Trump Administration was out in force across the TV
networks as they updated the American people on President Trump’s
agenda.

**Here’s what you missed:**

**Secretary of State Marco Rubio on ABC This Week**

-   [On negotiations to end the war in
    Ukraine](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1896223336755236941):
    “The sooner everyone grows up around here and figures out that this
    is a bad war that’s heading in a bad direction… the more progress
    we’re going to be able to make. But the president is crystal clear…
    he is going to be a president that tries to achieve peace.”
-   [On President Trump’s desire for
    peace](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-3-2-25-secretary-state-marco/story?id=119332903):
    “Shouldn’t we all be happy that we have a president who’s trying to
    stop wars and prevent them instead of start them? And I just don’t
    get it. I really don’t, other than the fact that it’s Donald J.
    Trump. If this was a Democrat that was doing this, everyone would be
    saying, well, he’s on his way to the Nobel Peace Prize. This is
    absurd. We are trying to end a war. You cannot end a war unless both
    sides come to the table, starting with the Russians. And – and that
    – that is the point the president has made.”

**National Security Advisor Mike Waltz on State of the Union**

-   [On the Oval Office meeting between President Trump and
    Zelenskyy](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1896212022641254592):
    “It was not clear Zelenskyy was going to go to negotiations at all —
    that he would ever be able to negotiate with Putin and whether he
    shared our goal of ending this war… This was a huge missed
    opportunity for him and for his country.”

**Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick on Sunday Morning Futures**

-   [On President Trump delivering
    results](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1896219981106565150):
    “We’ve had the lowest crossings ever, ever, under Donald Trump
    because of his ability to negotiate with Canada and Mexico.”

**Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on Fox News Sunday**

-   [On the danger of continuing the war in
    Ukraine:](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1896214224462020693)
    “The longer this goes on, not only are more Ukrainians losing their
    lives, but it increases the potential of this escalation towards
    World War III … That’s not a cost that President Trump is willing to
    accept.”

**Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent on Face the Nation**

-   [On rebuilding the
    economy](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1896228245659361353):
    “President Trump’s been in office five weeks… interest rates — the
    10-year bond… have been down every week since President Trump was
    President. Mortgage rates have been down every week. So, that’s a
    pretty good start.”

**Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Media Buzz**

-   [On cameras being able to witness President Trump’s Oval Office
    meeting with
    Ukraine](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1896267282105372721):
    “President Trump is the most transparent president in history. And
    as he said, it was great for the cameras to be in there because the
    American people — and the world — were able to see what the
    president and his team have seen behind the scenes in negotiating
    with President Zelenskyy’s team. They have continually denied the
    pragmatic reality of where their country stands today.”
