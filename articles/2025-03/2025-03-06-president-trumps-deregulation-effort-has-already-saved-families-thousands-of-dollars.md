  \ of Dollars"

**TO:** WHITE HOUSE COMMS STAFF  
**FROM:** CEA STAFF  
**SUBJECT:** PRESIDENT TRUMP SAVES AMERICAN FAMILIES $2,100 EACH BY
HALTING COSTLY BIDEN REGULATIONS

**<span style="text-decoration: underline">Summary</span>**  
President Biden piled on nearly $2 trillion in new regulations over his
four years in office, dramatically increasing costs for everyday working
people and businesses — and left billions of dollars more in proposed
rules still in the pipeline. Upon taking office, President Trump
immediately blocked these proposed rules and has initiated an aggressive
deregulatory agenda that requires substantial cuts in existing
regulations for each new agency rule. President Trump is committed to
cutting senseless red tape that will lower costs, lead to higher growth,
and usher America into its Golden Age.

-   Since returning to office, President Trump has saved Americans over
    $180 billion, or $2,100 per family of four, by halting proposed
    Biden-era regulations.
-   The Biden Administration added more than $1.8 trillion, or $21,090
    per family of four, in new regulatory costs, far surpassing any
    other administration on record.
-   72% of these new regulatory burdens ($1.3 trillion or $15,457 per
    family of four) were the result of new EPA rules.
-   Rolling back just automobile-related rules will save consumers over
    $1.134 trillion.
-   In 2024, the Biden Administration set an all-time record by
    publishing 107,262 pages of final rules, proposed rules, and other
    public notices in the Federal Register.
-   This stands in stark contrast to President Trump, who recently
    announced a bold deregulation initiative that requires the
    elimination of ten existing rules or guidance documents for every
    new regulation.

-   **Among finalized Biden EPA rules, the following edicts were the
    most expensive:**

    -   Department of Health and Human Services
        -   $43.15 billion: New mandates for Medicare and Medicaid
            Programs, increased nursing staffing levels in nursing

-   **In addition to the expensive regulations highlighted above, the
    Biden Administration also excelled at producing ridiculous
    regulations:**
    -   [A U.S. Postal Service
        regulation](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/19/2025-02544/cremated-remains-packaging-requirements)
        “requiring mailers to solely use the Cremated Remains shipping
        supplies provided by the Postal Service when mailing human or
        animal cremated remains, also referred to as cremains or ashes,
        domestically or internationally.”
    -   [A Federal Trade Commission
        regulation](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/06/12/2024-12744/trade-regulation-rule-relating-to-power-output-claims-for-amplifiers-utilized-in-home-entertainment)
        “requiring manufacturers of home audio amplifiers making
        power-related claims to calculate power output using uniform
        testing methods to allow consumers to easily compare amplifier
        sound quality.
