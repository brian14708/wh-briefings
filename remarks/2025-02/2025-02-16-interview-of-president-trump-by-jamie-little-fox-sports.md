Daytona International Speedway  
Daytona, Florida

     Q    I’m joined now by the president of the United States.  Mr.
President, five years ago, we were standing in this very spot.   
  
     THE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.  
  
     Q    What brings you back to the “Great American Race”?

  
     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think it’s fantastic.  It’s great for the
country.  Our country is doing well again.  And we have spirit — all
over the world, there’s spirit again.  We brought it back, and it’s been
less than four weeks.  So, you’ll see what we do in — in a little period
of time, it’s going to only get better.  But this is very exciting.

  
     Q    You brought your granddaughter.   
  
     THE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.  Carolina.  
      
     Q    I know some of your other family members are here.  You get to
take a ride around in the Beast.   
  
     THE PRESIDENT:  I’m going to do that.  
  
     Q    What is that like?  
  
     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’ll let you know in about two minutes,
because it’s going to be — they’re going to be going quite quickly, I
understand.  
  
     Q    And you just got to meet some of the drivers.   
  
     THE PRESIDENT:  I did.  
  
     Q    Are you going to get on the radio again and talk to them
before the start of this?  
  
     THE PRESIDENT:  I’m going to talk to them.  And I say they have a
lot of courage doing this. I see it, and I’ve been here, and they have a
lot of guts, as they would say.  
  
     Q    Mr. President, enjoy your time.  
  
     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Great.
