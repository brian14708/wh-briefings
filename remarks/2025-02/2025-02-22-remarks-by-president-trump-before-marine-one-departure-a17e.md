South Lawn

1:35 P.M. EST

     THE PRESIDENT:  So, we had a lot of news over the last 24 hours. 
We had the hostages given back today.  It’s disgraceful what’s going on
there.  They’re not in great shape, but we’ve also seen them in worse
shape.  But the hostages — the six hostages were delivered by Hamas. 
What a terrible situation it is. 

I’m going now to make a speech at CPAC, so I think we’re going to
include a lot of your subjects.  And I know it’s going to be covered by
all of you.  And so, I’ll see you at CPAC.

How are you?
