REMARKS BY PRESIDENT TRUMP  
BEFORE MARINE ONE DEPARTURE

South Lawn

  
 9:10 A.M. EST  
   
     THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everybody.  Thank you very much.  Thank you
very much.  
   
So, we’re going to North Carolina.  It’s been a horrible thing the way
that’s been allowed to fester, and we’re going to get it fixed up — it
should have been done months ago — from the hurricane that took place
almost four months ago.   
   
North Carolina has been treated very badly, so we’re stopping there.   
   
And we’re going to then go to Los Angeles and take a look at a fire that
could have been put out if they let the water flow, but they didn’t let
the water flow.  And they still haven’t for whatever reason.   
   
     So, I think we’re going to have a very interesting time.  I think
many of you are going with us.  If you’d like to have a ride on the
plane, we’d love to give it to you.  
   
     Q    Mr. President, why did you invite Adam Schiff on your trip
given you called him “scum” earlier this week?  
   
     THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t know.  Is he — is he going?  Is he going?  
   
     Q    No.  
   
     THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t know.  I mean, I really don’t.  You know,
because if he’s going to be there, it would be cheaper,  but I didn’t
invite him.  Somebody did.  
   
     (Cross-talk.)  
   
     Q    Pete Hegseth — Pete Hegseth lost two Republican votes
yesterday.  Are you at all concerned about his prospects?  
   
     THE PRESIDENT:  Look, whatever it is, it is.  He’s a good man.  I
don’t know what’s going to happen; you never know in those things.  But
Pete is a very, very good man.  I hope he makes it.  I hope he makes
it.  
   
     I was very surprised that Collins and Murkowski would do that. 
And, of course, Mitch is always a “no” vote, I guess.  Is Mitch a “no”
vote?  How about Mitch?  
   
     Q    He hasn’t said yet.  
   
     THE PRESIDENT:  Huh?  He what?  
   
     Q    He hasn’t said yet.  
   
     THE PRESIDENT:  Let’s see what happens.  
   
     (Cross-talk.)  
   
     Q    The March for Life is today.  Sir, the March for Life.  Mr.
President, the March for Life, sir.  Mr. President, the March for Life. 
The March for Life is today.   
   
     THE PRESIDENT:  I did a big clip for the March for Life, and we
look forward to seeing it.  I’m going to be watching it.  And JD Vance,
our vice president, is there, and he’s going to be representing us very
well.  Taking place in a little while, and other than being a little bit
cold, it’s a beautiful day.  
   
     (Cross-talk.)  
   
     Q    How will your — Mr. President, how will your administration —
how will your administration protect —  
   
     Q    Mr. President, will you give Italy a break of tariffs?  
   
     Q    — sir, how will your administration protect pro-life of
Americans going forward?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, we’re all — we’re all for it.  In fact, as you know,
I just signed a pardon, and in the pardon, we released 23 people that
were unjustly put in having to do with pro-life.  And they will be
released, and they’ll be out very shortly.  It was disgraceful what
happened to them.  That was a persecution.  
   
(Cross-talk.)  
   
Q    Mr. President, will you give — will you give Italy a break on tax —
on tariffs, sir?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I like her very much.  Let’s see what happens.  
   
Have a good time.  (Inaudible.)
