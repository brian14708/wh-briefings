REMARKS BY PRESIDENT TRUMP  
DURING HURRICANE HELENE BRIEFING  
   
Airport Fire and Rescue Facility  
Fletcher, North Carolina

  
   
  11:34 A.M. EST  
  
     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much.  It’s a little cold
outside, but you’re getting used to the cold.  
  
And one of the things that are very important to me and one of the
reasons I’m happy that we won so convincingly is to help North Carolina
get fixed up.  They supported us in record numbers, and I’m supporting
them in record numbers too.

And they had me set — I wanted to go to Los Angeles and see what was
going on with California, why they aren’t releasing the water.  Millions
and millions of gallons of water, they’re sending it out to the
Pacific.  Someday, somebody’s going — going to explain that one.  In the
meantime, they have no water in Los Angeles, where they had the
problems.  
   
But — so, we’re going there.  But I said, “Well, what about North
Carolina?”  “Well, you could do that la-” — “no, I can’t.”  I said,
“We’re stopping in North Carolina first, and then we’re going to Los
Angeles.”  
   
And we just appreciate the outpouring of love that we’ve had here.   
   
Lara was, as you know, very instrumental in the campaign, and she lived
here and is loved, and we appreciate it.   
   
And Michael Whatley has been incredible — wherever Michael is — hello,
Michael.  Michael Whatley has been great.   
   
And your congressmen have been great.   
   
And what we thought we’d do is take a quick look around.  First, we
wanted to do this.   
   
I — I want to say that we’re very disappointed in FEMA.  Your new
governor, it’s not his fault.  He’s brand-new to the whole situation. 
But we’re going to work together with the governor.  We’re going to work
together with the — your senators, but, really, we’re going to work a
lot with your congressman, especially the three that are in the area,
and Michael Whatley.  And I’d like to put Michael in charge of making
sure everything goes well.   
   
And Franklin Graham has been unbelievable.  We’ve made a big
contribution to Franklin, and we’ll continue to do so.  But I — I’ve
been hearing nothing but praise for the job that Samaritan’s Purse has
done with Franklin, and we appreciate it.   
   
Where is Franklin?  He’s around here someplace.  (Laughter.)  And — that
good-looking guy.  He’s always been a good-looking guy.   
   
His father was a good-looking guy, too, I’ll tell you.  We loved his
father, right?  I saw his father in the latter years, and I said, “Well,
he — he doesn’t have long to go.”  He was having a hard time, and he
lived about three, four years after that, right?   
   
REVEREND GRAHAM:  That’s right.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  He — he was — they call — they say he was “good stock.” 
He had the ultimate good stock.   
   
But I want to thank you, Franklin.  You were — you’ve been fantastic
here.  And everywhere he goes, he — he’s always — he’s always the first
one I see.   
   
Does — people don’t realize it, how — how good it is.  A lot of people,
they go, “Well, maybe it’s for the people that he’s got.”  And you guys
know, because you’re here, but the people that he’s got have done
amazing work.   
   
So, I just want to thank everybody.  We’re going to get over and take a
look.  We’ll say a few words.  I want to just — I do want to introduce
some of the people that we have.   
   
And our first lady — we’ll start with our first lady.  She wanted to be
here because of North Carolina.  And then I said, “Well, you can do
that, but you’re going to have to come to California too.” 
(Laughter.)   
   
THE FIRST LADY:  That’s okay.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  And she said, “That’s okay.”  (Laughter.)  
   
And we got to fix that one up too.  That’s — who — do you ever see
anything like that one?  It’s — who would have — who would have thought
that could have happened.   
   
So, Governor Josh Stein, thank you very much.  We appreciate it.  And
we’re going to have a — a very long and good relationship.   
   
Representatives — maybe stand up, if you would, so we — the press can
see.  Representatives Chuck Edwards — Chuck, thank you.  Thank you,
Chuck.  Tim Moore.  Virginia.  You know Virginia Foxx, a legend — she is
such a powerful woman.  Pat Harrigan.  Pat, thank you very much.   
   
Your agriculture commissioner, who I hear is excellent, Steve Troxler —
Steve, thank you very much.  Good job, Steve.  You’ve got plenty to do,
right?  
   
MR. TROXLER:  (Inaudible.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  More than you ever thought.   
   
North Carolina Speaker Destin Hall.  Thank you, Destin.  Thanks,
Destin.  Very good.   
   
House Majority Leader Brenden Jones.  Brenden, thank you very much. 
We’re making progress, Brenden.   
   
State Representatives Dudley Greene, Karl Gillespie, thank you very
much, fellas.  Good, good.  Thank you very much.   
   
State Senators Kevin Corbin, Warren Daniel, thank you.  Thank you very
much, Kevin, Warren.   
   
And County Commissioner Jennifer Best, thank you.  Jennifer, thank
you.  
   
So, Hurricane Helene was one of the worst natural disasters in American
history.  It was far worse than it was even billed.  I have never seen
such water damage.  It was largely water damage — wind damage, but water
damage nobody has ever seen.   
   
I’ve been here, as you know, numerous times, but now I’m here in a
position where we can do something, meaning I’ve been in — in office for
four days.  And I wanted to come sooner, but actually, they had a little
problem with getting, logistically, in here, but I would have been ev- —
here even sooner.  
   
One oh four — a hundred and four North Carolinians have — at least —
have lost their lives.  Is that now a fairly firm number, or are they
still finding people?  You know?  Is — what do you think?  They’re still
finding people?  Pretty much, okay?  It’s a lot of people.   
   
A hundred and four people lost their lives.  Seventy-three thousand
homes were severely damaged or destroyed.   
   
And I’ll tell you, I’ve been to a lot of them, and this was a — this was
like lots of hurricanes in one.  I’ve never seen such damage done by
water.  And the — the water came, it was violent, and it left, and there
was, like, nothing left.  It’s really pretty amazing.   
   
At one point, half of the emergency calls to FEMA went unanswered. 
That’s real bad.  FEMA was not doing their job.  The city of Asheville
went without running water for two months.   
   
A whistleblower testified that some FEMA employees refused to help
people who displayed Trump signs on their properties.  I think that’s
true, isn’t it?  I read that.  That’s not nice.  That’s not too nice, is
it?  
   
But whoever those property people were, thank you very much.   
   
Michael, is that true?  
   
MR. WHATLEY:  (Inaudible.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s not good — huh? — about the property owners.  You
put a Trump sign on it, they wouldn’t help — FEMA.   
   
Earlier this year, FEMA kicked 2,000 North Carolinians out of their
temporary housing into below-freezing temperatures.  What was that all
about?  Is that — do you know about that?  What happened?  Tell me.  
   
STATE SPEAKER HALL:  We had an incompetent administration under Biden. 
And we had a disaster, and then we call it “the disaster after the
disaster” — that was the FEMA response.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  You had nothing but disaster since then.  I — it doesn’t
matter at this point.  Biden did a bad job.   
   
Some residents still don’t have hot water, drinking water, or anything
else.  And m- — many of them don’t have quarters.  They don’t have
anything.  They got a stipend for what they lost, and we’re going to
take care of it.   
   
This is totally unacceptable, and I’ll be taking strong action to get
North Carolina the support that you need to quickly recover and
rebuild.  We’re working on it very hard.  
   
And I think if Michael Whatley does half as good a job for North
Carolina as he did for my campaign, we’ll be very happy.  (Laughter.) 
Him and Lara were a very powerful team.   
   
So, you think you can handle it, Michael?  I don’t know.  I’m not sure,
Michael.  (Laughter.)  I think this is maybe, in many ways, easier. 
Okay?  Maybe easier.  But you’re going to lead the team.   
   
Do you want to say who the — who the congressmen are that you want to
appoint?  Do you want to introduce them?  
   
MR. WHATLEY:  So, we — we have Virginia Foxx and Chuck Edwards and Tim
Moore —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  And —  
   
MR. WHATLEY:  — whose districts encompass the area (inaudible) —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  And they are the districts that were most severely
impacted, right?  You were — you were affected, then, Virginia?  
   
REPRESENTATIVE FOXX:  Yes, sir.  Lost my own property.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Really?   
   
Well, I’ll also be signing an executive order to begin the process of
fundamentally reforming and overhauling FEMA or maybe getting rid of
FEMA.  I think, frankly, FEMA is not good.   
   
I think when you have a problem like this, I think you want to go and —
whether it’s a Democrat or a Republican governor, you want to use your
state to fix it and not waste time calling FEMA.  And then FEMA gets
here, and they don’t know the area, they’ve never been to the area, and
they want to give you rules that you’ve never heard about, they want to
bring people that aren’t as good as the people you already have.   
   
And FEMA has turned out to be a — a disaster.  And you could go back a
long way.  You could go back to Louisiana.  You could go back to some of
the things that took place in Texas.  It — it turns out to be the state
that ends up doing the work.  It just complicates it.   
   
I think we’re going to recommend that FEMA go away and we pay directly —
we pay a percentage to the state.  But the state should fix this.  If
the state did this from the beginning, it would have been a lot better
situation.   
   
I think you guys agree with that, right?  
   
So, I just want to tell that Ash- — say that Asheville — I know it
well.  It’s a great place, and we’re going to have it be a great place
again.  That was the one that was most severely affected.  But North
Carolina is going to come back bigger, better, stronger than ever
before, and you’re going to be very thankful.   
   
And you’ve already seen — I know that it really began four days ago, but
you’ve already seen more action than you have in the last three months. 
And we’re going to get it together.   
   
We’re informing the Army Corps of Engineers to get going, because you
have a lot of river breaks and a lot of areas that you’re going to need
some pretty big work.  And they’re on their way.  They’re going to be
working very — much harder than they’ve been working in the past.  And
we’re going to take care of it.   
   
Any questions from the press of any of the congressmen, governor,
anybody?  
   
Q    Sir, are you going to sign an executive order on FEMA — getting rid
of it?  Can you explain more about signing the executive order to get
rid of FEMA, please?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  FEMA has been a very big disappointment.  They cost a
tremendous amount of money.  It’s very bureaucratic, and it’s very
slow.   
   
Other than that, we’re very happy with them.  Okay?  (Laughter.)  
   
And I think it’s — I think when there’s a — when there’s a problem with
the state, I think that that problem should be taken care of by the
state.  That’s what we have states for; they take care of problems.  And
a governor can handle something very quickly.  
   
You know, one of the things I’ve noticed, because I’ve been doing this
for a while, and we had a pretty good FEMA.  But I also noticed that
when they come, they end up in arguments of — they’re fighting all the
time over who does what.  It’s a — just a — it’s just not a good
system.  
   
This system is so beautifully designed over 250 years, approximately,
you know, and we’ll soon be celebrating the 250th year.  It’s going to
be a very big celebration.  But it’s been designed very well, and we’re
going to leave it that way.  
   
When North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Tennessee, when —
everybody knows the governor of Tennessee, I think — everybody.  Do you
— do you know everybody here, pretty much?  He’s o- —  
   
GOVERNOR LEE:  I — I’ve introduced myself.    
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I never thought of it, but you’re right over the ridge,
right?  
   
GOVERNOR LEE:  Right over the hi- — right over the hillside.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  So — so, you’re here to help.  That’s great.  
   
GOVERNOR LEE:  These here, thi- — the people in this region, including
Tennessee — the people of Appalachia are grateful that you are here and
that you haven’t forgotten them.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  
   
GOVERNOR LEE:  And that there are other disasters, but this one was
enormous for both North Carolina and Tennessee.  So, thank you.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  You know, I’ve seen a lot of disasters, and this — when
I came — I came here right after, the day after.  And when I came here,
I couldn’t believe it, actually.  I couldn’t believe the damage.  I —
and I’ve seen a lot of them.  This was — this was more like a tornado
than it was — what we witnessed.   
   
So, we’re going to get it very much — very much taken care of.  Good
job.  That’s nice that you came.  
   
GOVERNOR LEE:  Thank you, sir.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  And so, you call it right — you’re right over the ridge,
right?  Tennessee.  
   
GOVERNOR LEE:  Right over the ridge, yes, sir.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I like Tennessee, too.  Let’s see.  Where did I get more
votes — Tennessee or North Carolina?  I hate — (laughter) — I hate to
tell you, North Carolina, it was Tennessee.   
   
GOVERNOR LEE:  There’s one of the counties in this disaster that had 88
percent for you.  So (inaudible) —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Eighty-eight percent, yeah?  That’s — the people are
just incredible people.  
   
GOVERNOR LEE:  Yeah.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  So, do you have any questions, press?  
   
Q    Yes, Mr. President, you talked about conditions being placed on aid
to California — voter ID and the like.  Are there any conditions that
you’re going to put on aid to North Carolina?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, we’re going to do a lot for North Carolina.  You
know, they’ve been very slow.  I don’t know why it’s been so bad.  This
has been one of the worst I’ve seen.   
   
Katrina, of course, you know, was somebo- — something that — obviously,
that was a long time ago — that was not good.  But this has been very
slow.  I don’t know if that was for political reasons because they lost
the state.  You know, Biden lost the state.  Maybe he felt — he doesn’t
care.  Maybe there were other reasons.  I don’t know.  
   
But this has been very slow.  By any standard, this has been very slow. 
And we’re going to — we’re going to make up for lost time.  
   
Q    But no conditions you’re going to push for aid, just full stop?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, in California, I have a condition.  In California,
we want them to have voter ID so the people have a voice, because right
now, the people don’t have a voice because you don’t know who’s voting
and it’s very corrupt.   
   
And we also want them to release the water.  If they release the water,
they wouldn’t have had a problem.  If they released the water when I
told them to — because I told them to do it seven years ago — if they
would have done it, you wouldn’t have had the problem that you had.  You
might have — you might not have even had a fire.  
   
So — but here, I don’t have that.  It’s a different thing.  You got hit
by a storm.  The people are incredible.  They worked really well. 
Franklin was fantastic, and other groups — by the way, other groups came
in that were also fantastic.  And other states came in; Tennessee and a
couple of others came in, and they really helped.  That’s the way it’s
supposed to be.  
   
No, this is a different kind of a thing.  
   
Q    Mr. President, have you decided how much funding you would allocate
for disaster relief in North Carolina?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  About what?  
   
Q    Have you decided how much funding you would allocate for disaster
relief?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I haven’t de- — I have to see what it is.  
   
Q    Mr. President —  
   
Q    Are — are — are you disappointed that Senator Schiff hasn’t joined
you on this trip?  It’s reported that you invited Senator Schiff to join
you on this trip, and he was too busy.  Are you disappointed by that?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t know, I — I was told that Schiff was going to
travel with us to California.  I wasn’t thrilled, to be honest with
you.  (Laughter.)   
   
And I saw him last night on television.  It looks like he got hit with a
baseball bat or something.  What happened to him?  Something happened to
him.  
   
Q    Are you still —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  It was a little — it looked like he got hit.  It looked
like he got beat around, but —  
   
Q    So, did — did you invite him or —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  But I’ll ask Karoline to find out what happened to
him.   
   
No, if he wanted to come out, I would have done that.  But I don’t
know.  I — somebody said that he wanted to come on the plane, but I
think he’s staying back for the votes.  There’s some pretty good votes
going on.  
   
Yeah.  
   
Q    Mr. President, what is your timeline for getting rid of FEMA?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I — I woul- — for the — for this one?  For this one? 
Well —  
   
Q    For — you just talked about possibly getting rid of FEMA.  What
timeline are you looking at, and how would you do that?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re looking here — here, you’re talking about. 
To start — we’re going to start immediately — timeline.    
   
And to finish, it’s going to be a period of time.   
   
You know, people are also rebuilding their houses.  How long does it
take to build a house, right?  It takes a time.  
   
And I want them to build houses bigger, better, nicer than they had
before, so they can have — at least they get something out of this
disaster.  This was a real disaster.  
   
No, timeline will be fast.  In terms of infrastructure, I think very
fast.   
   
I want to thank Elon, because Elon was able to get us communication
systems, as you know — Starlink.  We had no communication.  The first
day I got here, I was asked by one of the people, one of the really
great representatives, professionals that — “Is there any way you could
get Starlink here,” because they had no communication whatsoever.  And I
called up Elon Musk, and he had, you know, hundreds of units brought
here — like, brought immediately.  And it’s hard to get; they couldn’t
get them before.  And that made a lot of difference.  I think it saved a
lot of lives, actually.  
   
Yeah.   
   
Infrastructure-wise, we’ll do it quickly.  
   
Q    Sir, can you just talk about how long you might — do you think it
might take to get rid of FEMA?  What’s the timeline on that if you’re
going to roll it back?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  I would say, look, as far as I’m concerned, I’m
not really thinking about FEMA right now here.  I’m thinking about
Michael Whatley, and I’m thinking about the three congresspeople that
you just heard from and also the other people in Congress.  And they’ll
be working with the governor.  They’ll be working with the governor. 
So, that’s what I see.  
   
Q    Change of subject real quickly.  The Laken Riley Act was signed by
Mike — Speaker Johnson yesterday.  When do you —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — when do you anticipate to put — to sign that in the Oval Office?

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re honored by that.  Laken Riley — I was there
at the time, and we had a big meeting with the parents right after that
horrible thing took place.   
   
And we have a — an act.  You all know what that act represents.  And it
was a bipartisan bill.  Many Democrats signed — signed on to it.  That’s
something that is a tribute to Laken, a beautiful young lady who was
killed viciously by an illegal alien.  And we passed a very powerful
bill, and it was just approved.  And we’ll have a ceremony sometime very
shortly.  
   
I’ll be signing it.  In other words, if you’re asking, I will definitely
be signing it.  Okay?  
   
Yeah.  
   
Q    Mr. President, the security detail for Anthony Fauci was terminated
last night, and I’m wondering if you have any comment on that?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  About what?  
   
Q    The security detail for Anthony Fauci was terminated last night,
sir.  Do you have a comment?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, I think, you know, when you work for govern- —
government, at some point, your security detail comes off.  And, you
know, you can’t have them forever.  So, I think it’s very standard.  If
it would be for somebody else, you wouldn’t be asking the question.   
   
The question is very fair, but, you know, you work for government — we
took some off other people too — but you can’t have a security detail
for the rest of your life because you worked for government.  
   
Q    Did you ask for it to be taken off, sir?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’ll see what happens.  
   
Q    Would you feel partially responsible if something were to happen
to, say, Dr. Fauci —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No.  
   
Q    — or John Bolton?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No.   
   
You know, they all made a lot of money.  They can hire their own
security too.  All the people you’re talking about, they can go out — I
can give them some good numbers of very good security people.  They can
hire their own security.  They all made a lot of money.  Fauci made a
lot of money.  They all did.   
   
So, if they, you know, felt that strongly, I — I think that — certainly,
I would not take responsibility.  
   
Q    North Carolina is a state that relies on trade and manufacturing. 
Are you going to have an announcement on new tariffs coming soon?  Is
there a timeline now?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, the tariffs are going to make our country rich. 
We’re going to be a rich, rich country very soon.  Tariffs are going to
make it rich.  And competence — we have common sense, competence, and
tariffs.   
   
The word “tariff” is one of the most beautiful words in the
dictionary.   
   
Q    Jonathan Reynolds, the — the business secretary of the United
Kingdom, said that there’s an even trade between the U.S. and — and the
UK, so they shouldn’t have tariffs.  Does trade imbalances or a balanced
trade affect tariffs and your decisions?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, ba- — unbalance and balance, and also deficits,
like with Canada.  We lose $200 billion a year with Canada.  That’s
because we allow them to make cars.  We allow them to take lumber.  We
don’t need their cars.  We don’t need their lumber.  We don’t need their
food products because we make the same products right on the other side
of the border.  It’s sort of crazy.  So, we’ve just allowed that — you
know, bad management has allowed it, over the last four years, in
particular, to become very imbalanced.   
   
And I said to — I call him “Governor Trudeau,” but he’s Prime Minister
Trudeau — when he was prime minister, I asked him, “Why would we do
that?  Why?”  And he was unable to give me an answer.  He said, “I don’t
know.”  And I said, “Do you think it’s fair that we’re paying $200
billion to keep Canada going?”  “And what would happen” — I said — I
asked him, “What would happen if we didn’t do that, if we didn’t
subsidize Canada?”  He said, “We’d be a failed nation.”  And I said,
“Then you should be a state,” because why are we paying all of that
money to Canada when, you know, we — we could use it ourselves, right?  
   
So, we take care of their military.  You know, we ordered — we’re going
to order about 40 Coast Guard big icebreakers.  Big ones.  And all of a
sudden, Canada wants a piece of the deal.  I say, “Why are we doing
that?”  
   
I mean, I like doing that if they’re a state, but I don’t like doing
that if they’re a nation.  
   
Also, they’ve been very nasty to us on trade.  Historically, Canada has
been very, very bad to us, very unfair to us on trade.  So, we’ll see
how it all works out.  
   
Q    So, the United Kingdom —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I would —  
   
Q    — might be in a better spot?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I would love to see Canada be the 51st state.  The
Canadian citizens, if that happened, would get a very big tax cut —
tremendous tax cut — because they’re very high- — highly taxed.  And you
wouldn’t have to worry about military.  You wouldn’t have to worry about
many of the things.  You’d have better health coverage.  You’d have much
better health coverage.   
   
So, I think the people of Canada would like it, you know, if it’s
explained.    
   
But I — just to start off, they’d have a very — they’d have a massive
tax cut, and they’d have a lot more business, because then we’d let
business go to Canada routinely.  And there’d be no tariffs.  You know,
if we did that, there’d be no tariffs.  
   
Q    So, the United Kingdom might be in a better spot, then?  
   
Q    Can you talk about Samaritan’s Purse?  Reverend Franklin Graham has
been a great asset to this state.  Talk a little bit about the way the
Samaritan Purse has helped North Carolinians.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, say it once again.  The first —  
   
Q    Reverend Franklin Graham has been a big part of Samaritan Purse and
their aid to North Carolina.  I just want to get your thoughts on that.

THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  Well, Franklin Graham has been a big asset to the
state.  His father was a big asset to the state, to the country — both
of them.  I just think this: I think Franklin and — and other people
that are doing what Franklin have done — but I — you know, I’ve known
Franklin so long.  He was at the inauguration.  He made a speech,
beautiful speech; beautiful prayer.  He just — he does a great job.   
   
And we gave — we made a big donation, and it was — it was money well
spent.  Sometimes you make donations, it’s not well spent.  He’s done a
great job here.  He’s done a really great job.  
   
So, I want to thank you.  We’re going to the site now, and — one of the
sites — and we’ll — I think you’ll — for those that haven’t seen it, you
won’t even believe it, but not enough work was done.  We’ll get it done
fast.   
   
And I can speak for the Republican congressmen, we’re going to knock it
out, right?  We’re going to knock it out.  And I think we take it very
personally, because it was — North Carolina was very unfairly treated —
very, very unfairly treated.  And it was obvious.  It was too obvious. 
And we’re going to make up for lost time.   
   
So, thank you to the people of North Carolina.   
 

Thank you, everybody.
