     THE PRESIDENT: So, thank you very much.  We just heard that we have
a great Secretary of Defense.  We’re very happy about that, and we
appreciate everybody’s vote.  
   
     And very importantly, I think we had two fantastic meetings in
North Carolina and also in Los Angeles, and we made a lot of progress. 
It’s – they’re tragic events, really tragic.  
   
And we appreciate your being here, and we’re going home.  
   
Q    What did you promise the — the governor, Mr. President?  Did he ask
for federal dollars?  Did he ask for your help?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, no, we just had a good talk.  We’re on the same
team.  We want to get it fixed.  So, we had a very good talk.  With the
governor, I had a very, very good talk.  
   
Q    What do you think of Mitch McConnell voting against Hegseth’s
nomination?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I didn’t know that.  I just know we won.  I didn’t know
that.  
   
Q    Do you think the mayor got the message that she’s got to cut red
tape and get (inaudible)?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I hope the mayor got the message.  Yeah.  I don’t know. 
(Laughs.)  I’m not sure, but I hope so.  Now, look, I think she means
well, but these people want to get about building their house. They’re
not going to wait around 18 months, and they’re not going to wait around
a long time.  
   
Q    Mr. President, are you —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  So, we’re going to give an immediate permit.  
   
Q    Are you concerned about any other nominations for confirmation in
the Senate?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No.  No, I’m honored to have Pete. I think Pete is going
to be a great Secretary of Defense — Pete Hegseth — and we’re honored to
have him.  
   
Q    I apologize.  I couldn’t hear you.  Did you say you were speaking
to him on the phone?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, I did speak to Pete — yeah — in the plane, in the
helicopter.  I think Pete is going to be a great Secretary of Defense.  
   
Q    Are you disappointed that McConnell voted no?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, I didn’t even know that.  No, I don’t know that.  I
just heard that we won.  Winning is what matters, right?  
   
So, thank you very much everybody.  Are you going on the plane?   
   
Q    Yes.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Good.  Maybe I’ll see you on the plane.  
   
Q    That would be great.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  We’ll see you on the plane.  
   
Q    Come back.  
   
Q    Come back and say hello, okay?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I will.
