title: Remarks by Vice President Vance at American Dynamism Summit
---
 
Waldorf Astoria

Washington, D.C.

9:16 A.M. EDT  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good morning, everybody.  How we doing? 
(Applause.)  
   
It’s — it’s great to be here.  Thanks to — to everybody for having me
today — in particular, Ben and Marc.  And I just got to say hello to Ben
and Katherine backstage.  But I know — I know, apparently, Marc has the
flu right now.  So, Marc, wherever you are — I think I had the same flu,
like, a few weeks ago.  It sucks.  But I’m sure — I’m sure you’ll get
through it.  
   
And it’s great to — to be with you all, and it’s great to talk about the
importance of American dynamism and what our administration is going to
do to support so many of the country’s most groundbreaking and
compelling companies.  
   
I know that you guys are working hard every single day.  And I think
it’s pretty good news — right? — that, as of a couple of months ago, you
have an administration that’s working with you and facilitating your
hard work instead of making it harder to innovate, which is, I think,
what the last administration did — though, in defense of Joe Biden, he
was asleep most of the time.  I don’t think he totally realized what he
was doing, but it certainly didn’t make it easier — his administration
did not — for our innovators.  
   
Now, as some of you may have seen — and I talked about this with Ben
backstage — I spoke at a conference in Paris last month, where my
message to a group of CEOs and foreign leaders was that we should
embrace the future head-on.  We shouldn’t be afraid of artificial
intelligence and that, particularly for those of us lucky enough to be
Americans, we shouldn’t be fearful of productive new technologies.  In
fact, we should seek to dominate them.  And that’s certainly what this
administration wants to accomplish.  
   
I suspect that most of you in this room are of like mind, and if you’re
not, I don’t know why the hell you’re at the American dynamism
conference.  (Laughter.)  But I — I received some pushback from people
who are worried about the disruptive effects of AI.   
   
You know, one journalist suggested the speech highlighted the tension
between the, quote, “techno-optimists” and the “populist right” of
President Trump’s coalition.   
   
And today, I’d like to speak to these tensions as a proud member of both
tribes.  And let me put it simply: While this is a well-intentioned
concern, I think it’s based on a faulty premise.  This idea that
tech-forward people and the populists are somehow inevitably going to
come to a loggerheads is wrong.  
   
I think the reality is that, in any dynamic society, technology is going
to advance, of course.   
   
And speaking as a Catholic, I think back to Pope John Paul II’s opening
lines of his encyclic- — e- — (coughs) — excuse me — encyclical “Laborem
exercens.”  Quote, “Through work, man must earn his daily bread and
contribute to the continual advance of science and technology and, above
all, to elevating unceasingly the cultural and moral level of the
society within which he lives,” end quote.  
   
Now, I quote the Holy Father not only because I’m a fan of his but also
because he rightly understood that in a healthy economy, technology
should be something that enhances, rather than supplants, the value of
labor.  
   
And I think there’s too much fear that AI will simply replace jobs
rather than augmenting so many of the things that we do.  
   
Now, in the 1970s, if you go back a little ways, many feared that the
automated teller machine — what we call the “ATM” — would replace bank
tellers.  In reality, the advent of the ATM made bank tellers more
productive, and you have more people today working in customer service
in the financial sector than you had when the ATM was created.  Now,
they’re doing slightly different jobs, of course, yes.  They’re doing
more interesting tasks also, and, importantly, they’re making more money
than they were in the 1970s.  
   
Now, when we innovate, we do sometimes cause labor market disruptions. 
That has — that happens.  But the history of American innovation is that
we tend to make people more productive, and then we increase their wages
in the process.  And I think all of us believe that’s a good thing.  
   
Now, after all, who would claim that man was made less productive by the
invention of the transistor or the metal lathe or the steam engine?  
   
Real innovation makes us more productive, but it also, I think,
dignifies our workers.  It boosts our standard of living.  It
strengthens our workforce and the relative value of its labor.  
   
And, as Americans, all of us should be particularly proud of our
extraordinary heritage — I think it is American heritage — of inventing
things and of our nation’s status to this day as the world’s foremost
driver of research and development.  
   
But all of this, the role that technology plays in a labor market, and
whether we greet innovative breakthroughs with excitement or with
trepidation depends on the purpose of our economic system in the first
place.  And I think this is where the populists have an important
point.  
   
It should be no surprise that when we send so much of our industrial
base to other countries, we stop making interesting new things right
here at home.  
   
Look, for example, at shipbuilding.  Now, if you go back to World War
II, America constructed thousands of so-called Liberty ships to carry
troops, cargo, and other things, building them at a pace of three ships
every two days — three ships every two days.  
   
Now we build about five commercial ships across an entire year in the
United States of America.  And as a result, the United States today
accounts for 0.1 percent — one tenth of one percent — of global
shipbuilding.   
   
China, on the other hand, now makes more commercial ships than the rest
of the world combined.  In fact, one of Beijing’s state-owned firms
built more commercial ships just last year than all of America has
produced since the end of World War II.  
   
So, while we remain the leader in technology and innovation, I think
there are troubling signs on the horizon.  And I raise all this to ask:
Does this sound like a regime — I’m speaking of China — that will pass
up on the opportunity to use AI, or any other technology, to advance
their own interests and further undermine the interests of their
rivals?  I think the answer is obvious, and that’s why, America, we’ve
got to be tech-forward.  
   
Yes, there are concerns.  Yes, there are risks.  But we have to be
leaning into the AI future with optimism and hope, because I think real
technological innovation is going to make our country stronger.  
   
So, deindus- — deindustrialization poses risks both to our national
security and our workforce.  It’s important because it affects both. 
And the net result is dispossession, for many in this country, of any
part of the productive process.  And when our factories disappear and
the jobs in those factories go overseas, American workers are faced not
only with financial insecurity, they’re also faced with a profound loss
of personal and communal identity.  
   
And so, to come full circle on this tension — alleged tension between
the populists and the techno-optimists, I can understand a reaction of
skepticism when we talk about the revolutionary potential of new
invention and artificial intelligence and all the other incredible
technologies that you guys are working, but I think that that tension is
a little overstated.   
   
And so, I’m going to come back to what’s sort of dividing some of the
tech optimists and the populists on our side.   
   
I think the populists, when they look at the future, and when they
compare it to what’s happened in the past, I think a lot of them see
alienation of workers from their jobs, from their communities, from
their sense of solidarity.  You see the alienation of people from their
sense of purpose.  And importantly, they see a leadership class that
believes welfare can replace a job and an application on a phone can
replace a sense of purpose.   
   
Now, I remember a Silicon Valley dinner in particular, back when I was
in — in my tech days, where my wife and I were sitting around talking to
some of the leaders of — of the important technology firms of the United
States.  And this was probably in 2016 or 2017.  And I was talking about
my real worry that we were heading in a direction where America could no
longer support middle-class families working on middle-class wages.  And
importantly, that even if you had enough economic dynamism to provide
the wealth to ensure those people could, you know, afford to buy a house
and afford their food and so forth, that even if you replace the
financial element of their jobs, you would destroy something that was
dignified and purposeful about work itself.  
   
And I remember one of the tech CEOs who was there that — you know, CEO —
you would know his name if I mentioned it.  He was the CEO of a — of a
multibillion-dollar company.  He said, “Well, I’m actually not worried
about the loss of purpose when people lose their jobs.”  And I said,
“Okay, well, what do you think is going to replace that sense of
purpose?”  And he said, “Digital, fully immersive gaming.” 
(Laughter.)  
   
And then my — my wife texted me underneath the table and said, “We have
to get the hell out of here.  These people are effing crazy.” 
(Laughter.)  
   
Now, I don’t think that, of course, that CEO’s views are representative
of — of most people in this room, but when I think about the — the — a
lot of the workers, based on what they’ve seen in the past, are very
worried about the future, because, frankly, their leadership has failed
to serve them.  
   
And then I think about this from the perspective of a lot of the tech
optimists.  I think a lot of the tech optimists, they see
overregulation.  They see stifling innovation.  I mean, you guys are
builders.  They are builders.  And while they may sympathize with those
who lost a job, they’re much more frustrated that the government won’t
allow them to build the jobs of the future.  
   
And they know that as hard as it is to build a business in digital
media, it’s still harder to build one in robotics or life sciences or
energy, in what we call the world of atoms.  They see a government that
makes their lives harder, and they mistrust anyone who looks to that
government for aid.  
   
And what I’d propose is that each group — our workers, the populace on
the one hand, the tech optimists on the other — have been failed by this
government — not just the government of the last administration but the
government, in some ways, of the last 40 years, because there were two
conceits that our leadership class had when it came to globalization.   
   
The first is assuming that we can separate the making of things from the
design of things.  The idea of globalization was that rich countries
would move further up the value chain, while the poor countries made the
simpler things.  
   
You would open an iPhone box, and it would say “designed in Cupertino,
California.”  Now, the implication, of course, is that it would be
manufactured in Shenzhen or somewhere else.  And, yeah, some people
might lose their jobs in manufacturing, but they could learn to design
or, to use a very popular phrase, learn to code.  
   
But I think we got it wrong.  It turns out that the geographies that do
the manufacturing get awfully good at the designing of things.  There
are network effects, as you all well understand.  The firms that design
products work with firms that manufacture.  They share intellectual
property.  They share best practices.  And they even sometimes share
critical employees.  
   
Now, we assumed that other nations would always trail us in the value
chain, but it turns out that as they got better at the low end of the
value chain, they also started catching up on the higher end.  We were
squeezed from both ends.  Now, that was the first conceit of
globalization.  
   
I think the second is that cheap labor is fundamentally a crutch, and
it’s a crutch that inhibits innovation.  I might even say that it’s a
drug that too many American firms got addicted to.  Now, if you can make
a product more cheaply, it’s far too easy to do that rather than to
innovate.  
   
And whether we were offshoring factories to cheap labor economies or
importing cheap labor through our immigration shyste- — system, cheap
labor became the drug of Western economies.   
  
     And I’d say that if you look in nearly every country, from Canada
to the UK, that imported large amounts of cheap labor, you’ve seen
productivity stagnate.  I don’t think that’s — that’s not a total
happenstance.  I think that the connection is very direct.  
   
Now, one of the debates you hear on the minimum wage, for instance, is
that increases in the minimum wage force firms to automate.  So, a
higher wage at McDonald’s means more kiosks.  And whatever your views on
the wisdom of the minimum wage — I’m not going to comment on that here —
companies innovating in the absence of cheap labor is a good thing.   
  
     I think most of you are not worried about getting cheaper and
cheaper labor.  You’re worried about innovating, about building new
things, about — the old formulation of technology is doing more with
less.  You guys are all trying to do more with less every single day.  
   
And so, I — I’d ask my friends, both on the — the tech optimist side and
on the populist side, not to see the failure of the logic of
globalization as a failure of innovation.  Indeed, I’d say that
globalization’s hunger for cheap labor is — is a problem precisely
because it’s been bad for innovation.   
   
      Both our working people — our populists — and our innovators
gathered here today have the same enemy.  And the solution, I believe,
is American innovation, because, in the long run, it’s technology that
increases the value of labor.   
  
Innovations like the American system and the interchangeable parts
revolution it sparked, or Ford’s moving assembly line that skyrocketed
the productivity of our workers — that’s how American industry became
the envy of the world.  
   
And that’s what I really want to talk about today: why innovation is key
to winning the worldwide manufacturing compe- — competition, to giving
our workers a fair deal, and to reclaiming our heritage via America’s
great industrial comeback. And I believe that’s what we’re on the cusp
of, a great American industrial comeback.  
   
Because innovation is what increases wages.  It’s what protects our
homelands, and I know we have a lot of defense technology companies
here.  It’s what saves troops’ lives on the battlefield.  
   
And I know everyone here today largely agrees.  It’s why we have some of
the greatest inno- — inventors and thinkers in energy; precision
machining; countless critical, high-value industries just in this
room.   
   
And I think the other thing that unites all of you is that you’re all
builders.  And I — and I use that word deliberately.  
   
I was very moved by Marc’s manifesto from a few years ago about
America.  We are a nation of builders.  We make things.  We create
things.  
   
Each of you came to this summit not because you developed some
flash-in-the-pan application, but because you’re building something very
real.  You’re raising new factories.  You’re turning profits back into R
& D.  And you’re creating new, good-paying jobs for your fellow
Americans.   
   
And this is why I’m such huge fans of yours — of Ben’s and Marc’s and of
the entire endeavor — and that we recognize now in our administration is
the time to align our work interests with those of all of you.  It’s
time to align the interests of our technology firms with the interests
of the United States of America writ large.  
   
Now, all of you, in your own ways, have answered that call.  After all,
there’s nothing forcing anyone to be in the room today.  Each one of you
could have set up headquarters in Southeast Asia or China, I’m sure, and
you would’ve done quite well for yourselves financially.  
   
But you’re here, I hope, because you love your country.  You love its
people and the opportunities that it’s given you, and you recognize that
building things, our capacity to create new innovations in the economy
cannot be a race to the bottom.  
   
Now, America is not going to win the future by ditching child labor laws
or paying our workers less than Chinese or Vietnamese laborers.  We
don’t want that, and it’s not on the table.  
   
We can only win by doing what we always did: protecting our workers and
supporting our innovators, and doing both of those things at the same
time.  
   
And so, I want to talk a little specifics here.  The Trump
Administration’s great plan for staging the great American manufacturing
comeback is simple.  You’re making interesting new things here in
America?  Great.  Then we’re going to cut your taxes.  We’re going to
slash regulations.  We’re going to reduce the cost of energy so that you
can build, build, build.  
   
Our goal is to incentivize investment in our own borders — in our own
businesses, our own workers, and our own innovation.  We don’t want
people seeking cheap labor.  We want them investing and building right
here in the United States of America.  
   
And so, if you’ll allow it, I’d like to talk about a few ways that the
Trump Administration is already pursuing a pro-innovation economy that
allows our workers to thrive and our companies to outcompete their
foreign peers — in short, an economy that is vibrantly America first,
that serves Americans from all walks of life and of every kind.  
   
Now, first, President Trump is starting with and is dead serious about
rearranging our trade and tariff regime internationally.   
   
We believe that tariffs are a necessary tool to protect our jobs and our
industries from other countries, as well as the labor value of our
workers in a globalized market.  In fact, combined with the right
technology, they allow us to bring jobs back to the United States of
America and create the jobs of the fucur- — future.   
   
Just look in the past few months at the auto industry as an important
example.  When you erect a tariff wall around a critical industry like
auto manufacturing and you combine that with advanced robotics and lower
energy costs and other tools that increase the productivity of U.S.
labor, you give American workers a multiplying effect.  Now that, in
turn, allows firms to make things here at a price-competitive basis.  
   
Our president gets that, which is why last month we posted 9,000 new
auto jobs after many, many years of stagnation or even decline in the
auto sector.  It’s why, just weeks in, we already have new plant or
production announcements from Honda, from Hyundai, and Stellantis worth
billions of dollars and thousands of additional jobs on top of the ones
that were already created.  
   
Now, this takes work.  It took, in the president’s first term, the
president ripping up NAFTA and creating a new U.S. deal for American
manufacturers in North America.  But there’s important work, and we’re
going to do it.  
   
Now, second — second, all of this is why the president is approaching
the issue of illegal immigration as aggressively as he has, because he
knows that cheap labor cannot be used as a substitute for the
productivity gains that come with economic innovation.   
   
And so, we’ve cracked down on illegal immigration at the border, where
the results speak for themselves.  Last month, migrant crossings were
down 94 percent to their lowest number all time, and that happened just
in two months of serious border enforcement.  
   
Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, last month, for the first time
in over a year, the majority of job gains went to American citizens born
on U.S. soil, and that’s important.  For the first time in over a year,
the majority of job creation actually went to American citizens.  
   
Third, this administration is focused on reducing our input costs for
our manufacturers and for everybody else.  Achieving energy an- —
abundance — and I know Doug Burgum was here earlier; will be here later
— is top of mind.  Because when we look at some of the most exciting
applications of new technologies, we realize it’s going to take a lot of
power to keep them running.   
   
And we’re — we’re thrilled to have our friends from the United Arab
Emirates, a number of the business leaders and government leaders, in
town this week for meetings with our government.  And one of the things
they consistently hammer upon — it’s something that unfortunately too
few of our European allies tend to get — is that if you want to lead in
artificial intelligence, you have got to be leading in energy
production.  
   
So, we are going to set the pace there, and we are going to lead from
the front.  
   
Now, we are already seeing, the good news is, signs of progress, even
just a couple of months in.  Gas and diesel prices are dropping.  The
cost of a barrel of U.S. crude is way down.  And last Wednesday, the
administration took major steps to make energy even cheaper and liberate
our companies from stifling environmental regulations.   
   
Now, that is great, but, of course, there’s a lot more work we have to
do over the next four years.  Getting the tax bill right is especially
critical for all of you and for all of your workers.  We know how
important it is to restore 100 percent bonus depreciation for capital
investments, as well as full expensing for R & D.  Again, we want people
to invest in America, and we’re going to make sure the tax code reflects
that.  
   
In order to build on the success of the original tax law, meaning the
tax law from the president’s first administration, our administration is
working to broaden some provisions that are critical to the industrial
base, like expanding full expensing to cover factory construction.  For
business owners, including manufacturers, making the 2017 tax cuts
permanent will provide further co- — confidence and predictability to
invest in new technology and equipment, hire more American workers, and
grow all of your businesses.   
   
And we have a lot more to do, but the country is already starting to see
the payoff of this administration’s bold economic agenda.  For producers
and consumers alike, inflation is finally starting to come down.  Core
CPI last week dropped to its lowest number since April of 2021.  And
when it comes to the labor market, last month’s jobs report showed a
massive reversal: 10,000 new manufacturing jobs created, where the
previous year we had lost over 100,000 manufacturing jobs.   
   
As you may have heard the president say, in less than two months since
he’s took office, he’s already secured more than $1.7 trillion in new
investments across the United States.  That’s hundreds of thousands of
new jobs in manufacturing, AI, other hard tech sectors, and more.   
   
So, we think there’s a lot to be excited about.  There’s a lot that
we’re excited about, and we certainly hope that you guys are excited
too.   
   
But the fundamental premise, the fundamental goal of President Trump’s
economic policy is, I think, to undo 40 years of failed economic policy
in this country.  For far too long, we got addicted to cheap labor —
both overseas and by importing it into our own country — and we got
lazy.   
   
We overregulated our industries instead of supporting them.  We
overtaxed our innovators, instead of making easier for them to build
their great companies, and we made it way too hard to build things and
invest things in the United States of America.   
  
     That stopped two months ago, and it will continue to stop, and
we’ll continue to fight for American workers and the American businesses
that hire them and that support them.   
   
So, I want to thank you all for two things.  Number one, I want to thank
you all for doing what you do.  Again, you could have chosen the easy
path.  Every single person in this room — as the president would say,
“You’re all very high IQ” — you’re some of the most talented people in
the United States of America.  You chose to build a business right here
in the United States of America, and for that, I’m grateful.   
   
But the second thing I want to say is that I think you’re not just
building your own business.  I think that you are part of a great
American industrial renaissance.  Whether it’s the war of the future,
the jobs of the future, the economic prosperity of the future, we
believe that we must build it right here in the United States of
America.   
   
So, thank you all for building.  Thank you all for building in America. 
And thank you all for building the kind of society that I want to raise
my children in.   
   
God bless you all.  Thanks for having me.  (Applause.)
