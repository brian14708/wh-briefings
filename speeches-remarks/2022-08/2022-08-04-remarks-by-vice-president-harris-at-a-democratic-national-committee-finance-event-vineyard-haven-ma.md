Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts*

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you, Epsteins, for hosting us and for
all that you do in so many ways for so many people. There’s truly not
much that any of us can do by ourselves.  It really does take a
community of folks who care about our country.  We all play in different
positions, but I think we’re playing on the same team.  
   
Which actually brings me to — I’m just going to share with you some
thoughts about this moment and where I think we are.  
   
So today, I actually spent the day — I flew out of D.C. this morning and
spent the day in Boston, because in the last few weeks since the Dobbs
decision came down, I’ve decided I wanted to get on the road and meet
with the folks who are on the ground doing the important work that must
be done right now, especially since the Dobbs decision made clear that
this is now being pushed to the states, sadly.  
   
For those of us who have been focused on the importance of understanding
the difference between states’ rights and what we need to do at the
federal level, we are now revisiting a moment where we’re looking at
those issues in a very profound way.  
   
And so I traveled to Boston to meet with the Governor of Massachusetts,
Governor Baker, who has been signing some really outstanding legislation
and, I think, making clear is a very important point that, on some
issues, we really should understand they’re just fundamental to who we
are, who we believe ourselves to be as Americans.  And we should have
the ability, combined with our conviction, in terms of what’s best for
our country, to then understand that we can approach some of these
issues in a nonpartisan way.  
   
So I was with the governor and met, I don’t know, at least a couple
dozen members of the state legislature.  As I’ve been in Indiana, I’ve
been in Florida, New Jersey, all over the country meeting with folks —
some in re- — so-called red states, so-called blue states, talking about
where we are.  
   
And again, what has prompted these trips in the last few weeks has been
the Dobbs decision because, of course, the United States Supreme Court
took a constitutional right, that had been recognized, from the people
of America, from the women of America.  And it will and is already
having a profound impact on human beings, on individuals, but on the
very principles that were part of the — there’s a spirit of the founding
of our country, those principles being the principle of freedom and
liberty.  
   
 And so I’ve been meeting with these folks to talk about what is at
stake right now and also what can be done.  And, of course, you all are
here in this heat, but this incredibly beautiful setting, understanding
that we are 96 days away from a very important election — the midterms —
that in many ways will be an inflection point on this issue.  
   
In that, in 96 days, we have the opportunity around the country to
determine whether we will have a pro-choice Congress.   
   
Our President, Joe Biden — who many of you know and have supported for
many, many years — there’s so many incredible things about him, and one
is that he is a lifelong and devout public servant who takes seriously
the importance of traditions and protocols around the most deliberative
body in the world, the United States Senate.  And Joe Biden has had
enough when it comes to the filibuster — which is part of a long
tradition of the Senate — (applause) — to say, “Enough is enough.  I’m
not going to let the filibuster get in the way on the issue of choice
and on the issue of voting rights.”  
   
And so that brings me to the point, which is also that what happened in
the Dobbs decision is a moment that is clear about what is at stake. 
But understand how it is connected to so many other issues that are
present in our nation right now that mean that there is so much at
stake.  
   
I asked my team to do a Venn diagram.  And one circle being which states
do we see an attack on women’s reproductive health and choice.  Another
circle, the attacks on voting rights.  And another circle, the attack on
LGBTQ rights.  You would not be surprised to know that there is a
significant overlap.   
   
And the next iteration of that Venn diagram — I’ve asked them — I want
to also put on a circle where we’re seeing books bans, where we’re
seeing attacks on immigrants.  
   
And it paints quite a vivid picture of where we are right now.  There is
so much at stake.   
   
You know, as Vice President — and we just celebrated, or at least
marked, 18 months in office, July 20th.  A year and a half. 
(Applause.)  Thank you.  And as Vice President, I have had the honor and
the responsibility of meeting with, talking directly with — by phone or
in person — at least 100 times with heads of state from around the
world: prime ministers, presidents, kings, chancellors.  
   
And I will tell you what you all know: When we, as the United States of
America, walk in those rooms, traditionally, historically, we’ve been
able to walk in those rooms chin up, shoulders back, representing what
we describe and believe to be the strongest democracy in the world,
imperfect though we may be, flawed though we may be.   
   
Walking in those rooms, we then talk about the importance of human
rights, civil rights, rule of law.  And we are able then, because of our
standing, to exert some influence, sometimes pressure, to hopefully
impact the condition of people around the world on those issues.  
   
The first bilateral meeting I had with a foreign head of state was a
breakfast at — now, my residence — the Vice President’s residence, where
I had over for breakfast then-Chancellor Angela Merkel — who, by the
way, is a wonderful human being.  She really is.  It’s awful how strong
women are portrayed.  Right?  You know, “Oh, she’s cold.  She’s this.” 
She’s warm.  She has a sense of humor.  We got on really quite well.   
   
And we had an extensive conversation.  We talked about China.  We talked
about Russia.  We talked about the state of the EU.  And then she leaned
over and she said, “Tell me what’s going on with voting in your
country.”  And she then had details about what she meant in asking the
question.  
   
Because, you see, when one holds themselves out to be a role model, with
that comes the fact that people will watch what you do to determine if
it matches what you say.  Nations and people around the world are
watching right now what’s happening in our country — when our highest
court takes a constitutional right, when long-settled issues like voting
rights are under attack.  
   
And I say all of this to say that this is a moment, I do believe, of
crisis in terms of the vulnerability and the fragility of our democracy,
and therefore the challenge, which you all have met by the very fact
that we are here together this afternoon, which is our willingness and
ability to stand up and fight for it.   
   
Because you see, the way I think about democracy: I think of it —
there’s a duality, actually.  Democracies are strong when they are
intact, when they do what they are supposed to do: They empower people. 
They provide a foundation that allows for stability, and with that comes
all of the things we care about in terms of productivity, prosperity. 
Democracies can be very strong.  
   
Democracy is also extremely fragile and precious.  If we do not fight,
if we are not vigilant in standing up for it, it will fall, it will
fail, it will falter.  
   
So that’s how I think about where we are right now.  And elections
matter.  Elections matter.   
  
Had you all not done the hard work that you did in 2020, electing Joe
Biden and me, we would not have been able to do the work that we knew
needed to be done.  
  
Remember, our inauguration was after January 6th.  We came in during the
height of a pandemic.  Our standing around the world was very weak with
many of our longstanding friends and allies.  
  
But because of the work that you all did, because of who our President
is, we were able to bring Europe together at a time where — you all may
remember, not very long ago — folks like Emmanuel Macron were
questioning the existence of NATO and its reason for being.  You
remember that.  
  
But we came in, because of the hard work you all did, and pulled NATO
back together, stronger than it’s ever been, so that yesterday, the
Senate took a vote to include two more countries in NATO, strengthening
it and adding to it — (applause) — because of what you all did. 
Elections matter.  
  
We said that we as Democrats stand for a strong country, and we know
that vital to that is that we support the children of America.  So we
passed a Child Tax Credit extension, which lifted almost 40 percent of
children in poverty out of poverty in just the first year.  
  
We did the work of saying we need to invest in our infrastructure, and
have an infrastructure law now in place that will allow us to remove
lead from pipes, which folks from Flint to Oakland have been talking
about, in terms of the poisonous water children — in particular, poor
children — have been drinking, which has led to learning disabilities
and health outcomes.  
  
We’ve done the work of renewing a commitment to what we must do to deal
with the crisis affecting our environment, which is leading to wildfires
in my home state of California, floods and hurricanes, and what we’re
seeing in Kentucky in terms of, unknown still, casualties.  
  
This is the work we did because elections matter.  You all came out in
2020.  We — *we* — won, and we were able to do this work.   
  
Elections matter.  In the midterms in 96 days, these elections will
matter in that we need to elect two more senators.  We need to hold on
to the Senate and get two more, because Joe said he will not let the
filibuster stand in the way of the Women’s Health Protection Act and the
John Lewis Voting Rights Act.  (Applause.)  Two more senators.  That’s
what we need.  
  
Elections matter.  It matters.  You know, you all know I spent a large
part of my career as a prosecutor.  Elections matter in terms of who is
the county prosecutor, especially when you have extremist so-called
leaders passing laws that will criminalize public health professionals
and punish women.  
  
Elections matter.  Voting rights.  Who is secretary of state.  Elections
matter.  Who is governor; who is going to sign those outrageous bills
being passed by extremist so-called leaders or veto them.  
  
So the work that you all are doing to support this effort matters in a
tremendous way, in particular when we are looking at the stakes being so
high.  And for all of those reasons, I thank you all.  I do believe that
we are up for this battle.  
  
I was speaking with some historians recently, and the — you know, this
is not the first time our nation has faced a moment like this.  And we
do get through it.  History has shown us that.  But it’s not without a
fight and not without a commitment to standing together, knowing we have
so much more in common than what separates us and that we believe in our
country and we love our country.  
  
So, with that, I thank you all very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.) 
Thank you.
