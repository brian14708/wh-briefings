1:14 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, good afternoon.  Today, we received another
outstanding jobs report: 528,000 jobs were added just last month to this
country’s employment.  528,000 jobs.  
   
We have now nearly doubled what we — we’re almost to 10 million jobs —
almost to 10 million jobs since I took office.  And that’s the fastest
job growth in history.  
   
Today, we also matched the lowest unemployment rate in America in the
last 50 years: 3.5 percent.  Yes, 3.5 percent.  
   
Today, there are more people working in America than before the pandemic
began.  In fact, there are more people working in America than at any
point in American history.  
   
You know, what we’re also seeing is something that just a few years ago
many experts said was literally impossible: the revitalization of
American manufacturing.  
   
Since I took office, we’ve created 642,000 American manufacturing jobs
in America.  We’ve seen the biggest and the fastest job recovery in
American manufacturing history since the ‘50s.  
   
And some people may have given up on American manufacturing.  But the
American people didn’t, and I know I never did.  That’s why I made it
“Make it in America” — that phrase — “Make it in America — the
cornerstone of my economic plan.  
   
And today’s report proves “Make it in America” isn’t just a slogan, it’s
\[in\] my administration.  It’s a reality.  
   
I’ve also made it a priority to bring down the federal deficit.  After
watching my predecessor every single year increase the debt — the
federal deficit — every year, for the four years he was in office, I
said, “No more.”  The days of exploding federal deficits are over.  
   
And I’ve kept my word.  Just take a look at the facts.  The deficit is
down a record of $1.7 trillion this year.  That’s right — $1.7 trillion,
with a “T”.  
   
And that’s on top of a $350 billion reduction to the deficit my first
year in office.  
   
Now, I know people will hear today’s extraordinary jobs report and say
they don’t see it, they don’t feel it in their own lives.  I know how
hard it is.  I know it’s hard to feel good about job creation when you
already have a job and you’re dealing with rising prices, food and gas,
and so much more.  I get it.   
   
I literally can remember sitting at my mom and dad’s dining room table
and watching them choose which bills they’re going to this — that month
because there wasn’t enough money to pay all the bills.  I get it. 
That’s why I’m doing everything in my power to lower the costs for
families. 

You know, we’ve seen some progress.  Gas prices are coming down. 
They’re down almost a dollar a gallon where — from where they were just
a month ago.  And, you know, we’re making progress.  
   
We now have more than 50 straight days of falling gas prices in this
country.  
   
The price at the pump is now less than $3.99 a gallon at more than half
of the gas stations in America.  
   
In fact, $3.79 a gallon is now the most common price paid at the pump in
the country — $3.79.  
   
While — while we’re not there yet, we’re on the cusp of passing the most
important step we can pass to take Con- — help Congress — to help us
lower inflation: the Inflation Reduction Act.  
   
That bill will lower prescription drug costs by giving Medicare the
power to negotiate for lower drug prices.  Lower drug prices.  That’s
something the American people have pro- — been promised for years, for
decades, and we’re on the verge of finally getting that done.  
   
The bill also keeps down healthcare insurance costs by keeping
healthcare premiums, for the — those on the Affordable Care Act down
$2,400 a year.   
   
It will make historic investments in clean energy — clean energy,
security.  The security of the country is at stake.  We’re going to save
American families hundreds of dollars a year on paying their energy
bills by allowing them to have money to invest by getting — allowing
them to put in new windows and doors and solar panels and the like, and
get tax credits for that.  
   
It also is going to restore some fairness to the tax code by imposing
corporate minimum tax of 15 percent on billion-dollar companies.  That
will put an end to what we’ve seen in the recent years, where 55 of the
largest companies in America — the Fortune 500 — paid zero federal taxes
on income over $40 billion combined in profit.  
   
This bill is going to reduce the deficit by another $300 billion.  
   
And one more point.  This bill will not — let me repeat this: This bill
will not — will not raise taxes on anybody making less than $400,000 a
year.  
   
When it comes to the benefits of this bill, you don’t have to take my
word for it.  Nearly 130 economists; 7 Nobel laureates in econ- — on the
economists — on economics, I should say; former Secretaries of Treasury;
Federal Reserve — former Federal Reserve Vice Chair; former director of
the Congressional Budget Office wrote that this bill will, quote,
combine — they wr- — signed, quote, will “fight inflation and lower
costs for American families while setting the stage for strong, stable,
and broadly shared long-term economic growth.”   
   
In short, this bill is a gamechanger for working families  
and our economy.  
   
I look forward to the Senate taking up this legislation and passing it
as soon as possible.  
   
You know, I know most families are focused on just putting three meals
on the table, taking care of their kids, and paying their bills. 
Helping you do that is my job.  That’s a President’s job as well.   
   
I have one more job, which is not only to focus on getting America
through the economic challenges we’re facing, but to look to the future
to make sure we’re building an economy that — that meets the needs of
American families to be able to succeed and for America to win the
future.  
   
When you step back, today’s jobs report is part of a broader story.  
   
For decades, the American economy has been struggling even before the
pandemic.  Middle-class Americans were working harder, but they were
falling further behind.  All the rewards in the economy seemed to be
going to those at the very top.

When I came to office, I was determined to change that.  
   
I ran for President saying I was going to restore the backbone of
America — the middle class — and grow the economy from the bottom up and
the middle out, not from the top down.  Because when the middle class
does well, everybody does well.  Everybody.  The wealthy do very well,
and the poor have a way up.  
   
My economic plan rests on five pillars:

Get America back to work at a record pace.  All Americans.  All
Americans, leaving no one behind.  And we’re doing just that.  
   
In the process, for the first time in a long time, workers are being
empowered.  Instead of workers begging employers for work, we’re seeing
employers have to compete for American workers.  
   
And we’re seeing a resurgence of working organiz- — worker organizations
and unionization.  When I — where I come from, that’s a good thing, and
it’s long overdue.  
   
Two, we’re literally rebuilding this nation — our roads, our bridges,
our ports, our airports, clean water, high-speed Internet for all
Americans.  For too long, America has failed to invest in itself.  We
changed that this year with the biggest investment in America since
Eisenhower’s Interstate Highway System.  
   
We’re now committing to rebuild America not just for tomorrow, but for
the next decade.  And that includes not only investments in things like
roads and bridges, but investments in research and development, the
next-generation technologies from artificial intelligence, to quantum
computing, to semiconductors that are all going to remake the world.  
   
As I said earlier, we’re going to build it in Amer- — build it here in
America.  
   
Let me be clear: We are going to invest it in America.  We’re going to
make it in America.  We’re going to win the economic competition of the
21st century in America.  
   
Three, give working people and the middle class a fighting chance — more
than just a little breathing room, a real chance to get ahead — by
making their everyday things more affordable and accessible, like
healthcare, prescription drug costs, energy, childcare, education,
housing, and so much more, because when we lower those costs of all the
necessary things, we improve their standard of living.  
   
Four, make our economy more competitive and less concentrated.  When too
few companies dominate a market, it — that reduces competition, drives
up the costs for American consumers.  
   
That’s been going on for too long.  We need to give small businesses and
entrepreneurs more opportunities and consumers more choices at the
afford- — at affordable prices.  
   
The fifth thing — five — the fifth pillar: We’re going to reward work,
not just wealth, in America so that everyone pays their fair share in
taxes.  
   
I’m a capitalist.  I’m not trying to punish anybody.  But I’m saying
everyone — everyone should pay their fair share.  Just their fair
share.   
   
America is a nation that was built on work.  We can never lose sight of
that.  That’s why the strength and pace of our job recovery is so
important.  
   
In the past, it has taken years for Americans to recover from an
economic crisis that we inherited.  And when that’s happened, millions
of people suffered for years and years just trying to get back to where
they were before — just trying to get back on their feet.  But that
didn’t happen this time.  
   
You know, my dad used to say that a job is about a lot more than a
paycheck.  It’s about your dignity.  It’s about respect.  It’s about
your place in the community.  And it’s about being able to look your
child in the eye and say, “Honey, it’s going to be okay,” and mean it.  
   
That’s the economy I’m determined to build today.  That’s the economy
I’m looking at.   
   
Now, part of changing the way things have been done in the past is by
restoring the faith of the American people in their government.  
   
Today, I’m going to be signing, very shortly, two bipartisan bills —
bipartisan bills that begin to restore that faith.   
   
A key driver of our economic recovery is the resurgence of American
small business.  Small businesses hire as many people as the — as the
major corporations.  We just learned last week that small businesses
with less than 50 employees created nearly 3 million jobs in 2021. 
Three million.  That’s the most ever in a single year.  
   
And more Americans applied to start new businesses than ever before in
our history.  And part of our plan is making sure that when we commit
funds to help America’s small businesses, it actually goes to those
small businesses they’re supposed to go to.   
   
We know that the last administration, that’s not what happened.  
   
Too much of small business relief funding, which was passed by the
Congress, ended up in the hands of those who either didn’t need it or
criminal syndicates who outright stole the money.  
   
Not only did the Trump administration let the biggest businesses with
the teams of lawyers and accountants skip to the front of the line, my
predecessor undermined the watchdogs who are supposed to be on the job
to make sure relief went to mom-and-pop businesses who were supposed to
get it in the first place.  
   
In my State of the Union address, I made it clear the watchdogs are
back.  And that’s why the Justice Department named a chief prosecutor
for pandemic fraud who got to work right away.  
   
In June of this year, the chief prosecutor told Congress that it was
essential — essential — to extend the statute of limitations for certain
pandemic fraud to extend to 10 years to make sure fraudsters can’t run
out the clock.  
   
Congress acted.  And today, I’m signing two bipartisan bills that will
give the federal and local prosecutors more time to hold criminals
accountable for defrauding the American people during a
once-in-a-century pandemic.  
   
Look, the American people deserve to know that their tax dollars are
being spent as intended.  
   
My message to those cheats out there is this: You can’t hide.  We’re
going to find you.  We’re going to make you pay back what you stole and
hold you accountable under the law.  
   
I want to thank the members of both parties in the House and Senate for
getting these bills to my desk.  
   
And now, I’m going to sign them into law as proof of another piece of my
economic plan: the belief that in the United States of America, there is
nothing beyond our capacity — nothing — when we work together as the
United States of America.  That’s what these bills represent: We work
together.   
   
God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops.  
   
Okay.  
   
(The bill is signed.)  
   
I just signed the Paycheck Protection Program — the PPP — and Bank Fraud
Enforcement Harmonization Act.   
   
Now I’m going to sign the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Fraud Statute of
Limitations.  
   
(The bill is signed.)  
   
Yeah, thank you very much.  I know it’s hot out here for you all, but
thank you.   
   
Q    Can you give us a comment on Brittney Griner, sir?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m hopeful.  We’re working hard.
