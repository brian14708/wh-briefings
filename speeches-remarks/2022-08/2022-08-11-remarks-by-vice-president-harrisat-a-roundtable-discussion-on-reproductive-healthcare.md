THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Good afternoon.  I want to thank these
extraordinary leaders — the leaders of California — who, as always, are
leaders of this great state but also national leaders on so many
critical and important issues — and, in particular, on this one.  
   
As the President and I have said, as we all recognize, we are facing a
healthcare crisis in America, as highlighted by the Dobbs decision that
came down several weeks ago.   
   
So, I will address that, but I, first, would like to say a few words
about our nation’s economy because we had some good news this week.   
   
We learned yesterday that our nation had zero percent inflation in the
month of July.  We saw drops in the price of gas, clothing, household
appliances, and more.   
   
And combined with other progress we have made, as it relates to the
economy, we have created, just last month alone, over half a million
jobs, which makes it over 9 million jobs over the course of the last 18
months, which means we have recovered all the jobs that were lost in the
pandemic.  Unemployment is at 3.5 percent, which is the lowest number in
half a century.   
   
So, there is good work to report in terms of the focus that our
administration and President Biden has had on bringing down the cost of
life and living for the American people.   
   
And to implement our vision of supporting working families and
supporting folks who deserve to be seen and heard, together with the
leaders in this room, in our first year, with an extension on the Child
Tax Credit, we cut poverty in America by 40 percent.   
   
We rescued small businesses.  During the course of the pandemic, there
were so many, in particular here in California, that were in dire need
of support.   
   
We have, through the Infrastructure Law, made a commitment with tens of
billions of dollars to upgrade the infrastructure of our nation.  And as
we know in California, we got a lot — lots of roads and bridges that
need that reinforcement and need that support.   
   
Our administration has dedicated tens of billions of dollars to
high-speed Internet.  As highlighted during the pandemic, we still have
far too many folks and families who either don’t have access to
high-speed Internet or cannot afford it.  So that has been a priority of
our administration, in addition to addressing the very important work of
doing what Californians have always been a leader on, which is thinking
and taking seriously the precious nature of our environment and what we
must do to save it.  
   
And we were very proud of the work that has happened recently.  And the
President will soon be signing a law that will invest $370 billion to
address the climate crisis in America.   
   
So, with that, I want to thank the leaders here because you have been
extraordinary in both pushing that these types of improvements would
take place, but also in partnering to ensure that what happens in
Washington, D.C., actually hits the streets of America and, in
particular, the people of California.  
   
Because of your work, folks are experiencing, I think, the benefit of
this hard work.  And, of course, there’s more to be done.   
   
So, with that, I want to thank everyone here and then address the topic
of our conversation this afternoon.  
   
The United States Supreme Court, in the Dobbs decision, did something
that is unheard of in our country — our country, which holds itself out
to be a model of democracy around the world.  We walk into rooms around
the world holding ourselves out to be the strongest democracy when it
comes to the importance of rule of law, respecting rights.  We walk into
rooms around the world and we talk about the importance of human rights,
of consistency, of justice.   
   
Yet, the United States Supreme Court, in the Dobbs decision, took a
constitutional right, that had been recognized, from the people of
America, from the women of America.   
   
And what we have seen around the country are extremist, so-called
leaders who are passing laws designed to criminalize healthcare
providers and punish women — laws that are being passed that make no
exception for rape or incest.   
   
And as my friends and former colleagues at this table know, as a former
prosecutor for quite some time, I specialized in child sexual assault
cases, in violence against women and children.  
   
The idea that states would be passing laws that would take from an
individual their right to self-determination after they have endured
such an atrocious act of violence is unconscionable.  
  
These are the kinds of things that are happening around our country. 
But not in California.  But not in California.  Because here, we have
leaders who understand the importance of the principles upon which our
nation was founded, which are the principle of freedom and liberty; the
importance of recognizing that in a democracy that champions the concept
of freedom and the liberty, the government should not be in the
position, nor should it have a right, to make the most intimate and
personal decisions that anyone can make about heart and home.  
  
Because in California, we understand it should be her decision and, if
she chooses, in consultation with her faith leader, her family, those
she trusts, but it should not be the government.  
  
In California, we understand one does not have to abandon their faith or
their beliefs to agree the government should not be making that decision
for someone else.  
  
So I am here today to talk with, to listen to these extraordinary
Californians, who are national leaders, to talk about how we can
continue to do what has been happening here, which is to fight for the
rights of women, for all people, to self-determination, to their ability
to make decisions.  Because we, here, trust women.  We trust people to
know what is in their own best interest, as opposed to having their
government tell them what is in their best interest.  
  
So, with that, again, I thank the leaders who are here.  We will discuss
some of the work that our administration has been doing and the
collaboration that has occurred already and will continue to occur
between our administration and the various states and, in particular,
the great state of California.  
  
So, with that, I’m going to turn the mic over to the Senate pro tem,
Toni Atkins.  
  
(The roundtable discussion commences.)
