  \ of the Interagency Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare\_Access"

Indian Treaty Room  
Eisenhower Executive Office Building

THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Vice President Harris, for leading today’s
meeting.  And thanks to you, all of you, especially Health and Human
Services Secretary Becerra and Director of the Gender Policy Council Jen
Klein for co-chairing this task force, and Attorney General Garland,
Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas, and Veterans Affairs Secretary
McDonough for your work on this task force to protect access to a
woman’s right to choose reproductive healthcare in the wake of the
Supreme Court’s extreme decision on wiping out a 50-year constitutional
precedent of Roe v. Wade.   
   
You know, I created this task force by executive order last month and —
to ensure that every part of the federal government does its part at
this critical moment where women’s health and lives are on the line
amidst chaos and uncertainty unleashed by this decision.  
   
Emergency medical care being denied to women experiencing miscarriages. 
Doctors uncertain about what they can do to provide for their patients. 
Pharmacists unsure whether they can fill prescriptions that they’ve
always filled before.  A tragic cases of rape survivors, including a
10-year-old girl forced to travel to another state for care.   
   
You know, and wiping out the right to choose on — whether you have
incest, abortion — I mean, excuse me, incest or having a rape or — I
mean, it just — this is just extreme.  You know, even the life of the
mother is in question in some case — in some states.  
   
Republicans in Congress and their extreme MAGA ideology are determined
to go even further, talking about nationwide bans that would outlaw
abortion in every state, under every circumstance, going after the
broader right to privacy as well.  
   
But as I’ve said before, this fight is not over.  And we saw that last
night in Kansas.   
   
In the opinion of people on — in the opinion of the Dobbs case, the
extreme majority of the Supreme Court wrote, “women…” — this is a quote
from that case — “women are not without electoral or political power.” 
Unquote.   
   
The Court practically dared the women in this country to go to the
ballot box and restore the right to choose that the Court had just
ripped away after 50 years  
   
And as I said last night — last month, I don’t think the Court has — has
any notion, for that matter — or the Republican Party, for that matter —
to decide that -– how -– how far to press their extreme agenda and how
women are going to respond.  They don’t have a clue about the power of
American women.   
   
Last night in Congress — in Kansas, they found out.  Women and men did
exercise their electoral and political power.  With a record turnout,
voters of Kansas defeated a ballot initiative to remove the right to
choose an abortion from the Kansas constitution.  It was in the Kansas
constitution. They’re trying to strike it and eliminate it from the
Kansas constitution.  
   
In a decisive vote, in a decisive victory, voters made it clear that
politicians should not interfere with the fundamental rights of women.  
   
And the voters of Kansas sent a powerful signal that this fall, the
American people will vote to preserve and protect their right and refuse
to let them be ripped away by politicians.  And my administration has
their back.  
   
You know, today, I’m signing a second executive order — I’m about to
sign — that responds to the healthcare crisis that has unfolded since
the Supreme Court overturned Roe and that women are facing all across
America.  
   
The healthcare crisis is –- you know, it’s just -– it’s hard for me to
even under- — understand how they think this.  The healthcare crisis is
women can’t get -– can’t choose, can’t get an abortion even in a case of
incest, even in the case of rape.  
   
But it goes beyond that.  There are a lot of women who take
prescriptions prescribed by their doctors and have been taking for some
time for other conditions — for arthritis, for epilepsy, for Crohn’s
disease.  And in many cases, these prescriptions are not being filled.  
   
Say a 25-year-old woman — her doctor prescribes medication for her
epilepsy.  She’s been doing it for a while.  She goes to the pharmacy. 
The pharmacist won’t fill the prescription because the same medicine
could also cause a miscarriage.  So if she’s not getting the medicine
she needs for her epilepsy whether she’s pregnant or not.  A pharmacy
has no right to do that.  
   
Just yesterday in Idaho, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit to make
sure that pregnant women facing serious threats to their health can get
the medical care they need in Medicare-funded emergency rooms.  
   
Under federal law, no woman — whether pregnant or not, no matter where
she lives — should be turned away or denied necessary treatment during a
medical crisis.  
   
The Justice Department stepped in to make sure that this extreme state
law criminalizing abortion does not put women’s health and lives at risk
in these situations.  
   
You know, this executive order also helps women travel out of state for
medical care.  Secretary Becerra is going to work with states through
the Medicaid to allow them to provide reproductive healthcare for women
who live in states where — where abortions are being banned in that
state.  
   
The executive order makes sure healthcare providers comply with federal
law so women don’t face delays or denials of medically necessary care.  
   
And this executive order advances research and data collection to
evaluate the impact that this reproductive health crisis is having on —
on maternal health and other health conditions and outcomes.  
   
This executive order builds on the first one I signed last month that
created this task force in the first place and that also will help
safeguard access to healthcare, including the right to choose and
contraception.  It promotes safety and security of clinics, patients,
and providers.  It protects patients’ privacy and access to accurate
information.  
   
Let me close with this: Beyond the actions you’re taking, I know that,
along with Kamala, many of you have been traveling the country listening
to women, healthcare providers, legal experts, state and local officials
and legislators, and others so that we are doing all we can in my
administration to protect the rights of — health and safety of the
people in this country.  You know, their perspectives are going to
inform the work of this task force and the recommendations you make to
me.  
   
I believe Roe got it right, and it has been the law for close to 50
years.  And I commit to the American people that we’re doing everything
in our power to safeguard access to healthcare, including the right to
choose that women had under Roe v. Wade, which was ripped away by this
extreme court.  
   
But ultimately, Congress must codify the protections of Roe as federal
law.  And if Congress fails to act, the people of this country need to
elect senators and representatives who will restore Roe and will protect
the right to privacy, freedom, and equality.  
   
I’ll stop there and turn this over to the Vice President.  There’s so
much more to say, but I’m anxious to hear from all of you.  Thank you. 
Thank you.  Thank you.  
   
Do I sign this order now?  I’m going to sign this executive order right
now, okay?  
   
(The President signs the executive order.)  
   
Okay, folks, we got a lot of work to do.  But, Madam Vice President, I’m
sure you can get it done sitting there with all those folks.   
   
Thank you.  
   
I wish I were with you in person, quite frankly.  But I’m getting
there.   
   
You’re on mute.  I can’t hear you.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  We feel your presence, Mr. President. 
(Laughter.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  Well, I wish I were —  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, President Joe Biden has set the tone for our
administration from the very beginning — from the time that an opinion
was leaked, to the time the Dobbs decision came down.   
   
And our President has been a leader in saying that the women of America
should be protected; their right to make decisions about their own
bodies should be a matter that we all defend, understanding that the
government should not be in the business of making those decisions for
the women of America.   
   
Our administration has been very clear, as is clear by the leaders who
are at this table, that we trust the judgment of the women of America to
make decisions based on what they know is in their best interests.  We
trust the women of America to make those decisions, if she chooses, in
consultation with her faith leader, with her physician, with her loved
one.  But we understand fully the government should not be making that
decision for her.   
   
And it is with that spirit that the President has convened this task
force of these leaders to ensure that we have a whole-of-government
approach to our work, understanding that every day in America —
especially with these extremist so-called “leaders” in states passing
these laws, some of which will criminalize healthcare providers and
punish women — that we do everything in our power and our ability, based
on our role, to ensure that we protect the women of America around some
of the most intimate decisions that any human being can make.   
   
So, it is with that spirit and purpose that we convene and we meet.  We
will be engaged in an in-depth discussion about the role of the various
agencies and the Cabinet members and their roles of leadership around
this important issue.   
   
As the President said, the people of Kansas spoke yesterday, and they
spoke loud and clear.  They said this is not a partisan issue.  The
women of America should not be the subject of partisan debate or
perspective.   
   
The people of Kansas spoke and said this is a matter of defense of basic
principles of liberty and freedom in America.  And they spoke loudly in
saying that they trust women to make decisions about their own lives and
their bodies.  And they said government should not be mandating those
decisions for the women of America.   
   
So, today, we are prepared to do the work that is necessary.  We will
discuss what we have done so far as an administration, and we will
discuss what we are prepared to do going forward.   
   
I have been traveling the country in recent weeks, talking with, in
particular, community-based leaders, healthcare providers, state
legislatures and legislators.  I’ve convened faith-based leaders.  We
have convened disability rights activists, people from various sectors
of our country to talk about this issue.   
   
And I will tell you: People are scared.  When they look at these laws
that are being passed and they understand what it means for themselves
or someone they love, they are concerned.  They are confused.  
   
When you look at a map — which I have here somewhere — in terms of what
this means in our country — and I don’t have the map at the moment; my
staff will tell me where that map is at the moment.  (Laughs.)  But what
we know is that there is a need for clarity around the rights of
individuals and states in this moment.    
   
And so, General Merrick Garland will talk about what the Department of
Justice is prepared to do.  We know that there are concerns about the
kind of support that is available in terms of federal resources to the
various states that are protecting the rights of women and what our
administration can do to support that.   
   
We will be discussing what we need to do to address the profound
misinformation and disinformation that is out there and can only thrive
in an environment where there is confusion about what is the right
approach and what is the law.   
   
So these are some of the topics that we will be discussing.  But, again,
all convened with an understanding and an appreciation for the fact that
this, as the President has said, represents a healthcare crisis in
America where women, every day in our country, whoever they voted for in
any election, understand what is at stake for themselves, their family,
and their future.   
   
And so with that, I thank all of the leaders who are here.  I look
forward to our discussion.  And because I promised that I have a map,
I’m going to now show you that map.  (Holds up map of the United States
of America.)  And you don’t need to necessarily be able to read the
words on the map, but you can see the color-coding, to understand this
map represents our current assessment of the various laws that exist
right now in these United States of America — different approaches in
different states to this issue, which some might argue has been, by
design, to intentionally confuse people about their rights.   
   
But what, in fact, it has done without any question is made clear that
the President’s leadership, the leadership of the President’s Cabinet
and all of us at this table is critically necessary at this moment.   
   
So, with that, I thank everyone for being here.   And — and I will now
turn it over to our — the head of our Gender Policy Council, Jen Klein. 
Thank you.
