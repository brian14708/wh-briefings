*Oakland International Airport  
Oakland, California*  

Q    Madam Vice President, the bill looks like it just passed.  What’s
your reaction?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  It’s a historic day.  When — listen, the
President’s agenda has been, since the day we took office, we were going
to bring down costs for the American people.  And today, you’re seeing
that, for example, on the healthcare issue and the extreme expense that
healthcare costs the American people — in particular, our seniors. 
Insulin is going to be capped at $35 a month.  
   
The climate crisis.  We’re here in California.  We’re seeing it across
the nation — the extreme weather and what it is doing to displace and to
cause death in many regions of the country.  We have to get in front of
this.  America needs to be a leader on this.  It’s historic — a $370
billion investment in the climate crisis.  It’s going to put America
back to where we should be as a leader globally.  
   
But it’s also going to be an investment in infrastructure. It’s going to
be an investment in jobs — all of the work that needs to happen to allow
us to be resilient and to put resources into what is a real threat for
not only our nation but the world.  
   
So, it’s a good day.  
   
Q    I know that you’ve been very busy today, but as a former
prosecutor, do you have any reaction to the unsealed search warrant that
was served on President Donald Trump?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, as a former prosecutor, I will tell you, I
don’t speak about anybody else’s case.  But I have full confidence that
the Department of Justice will do what the facts and the law requires.  
   
Q    How about some of the rhetoric that’s coming out from Trump’s
allies?  Do you have any reaction to the attempted attack on a FBI field
office yesterday?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I will say, as a former prosecutor, but as a
citizen of our nation, any attacks on law enforcement are completely
unacceptable.  And any so-called leader who engages in rhetoric that in
any way suggests that that law enforcement should be exposed to that
kind of danger is irresponsible and can result in dangerous
activities.  
   
You know, our law enforcement professionals — and, in this case, we’re
talking about our federal law enforcement agencies — they do very
important work.  And from the moment they walk out the door of their
home until they go back in, their families pray for their safety and
well-being.  
   
And I think it’s just highly irresponsible of anyone who calls
themselves a leader and certainly anyone who represents the United
States of America to engage in rhetoric for the sake of some political
objective that can result in harm to law enforcement officers and
agents.  
   
Q    One last question on legislation.  Do you think Democrats can get
another major piece passed before the midterms?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Let us celebrate one win at a time.  (Laughs.)  But
thank you for the question.  
   
Take care.  
   
                          END
