THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, everyone.  I want to thank these
extraordinary leaders, these education leaders for being here — for
traveling to be here for this important discussion and for the work that
you each do every day building the future of our nation and our world. 
So, thank you each.   
   
I want to first address this weekend and the historic significance of
the legislation that the Senate passed.  Thanks to our President Joe
Biden and his leadership, we are on the verge of signing into law the
Inflation Reduction Act.    
   
And to put this in context, this piece of legislation will be the
largest investment ever made to address the climate crisis.  We are
watching it — (applause) — indeed.   
   
And with the Inflation Reduction Act, we’re looking at an investment of
just about $370 billion to address the crisis that is clear every time
we turn on the television, from what’s happening on the West Coast with
fires, to hurricanes and floods.    
   
This piece of legislation will allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices,
which we know — when we think about the cost of life, the cost of
living, the burden of the cost of getting through the day — drug prices
are a huge part of what is weighing down American families.    
   
 We are going to see a cap on insulin for seniors of $35 a month, not to
mention the lowering of healthcare premium costs.   
   
 And — and as we say because it is the case, corporations are going to
pay their fair share.   
   
So this is happening as part of the vision that the President and I laid
out during the beginning of our administration, which is about taking on
the challenges of the moment — and that related, of course, to the
pandemic and what that was in terms of the need to get vaccinations to
folks and get people back to work, to what we have always intended to
do.  And we are seeing the progress of building a strong and prosperous
America.   
   
So, when we look at this and where we are right now, we are very proud
of the fact that in delivering for American families, we brought 40
percent of children out of poverty in our first year; lifted 40 percent
of America’s children out of poverty in our first year.    
   
We rescued small businesses.  We’ve seen historic job growth; in fact,
we calculate at least 9 million jobs created.  So we are now — and have
put all of those jobs back in play in terms of the jobs that were lost
during the pandemic.  And we are looking at the historic lowering of
unemployment — in fact, the lowest unemployment that we have experienced
in our country in half a century.   
   
So, I say all that to say that we’re proud of these accomplishments and
the fact that NATO is strong, and we’re actually going to grow by two
members; and a bipartisan bill to address what we need in terms of
reasonable gun safety; along with, of course, the — the nomination and
the confirmation of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and what that means in
terms of representation on our highest court; and the President’s right
decision, as it related to removing the head of al Qaeda.   
   
So, all of that to say there is good work that has been done, but we
recognize there is more to do.   
   
And so, on the topic at hand, these leaders are leading at an
extraordinary time, for many reasons.  They are building the future of
our nation to meet the challenges of the moment.  But we are also doing
that in the context of a decision by the United States Supreme Court to
take a constitutional right — that had been recognized — from the people
of America, from the women of America.  
   
And let’s note that we also understand and know that the majority of
women who will be impacted by this decision are between the ages of 20
and 29.  And so, many of them are college-age or will be attending
college.  And so, I’m gathered with a group of higher education
presidents and chancellors and with our Secretary of Education to
discuss how this issue will uniquely impact the women of that age range
and how it will impact, more specifically, women who are at — attending
our colleges and universities.   
   
The principles that are at stake are, of course, that we must trust the
women of America to make those most intimate decisions for themselves
and, if they choose, in consultation with their family members, with
their faith leader, and with their physician.  But the government should
not be making this decision for her.    
   
And when we consider the reality of women in college, we know there are
specific issues that will impact them.  And we’ve been hearing from
them.  We know that women in college are uniquely impacted by
restrictions on reproductive rights in that, one, women on college
campuses — and this is the sad truth — are three times more likely to
experience sexual violence.   
   
We know that many women in college have academic responsibilities, many
of them may be working as well to get themselves through college and pay
for tuition in a way that will limit their ability to travel and will
certainly make it almost impossible in terms of their ability not only
to leave school but to afford to travel to where they may receive
reproductive healthcare.   
   
So our administration has taken action to protect the reproductive care
that is available and accessible to the women of America.  In
particular, the President has signed two executive orders which will
protect reproductive healthcare, including permitting states to use
Medicaid funds to help women travel and — engage in interstate travel
for care — within, of course, the limits of the Hyde Amendment.   
   
Also, our Department of Justice — the United States Department of
Justice has brought a lawsuit challenging the Idaho abortion ban and is
clearly prepared to do more in terms of litigation as necessary to
ensure that there is no conflict between these state laws and the
federal law, which requires access to — guaranteed access to emergency
care.   
   
I’ll close with saying this: Our colleges and universities are doing
extraordinary work.  And I know of work that is happening, in
particular, around considering ways to protect students access to care
by instituting, for example, flexible attendance and leave policies so
that students can seek care; by creating emergency funds so that
students can afford care; and by clarifying confidentiality and privacy
policies for campus health services.  So there is good work happening
here.    
   
And I really look forward to the conversation that we will have with
these leaders, especially during these trying times.   
   
And so, with that, I’m going to turn it over to the Secretary of
Education, Cardona, to moderate and to start our discussion.
