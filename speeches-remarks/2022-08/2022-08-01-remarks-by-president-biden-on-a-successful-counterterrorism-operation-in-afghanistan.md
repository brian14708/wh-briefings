THE PRESIDENT:  My fellow Americans, on Saturday, at my direction, the
United States successfully concluded an airstrike in Kabul, Afghanistan,
that killed the emir of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri.   
   
You know, al-Zawahiri was bin Laden’s leader.  He was with him all the —
the whole time.  He was his number-two man, his deputy at the time of
the terrorist attack of 9/11.  He was deeply involved in the planning of
9/11, one of the most responsible for the attacks that murdered 2,977
people on American soil.   
   
For decades, he was a mastermind behind attacks against Americans,
including the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000, which killed 17 American
sailors and wounded dozens more.   
   
He played a key role — a key role in the bombing of U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania, killing 224 and wounding over 4,500 others.  
   
He carved a trail of murder and violence against American citizens,
American service members, American diplomats, and American interests. 
And since the United States delivered justice to bin Laden 11 years ago,
Zawahiri has been a leader of al Qaeda — the leader.   
   
From hiding, he coordinated al Qaeda’s branches and all around the world
— including setting priorities, for providing operational guidance that
called for and inspired attacks against U.S. targets.   
   
He made videos, including in recent weeks, calling for his followers to
attack the United States and our allies.  
   
Now justice has been delivered, and this terrorist leader is no more.  
   
People around the world no longer need to fear the vicious and
determined killer.  The United States continues to demonstrate our
resolve and our capacity to defend the American people against those who
seek to do us harm.  
   
You know, we — we make it clear again tonight that no matter how long it
takes, no matter where you hide, if you are a threat to our people, the
United States will find you and take you out.   
   
After relentlessly seeking Zawahiri for years under Presidents Bush,
Obama, and Trump, our intelligence community located Zawahiri earlier
this year.  He had moved to downtown Kabul to reunite with members of
his immediate family.   
   
After carefully considering the clear and convincing evidence of his
location, I authorized a precision strike that would remove him from the
battlefield once and for all.  
   
This mission was carefully planned and rigorously minimized the risk of
harm to other civilians.  And one week ago, after being advised that the
conditions were optimal, I gave the final approval to go get him, and
the mission was a success.  None of his family members were hurt, and
there were no civilian casualties.  
   
I’m sharing this news with the American people now, after confirming the
mission’s total success through the painstaking work of our
counterterrorism community and key allies and partners.   
   
My administration has kept congressional leaders informed as well.  
   
When I ended our military mission in Afghanistan almost a year ago, I
made the decision that after 20 years of war, the United States no
longer needed thousands of boots on the ground  
in Afghanistan to protect America from terrorists who seek to do us
harm.  
   
And I made a promise to the American people that we’d continue to
conduct effective counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan and
beyond.  
   
We’ve done just that.  
   
In February, our forces conducted a daring mission in Syria  
that eliminated the emir of ISIS.  
   
Last month, we took out another key ISIS leader.  Now we have eliminated
the emir of al Qaeda.  He will never again — never again allow
Afghanistan to become a terrorist safe haven because he is gone, and
we’re going to make sure that nothing else happens.  You know, it can’t
be a launching pad against the United States.  We’re going to see to it
that won’t happen.  
   
This operation is a clear demonstration that we will, we can, and we’ll
always make good on the sol- — solemn pledge.   
   
My administration will continue to vigilantly monitor and address
threats from al Qaeda, no matter where they emanate from.  
   
As Commander-in-Chief, it is my solemn responsibility to make America
safe in a dangerous world.  The United States did not seek this war
against terror.  It came to us, and we answered with the same principles
and resolve that have shaped us for generation upon generation: to
protect the innocent, defend liberty, and we keep the light of freedom
burning — a beacon for the rest of the entire world.  
   
Because this is the great and defining truth about our nation and our
people: We do not break.  We never give in.  We never back down.  
   
Last year, on September 11th, I once more paid my respects to Ground
Zero in New York City, at that quiet field in Shanksville, at the
Pentagon — and at the Pentagon.  
   
Standing at the memorial at Ground Zero, seeing the names of those who
died forever etched in bronze, is a powerful reminder of the sacred
promise we made as a nation: We will never forget.  
   
The memorial also bears a quotation from Virgil: “No day shall erase you
from the memory of time.”  “No day shall erase you from the memory of
time.”  
   
So we continue to mourn every innocent life that was stolen on 9/11 and
honor their memories.   
   
To the families who lost fathers and mothers, husbands and wives, sons
and daughters, brothers and sisters, friends and co-workers on that
searing September day, it is my hope that this decisive action will
bring one more measure of closure.  No day shall erase them from the
memory of time.  
   
Today and every day, I am so grateful to the superb patriots who serve
the United States intelligence community and counterterrorism
communities.  They never forget.  Those dedicated women and men who
tirelessly worked every single day to keep our country safe and to
prevent future tragedies — it is thanks to their extraordinary
persistence and skill that this operation was a success.  They have made
us all safer.  
   
And to those around the world who continue to seek to harm the United
States, hear me now: We will always remain vigilant, and we will act. 
And we will always do what is necessary to ensure the safety and
security of Americans at home and around the globe.  
   
Today, we remember the lost.  We commit ourselves to the safety of the
living.  And we pledge that we shall never waver from defending our
nation and its people.  
   
Thank you, all.  And may God protect our troops and all those who serve
in harm’s way.  
   
We will never — we will never give up.
