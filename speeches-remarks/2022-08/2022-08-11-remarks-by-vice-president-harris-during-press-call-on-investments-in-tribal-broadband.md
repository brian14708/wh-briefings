THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, everyone.  It is good to be with
you.   
   
Before I begin, I will address the historic legislation that President
Joe Biden will soon sign into law.  Because of President Biden’s
leadership, our administration will lower healthcare costs, lower energy
costs, fight the climate crisis, and create good-paying jobs.   
   
By doing so, we will create opportunity in communities across our
nation, including Tribal communities.  We will fund climate resilience
and adaptation programs to help Tribal communities address the climate
crisis.  We will provide emergency drought relief to Tribal communities
across the West.  We will electrify homes across Indian Country.  And we
will help Tri- — Tribes build wind and solar power projects to lower the
cost of electricity for Native families.  
   
And as we make the largest investment in fighting climate change in our
nation’s history, we will rely on the centuries of indigenous knowledge
and experience Tribal communities have in protecting our Earth and
reminding us all of how precious our earth is.  
   
Our leadership, together in partnership with Tribal leadership, is
essential to getting this work done.  Our administration is fighting to
make sure every person in America has the opportunity to succeed and to
thrive.  
   
Today, we have convened this call to discuss one front in that fight:
high-speed Internet.  In the 21st century, high-speed Internet is not a
luxury, it is a necessity.  Without high-speed Internet, it is more
difficult for students to take online classes; it is more difficult for
seniors to book telehealth appointments, including for mental health;
and it is more difficult for small-business owners to succeed.  
   
As Vice President, I have spoken with leaders across Indian Country like
Chumash Chairman Kenneth Kahn and Aaron Payments of the Sault Ste. Marie
Tribe.  And we have discussed the great need in Native communities for
high-speed Internet.  
   
Today, one in three Americans who live in rural areas and on Tribal
lands lack access to high-speed Internet, and many more people cannot
afford a high-speed Internet plan even when it is available.   
   
Every person in our country, no matter where they live, should be able
to access and afford a high-speed Internet plan.  That is why today I am
proud to announce $500 million in grants that are being awarded to
Tribal applicants this month — including Tribal governments, Tribal
schools, and utility companies in New Mexico, California, Arizona,
Nebraska, South Dakota, Alaska, and more — including $26 million for
Pueblo Isleta, whose governor, Vernon Abeita, has been a great advocate
for connecting Indian Country.  And you will hear from him soon.  
   
And last week, we made available an additional $1 billion in grants this
year to connect Tribal communities — because we all know we are working
hard, we are getting a lot done, but there are still so many communities
that do not have access to high-speed Internet — too many.   
   
So, to make sure high-speed Internet is affordable to all communities,
in addition to being accessible to Tribal communities, anyone living on
Tribal lands with access to high-speed Internet can sign up to receive
$75 off of their monthly Internet bill through the Affordable
Connectivity Program.  So far, we have signed up 185,000 households in
Native communities.   
   
To check whether you are eligible and to sign up — okay, I’m going to
give you a website.  How can I do this without giving you a website? 
(Laughs.)  It is GetInternet.gov.  GetInternet.gov.   
   
Please help us pass on that information.  We have found that when people
know where to go, they do sign up, and it makes a big difference.   
   
So our administration’s vision is to connect all Native communities with
the Internet and with the opportunity that comes along with access to
affordable Internet — the opportunity to live healthier, happier, and
more prosperous lives.  And we will continue to fight every day to make
that vision a reality.   
   
Before I hop off, I will thank a leader who you will hear from in a
moment, a champion in the fight to bring high-speed Internet to every
person across Indian Country: White House Infrastructure Coordinator,
Mitch Landrieu.   
   
Thank you all for joining.  Thank you for your leadership and your
partnership.
