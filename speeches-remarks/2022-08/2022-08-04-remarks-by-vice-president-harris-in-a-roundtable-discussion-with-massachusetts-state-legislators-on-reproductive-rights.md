     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you so much, Rebecca.  Thank you.  Well,
good afternoon, everyone.   
   
     Governor, I appreciate the role — the national leadership that you
have provided on this issue.   
   
     Congresswoman Pressley, I’ve watched your work in the halls of
Congress and throughout this beautiful state, and I thank you for your
leadership.  
   
     And to all the leaders who are here, as I said before the press
came in, you all are certainly local leaders, statewide leaders, leaders
in Massachusetts, but you’re also national leaders.  You are leading by
example.  
   
     The work that is happening here in Massachusetts is a model of work
that can and, we believe, should happen around the country, which is
born out of the spirit of an appreciation for one of the fundamental
principles of our nation, which is the significance of the concept of
freedom and liberty and dignity.   
   
     So I thank you all.  And I’m here to visit with you to hear from
you about what you are doing on the ground, how it is working, what your
challenges are, and also to talk with you about how we can support this
work.   
   
     I do believe that this issue is an issue that affects everyone in
our nation.  And therefore your leadership, by extension, affects people
around the country.   
   
     So we are here today because we share a fundamental belief that we
trust the women of America to make decisions about what is in their best
interest.  And we believe it is they who should make that decision and
not their government.  It is that simple.   
   
     We believe that when it comes to some of the most intimate
decisions that any human being can make about their life and their
future, that the government should not interfere with their ability and
need to make that decision for themselves — or if they choose, with
their loved ones, with their pastor, their priest, their rabbi — with
their loved ones.  But the government should not be making that decision
for them.   
   
     I also strongly believe that, on this issue, to stand for these
principles of freedom and liberty does not require anyone to abandon
their faith or their beliefs.  This is simply about saying the
government should not be making the decision for that person.   
   
     So, when we look at where we are, indeed — as you have mentioned,
Rebecca — the President and I believe that we are facing a healthcare
crisis in America after the Dobbs decision was rendered — a healthcare
crisis for many reasons.   
   
     In many states, extremist so-called leaders are passing laws that
would provide no exception for rape or incest.   
   
     I am a former prosecutor who specialized in child sexual assault
cases and violence against women.  The idea that we would require
someone who has endured an extreme act of violence and then subject her
to the government’s will without investing in her the self-determination
to which she is entitled to make decisions based on what she believes is
in her best interests is outrageous.   
   
     When we look at this issue, we know that this is — to the point
that you made, Rebecca — an issue that also overlaps with many other
attacks on our democracy by extremist so-called leaders in our nation.  
   
     You have but to look at those states where these attacks are
happening on a woman’s right to make decisions about her reproductive
healthcare, and you will see from those same so-called leaders attacks
on voting rights, from those same so-called leaders attacks on LGBTQ
rights.    
   
     So, when we think of this issue, it relates to so much that is
fundamental to what we have believed until now has been about progress
in our nation around the expansion of rights.  But this moment requires
us to see there are extremist so-called leaders who believe that the way
forward is to restrict rights.   
   
     There’s so much at stake right now.  I applaud the leaders — those
just downhome leaders in Kansas for what they just did two nights ago. 
Because they organized and they spoke volumes.  They said, “We trust the
women to make decisions about their lives.”  And they said, “This is not
a partisan issue.”   
   
     They spoke loudly and said, “It doesn’t matter who she voted for in
the last election or who she plans on voting for in the next election. 
Don’t take her rights from her and allow the government to replace its
priorities for her priorities.”   
   
     The vote that occurred in Kansas also made clear what we all know:
The majority of Americans agree with this principle.   
     So, I’ll close by saying that our administration stands with the
leaders who are here and with the women of America in a belief that they
should be able to make these decisions for themselves.   
   
     The President has signed, now, executive orders addressing this
issue with a whole-of-government approach that includes Health and Human
Services, that includes the United States Department of Justice, that
includes the Department of Defense.  I thank the Undersecretary for
being here.   
   
     And we will continue to do the work that is necessary to protect
the right of the women of America to make decisions for themselves and
not have their government supersede their judgment with its own.   
   
     With that, I thank you all.  Thank you.
