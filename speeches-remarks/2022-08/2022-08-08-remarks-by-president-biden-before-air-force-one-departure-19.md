Q    How are you feeling, Mr. President?  How are you feeling?  Come
over.  
   
Q    How are you feeling?   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Feeling great.  Tested negative again today.  Been
testing every day.  All good.  All is good.  
   
Q    To what extent do you expect the inflation bill to help Democrats
during the midterms once it passes, Mr. President?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Will I expect it to help?  Yes, I do.  It’s going to
immediately help.  For example, no senior will have any — on Medicare —
will have med- — bills of more than $2,000 for drugs, no matter what the
costs are.  That’s a big deal.  It changes people’s lives.  There’s a
whole range of things that are really game-changing for ordinary
folks.  
   
Now, some of it is not going to kick in for a little bit, but it’s all
good.  It’s really going to lower the daily — when you sit down at that
kitchen table at the end of the month, you’re going to be able to pay a
whole hell of a lot more bills because you’re paying less in medical
bills.  
   
Q    Mr. President, how worried are you about the situation in Taiwan? 
Because China is — they’re kind of keeping a bit of a grip around the
whole island now.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I am — I’m not worried, but I’m concerned that
they’re moving as much as they are.  But I don’t think they’re going to
do anything more.  I think —  
   
Q    Do you think it was a wise move of the Speaker to go to Taiwan —
looking at it now?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  That was her decision.        
   
Thank you.
