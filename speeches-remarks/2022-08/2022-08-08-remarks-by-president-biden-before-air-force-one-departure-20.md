THE PRESIDENT:  Is it hot enough?

Q    (Laughs.)  Just slightly.

THE PRESIDENT:  Anyway, I think it was a good day.  We’re going to get a
lot done down in Kentucky.  I think they’re going to be able to be in
good shape.  And the Governor is really working.  There’s a real
bipartisan effort down there, so I’m very hopeful.  Very hopeful.

Q    Do you think people are listening to your bipartisan message, which
you keep repeating?  You were saying it today.

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I — you know —

Q    Are Americans listening?  Because you are — I’m sorry to say that
you’re — in the polls — with due respect, in the polls, you’re very —
you know, your polls are terrible.  But your message seems to be
reaching out to people.  Why aren’t they hearing?

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, it’s a long — a long way home.  You know, it’s —
the fact is that we’ve been divided for so long, and it’s only recently
that we have any kind of a movement.  And I think you’re going to see a
lot change.  

Q    Did you invite Leader McConnell on this trip today?

THE PRESIDENT:  I talked to him.  I — he knew — 

Q    Did you invite him today?

THE PRESIDENT:  I — he knows he’s always invited.  I invited him the
first time I went down.

Q    Do you wish he would have joined you?

THE PRESIDENT:  No, I don’t think so.  I don’t think he has to.  He got
a — he’s got a Senate to run.

Q    What was your message to the vi- — what was your message to the
families and the flood victims whose homes were damaged?  When you were
talking with them, what was your message to them?

THE PRESIDENT:  My message was: We’re going to stay until they’re fixed.
 

Thanks.

Q    Thank you, Mr. President.
