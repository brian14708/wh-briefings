title: Remarks by President Biden Before Marine One Departure
---
 
South Lawn

12:20 P.M. EST

Q    President Biden, why did your administration reject the holiday
testing surge in October?  Does the buck stop with you there — rejecting
the surge? 

THE PRESIDENT:  We didn’t reject it. 

Q    What did the governors tell you they’re worried about?

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, they’re not — they didn’t tell me they’re worried,
but they thanked me for the cooperation they’re getting.  They said
they’ve gotten all that they need.  They just want to know what we think
is going to happen from here. 

They asked Dr. Fauci some more questions about everything from whether
or not he thought he was going to move to test at home — I mean, on air
flights and that kind of thing. 

But there was no — there were no complaints.  There was a lot of
cooperation.
