The Ellipse  
Washington, D.C.

6:48 P.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT:  My name is Joe Biden.  I am Jill Biden’s husband. 
(Laughter.)  On behalf of Jill and Kamala and Doug, we welcome you to
the National Christmas Tree Lighting.  
   
Thanks to the Interior Secretary, Deb Haaland, for that introduction and
her leadership.  She has made me look awful good in my judgments.  It is
wonderful to join you here on your birthday, Madam Secretary.  Happy
birthday.  (Applause.)  
   
Also thanks to the National Parks Service and Foundation that takes such
great care of our national parks, and the 1,300 students around the
country who created the ornaments that decorate the trees representing
our states and our territories.  
   
And a special thanks to tonight’s host, LL Cool J.  (Applause.)  I’ll
tell you what, man, he looks like he can still play.  And I’m not
talking about instruments; I’m talking about football or something.  The
man is — you know, anyway, I tell you what.  (Laughter.)   
   
But tonight’s world-renowned performers were just wonderful to sit there
and listen to you and hear you and watch you.    
   
Over the course of the past 99 years, Presidents have continued this
great America tradition of lighting the National Christmas Tree through
war and peace, struggle and progress.  
   
You know, for the evergreen tree — it reminds us that even in the
coldest, darkest days of winter that life and abundance will return.  
   
It’s a bright beacon of hope that reminds us of the promise we find in
scripture of finding light in the darkness, which is also a very
American thing to do — perhaps the most American of things: to find
light.  And it’s important to continue traditions like this one to
remember that simple truth today.  
   
For all those lost during this pandemic, we have also seen how much
there is to gain — the appreciation and gratitude of the gift of time
and the light of goodwill that we share as we look out for one
another.  
   
Jill and I are especially grateful to our service members and their
families and for their sacrifices to our nation.  
   
We also — we also keep in our hearts those who lost a loved ones because
of this virus or any other cruel twist of fate or accident.  We pray for
them to find strength from sorrow, purpose from pain.  
   
And as we look out across the country with the promise of a new year
ahead, we know this:We are a great nation because you –- the American
people.  You are a good people.  And because of you, we will never been
more optimistic about the future.  You’ve made me so optimistic I can’t
— I tell you what, we’re — we have so much ahead of us.   
   
As we enter this holiday season, in my Catholic faith, I think there’s a
prayer attributed to St. Francis.  It says: Where there is hatred, let
there be to sow love; where there is discord, union; where there is
doubt, faith; and where there is darkness, light.  And that’s what we
do.  That’s who we are.  That’s what the United States of America is all
about.  
   
So, Merry Christmas, America.  May God bless you all.  And may God
protect our troops.  (Applause.)
