State Dining Room

10:46 A.M. EST  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  Before I start, I’d like to report that
later today, I’ll be signing the bill funding the government operations
for the next few months.   
   
Funding the government isn’t a great achievement.  (Laughs.)  It’s a
bare minimum of what we need to get done.   
   
But in these times, a bipartisan cooperation is worth recognition, so I
want to thank Senators Schumer and McConnell, and Speaker Pelosi for
getting this done.   
   
And I want to thank the substantial bipartisan vote in the Senate for
sending this bill to my desk today to avoid disruption of government
operations.  And I want to urge Congress to use the time this bill
provides to work toward a bipartisan agreement on a full-year funding
bill that makes the needed investments in our economy and our people,
from public health, to education, to our national security.    
   
Now, for today’s news.  Every year, December brings the joys of the
holiday season and gives us an opportunity to reflect on the year gone
by, and look ahead and begin to imagine the new year to come.   
   
This year, we can reflect on some extraordinary bit of progress.  Our
economy is markedly stronger than it was a year ago.  And today, the
incredible news that our unemployment rate has fallen to 4.2 percent.   
   
At this point in the year, we’re looking at the sharpest one-year
decline in unemployment ever.  Simply put, America — America is back to
work and our jobs recovery is going very strong.   
   
Today’s historic drop in unemployment rate includes dramatic
improvements for workers who have often seen higher wages and higher
levels of unemployment — excuse me, higher levels of unemployment.  They
are receiving higher wages.  And the rate of Black and Hispanic
unemployment is also dropping sharply.   
   
But that’s not just jobs that are up.  Wages are up, especially for
hardworking Americans often ignored in past — in past recoveries. 
Workers in transportation and warehouses have seen their wages go up
approximately 10 percent this year.  Workers in hotels and restaurants
have seen their wages go up 13 percent this year.   
   
And thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we’ve delivered significant tax
cuts to families raising children.  Tax cuts and rising wages for
middle-class families mean that Americans, on average, have more in
their pockets today than they did each — in each month since we’ve been
in office than they did last year after accounting for inflation.  Let
me repeat that: Even after accounting for rising prices, the typical
American family has more money in their pockets than they did last
year.   
   
In fact, we’re the only leading economy in the world where household
income and the economy as a whole are stronger than they were before the
pandemic.   
   
Applications for new small businesses are up 30 percent compared to
before the pandemic.  Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we’re cutting
child poverty in America by more than 40 percent.  And millions of
children who spent last Christmas in poverty will not bear that burden
this holiday season.   
   
Today’s news means that the unemployment rate has now fallen by more
than two percentage points since I took office.  That’s the fastest
decline in a single year on record.  And it’s about three times faster
than any other President in their first year in office.   
   
The number of people claiming unemployment has fallen from 18 million
when I took office, to 2 million this week.  Another record drop.     
   
We’ve also learned today that in November, 235,000 jobs were created in
the private sector.  And when they went back and recalibrated, they
found — the last two months — they found that job growth over the prior
two months, September and October, actually created 82,000 more jobs
than had previously been reported — which means that we’ve averaged
nearly 400,000 new jobs a month over the last three months.  A solid
pace.    
   
All told, in the first 10 full months of my administration, the economy
has created 6 million jobs, a record for a new President.  This is a
significant improvement from when I took office in January — a sign that
we’re on the right track.  
   
Because of the extraordinary strides we’ve made, we can look forward to
a brighter, happier new year ahead, in my view.  
   
But I also know that despite this progress, families are anxious. 
They’re anxious about COVID.  They’re anxious about the cost of living
and the economy more broadly.  They’re still uncertain.  I want you to
know: I hear you.  It’s not enough to know that we’re making progress. 
You need to see it and feel it in your own lives — around the kitchen
table, in your checkbooks.   
   
And that is why, every day, my team and I are working to deliver
consistent, determined, focused action to overcome the challenges we
still face.  Now, chief among those challenges is COVID-19.   
   
Yesterday, I laid out the key actions we’re going to take this winter to
fight this virus, to protect one another, to protect our economy and our
economic recovery.    
   
They include: number one, expanding our nationwide booster campaign with
more outreach, more appointments, and more hours.   
   
I was thrilled to see that yesterday we had more vaccine shots
administered than any day in the past six months.  
   
Number two, we’re launching hundreds of new family vaccination clinics
to make it easier for children and parents, the whole family to get
vaccinated in one place; and new policies to keep children in school
instead of guarant- — quarantining them at home when someone in the
class comes down with COVID, if they do.  
   
Thirdly, making free at-home tests more available than ever before by
having them covered by our private health insurance plans.  The
availability of community health centers and other sites for the
uninsured will be the alternative as well.  So, if you have insurance,
you’re going to be — it will cover these — these tests.  And if you
don’t have insurance, we have facilities you can attend and get these
tests.    
   
Increasing our surge response is the fourth thing — our “surge response
teams.”  They’re made up of doctors and nurses and medical staff who go
into communities with rising cases and provide the needed staff for
overrun hospitals — for their emergency rooms, their intensive care
units, to get help to them as they need it.  And we’re about tripling
the number of those surge teams.   
   
Accelerate — fifth, we’re accelerating our efforts to vaccinate the rest
of the world and strengthening international travel rules for people
coming into the United States.  This is a plan all Americans can rally
behind, in my view.  
   
We’re also addressing another concern for families: prices.  Just about
every country is grappling with high prices right now as they fight the
pandemic.   
   
And as the world economy continues to come back to life, the more — the
more price pressures are going to ease as things begin to move.  
   
But we’re not sitting around waiting.  In the meantime, I’ve used every
tool available to address price increases, and it’s beginning to work.  
   
Take gasoline and gas prices.  Last week, I announced the largest-ever
release from the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve to increase
the supply of oil and help bring down prices.   
   
And I brought together other countries — India, Japan, the Republic of
Korea, the United Kingdom — who all agreed — all agreed to join me in
releasing additional oil from their reserves.   
   
And China — China may very do well — do more as well.  They haven’t done
it yet.     
   
This worldwide effort we’re leading won’t solve the problem of high gas
prices overnight.  But over the last month, likely due in part to the
anticipation of this action, we’ve seen oil and gas prices out of the
wells — oil and gas prices on the wholesale market come down
significantly.  
   
Since the end of October — (coughs) — excuse me — the average weekly
price of gasoline on the wholesale market — that’s what you sell to the
gas stations — has fallen around 10 percent, and that decline has picked
up in recent days.  That’s a drop of about 25 cents per gallon.   
   
These savings are beginning to reach Americans, and should pick up in
the weeks ahead.  And it can’t happen fast enough.  
   
And I’ve asked the Federal Trade Commission to consider whether
potentially illegal and anti-competitive behavior in the oil and gas
industry is causing higher prices for consumers when they don’t need to
be that high because the wholesale price has come down so much.  So, we
can ensure that the American people are paying a fair price for gas.  
   
At this time of the year, another concern that is facing American
families is about being able to find what you need in the holidays,
whether it’s gifts or groceries.   
   
As I laid out earlier in the week, because of my actions — the actions
that my administration has taken, in partnership with business — excuse
me — (coughs) — with private business and labor, retailers and grocery
stores, freight movers and railroads, these shelves are going to be —
the shelves of our stores are going to well-stocked.   
   
We’ve sped up operations at our ports.  For example, at the Port of Los
Angeles and Long Beach — the two busiest ports in America — over the
last month, the number of containers left sitting on the docks for over
eight days is down by 40 percent.   
   
I’ve said that before and people have come up to me and said, “Well that
does that mean?  So, they’re down 40 percent.”   
   
     Well, it means that the products are no longer sitting on the
docks; they’re getting off the docks into trains, into trucks, into mi-
— into vehicles to get them to the stores’ shelves.  That is an
incredible success story.  
   
On Monday, I convened a group of CEOs from some of the largest retailers
and grocery stores, as well as leading companies that works with small
businesses across the country.   
   
And they reported that their investments \[inventories\] are up, shelves
are well-stocked, and they’re ready to meet consumer demand for the
holidays.  Now, I said that yesterday, and then I saw a couple of your
stations put on — you found some empty shelves.  (Laughs.)  They’re old
empty shelves, but it doesn’t matter.   But go back and take a look at
some of those shelves again.  Okay?   
   
But the point is that the vast majority of the shelves are filled, and
the CEOs of not only the — the suppliers, but the CEOs of UPS and FedEx,
which are on track to deliver more packages than ever, are saying the
same thing.  
   
So, we’re heading into the holiday season in strong shape.  Again, this
is about a concerted, focused action.  We averted this potential crisis
by figuring out what needed to be fixed, and then we brought together
the people that have the capacity to fix it or at least alleviate it.  
   
Now — now it’s time to build on the success we’ve had this year on jobs,
wages, creation of more small businesses, and fixing challenges in the
economy.  We need to cut costs further for families.   That’s what my
Build Back Better plan does that’s still being considered in Congress. 
It will lower the out-of-pocket cost for childcare, eldercare, housing,
college, healthcare, and prescription drugs.   
   
In fact, a new independent analysis released this week showed that my
plan would mean $7,400 in tax cuts and savings for the typical family of
four with two children.  Seventeen Nobel Prize winners in economics have
written a letter to me, affirming that this bill would reduce long-term
inflationary pressures in the economy.    
   
And two of the leading rating agencies — not — not, you know, liberal
think tanks — two of the leading rating agencies on Wall Street
confirmed this month that my plan will not add to inflationary
pressures.   
   
What I’ve always proposed and what I’m proposing now is having a way to
lower — lower some of the most difficult costs — and what are they? —
the difficult costs families pay every month by asking corporations and
the wealthiest Americans — including, for example, the 55 corporations
that paid zero in federal income tax last year, despite generating $40
billion in profits — and I’m happy they’re profitable — to begin to pay
their fair share.   
   
For example, just requiring corporations to pay a minimum 15 percent in
taxes raises enough revenue to pay for lowering the cost of childcare
for 90 percent of families and provides universal preschool for three-
and — all three- and four- year-olds in America.  
   
Now, what’s better for those corporations?  Is it better for them having
childcare so parents can come back to work today and they have a
better-educated workforce in the future, or having — not paying any
tax?  
   
Once again, no one — no one making less than $400,000 a year will pay a
penny more in federal taxes.  My Build Back Better plan is fiscally
responsible.  It’s the first major piece of legislation in more than a
decade that’s not only fully paid for, but will generate more than $100
billion in deficit reduction this decade.  
   
It fully covers the cost of its investments by making the largest
corporations and richest Americans pay a little more in taxes.  I think
that’s a trade-off that’s worth making.  And by the way, those very
business are going to do better having a better educated and more
available workforce.   
   
Having those who’ve done very well pay their fair share is just the
right thing to do in order to provide a little breathing room for
millions of American families.   
   
Throughout our history, we’ve emerged from crisis by investing in
ourselves.  And so, we’re going to keep at this. We’re going to keep
making progress for our families and for our nation.   
   
I promise you that’s what’s going to happen.  God bless you all.  And
may God protect our troops and keep everyone safe.   
   
Q    First of all, Mr. President, your voice sounds a little
different.  Are you okay?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m okay.  I have a test every day to see — a COVID
test.  I — they check me for all the strains.  What I have is a
one-and-a-half-year-old grandson who had a cold, who likes to kiss his
Pop.  (Laughter.)  And he’d been kissing my — anyway, so — but it’s just
a cold.  
   
Q    And then, on COVID policy, it seems like the administration is
starting to soften some of the language.  There’s this new op-ed where
you talk about COVID and “We’re going to beat it back.”  Are you no
longer going to “shut it down”?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, we got to beat it back before we shut it down. 
Look, it’s going to take time worldwide.  In order to beat COVID, we
have to shut it down worldwide.  In the United States of America, we’re
doing everything that needs to be done to take care of the American
people within our borders.  
   
But look what’s happened.  You know, we were starting to make some real
progress, and then you find out there’s another strain.  And the idea
that you can build a wall around America to keep any COVID from around
the world out is not the — not there.   
   
And besides, that’s one of the reasons why — I know we get criticized —
I get criticized for not doing more for the world.  But we’ve done more
for the world in providing vaccines available and help than any nat- —
all — every other nation in the world combined.   
   
In addition to that — in addition to that, we’ve also — with regard to
India and other countries — and we’re working around the clock. 
Remember, I suggested we suspend the patents, let everybody be able to
have access to this so they can make the vaccine in their own
countries.   
   
And thirdly, in Southern Africa — for example, South Africa has all the
vaccines they need, and they don’t want any more vaccines now.  One of
the things I’m considering is how can we help them deal with the issue
of the —  
   
As I said before, the biggest challenge we had in the beginning of this
administration, in my view, was not getting the vaccines produced —
although that was not easy, and I’ve got to give — you know, President
Trump, early on, went out and — he got them to do the research to try to
get the right vaccines.   
   
But logistically — logistically, getting the vaccines from a container
that gets delivered to you, to a hospital, to a state, to a — and
getting it in someone’s arms — that’s a very, very difficult thing.  And
we did it better than anybody in the world has done it.  But we got to
try to help other people.  
   
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  Given that there are now multiple cases
of Omicron here in the U.S., are you considering requiring vaccines for
domestic travel or any other new measures for domestic travel?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  The measures that I announced yesterday are — we believe
are sufficient to deal with the proper medical precautions to deal with
the spread of this new variant.  We are doing, as you know — at NIH, as
well as among the manufacturers — a lot of research to see the extent of
its — how quickly it spreads, how deadly it is, et cetera, et cetera.   
   
But we do require for travel — we’re going to continue to require people
to have masks on — masks on — and in public places, and — and federal
buildings.  So — but I don’t, at this point, because — let me —  
   
I think I know a fair amount about this issue.  But I’m not a scientist,
so I continue to rely on the scientists and asking them whether or not
we have to move beyond what we did yesterday.  Right now, they’re saying
“no.”  
   
Q    (Cross-talk.)  
   
Q    What is happening in Ukraine, and what — on the border between
Ukraine and Russia?  And what are you going to do about it?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I have been in constant contact with our allies in
Europe, with Ukrainians.  My Secretary of State and National Security
Advisor have been engaged extensively.   
   
And what I am doing is putting together what I believe to be will be the
most comprehensive and meaningful set of initiatives to make it very,
very difficult for Mr. Putin to go ahead and do what people are worried
he may do.   
   
But that’s in play right now.  
   
Q    Are you going to talk to Putin soon, Mr. President?  
   
Q    Did you talk to Putin this morning, Mr. President?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No.
