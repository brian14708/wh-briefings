East Room

3:16 P.M. EST  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Please, sit down.  Mom, come on up here a
minute.  Come on.  (Laughter.)  I want you to meet Gabe’s mom, who I
still believe is more like his sister — (laughter) — than his mom.  She
is the inspiration.  She is the reason why this young man has done such
incredible things.   
   
And it’s a simple lesson — my mother always told me: Listen to your
mom.  (Laughter.)   
   
MS. WHEELER-LARA:  Yes.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you.  You deserve a great deal of
praise.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  
   
MS. WHEELER-LARA:  Thank you so much.  Thank you.    
   
THE PRESIDENT:  And one other thing before I begin my formal remarks.  I
look out in the audience and I see so many people who’ve been in this
battle for so long.  But the one person who I know from personal
experience — having been here for more than 40 years — who has been a
champion when it was viewed as political suicide to be a champion was
the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi.  (Applause.) 
Nancy, stand up.  Stand up.   
   
There was many others behind her as well.  But, Nancy — not a joke — you
were the one who started that fight in a way that you took it on with
such passion.  And it wasn’t — it was not — it was viewed as a political
death sentence to take this issue on at the time.  But you did it.  You
fundamentally changed the way we looked at this.  You even got George
Bush to lead on this, too.  (Laughter.)  
   
No, but all kidding aside, you — I just want to personally, in front of
all these people and all the world, thank you for your incredible
work.  
   
Ladies and gentlemen, I’m also joined by the Second Gentleman.  He is a
hell of a lawyer.  (Laughter.)  And I thank him for being here.  
   
And, Mr. Secretary, thank you for your leadership of HHS.  
   
I — and I want to thank Gabe for sharing his story, because — you know,
you committed your life to this work, Gabe.  I don’t know whether you
had that plan when you began it, but it’s amazing what you’ve done. 
It’s amazing what one person can do.  It’s an honor to meet with you
both and to learn more about the work you’re doing together to support
your community.  
   
Folks, we’re also joined today by many who have been part of this effort
for decades, including Dr. Fauci, who is — I — he’s all things to —
(applause) — Doc, you’re the best.  And you never walk away from an
issue or a problem.  Thank you.   
   
And to all of you who have contributed so much to this mission of
advocating for better prevention services for those at risk of getting
HIV and improved care services; and living with HIV, breaking down the
stigma, and from — and the disinformation that still exists around
HIV/AIDS, I want to thank you — thank you for your voices and for
putting your hearts into your work.  Because that’s what you do, you put
your hearts into the work, and people can tell.    
   
It’s because of all of you and the dedication of scientists and
activists around the world that we’ve been able to dramatically reduce
new HIV transmissions and make individuals with HIV today lead long and
healthy lives.    
   
And, you know, it’s because of the persistence and the resilience of the
HIV community that we’ve changed so much about the way we approach
healthcare, research, and equitable access to services — even the
relationship between patients and healthcare providers.  
   
You know, and it’s because of you — and it’s not hyperbole to suggest it
— that we are within a striking distance of eliminating HIV
transmission.  Within striking distance.  (Applause.)   
   
And I think everybody but Nancy couldn’t have imagined this — us being
there 40 years ago.  But the fact is that when the CDC reported the
first cases that — of what we now know as AIDS.  
   
It’s something that we couldn’t fully imagine even 20 years ago before
the landmark investments that the United States made through PEPFAR and
— President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.  
   
But you made it possible.  You made it possible.  And I want to take
this moment on this historic anniversary to acknowledge the incredible
passion and the work that got us here.  Because I know — I know that so
many of you — for so many of you, this is personal.   
   
Today, we once more raise a two-story-tall red ribbon on the North
Portico of the White House to remember how far we’ve come, the work we
have left to finish, and so we never forget the price — the price that’s
paid all along the way.  
   
And so many of you know and have relations with people who have —
whether they’re family members or friends that you’ve watched them, in
the past, whither way.   
   
In the past four decades, as has been mentioned, an estimated 36 million
people — 36 million people, including more than 700,000 here in the
United States, have died of AIDS-related illnesses.   
   
Think about that.  That many people — more than almost all the modern
wars combined — all the wars combined.   
   
Here at home, we saw entire communities devastated by this disease,
particularly among the LGBTQ+ individuals and members of racial and
ethnic minority groups that Gabe has already spoken to.  And a
generation that endured the brunt — the brunt of this epidemic: losing
friends, loved ones, family members, partners — instead of being seen
and being recognized.

And I can recall — if you excuse the point of personal privilege —
being, I think, in this very room when a senator who — he’s deceased
now, so I don’t want to mention his name because he can’t defend himself
— but standing up and saying, along with another guy named Jerry
Falwell, this is “God’s punishment.”  I’m paraphrasing it.  “God’s
punishment.  Finally.”

Think how much has changed.  I mean, back in those days, the willingness
of other members of the Senate and the House to stand up and take him on
was — Nancy was there.  Many of you were there.  But it wasn’t a
universal thing.  Wasn’t a universal thing.

But you all demanded — demanded to be treated with dignity and with
equity.  Those voices, those stories are invaluable.   
   
As we recommit ourselves to finishing the fight — that we are going to
make these individuals living with AIDS and are helping them drive and
inform our efforts at every step of the way, because we’re going to
finish this fight.

And so, when my administration came to office, not only — not only did
we reestablish the White House Office of National AIDS Policy, which —
(applause) — it’s hard to believe. 

I don’t deserve any cred- — that was the easiest possible thing to do. 
(Laughter.)  No, I really mean it.  Think about it.  Think about it. 
That it gets a round of applause in the year 2021 when we say that.  I
mean, it — it should have never, ever — well, any- — well, I don’t want
to get into that.  But, anyway.  (Laughter.)  

And I’ve asked Harold Phillips to lead our efforts.  Harold — (applause)
— stand up, Harold.  (Applause.)Harold, I think they know you. 
(Laughter.)

Harold has dedicated — he has decades of experience working with — to
end AIDS, the HIV epidemic.  And I want to thank him for his leadership
and willingness to — to join the administration, and releasing the
National HIV/AIDS Strategy for 2022 to 2025.  That’s — that’s what he’s
doing.   
   
It’s a roadmap for how we’re going to put our foot on the gas and
accelerate our efforts to end the HIV epidemic in the United States by
the year 2030.  That’s the goal.  (Applause.)    
   
And it centers on the kind of innovative, community solutions —
community-driven solutions that we know will work.  
   
It’s a plan to make sure that the latest — the latest advances in HIV
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment are available to everyone,
regardless of their age, race, gender identity, sexual orientation,
disability, or other factors.  
   
It shouldn’t matter where you live in the country or how much money you
make or how you respond or how we — we have to respond across the board
to the HIV epidemic everywhere and support all people living with HIV.  
   
And, critically, this strategy takes on racial and gender disparities in
our health system that for much too long have affected HIV outcomes in
our country — to ensure that our national response is a truly equitable
response.  
   
So, we’re going to take aggressive action and back it up.  We’ve asked
Congress for $670 million — an historic budget request — for the Ending
the HIV Epidemic in the United States initiative.  And I’m confident
we’re going to get that done.  Right, team?  (Applause.)  
   
We’ve got some great congressional champions for this work here today,
starting with a woman who, as I said — I’ve already mentioned, as she —
a leader on the issue from the moment she set foot in Congress, starting
with Nancy.  
   
But also Representative Barbara Lee.  Barbara Lee, please. (Applause.) 
Maxine Waters.  (Applause.)  I learned a long time ago, when Maxine
says, “I have an idea,” just say “yes”.  (Laughter.)  Just say “yes.”   
   
And Sean Patrick Maloney.  Sean.  (Applause.)  Jenniffer –- David
Cicilline.  David.  (Applause.)  And Jenniffer González-Colon. 
(Applause.)   
   
Thanks for all you’re doing.  I really — I was going to say — not for
your support — this is sui generis with all of you.  You’re just
incredibly committed to this.  
   
And it’s an issue that has a long history of bipartisan support, so I’m
looking forward to working across the aisle, God willing.  
   
I want make sure that everyone in the United States knows their HIV
status, that everyone with HIV receives high-quality care and treatment
that they deserve, and that we end the harmful stigma around HIV and
AIDS.  (Applause.)   
   
In particular, there is still a large number of states with HI- — that
have HIV criminalization laws that do not reflect an accurate
understanding of HIV.  
   
For example — (applause) — HIV cannot be transmitted through saliva. 
There are still laws on the books that criminalize spitting by people
with HIV.  I mean, this is 2021, the United States of America.  
   
But we have to follow science, and that means eliminating the laws that
perpetuate discrimination, exacerbate disparities, discourage HIV
testing, and take us further away from our goal.  We can do this.  
   
And as we accelerate our efforts at home, we’re not going to let up on
the efforts to fa- — fight HIV/AIDS globally.    
   
Leading the reauthorization of PEPFAR in 2008 was among the highlights
of my time as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.  And at the
time — (applause) –- and by the way, I was not one of the great leaders
in this.  I — I always supported the effort, but it wasn’t –- it was
because I was chairman of the committee.   
   
And believe it or not, there was a Republican President — and I’m not
being a wise guy when I say this — who pushed for PEPFAR.  There is an
undeniable proof of the good that American leadership and innovation can
achieve in the world when we commit to it.  We have a moral obligation
to do that and continue.  
   
Since President Bush launched PEPFAR in 2003, we’ve saved more than 21
million lives.  (Applause.)  We’ve prevented –- (applause) — we’ve
prevented millions of HIV infections.  And we’ve helped at least 20
countries bring their HIV epidemics under control or reach their U.N.
AIDS 90-90-90 treatment targets.  That means 90 percent of the people
living with HIV in a country will know their HIV status; 90 percent of
HIV-positive individuals are able to access treatment; and 90 percent of
those receiving treatment for HIV will have — will have suppressed viral
loads.  
   
That’s within our power.  We’re doing that.   
   
And though PEPFAR — through PEPFAR, the United States will support
nearly 19 million men, women, and children with lifesaving HIV
treatment.  It’s an incredible, incredible achievement.   
   
Those are not only lives saved though.  They are -– they’re  communities
that are strengthened by the –- by the talents and contributions of
HIV-positive individuals who are here today leading productive lives and
leading the community because of what you’ve all done.  
   
And as we have faced COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve also reaped additional
benefits from our decades-long investment in strengthening health
systems around the world through PEPFAR.  
   
Working through the CDC and USAID, PEPFAR supports more than 70,000 case
— care facilities, 3,000 laboratories, and nearly 300,000 healthcare
workers across 55 countries, all of which have been vital in supporting
the global fight against COVID-19.  
   
By strengthening countries’ abilities to fight AIDS, we’ve also improved
our collective ability to fight other diseases.  
   
And I want to thank and recognize a guy that I can’t believe all he has
done: Dr. John — John Nkenga- — Nkengasong.  Nkengasong.  I apologize,
Doc.  (Applause.)  And, Doc — Doc Nkengasong, stand up.  And, Doc — Doc
— Dr. Nkengasong, you can call me “Joe Bidden.”  (Laughter.)   
   
But you’re helping lead the important work of Omicron variant in this
current role as Director of Africa’s CDC and who is my nominee for
Ambassador-at-Large to oversee PEPFAR — (applause) — and our global
efforts to conbay \[sic\] — combat HIV.  
   
I understand you’re joined by Peter Sands.  Peter, stand up, will you? 
(Applause.)  The Executive Director — the Executive Director of the
Global Fund.  
   
This year marks 20 years of the Global Fund, and the United States is
proud to be both a founding member of the Fund and the largest
contributor.  And the United States is looking forward to hosting the
Global Fund’s Seventh Replenishment Conference next year here.  And so,
thank you.  (Applause.)   
   
We still have a difficult road ahead of us — we can’t kid ourselves —
particularly, addressing the disparities we see both domestically and
globally, including the impact of high transmission rates among
adolescent girls and young women.  
   
And today, as we look back on the past 40 years, where there has been so
much pain and suffering, it’s a testament to all — all the hard work
represented in this room and around the world that we are gathered today
with hope in our hearts and for the future that’s within our grasp.  
   
We can do this.  We can do this.  We can eliminate HIV transmission.  We
can get the epidemic under control here in the United States and in
countries around the world.  
   
We have the scientific understanding, we have the treatments, and we
have the tools we need.  
   
We’re going to engage with people with live — with lived experience with
HIV and ensure that our efforts are appropriate and effective, and
centered around the needs of the HIV community.  Not (inaudible) —
centered around the needs of the community.  
   
And folks, together, we’re going to save lives.  I can imagine no higher
calling to which we could be dedicated than our commitment to save
lives.  And this is the one area where we can get a lot more done
quickly.  
   
So, I want to thank you all again.  I’m honored to be with you today. 
And this is one heck of a group of people who have hearts that are as
big as their heads.  And thank God. (Laughter.)  Thank God.  Have in
those beautiful skulls so much knowledge and capacity.  (Laughter and
applause.)  
   
So, thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)  Anyway, thanks.
