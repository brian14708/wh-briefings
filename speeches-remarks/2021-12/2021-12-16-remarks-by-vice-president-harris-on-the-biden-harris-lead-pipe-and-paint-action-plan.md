*AFL-CIO Headquarters  
Washington, D.C.*

9:52 A.M. EST  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  Good morning.  Have a seat.  Have a
seat.  Good morning.   
   
Ms. Jackson, I want to thank you.  Your leadership is so inspiring, and
the whole group of women and men and the community leaders that — that
really have been a voice on these issues for so long.  For so long.  And
you hold us to be accountable.  And I’m glad to say today we’re about to
announce that we are taking that charge seriously and have heard you. 
But please continue with your leadership because it’s so important.  So,
thank you.   
   
And good morning, everyone.   It is great to be in the house of labor. 
(Applause.)  Good morning.  (Laughs.)  Good morning.  And it’s so good
to be here at the AFL-CIO.  
   
You know, the last time I was in this building was in August, and it was
early in the morning.  My husband, Doug, and I came here to pay our
respects and say goodbye to the late, great Rich Trumka.  And as we all
know, he was a man who lived and breathed solidarity.  
   
And I remember that morning because we wanted to just come in and be
lowkey.  And — and so we walked in the door and there was Liz Shuler. 
And she greeted me with a big ole warm hug, and we talked that day about
Rich’s legacy, about the tremendous mark he made and left on our
nation.  
   
And, Liz, we also talked about the future because that’s what I believe
Rich would have wanted.  And we talked in a way that was not only the
focus on what we have achieved, but we talked about what we still have
yet to do.  And Liz knows  
what we must do.  
   
We have worked together for some time now, and I will tell you Liz knows
we must protect the rights of workers  
to organize and collectively bargain.  She knows we must  
strengthen those rights.  She knows we cannot let up or ever accommodate
any amount of progress.  We must stay vigilant.  And she knows that the
Biden-Harris administration will always stand in solidarity with the
American labor movement.  (Applause.)   
   
So you all know, and the President and I have been clear: We are
determined and we are proud say, perhaps sometimes with a bit of
bravado, that we will be the most pro-labor union administration in
America’s history — (applause) — and we are proud of that.  And we are
proud of that.  
   
And it’s for good reason.  Because we’re clear: When union wages go up,
everybody’s wages go up.  When union jobs are safer, our communities are
safer.  And when union members  
go to work, they go to work for all of us.  They teach our students and
care for our patients.  They lay broadband lines  
and manufacture electric vehicles.  And union members  
replace lead pipes –- (applause) — which is what brings me here today.  
   
Over the years, I have traveled around the country and I have met many
parents to talk about this very issue –- so many parents –- parents who
are worried that every time they turned on the faucet to get their child
a glass of water, that they may be filling that glass with poison;
parents who worry, as they make breakfast in the morning or in the
evening help their children to brush their teeth, that they are exposing
their children to something that could harm them.  
   
 And the science is clear about what drinking water from a lead pipe can
do to the human body.  For adults, it can cause an increase in blood
pressure and decrease kidney function.  For children, it can severely
harm mental and physical development.  It can stunt growth, slow down
learning, and cause irreparable damage to the brain.  
   
So, the bottom line is that there is no reason in the 21st century for
why people are still exposed to this substance that was poisoning people
back in the 18th century.  There is no good reason.   
   
But here’s the truth, and it’s a hard truth: Millions of people in our
country, many of them children, are still exposed to lead every day.  As
many as 24 million housing units in our country contain substantial
amounts of lead paint.  As many as 10 million households get their water
through lead pipes and service lines, and so do up to 400,000 schools
and childcare facilities.  
      
Let’s just reflect on that.  In one of the most advanced nations in the
world, this is happening right now in our country.  In areas around our
country, children are drinking  
from water fountains fed by lead pipes.  They’re sleeping  
in bedrooms coated with lead paint.  
   
And as a result, today, more than half of children under six in our
country are at risk of lead exposure.  
   
And I’m going to repeat that: More than half of the children in America
who are under the age of six are at risk of lead exposure.  
   
So, it’s not right, obviously, and we cannot let this stand any longer. 
Lead exposure in our nation is an emergency, we should all agree, is
something we can do something about.  
   
And so, that is why our administration is releasing the Biden-Harris
Lead Pipe and Paint Action Plan.  And that’s a nice, fancy name.  You
know, we have these long names.  Mayor, you know that.  Mitch Landrieu
is here.   
   
But it is an action plan.  So, the action is to direct and coordinate
the efforts of local, state, and federal partners to a single goal: to
significantly accelerate the removal of lead pipes and paint over the
next 10 years, particularly in communities that have historically been
left out and left behind.  
   
So, this action plan — the action will be historic in proportion and
nature.  It will build on the historic progress of our administration
that we’ve made over the last year to protect our communities from lead
exposure.  
   
Last month, thanks to the support of so many in this room, so many
extraordinary leaders –- I wish I could just name everybody by name –-
because of you, not only what you did leading up to January, but what
you’ve done your entire lives and then what you have helped us to do in
this town and around the country, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal is
now the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law because of you — because of you. 
(Applause.)   
   
And our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will invest $15 billion in
replacing lead service pipes and lines throughout our country.  
   
As part of our action plan, the EPA — where is Michael? — he’s coming up
next, I think — the EPA — he’s behind the curtain — is announcing that
it will allocate $2.9 billion in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for
funding for states and Tribes and territories for lead service line
replacement in the year 2022.  
   
And it is also making clear that the remaining funds for states and
local governments provided through the American Rescue Plan can be used
to replace lead service lines.  So, just like they are already doing in
Pittsburgh and Milwaukee and Syracuse and Duluth — this is the work that
we will continue to do around the country.  
   
And as we replace lead service lines and upgrade our water
infrastructure, we are not only doing work that is good and important,
we are also creating jobs.  And we are creating good union jobs — good
union jobs.  (Applause.)   
   
Because here’s the thing that everybody in this room knows, but I’ll
speak to the press that’s back there: The significance of good union
jobs is not only what I’ve already talked about in terms of what that
means in raising the standards by which we recognize the dignity of work
and the importance of that work, but this is also about uplifting highly
skilled folks — highly  
skilled.  They train.  They’re in apprenticeship programs.  They study
to do this work because this work is not only important, it’s
complicated.  It takes great skill.   
   
And so that’s what we’re talking about — those kinds of jobs.  And you
know that my first stop after the President signed the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law was in Columbus, Ohio.  And when I was in Columbus, I
went to meet with members of the Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 189. 
And the apprentices there — they showed me the training tools they use
to do their trade and how they learn on those tools — the welding tools,
the fitting tools.  And they talked with real excitement about the jobs
this law will create — jobs for carpenters and plumbers, jobs in small
towns and big cities, jobs that cannot be outsourced.   
   
And because the pipes and paint that need replacing are right here, the
work that we are doing to cultivate and to support this workforce is
right here.   
   
And friends, the economic benefits of removing lead pipes and paint do
not stop with job creation.  It is that and it is more.  Lead poisoning
cost our nation billions of dollars.  High lead levels in communities
correlate — just think about it — to higher healthcare costs, lower
earnings, and, therefore, lower tax revenues.  All of this is related.  
   
In fact, for every dollar we spend on lead remediation, our communities
get at least $3 back.  One dollar for three.  I was with a bunch of CEOs
the other day — they like to talk about return on investment.  This is a
really good return on investment.  
   
And here’s the truth: There are certain communities that are harder hit
by lead poisoning than others.  So, let’s talk about that also.  When
some communities learn that there is lead in their homes or in their
schools, if they have the resources or the influence, then action is
taken.   
   
However, so often for poor communities, rural communities, communities
of color, that does not happen.  And I’ve seen this dynamic play out for
so many years on so many issues of environmental justice.   
   
And so, in fact, when I served as District Attorney of San Francisco,
back in 2005, I created the first environmental justice unit.  For those
of you who know the Bay Area in California, you’ll know there’s a place
called Bayview-Hunters Point, where the community at the time had an
annual household income of about $15,000 — one-five.   
   
And then, no surprise, there were many issues that affected that
community, including dumping.  People would just go there — they would
treat it like a dumping site, as though families and children were not
there.  
   
And I saw firsthand how this work that they were doing — it basically —
how they became dumping grounds, how that resulted in environmental
hazards and havens for pollution.  And so, I created the first
environmental justice unit to go after polluters and to protect the
health of all of our communities.  
   
Because, by the way, my approach was — some may not want to hear this —
the people who are dumping in those communities need to be held
accountable by a prosecutor.   
   
And so, that was the work that we did many, many years ago.  And then
there is the work that we did most recently when I was in the U.S.
Senate, knowing that children were getting sick from water that came
from the tap and that these children are often from communities that
were being left behind.  So, we introduced legislation to put emergency
funds toward the replacement of toxic drinking water infrastructure in
communities that were being disproportionately harmed.  
   
Our administration, the Biden-Harris administration, is committed to
investing in all communities, especially those that have long been
overlooked and underserved.  We must target investments toward
communities that are at a higher risk of exposure to lead pipes and
paint.  
   
And to that end, our Build Back Better Act will allocate $9 billion in
lead remediation in low-income communities, Native communities and
communities of color, as well as for schools and childcare facilities. 
It would also invest nearly $1 billion to address lead hazards in rural
communities.  
   
I will conclude with this: The challenge that we face is, without any
question, great.  Lead is built into our cities, it is laid under our
roads, and it is installed in our homes.   
   
And that is why we decided to launch this action plan here in this house
of labor — because unions know how to do great things.   
   
And it is right there in the original model of the AFL-CIO: “Labor
conquers all.”  So we need your help to conquer these challenges.  We
need your help to make millions of homes, schools, and workplaces safe
for everyone.  And we need your help to make sure this is the beginning
of the end for lead in America.   
   
So, let us get to work.  Thank you all.  May God bless you.  And may God
bless America.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very
much.
