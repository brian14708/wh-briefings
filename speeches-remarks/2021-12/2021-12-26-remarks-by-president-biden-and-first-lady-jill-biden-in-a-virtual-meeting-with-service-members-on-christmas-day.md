(December 25, 2021)

THE FIRST LADY: Hi, Merry Christmas. How are you?

THE PRESIDENT: Bahrain, Qatar, Romania — you’re everywhere but home.

THE FIRST LADY: Yeah.

THE PRESIDENT: Sorry.

THE FIRST LADY: We are sorry. You know, one of the things we know —
because we are a military family, we know what it’s like to have you —
you know, our loved ones — serving and being away during the holidays.
And so, I’m sorry you have to be away. We know what it’s like for your
families to have that empty seat at the table like we had.

And my dad was a World War Two vet. He — he served in the — he was in
the Navy, and he served in the South Pacific on a ship. He was a
signalman. And our son Beau was in Iraq for a year.

So, we certainly know, as a family, what it’s — what your families are
feeling today. And that’s why we will continue — Joe and I will
continue, forever and ever, to support you in any way we can — but, most
of all, serve your families.

Joe. Oh, here’s — here’s Commander. This is —

THE PRESIDENT: This is Commander.

THE FIRST LADY: (Laughs.) You can probably — there he is.

THE PRESIDENT: He’s 16 weeks old.

THE FIRST LADY: Yeah. (Laughter.)

THE PRESIDENT: Hello, everybody, and Merry Christmas. And it’s wonderful
to see you all. But I know, as Jill said, you’d rather be home today,
and I don’t blame you.

Jill and I know how hard it is for you. But quite frankly, it’s hard if
your husbands, wives, moms, dads, children — be apart or are on duty
during a season of togetherness.

And we Bidens understand that. We still, every once in a while, look at
that empty chair.

And, you know, service for your country is — whether you’re in Iraq or —
you know, Beau spent a year in Iraq with the Delaware Army National
Guard. I remember that when we — it felt like, as I said — and all those
birthdays and other occasions, celebrations where you’re not together.

So, as your Commander-in-Chief, I wanted to take this opportunity to say
thank you, thank you, thank you. It’s a poor substitute for what you’re
missing, but I understand. I just want to know how much we care. We’re
grateful for your courage, your sacrifice — not only your sacrifice, but
your family’s sacrifice.

The holidays really bring into sharp focus being apart is — it’s just
part of the job, but it’s a hard part of the job. And it’s — but it’s
who you guys are. You’re solid — you know, I get criticized for saying
this occasionally, but you’re the solid steel spine of the nation. You
really are. Always vigilant, always ready when duty calls — 365 days a
year.

And during the holiday season, as we pray for peace and spread joy and
glad tidings, we also look for hope toward the possibility of a better
year and to give thanks — and to give thanks to everything — for
everything we’ve got to you, the service, your families, and to give you
as much space as you need.

Now, we were going to send this guy over. But I want to — you know, we —
give you so much to make our freedom and prosperity possible.

You are — as I said, you’re the best. Your families serve right
alongside you through every one of your missions and your deployments
and your hardship. And we owe you, and we owe your families.

I’ve often said that, as a nation, we have many obligations, but we only
have one truly sacred obligation: to properly prepare those and equip
those who we send into harm’s way and to care for you and your families
while you’re gone and when you return home.

It’s because — because all of you are out there doing what you’re doing
that America is — Americans all across the nation are able to spend the
day with their loved ones enjoying the blessings of security of our
American democracy. And we’re so, so grateful.

Now, we got Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Space Force, Coast
Guard all on the line here, and I’m looking forward to hearing from all
of you about the work you’re doing for our country and what’s on your
mind. And you can ask your Commander-in-Chief any questions you want to.
I’ll try to answer them.

So, thank you.

END
