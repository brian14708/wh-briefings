1:34 P.M. EST  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Governor Janet Mills.  It’s good to see
you, and thank you for your leadership and your friendship.  
   
Well, good afternoon, everyone.  It is an honor to join leaders from
around the world as we conclude the first day of the Summit For
Democracy.   
   
As I have discussed with many of you, I believe our world is at the
start of a new era — an era with new challenges, an era with new
opportunities, an era that is defined by interconnection and
interdependence.  
   
In this new era, I believe that democracy is our world’s best hope not
because it is perfect but because of its principles, because it delivers
for the people.  
   
Democracy protects human rights and promotes human dignity.  It is a
means to create peace and prosperity.  It is a means to solve our
greatest challenges, from COVID-19 to the climate crisis.  
   
It is, then, of particular concern, of urgent concern that democracy is
presently under threat and, for 15 years, has been on the decline.  
   
Around the world, autocrats have become emboldened.  Human rights
violations have multiplied.  And corruption is undermining progress. 
And misinformation is undermining public confidence.   
   
And so, it is incumbent on each of us, individually and collectively, to
take action.  
   
Here in the United States, we know that our democracy is not immune from
threats.  January 6th looms large in our collective conscience.  
   
And the anti-voter laws that many states have passed are part of an
intentional effort to exclude Americans from participating in our
democracy.  
   
In our democracy, in every democracy, a representative government is
foundational and the right to vote is fundamental.  
   
And so, ensuring every eligible American can access that right is a top
priority for our administration and an effort that I am proud to lead.  
   
We know that the right to vote cannot be taken for granted.  At every
turn, it must be safeguarded and strengthened.  And so, our Department
of Justice has increased its efforts to enforce federal voting rights
laws.  And our executive branch is taking further action to strengthen
the right to vote.  
   
But executive action alone is not enough.  Our Congress must act.  
   
Right now, there are two bills before the United States Congress: the
Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.  
   
Taken together, these bills would help to ensure that every eligible
American can vote and have their vote counted in a free, fair, and
transparent election.  
   
Today, as the world watches, the President and I reiterate our call for
swift passage of these bills.  
   
We know our work at home will make us stronger for the world.  We also
know that the strength of our democracy is tied to the strength of
democracies worldwide.  
   
And so, we are equally committed to combating threats to democracy
wherever they exist — threats such as corruption, which corrodes public
trust, fuels inequality, and can destabilize nations and entire
regions.  
   
On Monday, our administration released our first-ever U.S. Strategy on
Countering Corruption.  Through this strategy, we will deepen our
understanding and response to the transnational dimension of this
threat, which I know, from my work with leaders around the world, is
critical.  
   
In addition, because human rights and democracy are inextricably linked,
the United States has also rejoined the United Nations Human Rights
Council.  
   
Together, we must protect the rights of people with disabilities, the
rights of people of color, the rights of Indigenous peoples, LGBTQI+
rights, and women’s rights.  
   
In March, I addressed the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women.  And I
will say what I said then: I strongly believe the status of women is the
status of democracy, the exclusion of women in decision-making is a
marker of a flawed democracy, and the full participation of women
strengthens democracy.  
   
To that end, our administration has launched the first National Strategy
on Gender Equity and Equality.  
   
We are working to defend equal rights, including reproductive rights,
which are at grave risk here in the United States.  And we are working
with partners around the world to promote the full participation of
women and girls.  
   
So, I will conclude today with a short story.  So, this week, as you
know, Olaf Scholz took office as the Chancellor of Germany.  And the
President and I both look forward to working with him as we did his
predecessor.  
   
And on that point, back in July — this last July — I welcomed German
Chancellor Angela Merkel to my residence here in Washington, D.C.  We
spoke, then, about the status of democracy in our respective nations and
around the world.  And I mentioned my belief that democracy is marked by
both its strength and its fragility.  
   
It was a thoughtful and a powerful conversation.  And it was also very
personal.  The Chancellor shared what it was like to live behind the
Iron Curtain, and I shared how the Civil Rights Movement influenced my
upbringing.  
   
Though we grew up in different times and places, under very different
circumstances, the importance of democracy in our own lives was and
remains clear.  
   
As we address the present threats to democracy, as we work to prove its
value and vitality in this new era, as leaders of our world, we must all
remember that democracy is neither  
an abstract concept nor a static state.  
   
Democracy lives in the people.  Democracy is the people.  And democracy
is our best hope.  
   
So, as we go forward, let us do the work that democracy requires.  Let
us go to work, let us deliver together for the people.  
   
Thank you.
