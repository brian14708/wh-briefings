THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, everyone for participating in the Summit for
Democracy and for renewing our dedication to the shared values that are
the root of our national and international strength.  
   
In the lead-up to this gathering, over the last two days, we’ve heard
government leaders, as well as democratic reformers from every region of
the world, talk about the challenges that democracy is facing and the
opportunities for its renewal.  
   
We’ve facilitated conversations and connections among mayors around the
globe — from Mesa, Arizona, to Mannheim, Germany — and other leaders who
are on the frontlines of demonstrating the power of democracy through
local governments — governance.  
   
We’ve shone a spotlight on the importance of protecting media freedom
and how advancing the status of women and girls is an investment in the
success for our democracies.  
   
And we’ve focused on the need to empower human rights defenders and make
sure technological and — technology enables so much of our lives that is
used to advance democracies to lift people up, not to hold them down.  
   
We’ve heard the concerns of young people who have had a greater stake in
the future than anyone else — and they’ve made that clear — about what
matters to them most and how important it is to make sure their voices
are included in our democracies.  
   
And though each of our nations faces unique challenges and many of the
specific circumstances are different, the threat we face and the
solutions we seek have a common antecedent.  This is not a struggle of
any one facing it alone; it’s all of us.  
   
And the commitments we’ve made to ourselves, to our own people, to one
another will not only strengthen our own democracies by pushing back
against autocracies fighting corruption and promoting human rights for
all people — this is going to help seed the fertile ground for democracy
to bloom around the world.  
   
And I’m so encouraged by the energy and the enthusiasm we’ve seen to
rally people around the world in support of our shared democratic
values.  
   
As just one example: In advance of the Summit, the presidents of Panama,
Costa Rica, and the Dominican Republic formed, quote, an “alliance to
strengthen democratic institutions,” end of quote, to cooperate — to
cooperate on transparency, human rights, economic development, and
strengthening democracy throughout the region.   
   
This is the sort of inspiring commitment and partnerships that I hope
we’ll see more of as we undertake this issue in the next year of
action.   
   
And I hope that each of our countries are going to measure the results
of our efforts so that we can report back on our progress at a second
Summit for Democracy next year, when I hope to welcome each of you in
person.  
   
For the — for our part, as I said yesterday, the United States is
committed to strengthening our democracy at home and to working with
parties around the world — around the globe to prove that democracies
can deliver for people on issues that matter most to them.  
   
Here at home, that means working to make real the full promise of
America, including by enacting both the Freedom to Vote Act and the John
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.  
   
Because what’s true around the world is also true in the United States:
The sacred right to vote, to vote freely — the right to have your vote
counted is the threshold of liberty for democracy — for every
democracy.  With it, anything is possible.  Without it, virtually
nothing is possible.   
   
So, we have to come together and get it done, and we will.   
   
The United States is also going to continue our efforts to beat the
pandemic, working with the World Health Organization, COVAX, and other
partners to save lives, vaccinate the world against COVID-19, and
advance health security for everyone.  
   
We’re leveraging our democratic partnerships, like the G7 and the Quad,
to amplify our shared capacity to produce and to deliver vaccines and to
help get shots in arms for everyone everywhere.   
   
We’re taking on climate crisis — the climate crisis with a seriousness
and urgency, responding to the moral — with moral clarity we’re seeing
coming from young people around the world.   
   
And we’re affirming the democratic values that are at the heart of our
international system and which have been the foundational elements of —
for decades — of global growth and prosperity.  
   
And we’re committed — we’re committed to working with all who share
those values to shape the rules of the road that are going to govern our
progress in the 21st century, including on issues of cybersecurity and
emerging technologies so that future generations continue to reap the
benefits of liberty and democracy, as we have.  
   
And the final message I want to impart as we close out this Summit for
Democracy is that we know how hard the work is that’s going to be ahead
of us, but we also know we are up to the challenge.   
   
Because as I have said before, and as this gathering has demonstrated,
the democratic world is everywhere.  
   
Autocracies can never extinguish the ember of liberty that burns in the
hearts of people around the world, in every portion of the world.   
   
It knows no borders.  It speaks every language.  It lives in
anti-corruption activists, human rights defenders, journalists, peaceful
protestors on the frontlines of this struggle all around the world.  
   
And it lives in town council meetings, union elections, daily small acts
that occur around the globe whenever people come together to solve
problems and to bridge differences, and in all the ways civil society
empowers individuals to have a direct say in the issues that impact on
their — their lives — impact on them personally.  
   
And so, defending democracy demands a whole-of-society effort.  It
requires all of us.   
   
As the leaders of governments, we — we have a responsibility to listen
to our citizens, to strengthen the guardrails of democracy, and to drive
reforms that are going to make transparent, accountable governments —
governance more resilient against the buffering and — the buffeting
forces of autocracy and those who want — and the naked pursuit of power
ahead of the public good.  
   
You know, we have to work together with the private sector to combat
corruption, to build more equitable economies where more people can
share in the benefits.   
   
We have to empower our citizens to hold accountable — to hold all of us
accountable to the highest ideals and to make sure our actions align
with our words.  
   
And as we close out the first gathering, let’s — let us together
reaffirm our determination that the future will belong to those who
embrace human dignity, not those who trample it; who unleash the
potential of their people, not those who stifle it; and who give their
people the ability to breathe free, not those who seek to suffocate
their people with an iron hand.  
   
You know, as the great Irish poet Seamus Heaney once wrote:  
   
“…once in a lifetime,  
The longed-for tidal wave  
Of justice can rise up,  
And hope and history rhyme.”  
   
That tidal wave doesn’t come out of nowhere.  It doesn’t happen by
accident.  
   
It happens because people unleash the irresistible power of their dreams
and their determination.  
   
Democracy is what makes it possible for hope and history to rhyme.  
   
And today, hope and history lie in our hands.   
   
So let’s raise up our ambitions and rise up to meet the challenges
together.   
   
Thank you, and I look forward to following through in the next year on
all of the commitments that we’re making individually.  Thank you.  
   
Q  President Biden, inflation just hit nearly (inaudible) — (music
played over audio feed).  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible) peak of the crisis, and I think you’ll see
it change sooner than — quicker than — more rapidly than it will take
than most people think.   
   
Every other aspect of the economy is racing ahead.  It’s doing
incredibly well.  We’ve never had this kind of growth in 60 years.  But
inflation is affecting people’s lives.    
   
But if you take a look at it, if you — if we were — if and when, God
willing, we get the Build Back Better proposal — if you look at what —
what’s inflation all about for people?  They’re paying more for things
they need than they had to pay before.  That’s the bottom line.  
   
Now, if they’re paying considerably less for childcare, considerably
less for healthcare, considerably less for insulin, considerably less —
and go down the list — of being able to take care of their parents — all
of the things that are in the Build Back Better plan — the reason why
people think it’s going to — economists think it’s going to, in fact,
diminish the impact on inflation is because it’s reducing costs for
ordinary people.  Reducing costs for ordinary people.  
   
So, I think it’s — but in the meantime, in order to get that up and
running — and we don’t have a single Republican willing to support it
yet.  In order to get that up and running, it’s going to be focused all
on the downside.  The downside is prices have gone up because of supply
chain concerns.   
   
We’ve worked hard on the supply chain concerns.  I think you’re going to
see — you’ve already begun to see, and you’re going to see over the next
couple months the oil prices, gas prices — prices of gas pump come
down.   
   
You know, the biggest — one of the — a third of the increase in
inflation is used automobiles.  So, I mean, it is a real problem, but
the point is that has to do with supply chain as well, but it also has
to do with the fact that not everybody is looking for a used
automobile.  But those who are, they’re paying higher prices because
there’s fewer of them because of COVID and what was sold out and the
like.  
   
So I think it’s — it really is — it’s a real bump in the road.  It does
affect families.  When you walk in the grocery store and you’re paying
more for whatever you’re purchasing, it matters.  It matters to people
when you’re paying more for gas, although in some states, we’ve got the
price down below three bucks a gallon.  But the point is: It’s not gone
down quickly enough.  But I think it will.  
   
(Cross-talk from reporters.)  
   
Wait.  Wait, wait, wait.  What’s the follow-up?  I’m sorry.  
   
Q    Can you get Senator Manchin on board — with the inflation numbers
this high — with the Build Back Better bill?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I — I don’t know the answer to that.  I’m going to
be talking to him at the beginning of the week.  And I think, if you
look at what most people are saying — most of the economists are saying:
This Build Back Better bill is not going to increase inflation; it’ll
diminish inflation.  It has a negative impact on inflation, not a — it
doesn’t raise inflation.  
   
But that’s hard for people to think about right now because inflation is
up, and there’s a direct correlation in most people’s mind: “Well, why
is there inflation?”  “Well, government is spending money.”  Well,
that’s not the reason for the inflation.  
   
The reason for the inflation is that we have a supply chain problem that
is really severe and it’s causing a significant increase in prices in
things that, in fact, are hard to get access to.  Because, at the bottom
— the bottom of it all is COVID.  COVID has had a serious impact on the
ability to produce a whole lot of necessary products, particularly those
imported from the Pacific and other places.  
   
I’ll take your question and stop.  
   
Q    Mr. President, what’s your response to the Supreme Court leaving
the Texas abortion law in place?  And what specifically are you going to
do?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, my problem is I haven’t seen — I just got back — I
just walked here from delivering Bob Dole’s eulogy, so I haven’t seen
the report.  I will take a look at what the Supreme Court said.  I don’t
know what it said.  I don’t know what it said because the last three
hours I’ve been involved with Bob Dole’s eulogy and funeral.  And — but
I will — I will have a comment.  
   
Q  Providers will sue if the law remains intact.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don’t — I’m not going to comment on something I
don’t know yet, but I will comment.  
   
Thank you all so very much.
