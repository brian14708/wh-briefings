THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, folks. 

I’m about to get a briefing from my COVID team on Omicron variant.  And
we got some encouraging news from Pfizer yesterday.  Preliminary lab
data has indicated — it shows that — that three doses of the Pfizer
vaccine protects avents \[sic\] — protects against the Omicron variant.

And today, we’ve got even more good news from the FDA and the CDC: 16-
and 17-year-olds are eligible for boosters.

So, my message is really very straightforward and simple.  If you got
vaccinated six months ago — and I say to all of you in the press as
well, not a joke — I say to all of you: If you got vaccinated six months
ago, get your booster right away.

We’re seeing a lot more Americans do just that.  Fifty million — fifty
million people are — now have gotten their booster shots.  And we’re
getting people their booster shots at a record pace — roughly a million
people a day.

And America is making progress: 200 million with two shots, and more
kids vaccinated than any country on Earth.

And we got — we got a lot of work to do, but we’re going to get — we’re
going to get through this.  We’re going to make it through this.  And
we’re going to be okay, in my view.

And I’m about to get a briefing from my COVID team, as I said.  So,
thanks.  And I’m going to get the meeting started now.   
   
Thank you.
