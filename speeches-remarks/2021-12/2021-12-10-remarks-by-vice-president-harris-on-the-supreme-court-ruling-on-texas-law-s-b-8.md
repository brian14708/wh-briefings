title: Remarks by Vice President Harris on the Supreme Court Ruling on Texas Law S.B.
  8

*Vice President’s Ceremonial Office  
Eisenhower Executive Office Building*

Q    Madam Vice President, on the SCOTUS ruling today, I’m wondering —
the Biden administration promised a whole-of-government response to S.B.
8.  So after DOJ’s lawsuit was defeated, what will the Biden
administration do next?  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, listen, the ruling today is an attempt to
undo — in terms of what’s happening in Texas, Mississippi, and around
the country — is an attempt to undo 50 years of precedent.    
And as far as I’m concerned and as far as our administration is
concerned, a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body is
non-negotiable.   
  
And so we will continue to fight for the constitutional right of all
women to make decisions about their own body without interference by
some legislative group of people that think that they can replace their
judgment with hers.
