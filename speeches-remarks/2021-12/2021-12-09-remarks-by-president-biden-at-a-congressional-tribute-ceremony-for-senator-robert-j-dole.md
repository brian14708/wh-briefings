U.S. Capitol  
Washington, D.C.

10:28 A.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT:  Vice President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader
Schumer, Minority Leader McConnell, members of Congress, distinguished
guests, but most importantly, Elizabeth and Robin — I know this is not
easy.  Thank you for letting us do this.  
   
We meet here in the very heart of American democracy, the Capitol of the
United States of America, to receive a hero of that democracy for a
final time: Robert Joseph Dole.  He belongs here, in this place, in this
temple of liberty — to liberty and to — temple to possibilities.  
   
Bob Dole loved this Capitol.  It’s where he served the nation, shaped by
the figures that surround us: Washington and Jefferson, who set us on
our path; Abraham Lincoln, another man who — from the Heartland of the
country from whence he came; Bob’s hero, Dwight David Eisenhower; Martin
Luther King, Jr., whom Bob helped pass legislation honoring the great
civil rights leader with a federal holiday — Bob stood up and got that
done; Gerald Ford, who served here and with whom Bob sought the vice
presidency of the United States.  
   
In a sentence: Bob belongs here.  He too was a giant of our history —
and that’s not hyperbole; it’s real — of wit and grace, of principle and
persistence, of courage and conviction.  
   
I had the great honor of serving with Bob, as many of you around this
casket have.  I served with him for 25 years. 

He did have great wit.  They once asked him why in God’s name did he
vote to continue to fund Amtrak.  He said because if he didn’t, “Biden
would stay overnight and cause more trouble.”  (Laughter.)  I commuted
every day.  (Laughs.)  It’s a true story.  He was the deciding vote.

Well, you know, Bob and I — like many of us here — we disagreed on a
number of things but not on any of the fundamental things.  We still
found a way to work together.

We genuinely — we genuinely respected one another as colleagues and as
fellow Americans.  It was real; it wasn’t fake.  And we became great
friends.  
   
And because Bob deserves the final word, I’d like to read a portion of
his final message that he left to the country that I hope we all listen
to in the days and weeks and months to come.   
   
And I quote Bob Dole:  
   
“I cannot pretend that I have not been a loyal champion \[of\] my party,
but \[I’ve\] always served my country best when I did \[it\] so first
and foremost as an American.”  
   
“When we prioritize principles over party and humanity over personal
legacy” — when we do that, we “accomplish far more as a nation.  By
leading with shared faith in each other, we become America at its
best.”  He went on to say, “a beacon of hope, a source of comfort in
crisis, a shield against those who threaten freedom.”   
   
“Our nation has certainly faced periods of division.  But at the end of
the day, we have always found ways to come together.  We can find that
unity again.”  
   
And then the message said, end of message.  
   
My fellow Americans, America has lost one of our greatest patriots.  We
may follow his wisdom, I hope, and his timeless truth.  But the truth of
the matter is: As divided as we are, the only way forward for democracy
is unity, consensus — the only way.  May we follow his wisdom and his
timeless truth and reach consensus on the basic fundamental principles
we all agree on.     
   
May God bless Bob Dole.  May God bless America.  And may God protect our
troops.
