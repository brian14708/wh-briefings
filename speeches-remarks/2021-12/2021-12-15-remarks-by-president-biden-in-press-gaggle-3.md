Q  Mr. President, should congressional Democrats move on to working on
voting rights legislation this year and put off your Build Back Better
plan until 2022?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  If we can get the congressional voting rights done, we
should do it.  If we can’t, we got to keep going.  There’s nothing
domestically more important than voting rights.  It’s the single-biggest
issue.
