 South Lawn

10:59 A.M. EST  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I have some good news this morning: That Pfizer lab
report came back saying that the expectation is that the existing
vaccines protect against Omicron.  But if you get the booster, you’re
really in good shape.  And so that’s very encouraging.  That’s the lab
report.  That’s the lab report.  There’s more studies going on.  But
that’s very, very encouraging.  
   
Q    What did you achieve by talking with Putin yesterday?   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  He asked about you a lot.  We talked about you a lot.  
   
Q    Are you confident that Vladimir —  
   
Q    How are you going to get Manchin on the —  
   
Q    — Putin got the message?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No — no, wait.  Hang on.   
   
Q    Can you answer, sir, please?  
   
    THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, I will.  
   
Q    Joe Manchin says —  
   
Q    Mr. President, will you have him in person —  
   
Q    Can you answer my question first?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Shh.  Shh.  Let me —  
   
In the meeting with Putin, I was very straightforward.  There were no
minced words.   
   
It was polite, but I made it very clear: If, in fact, he invades
Ukraine, there will be severe consequences — severe consequences — and
economic consequences like none he’s ever seen or ever have been seen,
in terms of being imposed.  
   
He knows.  His immediate response was he understood that.  And I
indicated that I knew he would respond.  But beyond that, if, in fact,
we would probably also be required to reinforce our — our presence in
NATO countries to reassure particularly those on the eastern front.   
   
In addition to that, I made it clear that we would provide the defensive
capability to the Ukrainians as well.  
   
The good news is — the good news — the positive news is that, thus far,
our teams have been in constant contact.  We hope by Friday we’re going
to be able to say and announce to you that we’re having meetings at a
higher level, not just with us but with at least four of our major NATO
Allies and Russia to discuss the future of Russia’s concerns relative to
NATO writ large and whether or not we can work out any accommodations as
it relates to bringing down the temperature along the eastern front.  
   
Q    Can we rule out boots on the ground, sir — putting U.S. troops on
the ground?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  In terms of in Ukraine?  
   
Q    Senator Tim Kaine, Democrats are talking about could U.S. troops be
needed on the ground in or around Ukraine to stop an invasion.  Will you
rule that out, or is that on the table?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  That is not on the table.  What is not — they are not
—  
   
We have a moral obligation and a legal obligation to our NATO Allies, if
they were to attack under Article Five.  It’s a sacred obligation.  
   
That obligation does not extend to NATO — I mean, to Ukraine.  But it
would depend upon what the rest of the NATO countries are willing to do
as well.  
   
But the idea the United States is going to unilaterally use force to
confront Russia from invading Ukraine is not on — in the cards right
now.  But what will happen is: There will be severe consequences that
will have —  
   
Q    Sir, you’ve known Vladimir Putin for years.  Are you confident that
he got the message and knows this is different?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I am absolutely confident he got the message.  
   
Thank you.
