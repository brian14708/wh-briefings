  Meeting"

Oval Office

2:05 P.M. EDT  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  It’s an honor and a pleasure to welcome President
Zelenskyy to the White House, to the Oval Office.

As we celebrate 30 years of Ukrainian independence, the partnership
between our nations grows stronger, and it’s going to even become
stronger than it has been.

Ukraine and the United States have a similar value system and the strong
commitment to the fil- — the fulfillment of a promise that we hope all
will come forward, and that is a Europe whole, free, and at peace.

And the United States remains firmly committed to Ukraine’s sovereignty
and territorial integrity in the face of Russian aggression and — and —
our support for Ukraine’s Euro-Atlantic aspirations.

Today, we’re going to discuss how the U.S. can continue to support
Ukraine as it advances its democratic reforms, agenda, and movement
toward being completely integrated in Europe.

We’re revitalizing the Strategic Partnership Commission between our
nations.  And we’re also creating a new strategic defense framework and
a new $60 million security assistance package, as well as a new energy
and climate dialogue to help Ukraine diversify its energy supplies while
supporting our climate goals relating to global warming.

And, of course, we’ll talk about our ongoing fight against COVID-19. 
And the United States has donated 2.2 million vaccines to — through — to
Ukraine through COVAX.  And we’re going to continue to work to provide
more as well.

We have much to talk about.  And I still remember the opportunity that I
had to speak to the Rada years ago, and I look forward to being able to
come back some day to see you.  
   
Mr. President.  
   
PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY:  (In English.)  Thank you very much, Mr.
President.  
   
(As interpreted.)  First of all, I would like to greet you, ladies and
gentlemen, as representatives of the journalist community.  And I would
like to thank President Biden for his invitation.  In the difficult
times for the world and for the United States, for Ukraine, still you
found time for us, and we are very grateful for this indeed.  And, of
course, the United States, our strategic partner and staunch supporter
of our sovereignty and our territorial integrity.   
   
And I would like to use this occasion to thank President Biden
personally for following our conversation on the phone and dispatching
the more than 2 million vaccines to save Ukrainian lives.   
   
(In English.)  More than 2 million.  
   
INTERPRETER:  Yes.  
   
PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY:  (As interpreted.)  And thank you for the $60
million program for defense development in Ukraine until the end of this
year.  We appreciate this contribution.  
   
And, Mr. President, accept my sincere condolences because of the tragic
death of the heroes who were trying to save human lives in Afghanistan
and sacrificed their own.  
   
We are very compassionate and we have the fellow feeling for such losses
— such tragic loss — because for eight years in a row, as you know,
we’ve had this war on the Ukrainian Donbas and we have lost 15,000 of
our best people.   
   
Well, I have a very big agenda for our relations — maybe not for this
meeting, which is too short — to answer all the questions, but they are
all of big importance for our both countries, I believe. 

But, at least, we have to focus very much now on the security issue,
which is the most important on this agenda.  And security in Donbas —
the Ukrainian Donbas, in the Ukrainian Crimea — temporarily, as we
believe, occupied by the Russian Federation; security in the Black Sea
and security in the Azov Sea region.

And, of course, the security issue — energy security at this time,
because we are very much concerned, as you are, with the commissioning
of — possible commission on the Nord Stream 2. 

And I would like to discuss with President Biden here his vision, his
government’s vision of Ukraine’s chances to join NATO and the timeframe
for this accession, if it is possible; and the role the United States
can play being involved in a peaceful settlement in Donbas that we would
like to reach.

And last but not least, the economic bloc.  Because we came to Ukraine —
we came to office to transform Ukraine, so we called our program a
“transformation program,” and we would like to discuss the role that the
United States would like to play in this transformation and economic
revival of our country.

And, finally, a very sensitive issue of this morning, Mr. President: We
handed over to your representatives a list of prisoners — prisoners held
in the temporarily-occupied Donbas; in the temporarily-occupied Crimea;
in the Russian Federation — their territory, in Moscow.  There are 450
people, maybe more, which are held there, and we would like to have your
assistance in freeing them and bringing them back to their country.

(In English.)  Thank you very much.

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you.  Much to talk about.
