title: Remarks by President Biden on the August Jobs Report
---
 
State Dining Room

10:41 A.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  I’m sorry I’m a few minutes late.  We’re
getting ready to head down to Louisiana and I had a few things I had to
do.  
   
Look, we — as we head into Labor Day weekend, we have more evidence of
the progress of our economy from last year’s economic calamity.  
   
Today, we learned the economy created 235 new — thousand — new jobs in
August.  And the unemployment rate fell to 5.2 percent, the lowest it
has been in 18 months.  
   
But despite the impact of the Delta variant — and I’ll talk a little
more about that in a minute — what we’re seeing is an economic recovery
that is durable and strong.  
   
The Biden plan is working.  We’re getting results.  America is on the
move again.  And today’s revision of previous month job gains, with the
revision of the July numbers — this report means that we have been
adding an average of 750,000 jobs per month, on average, during the past
three months.  
   
And in the three months before I became President?  Well, we were adding
60,000 jobs a month.  
   
The total job creation in the first seven months  
of my administration is nearly double — double any prior first-year
President.   
   
While I know some wanted to see a larger number today, and so did I,
what we’ve seen this year is a continued growth, month after month, in
job creation.  It’s not just that I’ve added more jobs than any
first-year President — in the first year of any President — it’s that
we’ve added jobs in every single one of my first seven job reports.  And
wages are going up.  
   
Some more jobs — some — some mo- — some months are fewer, some months
more, but always adding jobs.  
   
This is the kind of growth that makes our economy stronger and
consistent progress, and not boom or bust.  
   
Our economy grew the first half of this year at the fastest rate in
about 40 years.  
   
We’re the only developed country in the world — I’ll say that again —
we’re the only developed country in the world whose economy is now
bigger than it was before the pandemic.  
   
Because of the groundwork we laid with the American Rescue Plan, our
vaccination — and our vaccination strategy, we’re seeing an economy and
a job market that can weather the ups and downs of the Delta variant and
anything else that comes our way.  
   
You know, we have a lot more work to do, as I will discuss shortly.  But
the facts speak for themselves.  Think of where this country stood on
the day I was sworn in as President, and compare it to where we are
today.  
   
The number of people filing new claims for unemployment each week is
down 57 percent.  Down 57 percent.  
   
Child poverty is down nearly 50 percent.  We’re no longer seeing long
lines of people waiting for boxes of food to be put in their trunk after
waiting for hours, or sometimes up to two hours.  
   
The unemployment rate is down, from 6.3 percent to 5.2.  And I believe
it’s going to continue to go down.   
   
And it’s no wonder that last week’s Gallup poll found that 72 percent of
Americans think that now is a good time to find a quality job.  At this
time last year, that number was 30 percent.  And that’s the mark of an
economy where regular people can see a place for themselves in the
economy.  
   
You know, the holidays we celebrate this weekend — the holiday, Labor
Day, is about honoring the dignity of work, honoring the American
worker.  And that’s what our economic strategy is all about as well.  
   
It’s about growing our economy from the bottom up and the middle out,
providing some extra breathing room for families —  and my dad would
just say, “Just a little breathing room” — creating an environment where
employers have truly com- — have to compete — compete for workers by
providing higher wages and better benefits.  
   
That’s what’s happening.  Wages are up, especially for working-class
Americans.  
   
Even so, even with the progress we’ve made, we’re not where we need to
be in our economic recovery.  There are two critical tasks ahead this
month to get us closer to our goal and to take the next steps in our
recovery.  
   
The first: We need to make more progress in fighting the Delta variant
of COVID-19.  This is a continuing pandemic of the unvaccinated.  Since
becoming President, I’ve ramped up testing, secured enough vaccine for
every single American, and gotten 175 million Americans fully
vaccinated.    
   
Still — still, too many have not gotten vaccinated.  And it’s creating a
lot of unease in our economy and around our kitchen tables.   
   
Today’s report shows that the steps we’ve taken, passing the Rescue Plan
and vaccinating 175 million people, make our economy capable of growing
and adding jobs even in the face of this continuing Delta surge.  A
strength in our economy very different from the way things were last
winter.  
   
There’s no question the Delta variant is why today’s jobs report isn’t
stronger.  I know people were looking, and I was hoping, for a higher
number.  
   
But next week, I’ll lay out the next steps that are going to — we’re
going to need to combat the Delta variant, to address some of those
fears and concerns.  
   
I want to talk about how we’ll further protect our schools, our
businesses, our economy, and our families from the threat of Delta.  As
we continue to fight the Delta variant, the American Rescue Plan we
passed continues to support families, businesses, and communities.  Even
as some of the benefits that were provided are set to expire next week,
states have the option to extend those benefits and the federal
resources from the Rescue Plan to do so.  Not more federal taxes, state
taxes, but they have the federal money to be able to do that.   
   
States continue to have access to a wide array of support, like help for
schools that are reopening, help for childcare centers to make them
available and affordable, and other resources to help our economy get
back to normal.  
   
The measures we’ve taken so far have brought America out of an economic
freefall, steadied us, and enabled us to grow our economy even as we
combat — continue to combat COVID.   
   
We are adding jobs, not losing them.   
   
The fight against COVID today is far different from the fight we were
waging last winter.  
   
The second thing that has to happen in September is for the Congress —
the House and Senate — to finish the job of passing my economic agenda
so that we can keep up the historic momentum we’ve been building these
last seven months.  It’s about investing in America’s future, not about
short-term stimulus; that’s not what we’re talking about.   
   
These are long-term prosperity we’re talking about — about lowering the
cost of living for families, creating millions of good-paying jobs for
hardworking Americans.  It’s about reducing bottlenecks in our economy,
reducing long-term price pressures.  It’s about helping more people to
work by helping ease the burden that parents bear, especially mothers,
keeping them out of the job market.   
   
Both the Senate and the House have taken important steps forward to pass
my bipartisan infrastructure plan.  This bill is going to end years of
gridlock.  We used to — remember when we had — we always had — you know,
the whole notion we had, I guess, was every week was going to be
infrastructure week?  
   
Well, both literally and figuratively, it’s going to change things on
our streets across the country and, figuratively, as it relates to
Washington.   
   
We’re going to create millions of good-paying jobs.  We’re going to ease
inflationary pressure and allow us to win the competition of the 21st
century in a global economy where the competition has become more
intense.  
   
Look, it’s historic investment in roads, in rail, in transit and
bridges, in clean energy, in clean water, universal broadband.  It’s
going to modernize our energy grid.  You need not go any further than
look what’s happening across the country now in terms of the energy
grids.  It’s about resilience.  Make our roads and highways safer.  Make
us more resilient to the kinds of devastating impacts from extreme
weather we’re seeing in so many parts of the country.  
   
And, look, this is about good-paying jobs for ordinary people,
blue-collar workers.  Jobs at prevailing wage — not $15 an hour, or $20
or $30.  But for the carpenters and pipe-fitters, plumbers, electrical
workers, and so many other Americans, about 90 percent of the jobs we’ll
create with this plan won’t require a college degree.  It will
fundamentally transform the lives of millions of people.  It’s going to
transform America and propel us into the future, just as we did when we
built the transcontinental railroad or we electrified the country — the
TVA.  
   
Look, at the same time, the House and Senate have to advance my Build
Back Better agenda.  That bill contains critical investments in
childcare to make it easier for families to be able to go to work and
assure their child is being taken care of, and home care for seniors. 
The polling data shows: Among your generation — all of you out here —
your greatest concern is caring for your elderly parent, even more than
your child. 

It’s about paid leave — allowing people with a new child or a sick
spouse at home to take care of them without risking losing their
paycheck — not indefinitely, but for a time period they can actually
make a difference.  
   
Universal pre-K and community college — making us significantly better
educated and increasing our competitive edge globally, around the world,
over time.  
   
And we’ll combat climate change by building our clean energy future,
creating — the experts point out — millions of jobs and building
windmills and solar panels all around the country, and transferring that
energy — transmitting it to parts that don’t have that capacity.  
   
We’re going to bring down the cost of prescription drugs by allowing
Medicare to finally be able to negotiate drug prices with producers. 
Look — and so much more.   
   
Here’s the thing you need to know: We’re going to deliver these
investments without raising taxes one cent on anyone making less than
$400,000 a year.  
   
How are we going to do that?  We’re going to do it by leveling the
playing field; by just having a fair system where we ask the largest
corporations and the wealthiest Americans to begin to pay their fair
share, not more. 

They can still make millions of dollars.  The super wealthy are still
going to be able to have three homes.  It’s not going to affect
anything.   
   
The fact of the matter is, though, it’s about time they begin to pay
their fair share.  
   
For example — you’ve heard me say it before and I’ll say it again, but
it’s the best example to make clear to people a very complicated notion:
Fifty-five of the largest corporations in America last year paid zero —
zero in federal taxes.  
   
I don’t care what your position is.  It just seems to me it’s time they
start to pay their fair share like everybody else.  Just pay a little
bit here, and it comes out to billions of dollars if they pay it.

The irony of ironies is: During the recession and the pandemic — you’ve
heard me say this before; I apologize for repeating it — when the vast
majority of Americans were struggling just to hang on, the number of
billionaires in America actually grew.  
   
(Laughs.)  Now, I want to hold here for just a second.  If — you know,
there have been so many records the stock market has hit under my
presidency.  Imagine if the other guy was here: “We’re doing great. 
It’s wonderful.  The stock market is surging.  It’s gone up higher under
me than anybody.”  But that doesn’t — that doesn’t mean that it’s the
best for the economy. 

Look, the stock market has set 40 record highs just this year.  They can
afford to pay just a little bit more.   
But, folks, right now, the House and Senate are working on my plan to
generate a fairer tax system and close loopholes that big corporations
and the super-wealthy use to pay less.  
   
To give you one example, there’s a group of experts — left, right, and
center — who estimate that, right now, we lose more than $100 billion a
year in tax revenue owed from the top 1 percent of taxpayers alone — not
because of low tax rates, but because wealthy people aren’t paying the
taxes they owe. 

We’re going to change that so they pay taxes just like typical
hardworking Americans do right now.  We’re going to use the money we
collect from the tax cuts for — to give tax cuts to middle-class
families, to make it easier to raise kids, to take care of your aging
parents, and so much more.  
   
But what’s going on in Congress?  Not a single Republican supports this
plan.  They support the bipartisan plan, but not this plan.  Not one. 

And some big corporations are spending millions of dollars in —
legitimately — I mean, they — they’re lobbying — to try to escape their
obligation to pay the taxes they owe, leaving working families to pay a
larger share of the burden.  
   
Somebody has got to pay.  And when those who can afford to pay aren’t
paying anywhere near their fair share, it means you all pay more.  
   
You know — and this has worked in the past, with significant lobbying
efforts, but I don’t think it’s going to work with me.

For those big corporations that don’t want things to change, my message
is this: It’s time for working families — the folks who built this
country — to have their taxes cut.  
   
And those corporate interests doing everything they can  
to find allies in Congress to keep that from happening, let me be — as
the old expression goes — perfectly clear: I’m going to take them on.  
   
We’re going to pass these measures.  We’re going to build an economy
from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down.  
   
And when corporations and the wealthiest start to pay their fair share,
it’s going to put millions of people — according to all the estimates —
millions of people to work in jobs that are going to help them punch
their ticket to the middle class and stay in the middle class.  And
everyone will do better, including corporate America.   
   
Look, just think about it: Throughout our history, when the middle class
has done well, when it prospers, has there ever been a time the wealthy
and corporate America doesn’t do well?  I can’t think of one.  
   
Our country needs these investments.  I’m not asking anything other than
some fairness being injected into the system.  Like I said, to hold
here, the fact is that, you know, the very wealthy will — they’re still
going to have three homes or four homes, if they want.  It’s not going
to change what schools they can send their kids to.  It’s not going to
change their standard of living.  But just pay a fair share.   
   
Corporate America — it’s going to continue to do very well.  I’ve seen
no evidence to suggest that it’s going to cost jobs or cost — I mean,
you know, it’s just — and now we need Congress to finish the job, to
come through for the American people and ensure that the economy
continues to gain strength and stability as we move forward.  
   
Now, finally, the third thing we need to do, all of us, is to stick
together.  We have to put ourselves on track to accomplish extraordinary
things: a strong, inclusive, historic economic growth; landmark
investments to create even more good jobs and deliver breathing room to
millions of families; a giant step forward in the fight against climate
change — the crisis made more evident than ever by the death and
destruction caused by extreme weather just these past few days.  
   
My agenda, I believe, is one that every American, if they understand it,
they can get behind.  And because of the work we’ve all put in — not
just here in Washington, but in communities across the country — every
one of those goals is now within our reach.  
   
Coming together has always been part of the DNA of Americans.  And if we
can summon that instinct within us to unite as one people, one nation,
there is nothing beyond our capacity.  
   
So, let’s keep going.  Let’s stick together.  And let’s remember who we
are.  You’ve heard me say it time and again: We’re the United States of
America.  And the rest of the world is looking to us to — because we’re
— we are the most prosperous nation in the world right now.  We’re
growing.  And there’s a fairness to what we’re doing.  A fairness.

We’ll still have millionaires.  We’ll still have billionaires.  We’ll
still have corporations that do incredibly well and CEOs that make a lot
of money.  But everybody has to start paying their fair share. 

Thank you very much. 

Q    Mr. President, on abortion rights in Texas, sir.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Pardon me?

Q    One question on abortion rights in Texas, sir.  What would be your
message to women in Texas?  And what can your administration do to
protect abortion rights on the federal level? 

THE PRESIDENT:  I’m late for going down.  I’m going to talk about these
things from Louisiana.  But I have been — continue to be a strong
supporter of Roe v. Wade.  Number one.

And the most pernicious thing about the Texas law: It sort of creates a
vigilante system where people get rewards to go out to — anyway.   
   
And it just seems — I know this sounds ridiculous — almost un-American,
what we’re talking about — not to debate about —  
   
And I under- — I respect people who think that — who don’t support Roe
v. Wade; I respect their views.  I respect them — they — those who
believe life begins at the moment of conception and all.  I respect
that.  Don’t agree, but I respect that.  I’m not going to impose that on
people. 

But what I was told — and I must tell you, I am not certain — I was told
that there are possibilities within the existing law to have the Justice
Department look and see whether there are things that can be done that
can limit the independent action of individuals in enforcing a federal
sys- — a state law.   
   
I don’t know enough to give you an answer yet.  I’ve asked that to be
checked.   
   
Thank you all very much.
