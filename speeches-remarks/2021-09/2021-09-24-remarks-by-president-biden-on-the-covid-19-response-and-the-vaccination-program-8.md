title: "Remarks by President Biden on the COVID- \u2060 19 Response and the Vaccination\
  \ Program"
---
 
 State Dining Room

9:57 A.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning, everyone.  As I’ve said before, we have
the tools to beat COVID — COVID-19 — if we come together as a country
and use the tools we have.  
   
Earlier this month, I laid out a six-part plan for the fall that does
just that: One, vaccinate the unvaccinated, including with new
requirements; two, keep vaccinated — keep the vaccinated protected;
three, keep children safe and schools open; four, increase testing and
masking; five, protect the economic — our economic recovery; and six,
improve the care for people with COVID-19.  Now, we’ve made important
progress on each front.  
   
And this week, as planned, we took a key step in protecting the
vaccinated with booster shots, which our top government doctors believe
provides the highest level of protection available to date.  
   
The Food and Drug Administration — the FDA — the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention — the CDC — they’ve completed their independent
scientific review.  And based on that review, the majority of Americans
who were fully vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine are now able to
receive the booster shot six months after they’ve received their second
shot.  Six months after you receive the second shot, you’re eligible.   
   
Those eligible include, in addition to meeting the requirement of six
months after the second shot: those people that are 65 years old or
older; adults 18 and over with certain underlying health conditions like
diabetes and obesity; and those who are at increased risk of COVID-19
because of where they work or where they live, like healthcare workers,
teachers, grocery store workers.  
   
That’s over — that group makes up 60 million Americans who are now
eligible for a booster six months after their second shot.  And up to 20
million who will receive their — received their earlier Pfizer shot at
least six months ago are eligible today.  So, those January, February —
those folks are eligible now.  Now.  
   
And I’ve made clear all along: The decision of which booster shot to
give, when to start the shot, and who will get them is left to the
scientists and the doctors.  That’s what happened here.  
   
And while we waited and prepared, we brought enough — we bought enough
booster shots, and states and pharmacies, doctor’s offices, and
community health centers have been preparing to get shots in arms —
booster shots in arms — for a while.  
   
And like your first and second shot, the booster shot is free and easily
accessible.  Booster shots will be available in 80,000 locations,
including over 40,000 pharmacies nationwide.  
   
So, my message today is this: If you’ve got the Pfizer vaccine — if you
got the Pfizer vaccine in January, February, or March of this year and
you’re over 65 years of age, go get the booster.   Or if you have a
medical condition like diabetes or you’re a frontline worker, like a
healthcare worker or a teacher, you can get a free booster now.  I’ll be
getting my booster shot.  It’s hard to acknowledge I’m over 65, but I’ll
be getting my booster shot.  (Laughter.)  It’s a bear, isn’t it?  I tell
you — acknowledge it.  Anyway.  
   
But all kidding aside, I’ll be getting my booster shot.  I’m not sure
exactly when I’m going to do it — as soon as I can get it done.    
   
Of course, millions of Americans got the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson
vaccines.  My message for you is this: You still have a high degree of
protection.  Our doctors and scientists are working day and night to
analyze the data from those two organizations on whether and when you
need a booster shot.  And we’ll provide updates for you as the process
moves ahead.  
   
Again, the bottom line is: If you’re fully vaccinated, you’re highly
protected from severe illness even if you get COVID-19.   
   
In fact, recent data indicates there’s only one confirmed positive case
per 5,000 fully vaccinated Americans per day.  You’re as safe as
possible.  You’re in good shape.  And we’re doing everything we can to
keep it that way, which is where the booster comes in.  
   
So, let me be clear: Yes, we’ve made incredible progress in vaccinating
Americans, with over 182 million people being fully vaccinated as of
today.  
   
But this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated.  And it’s caused by the fact
that, despite Americans having an unprecedented and successful
vaccination program, despite the fact that for almost five months, free
vaccines have been available in 80,000 locations, we still have — we
still have over 70 million Americans who have failed to get a single
shot.  
   
And to make matters worse, there are elected officials actively working
to undermine with false information the fight against COVID-19.  This is
totally unacceptable.  
   
The vast majority of Americans are doing the right thing.  Three
quarters of the eligible have gotten at least one shot, but one quarter
has not gotten any.  
   
And in a country as large as ours, that’s — 25 percent minority can
cause an awful lot of damage.  And they are causing a lot of damage.  
   
The unvaccinated overcrowd our hospitals, overrunning emergency rooms
and intensive care units, leaving no room for someone with a heart
attack or a cancer operation needed to get the lifesaving care because
the places where they would get that care are crowded; they are not
available.  
   
The unvaccinated also put our economic at — recovery at risk, causing
unease in the economy around the — and causing unease around the kitchen
table.  I can imagine what’s going on in the conversations this morning,
and a lot of parents wondering what’s going to happen.  “What’s going to
happen?”  Those who have been vaccinated — “what’s going to happen?” 
Potentially slowing economic growth, costing jobs.   
   
Their refusal has cost all of us.  The refusal to get vaccinated has
cost all of us.  And I’m moving forward with vaccination requirements
wherever I can.  These requirements will cover two thirds of all workers
in America.   
   
And I’m pleased to see more businesses and organizations instituting
their own vaccination requirements.  I’ve had business leaders call me
and thank me for setting the policies that would allow them to do the
same thing.  They are able to do it anyway, but it gives them the
ability to move forward.  
   
We’re making progress.  For example, United Airlines, which required
vaccines about seven weeks ago, now has 97 percent of their employees
vaccinated.   
   
Just four weeks ago, the Department of Defense required vaccinations for
the military, and already 92 percent — 92 percent — of our active-duty
service members are vaccinated.  
   
And we’re on track to administer 24 million shots in arms in
September.   
   
So, please, do the right thing.  Do the right thing.  And I understand
there’s a lot of misinformation you’ve been fed out there, but try to
look through — get to people you trust, the people who have been
vaccinated.  Ask them.  Ask them.   
   
So, get vaccinated.  But just don’t take it from me.  Listen to the
voices of the unvaccinated Americans who are lying in hospital beds,
taking their final breaths, saying — and, literally, we’ve seen this on
television — “If only I had gotten vaccinated.  If only.  If only.”  
   
They’re leaving behind husbands and wives and small children — people
who adore them.  People are dying and will die who don’t have to die. 
It is not hyperbole to suggest it’s literally a tragedy.   
   
Please don’t let this become your tragedy.  Get vaccinated.  It can save
your liv- — your life.  It can save the lives of those around you.  
   
You know, text your ZIP Code to 438829 — 438829 — or visit Vaccines.gov
to find a vaccination location near you now.  
   
Let me close with this: We also made so much progress during the past
eight months in this pandemic, and now we face a critical moment.  We
have the tools.  We have the plan.  We just have to finish the job
together as one nation.  And I know we can.  I know we can.  
   
God bless you all.  And please, look out for your own self-interest and
health here.  Get vaccinated.  May God protect our troops.  
   
Thank you.  
   
ABC, Rachel Scott.  
   
Q  Thank you, Mr. President.  You said on the campaign trail that you
were going to restore the moral standing of the U.S., that you were
going to immediately end Trump’s assault on the dignity of the immigrant
communities.  
   
Given what we saw at the border this week, have you failed in that
promise?  And this is happening under your watch.  Do you take
responsibility for the chaos that’s unfolding?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Of course I take responsibility.  I’m President.  But it
was horrible what — to see, as you saw — to see people treated like they
did: horses nearly running them over and people being strapped.  It’s
outrageous.  
   
I promise you, those people will pay.  They will be — an investigation
is underway now, and there will be consequences.  There will be
consequences.  It’s an embarrassment.  But beyond an embarrassment, it’s
dangerous; it’s wrong.  It sends the wrong message around the world.  It
sends the wrong message at home.  It’s simply not who we are.  Thank
you.  
   
Peter Alexander.  
   
Q    Mr. President, thank you.  You came into office on a message of
competence and unity.  We’ve witnessed what’s happened in the country
over the course of the last several months.  We’ve seen the chaotic
troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, the threat of a government shutdown
right now, and Democrats — members of your own party — are still divided
over your agenda going forward.  So what do you say to Americans who say
that you have not delivered on that promise?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Remember, I said it’s going to take me a year to deliver
everything I’m looking at here.  That’s number one.  
   
Number two, take a look at what I inherited when I came into office —
when I came into office, the state of affairs, and where we were: We had
4 million people vaccinated.  We had no plan.  We had — I mean, I can go
down the list.   
   
So, you know, part of it is dealing with the panoply of things that were
landed on my plate.  I’m not complaining; it’s just a reality.  It’s a
reality, number one.  
   
Number two, I think a part of what has to happen here as well — for
example, let’s talk about my economic plan.  The economic plan — and you
all are always — and understandably, legitimately — citing polls.  Every
element of my economic plan is overwhelmingly popular — overwhelmingly
popular.  
   
But the problem is, with everything happening, not everybody knows
what’s in that plan.  For example, all those women out there who are not
able to go back to work because they have a — a dependent grandparent or
a parent, or they have a dependent child who needs help, or they can’t
find daycare, or they can’t find affor- — I mean, look at what’s
happening.  
   
Well, there’s a solution.  There’s a solution in the proposal that I put
forward.  And the plans we’re now debating in the United St- — among
ourselves and they’re debating in Congress as — is a plan — the essence
of the plan that I laid out at the beginning.  
   
And so, I’m confident that, at the end of the day, we’re going to be
able to get that done.  
   
Second point I’d like to make: We talk about price tags.  The — it is
zero price tag on the debt.  We’re paying — we’re going to pay for
everything we spend.  So they say it’s not — you know, people,
understandably — “Well, you know, it started off at $6 trillion, now
it’s $3.5 trillion.  Now it’s — is it going to be $2.9?  Is it…”  
   
It’s going to be zero — zero.  Because in the — in that plan that I put
forward — and I said from the outset — I said, “I’m running to change
the dynamic of how the economy grows.”   
   
I’m tired of trickle-down.  The trillionaires and billionaires are doing
very, very well — you all know it; you’ve all reported it — and in the
middle of this crisis.  But hardworking people and middle-class people
are getting hurt.   
   
And so, I provide for, for example, a tax cut.  If you have a child, you
get a refundable tax credit.  It’s reduced hunger in America by 40
percent, literally, for children.  You have the — the whole notion of
being able to provide for daycare for your children, getting people back
to school, et cetera.  It’s all paid for. It’s all paid for.   
   
But — and a lot of these are flat tax cuts that exist within my
proposal, and they’re being calculated as if the cost of — of the — of
the Child Care Tax Credit is a cost to the government; it’s not.  It’s
reducing taxes — reducing taxes, not increasing taxes.    
   
Now, part of the problem is I had hoped — I hadn’t planned on, although
I kind of anticipated it might happen — I hadn’t planned on the 178-mile
top winds hurricanes going into Louisiana and 20 inches of rain in New
York and New Jersey, and — and an area as big as the state of New Jersey
burning down in the West.   
   
And so, what I had hoped I would be doing, I do what I did in the
campaign: I’d be out making the case about what my plan proposal
contained.  And it’s been very much curtailed by a whole range of
things.  
   
And so, I think that it’s understandable — I think it’s understandable —
people being frustrated.  I think they’re frustrated as well by the fact
that — not just members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans —
frustrated by, you know, “I thought this was going to be better.  I
thought everything was working out.”  We were — we were moving along on
— on COVID-19, and now we have all these people who refuse to get a
shot.  And now look at the people dying — large numbers of people dying.

So, I guess, I think it’s a totally legit- — obviously, it’s a
legitimate question you’ve asked — but I think, putting into context
here, it’s going to take some time here. 

And I know I always kid you when you all ask me about, “Well, what about
— are you going to get A done, B done, C done?”  “Well,” I say, “do you
want to negotiate?”  I’m being a bit facetious, obviously, but here’s
the deal: This is going to end up — I believe, we’re going to end up
getting both pieces of my economic legislation. 

The first piece — the 1.9 — fundamentally changed the structure and the
nature of the economy in this country, even though, remember, it got
clobbered.  It was this — “Oh, this terrible thing, no Republican voted
for it.”  Well, we got ec- — real economic growth. 

Now it — we’re at this stalemate at the moment.  And we’re going to have
to get these two pieces of legislation passed.  Both need to be
passed.  And they’ll have a profound impact according to not just Joe —
not Joe Biden, but according to Wall Street, according to the IMF,
according to international organizations. 

And so — and then there’s, you know, I’m going to be having a meeting
today with the Quad, with the — the leaders of — the leader of India,
Japan, and Australia.  And we’re going to be talking about Afghanistan,
which is a legitimate thing for people to talk about. 

But the truth of the matter is, at the end of the day is: We were
spending $300 million a day for 20 years.  There was no easy way to end
that.  And we’re now still getting people out, but it’s — it’s really —
there was no — no picture-book way to say, “Okay, the war has
ended.  Let’s get everybody out, and we’ll go home.”  No war has ever
ended that way, other than there’s been a surrender, and it’s a totally
different circumstance. 

So anyway, there’s a lot, I’m sure, along the line that there are things
I could have done better, but I make no apologies for my proposals, how
I’m propo- — how I’m — how I’m proceeding, and why I think, by the end
of the year, we’re going to be in a very different place. 

Q    Mr. President, just to follow up on COVID, if I can, quickly —

THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.

Q    What do you say to Americans who disregard the new CDC guidance and
get a booster shot anyway?

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I — I don’t — I’m not sure how they get it, but —

Q    There are people who go into stores right now and just have got it
without any high-risk situation or underneath that age limit; it happens
around the country as we speak.

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think what’s going to happen is you’re going to
see that, in the near term — or we’re probably going to open this up
anyway.  They’re constantly looking at — we’re looking at both Moderna
and J&J.  And we’re both — as I said in the speech — in addition to
that, we’re also looking to the time when we’re going to be able to
expand the booster shots, basically, across the board. 

So, I would just say: It’d be better to wait your turn in line, wait
your — you know, in line — wait — wait your turn and to — to get there.

Q    Thank you, sir.

THE PRESIDENT:  Ken. 

Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  When you met with congressional leaders
this week, you told them to try to find a number less than $3.5 trillion
on the reconciliation package that they could live with.  What is that
topline number in your mind as you deliberate these considerations?

And then, separately, you mentioned how you’re going to pay for some of
these provisions.  Senator Wyden has a proposal on annual taxes on
billionaires’ unrealized gains.  Is that a proposal that you support?

THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, I do.  I — look, I support a lot of these
proposals.  We don’t need all the things I support to pay for this, but
I do support that.

Look, you — if you — if you get a — if you file with a W-2 form, you
know, the IRS has access to your bank account and your bank tells you
how much you made, what you have in there, and, you know — and they
estimate your tax. 

Well, if you — if you have no income, you’re just — it’s all — if you
have no earned income and it’s all investment income, it’s hard to
figure out what the hell you — excuse me — what the heck you have.   
   
And that’s why we have to — and I know some people don’t like this —
that’s why we have to rehire some IRS agents.  And not to do anything,
not to try to make people pay something they don’t owe — just say, “Hey,
step up.  Step up and pay like everybody else does.

Look, I really mean this.  Look at my whole career — and I come from,
you know, the corporate state of America.  I just think it’s about just
paying your fair share, for Lord’s sake. 

Now, we can argue whether or not the corporate tax should go back up to
26 and a half percent or 28 or 24, but the idea that 50 — 50 major
corporations in America, making a sum total of $40 billion pays zero? 
Come on.  Come on.  It’s just wrong.  It’s just not fair.  And I think
is beginning to, you know, sink through the ether a little bit here on
the part of people.

So, I think there clearly is enough from a panoply of options to pay for
whatever it is that folks decide to pay for.  
   
And let me finish by answering the initial part of your question, if I
may.  The way I look at it is what I’ve been telling my colleagues, and
it surprises them sometimes when we — in those rooms.  And I don’t know
whether you heard, but both meetings went very well.  I mean, it was —
it was — they were collegial.  It — it wasn’t — no one was hollering. 
Everybody was — you know.  And people were hanging out afterwards in the
Oval, and — anyway — both the progressives, as well as the — the
moderates.   
   
And one of the things that I think is important for — and I’m trying to
get people to focus on is: What is it you like?  What do you think we
sh- — no, don’t — forget a number.  What do you think we should be
doing?  Is it appropriate, in your view, to cut taxes for working-class
people by providing for daycare, providing for early education, three
and four years old?  Is it appropriate to do something about free
community college or do you want a — means tested?  I’m telling them,
“What — what are your priorities?”  
   
And several of them, when they go through their priorities, it adds up
to a number higher than they said they were for. Because I think this is
— we’re getting down to the — you know, the hard spot here.  People are
having now to go in and look in detail as to what it is specifically
they’re for.   
   
It’s a little bit like when we went through — and I’ll end with this —
it’s a little bit like when we went through the issue of the bipartisan
deal on infrastructure.  There were a lot of negotiations on that.  And
it wasn’t until people were forced to look at: What are you for?  Are
you for taking care of that highway or bridge in your state or that
region — in your region?  Are you for doing something about
environmental degradation?  Are you for something that deals with
allowing us to provide for monies to states so that they can, in fact,
deal with things like what happened in states where the major utility
lines come down?  What do we — what do you do to build those back better
to pre- — prevent that from happening?  
   
And it’s sort of a — there’s a — and you all speak to all these folks,
so — you speak to as many as I do.  I find that they’re going, “Huh, I
never really thought that through before.  I think it makes sense.”  
   
And that’s how we finally got to a bipartisan deal on what is a serious
infrastructure proposal that really does a number of things, including —
including things where people said, “I don’t want to do anything in the
environment,” and then they start thinking, “Well, wait a minute.  I
have all these diesel buses at home.  It would be a hell lot better if
we had electric buses.  It wouldn’t change the circumstances on boom,
boom, boom.”  
   
So, I think this is a process.  That’s why I said at the front end that,
although we got off to a very fast start with the first piece of
legislation, I don’t expect this to be done and us being in a position
where we can look back and say, “Okay, did we get it done?” until
basically the end of the year.  
   
I don’t mean the vote on the two pieces of legislation related to the
economy.  But I think it’s just going to take some time.  
   
And look, you know, we’re — my guess is, we all come from similar
backgrounds. Remember you used to sit around the table — the kitchen
table in the morning, if you had the chance to do that, or dinner at
night with your mom and dad and your brothers or sisters.  What did
people talk about?  They talked about, you know, “Are we going to be
able to pay the mortgage?”  At least my house.  
   
I mean, “What’s going to happen if we have another one of those floods,
and then, you know, it blows through here like it did in Queens?  What’s
going to happen?  What are we going to do?”  
   
“And, by the way, I don’t — I don’t — you know — you know, I — I’m just
not sure that I want, you know, my son or daughter to — to be going into
school when so many people are not vaccinated.  I mean, you know, it’s
just — you know, I’m not sure I want Kenny to be there doing this…”   
   
But these are practical things people are talking about.  And they’re
looking down the road, and they’re looking at cost-of-living issues as
well.  And so what’s the cost-of-living issues?  
   
Well, it’s because we’re in a position where the ability to have the
product — the elements of the production of a product that, in fact,
need to go into the production of that product, are — are hard to get
hold on of because people are in trouble.  They’re not able to produce
them.  They’re not able to get it, or they’re being hoarded.  It’s like,
you know, what we have with — and we’re making progress, but like what
we’re doing with regard to making sure we have the computer chips to be
able to keep as — in the vernacular — to keep — you know, build
automobiles.   
   
I mean, I think, everybody was kind of surprised when I — I think if I
had said to you — I may be dead wrong, but if I had said to you in, say,
April that I was going to get all three major manufacturers of American
automobiles saying they’re going to go electric, I doubt whether you
thought I — that could be done.   
   
Well, we’re out here in the back lawn; they’ve all of a sudden figured
it out.  They’ve had a bit of an epiphany.  And they’ve realized, “Whoa,
wait a minute, man.  China is investing billions of dollars.  China is —
they’re getting battery technology.  We’re going to be — blah,
blah.  And this is going to happen anyway.”   
   
And, again, I’ll just conclude by saying: This is a process, and it’s
going to be up and down.  That’s why I don’t look at the polls —
(laughs) — not a joke — because it’s going to go up and it’s going to go
down.  It’s going to go up.   
   
And hopefully at the end of the day, I’ll be able to deliver on what I
said I would do: one, bringing the country together on a few and very
important things, like on infrastructure; getting us in a position where
we can have some — some coherent policy, relative for foreign policy,
where there is agreement; moving us in a position where we’re able to
actually generate the kind of change in the dynamic of how we grow the
economy — not eliminate the super wealthy, not at all, but allow the
working class and the middle class to be able to build out and up.  And
that can be done.  
   
And like I said, every time I hear — and I drive my staff crazy — every
time I hear, “This is going to cost A, B, C, or D,” the truth is, based
on the commitment that I made, it’s going to cost nothing because we’re
going to raise the revenue — raise the revenue to pay for the things
we’re talking about.   
   
And we’re going to give and — and right now, if you take a look at the —
the reconciliation piece, a trillion dollars of that is tax cuts, not
raising anybody’s taxes; it’s tax cuts.  People are going to be paying
less taxes.   
   
But the people who pay less taxes are going to be working-class folks. 
It’s going to put women back to work.  It’s going to put people in
situations where they have — as I know you’re tired of me saying, but
I’ll never — my dad’s constant refrain: Just give people a little
breathing room — a little breathing room.   
   
Thank you, guys.
