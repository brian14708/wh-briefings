title: Remarks by President Biden, Prime Minister Morrison of Australia, and Prime
  Minister Johnson of the United Kingdom Announcing the Creation of AUKUS

East Room

5:01 P.M. EDT

PRIME MINISTER MORRISON:  Well, good morning from Australia.  I’m very
pleased to join two great friends of freedom and of Australia: Prime
Minister Johnson and President Biden.

Today, we join our nations in a next-generation partnership built on a
strong foundation of proven trust.

We have always seen the world through a similar lens.  We have always
believed in a world that favors freedom; that respects human dignity,
the rule of law, the independence of sovereign states, and the peaceful
fellowship of nations.

And while we’ve always looked to each other to do what we believe is
right, we have never left at — each other.  Always together.  Never
alone.

Our world is becoming more complex, especially here in our region, the
Indo-Pacific.  This affects us all.  The future of the Indo-Pacific will
impact all our futures.

To meet these challenges, to help deliver the security and stability our
region needs, we must now take our partnership to a new level — a
partnership that seeks to engage, not to exclude; to contribute, not
take; and to enable and empower, not to control or coerce.

And so, friends, AUKUS is born — a new enhanced trilateral security
partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United
States.  AUKUS: a partnership where our technology, our scientists, our
industry, our defense forces are all working together to deliver a safer
and more secure region that ultimately benefits all.

AUKUS will also enhance our contribution to our growing network of
partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region: ANZUS; our ASEAN friends; our
bilateral strategic partners, the Quad; Five Eyes countries; and, of
course, our dear Pacific family.

The first major initiative of AUKUS will be to deliver a nuclear-powered
submarine fleet for Australia.  Over the next 18 months, we will work
together to seek to determine the best way forward to achieve this. 
This will include an intense examination of what we need to do to
exercise our nuclear stewardship responsibilities here in Australia.

We intend to build these submarines in Adelaide, Australia, in close
cooperation with the United Kingdom and the United States.

But let me be clear: Australia is not seeking to acquire nuclear weapons
or establish a civil nuclear capability.  And we will continue to meet
all our nuclear non-proliferation obligations.

Australia has a long history of defense cooperation with the United
States and the United Kingdom.  For more than a century, we have stood
together for the course of peace and freedom, motivated by the beliefs
we share, sustained by the bonds of friendship we have forged, enabled
by the sacrifice of those who have gone before us, and inspired by our
shared hope for those who will follow us.

And so, today, friends, we recommit ourselves to this cause and a new
AUKUS vision.

PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON:  I’m delighted to join President Biden and Prime
Minister Morrison to announce that the United Kingdom, Australia, and
the United States are creating a new trilateral defense partnership,
known as AUKUS, with the aim of working hand in glove to preserve
security and stability in the Indo-Pacific.  
   
We’re opening a new chapter in our friendship, and the first task of
this partnership will be to help Australia acquire a fleet of
nuclear-powered submarines, emphasizing, of course, that the submarines
in question will be powered by nuclear reactors, not armed with nuclear
weapons.  And our work will be fully in line with our non-proliferation
obligations.   
   
This will be one of the most complex and technically demanding projects
in the world, lasting for decades and requiring the most advanced
technology.  It will draw on the expertise that the UK has acquired over
generations, dating back to the launch of the Royal Navy’s first nuclear
submarine over 60 years ago; and together, with the other opportunities
from AUKUS, creating hundreds of highly skilled jobs across the United
Kingdom, including in Scotland, the north of England, and the Midlands,
taking forward this government’s driving purpose of leveling up across
the whole country.  
   
We will have a new opportunity to reinforce Britain’s place at the
leading edge of science and technology, strengthening our national
expertise.  And perhaps most significantly, the UK, Australia, and the
U.S. will be joined even more closely together, reflecting the measure
of trust between us, the depth of our friendship, and the enduring
strength of our shared values of freedom and democracy.  
   
Only a handful of countries possess nuclear-powered submarines, and it
is a momentous decision for any nation to acquire this formidable
capability and, perhaps, equally momentous, for any other state to come
to its aid.  But Australia is one of our oldest friends, a kindred
nation and a fellow democracy, and a natural partner in this
enterprise.  
   
Now, the UK will embark on this project alongside our allies, making the
world safer and generating jobs across our United Kingdom.  
   
Thank you.  Over to you, Mr. President.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you, Boris.  And I want to thank that fellow
down under.  Thank you very much, pal.  Appreciate it, Mr. Prime
Minister.  
   
I’m honored today to be joined by two of America’s closest allies —
Australia and the United Kingdom — to launch a new phase of the
trilateral security cooperation among our countries.  
   
As Prime Minister Morrison and Prime Minister Johnson said, I want to
thank you for this partnership, your vision  
as we embark together on this strategic mission.  
   
Although Australia, the UK, and U.S. partnership — AUKUS — it sounds
strange with all these acronyms, but it’s a good one, AUKUS — our
nations will update and enhance our shared ability to take on the
threats of the 21st century just as we did in the 20th century:
together.  
   
Our nations and our brave fighting forces have stood
shoulder-to-shoulder for literally more than 100 years: through the
trench fighting in World War I, the island hopping of World War II,
during the frigid winters in Korea, and the scorching heat of the
Persian Gulf.  The United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom have
long been faithful and capable partners, and we’re even closer today.  
   
Today, we’re taking another historic step to deepen and formalize
cooperation among all three of our nations because we all recognize the
imperative of ensuring peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific over the
long term.  
   
We need to be able to address both the current strategic environment in
the region and how it may evolve.  Because the future of each of our
nations — and indeed the world — depends on a free and open Indo-Pacific
enduring and flourishing in the decades ahead — ahead.  
   
This is about investing in our greatest source of strength — our
alliances — and updating them to better meet the threats of today and
tomorrow.  
   
It’s about connecting America’s existing allies and partners in new ways
and amplifying our ability to collaborate, recognizing that there is no
regional divide separating the interests of our Atlantic and Pacific
partners.  
   
Indeed, this effort reflects a broader trend of key European countries
playing an extremely important role in the Indo-Pacific.   
   
France, in particular, already has a substantial Indo-Pacific presence
and is a key partner and ally in strengthening  
the security and prosperity of the region.  
   
The United States looks forward to working closely with France and other
key countries as we go forward.   
   
And finally, this initiative is about making sure that each of us has a
modern capability — the most modern capabilities we need — to maneuver
and defend against rapidly evolving threats.    
   
AUKUS will bring together our sailors, our scientists, and our
industries to maintain and expand our edge in military capabilities and
critical technologies, such as cyber, artificial intelligence, quantum
technologies, and undersea domains.  
   
You know, as a key project under AUKUS, we are launching consultations
with Australia’s acquisition of conventionally armed, nuclear-powered
submarines for its navy — conventionally armed.  
   
I want to be exceedingly clear about this:  We’re not talking about
nuclear-armed submarines.  These are conventionally armed submarines
that are powered by nuclear reactors.  This technology is proven.  It’s
safe.  And the United States and the UK have been operating
nuclear-powered submarines for decades.  
   
I have asked Secretary Austin and the Department of Defense  
to lead this effort for the U.S. government in close collaboration with
the Department of Energy and Department of State.  
   
Our governments will now launch an 18-month consultation period to
determine every element of this program — from workforce, to training
requirements, to production timelines, to safeguards and
nonproliferation measures, and to nuclear stewardship and safety — to
ensure full compliance with each of our nation’s commitments under the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  
   
We’ll all undertake this effort in a way that reflects the longstanding
leadership in global nonproliferation and rigorous verification
standards, in partnership and consultation with the International Atomic
Energy Agency.  
   
So, I want to thank the Prime Minister — Prime Minister Morrison and
Prime Minister Johnson for their friendship, but mostly important for
their leadership and partnership as we undertake this new phase of our
security cooperation.  
   
And the United States will also continue to work with ASEAN and the
Quad, as was stated earlier; our five treaty allies and other close
partners in the Indo-Pacific; as well as allies and partners in Europe
and around the world to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific, and build
a future of peace, opportunity  
for all the people of the region.   
   
We’re joining together.  Partnerships are getting stronger.  This is
what we’re about.   
   
I want to thank you all.  And I look forward to seeing both of you in
person very soon, I hope.   
   
Thank you.  Thank you.
