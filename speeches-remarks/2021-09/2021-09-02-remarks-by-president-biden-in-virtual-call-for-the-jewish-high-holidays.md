2:03 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much.  I should start off with a
bit of an apology.  When I was Vice President, for eight years I had a
celebration at my home — my temporary home of the Vice President’s
Residence — and I had planned on doing that here at the White House but
for COVID.  So, next year, I hope.  Next year.  Not only next year in
Jerusalem, but next year at the White House, God willing.  
   
And let me say, Rabbi: Thank you for the introduction.  And I also want
you to thank the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the Rabbinical
Assembly, the Rabbinical Council, and the — Council of America — and the
Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association for co-sponsoring this call.  
   
Rabbi, I just want to thank all of you — each one of you — for
spearheading this effort.  
   
Look, it’s always great to see my friend, Michael Beals.  I spent an
awful lot of time — they began to worry — I spent more time at Beth
Shalom, but I always went to mass first.  I always went to mass first. 
You think I’m kidding; I’m not.   
   
But I want to thank you for the beautiful opening prayer and for your
friendship.   
   
As many of you know, as I said — when Jill and I used to host everyone
at our temporary residence — our public housing we had at the Naval
Observatory for the High Holidays, of course — we served apples and
honey and — as a sign of America’s capacity to change and progress.   
   
I’m proud the Naval Academy — the Naval Observatory, once head of the
Naval — the Chief Naval Operations — is now occupied by Vice President
Kamala Harris and the Second Gentleman, Doug Emhoff.  
   
Look, while the season of awe is a sacred time for Jews here in America
and around the world, the message of the holidays, I’ve always believed,
is universal.   
   
Renewal.  Renewal.  When I was running for President, I placed the idea
of renewal at the center of my campaign.  I said my mission was to
restore America’s soul.  I got criticized for that, but I meant it in a
literal sense.  We seem to have lost our way.  We lost the — a sense of
comradery.  We treated each other so harshly, the way we spoke of one
another and the way in which we dealt with politics.   
   
And I thought it was essential because, you know, America is an idea —
it’s an idea that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men
and women are created equal, et cetera.  No other country has been based
on that notion.  And when we stop respecting one another, that all
begins to change.   
   
You know, Rosh Hashanah and the Days of Awe present us with a chance to
restore our souls — our own souls, our individual souls.  And the High
Holy Days also allow us to take collective responsibility for renewal.  
   
I happen to be a practicing Catholic, and one of the things I like about
my pope today is that he’s all about renewal and forgiveness.  That’s
what — that’s what he’s about.  And I look forward to — I hope I’m going
to get to see him in the not-too-distant future.   
   
But, you know, I think that — I think the world is starting to realize
what’s been missing of late.  Not only do we have to look inward, we
also need to look at each other and talk to each other, rebuild
communities through empathy and acts of kindness and decency.  
   
You know, we need to look outward to bridge the gap between the world we
see and the future we seek.  And that chasm seems to be widening rather
than narrowing.  
   
And the work of our renewal is front of mind as we take pride in the
progress so far and acknowledge the immense challenges that remain.   
   
You know, when I took office — took the oath — we were on — in the
depths of a once-in-a-century pandemic.  And today, though we still face
a long road ahead, thanks to the miracles of science and medicine and
the dedication of so many, we’ve vaccinated tens of millions of
Americans, and hundreds of thousands of lives have been saved.  We’re
going to emerge from this pandemic, but we just have to — we have to
focus more.  
   
When my presidency began, we saw millions out of work and long lines at
food banks.  I mean, I never thought I’d see a time when people were
lined up for a better part of an hour or more in nice-looking
automobiles, just waiting for a box of food to be stuck in their
trunk.   
   
And now we’ve created millions of jobs.  We’re lifting millions of
children and families out of poverty, and building our economy back
better.  
   
But, you know, we’ll continue to confront other societal challenges as
well, like the scourge of anti-Semitism.  It remains all too present
today.  
   
You know, I had a chance to meet with the new Prime Minister of Israel. 
He’s — he’s a gentle man.  He’s — we talked about how his — he has much
more conservative views on matters in the Middle East than I do, but he
knows, as he pointed out — he said, “You’ve met every single prime
minister and you’ve known them since Golda Meir.”   
   
And I told him something Golda Meir said to me after a long — it was
after the Six-Day War.  And I was in her office, and she had an
assistant sitting next to me in the front of the desk — a guy named
Rabin.  And she was leaning back, and she had that — on the back of her
wall she had these maps that you can pull up and down, you know?  And
she kept pulling the maps down and showing me how many people have died
and what happened, and so on and so forth.   
   
And I would — by the time we got finished, she said all of a sudden, out
of the blue — she said, “Would you like a photograph?”  And I looked at
her and I said, “Well, sure, Madam Prime Minister.”   
   
And she knew I had been a bit of a student of Israel and I — I was
raised by a righteous Christian, a father who — who made sure that we —
we had — we had dinner where we incidentally ate and we talked.  And my
father — my father was the one who was — would rail against the fact
that — what — we didn’t bomb railroad tracks in World War Two and all —
I know Michael knows this.   
   
And what I’ve done since I became an elected official: On my 16th
birthday of each of my children, I put them on a plane and take them to
— to Europe.  And the first stop I’ve taken them to was to go into one
of the concentration camps, because I wanted them to see how this can
happen again.  I wanted them to see, as that — as, you know, Auschwitz
and other places.  We didn’t — that’s not where I took the first one.   
   
And the sign over the gate, you know — you know, “Your work will set you
free,” et cetera.  And visit where the chambers were — the gas
chambers.  And right next to it and along the fence line were these
beautiful homes that had tile roofs.  And everybody pretended they
didn’t know it was going on.   
   
You know, the — and so, my dad’s notion was always that, you know,
you’ve just — we’ve just got to keep remembering.  And I’ve taken every
one of my children and now my grandchildren.  I got two grandchildren
left to take.   
   
And the point I’m trying to make here is that I used to think coming out
of the Civil Rights Movement and being involved in the Jewish community
as a kid, and the Civil Rights Movement — in Delaware — I used to think
that hate could be defeated, it could be wiped out.  But I learned a
long time ago, it can’t.  It only hides.  It hides.  It hides under the
rocks.  And given any oxygen at all, it comes out.  It’s a minority
view, but it comes out and it comes out raging.   
   
And it’s been given too much oxygen in the last 4, 5, 7, 10 years, and
it has seen itself, whether it was — I remember spending time at the —
you know, going to the — you know, the Tree of Life Synagogue, speaking
with the — just — it just is amazing these things are happening —
happening in America.  
   
And I guess the point I want to make is that it just shows that if we
walk away from “never again,” it’s going to happen again.  It can’t
happen again.   
   
And so, I guess the point I’m making is that the attack in Pittsburgh,
those attacks — all anti-Semitic attacks — aren’t just a strike against
the Jewish community; they’re a strike against the soul of our nation
and the values which we say we stand for.  No matter its source or
stated rationale, we have to and will condemn this prejudice at every
turn, alongside other forms of hate.   
   
But, you know, it’s time that we deep — we be deep — deeply mindful of a
world beyond our borders, even as we did what was necessary and right to
end 20 years of war in Afghanistan.  And we mourn all those who we lost,
including 13 brave servicemembers who were killed alongside so many
other innocents in an act of terror and malice.   
   
And in spite of welcoming the stranger, we now embark on the next phase
of this mission, which is the cause that the Jewish community so often
led.  Whether it was Soviet Jews coming to America or Ethiopian Jews
headed to Israel, we have to integrate these newcomers and help them
begin to renew and rebuild their own lives.  
   
And this New Year, we’re going to have to remain steadfast in our
pursuit of peace.  We never waver in our support for the future security
of the State of Israel.  Because I told you, when I met Golda Meir after
she was going through that, flipping the maps up and down, she said,
“Would you like a photograph?”  
   
The part I didn’t tell you: We walked out and we stood in that hallway
many of you have been.  And we stood there, and there were camera people
and — while I was having our photographs taken.  And she — without
looking at me, she said, “Senator, you look so somber.  Don’t worry.” 
And I — without looking at her, I said, “I am very worried, based on
what you just told me.”  She said, “No, no.  We Jews have a secret
weapon in our fight with the…”  And I turned and looked at her.  
   
It’s a true story, and I’ve written about it.  And she said, “We have no
place else to go.”  “We have no place else to go.”  Well, the truth of
the matter is that’s probably true, but it’s so sad.  And we have to
make — we have to continue to fight like hell to make sure there’s — any
place can be gone.  
   
We’re going to maintain those deep bonds that started at the birth of
the Jewish State — a bond I’m honored — I had the honor of renewing with
Prime Minister Bennett at the White House last week.  
   
The challenges before us, I think, are monumental.  But if Jewish
history and tradition teaches us anything, it’s the resilient belief in
the promise of tomorrow.  
   
Even after the worst destruction and pain, the Jewish people have
recovered, rebuilt, emerged stronger than before, and we — so must we.  
   
And may God inscribe each of us in the Book of Life.  And I hope you all
have a happy and healthy and — and sweet New Year.  Shanah Tovah.  
   
But, you know, here’s — I want to say one more thing.  I just want you
to know that — and there — there is hope for some religious
collaboration down the road here.  As Rabbi Beals will tell you, my — my
daughter married a Jewish young man.  And — you know, dream of every —
every Catholic father that she marry a Jewish doctor.   
   
But all kidding aside, he did — he’s a great surgeon.  And — and we
wanted to have a co-confessional wedding, and everybody said, “What do
you mean by that?”  The rabbi will tell you, I contacted a friend of
mine in Delaware, who’s passed away — she was just an incredible woman —
to find me a rabbi who’d come and — and preside in a Catholic Church —
the oldest Catholic Church in the state, that I belonged to it, built in
1842.   
   
And we had a chuppah on the altar, and we had a co- — it was
co-officiated.  Now, some of you aren’t going to like this, but it was
co-officiated by a Catholic priest as well as a Jewish rabbi.   
   
And I only asked one thing.  They asked me — and I arranged it — and I
only asked one thing.  There’s a psalm based — there’s a hymn — my
favorite hymn in the Catholic Church based on a psalm, and it’s — it’s a
psalm that talks about life.  And — and so, I — I asked if that ps- —
that psalm — that hymn in the Catholic Church.   
   
And it says, “May He lift you up on Eagle’s wings and bear you on the
breath of dawn, and let the light shine upon you,” et cetera, and — “and
hold you in the palm of his hand.”  And they played — and I’m — my mind
is going blank now.  What’s the song that is played where everybody is
on the chair?  Everybody, you know — what — what — I can’t remember it. 
Anyway.   
And that’s the song that was played.   
   
So, you know, I don’t know what the hell is going on here.  I just had
one little favor — you know, just that they play “On the Wi- — On
Eagle’s Wings.”  
   
But, look, I’m taking too much of your time, but I really, honest to
God, believe that we have a possibility — a possibility to make things
so much better, and we just have to believe it.   
   
You know, I always am criticized by colleagues in the Senate because I’m
always quoting Irish poets.  They think I do it because I’m Irish.  I
don’t do it for that reason, Rabbi Person; I do it because they’re the
best poets in the world.  That’s why I do it.   
   
But there’s a — there’s a poem that — written by a famous Irish poet who
said that — he talked about — about the future.  And he said, “The world
has changed — changed utterly.  A terrible beauty has been born, but it
can be made beautiful.”  
   
There’s so much we can do.  People are looking over the edge, and
they’re all of a sudden realizing we got to change.  We’ve got to
change.   
   
And I — I’m not being solicitous, but I — I think the Jewish community
is sort of the backbone of staying with what’s right.  And so, I’m
looking forward to continue to work with you.  And again, happy
holidays.
