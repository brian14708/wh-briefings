2:30 P.M. PDT  
   
GOVERNOR NEWSOM:  All right, well, let me — Mr. President, let me
welcome you.  And I was joking with the President.  I said this — this
has been my office pretty much the last 18 months, with COVID and all
these wildfires.    
   
And, you know, I just wanted, once again, Mr. President — and this day,
I’m sure, will reinforce this part — just thank you, each and every one
of you, for your extraordinary contribution and service, and more
importantly, perhaps, your sacrifice.  Because it’s been a hard year and
a half.  And not only are you taking care of everybody else, but taking
care of yourself and your family, your friends.  The fear and anxiety so
many of you have had to face, yet here we are: the remarkable faces of
resilience.  
   
And so, I’m honored to be here with the President of the United States,
who has honored us with his presence, to talk about the challenges we
face this year.  Mr. President, 2.2 million acres, so far, burned this
year; 7,400 active, large fires that we’ve had to suppress.  We
currently are (inaudible) challenge of 15 large fires and, of course,
two (inaudible) fired: the Caldor fire, (inaudible) Lake Tahoe, and of
course, the Dixie fire, which is one of the largest — second-largest in
California’s history.  
   
Chief Porter is here.  Of course, the head of the U.S. Forest Service is
here, and all personnel representing the diversity of law enforcement
and first responders across the spectrum — federal, state, local.  An
unmatched group, I would argue, humbly, anywhere else in the country. 
But we’ve needed each and every one of them during this trying fire
season.  
   
And I’ll just end on this, Mr. President: This fire season just kept
going.  I’ll remind you we lost Paradise in 2018, the second week of
November.  In 2017, we had one of the largest wildfires in history, in
December.  
   
We are barely out of August in the first few weeks now of September.    
   
So we’re really humbled and gratified by your support and leadership,
and we welcome you here (inaudible).  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you all are the best.  That’s not hyperbole.  You
know, I used to always — as the governor probably heard from the United
States senators here, I always got kidded when I was a senator all those
years because I’d always quote Irish poets.  And they thought I did it
because I was Irish.  (Laughter.)  I did it because they’re the best
poets in the world.  (Laughter.)  
   
But there’s a famous line of a poem written by (inaudible).  He said,
“All’s changed, changed utterly.  A terrible beauty has been born.”   
   
By the way, you don’t have to stand for me.  Sit.      
   
And the truth is, all has changed.  It’s changed in a way that it’s
never going go back to what it was 10, 15 years ago.  It’s simply not
the case.   
   
When I became President, I committed I’d rejoin an outfit I helped put
together, and that was the Paris Accord.  And things have changed so
significantly; I mean that.  This is like preaching to the choir, as
they say where I’m from.  And you all understand it.  
   
The idea we’re going to go back to a circumstance where we’re going to
be able to be in a situation like it was in 1960, ’70, or ’80, it’s just
not going to be the case.  
   
But we can’t afford to let anything slip further.  We can’t allow that
to happen.  All the data — and some of you are genuine experts here —
all the data show that to get it to stay below 1.5 degrees centigrade,
we have to act more rapidly and more firmly and more broadly than
today.  It really is a matter of what the world is going to look like. 
Not a joke.  Not a joke.   
   
Gov, I doubt whether you or I would have ever believed that more people
died in New York City, in Queens, from flooding than in a hurricane in
Louisiana when I was down there with the Gov, with 178-mile-an-hour
winds.  Four people died.  They had flood stages that were up to 20 feet
— people dying in basements because they’d overflowed.  They had
tornados, so they head to the basement, and how many people got killed
because they couldn’t get out?  
   
And, folks, there’s so much we can do — we can do.  And I think even
some of my more conservative — I don’t want to be flippant — some of my
more less-believing friends in this notion of global warming are, all of
a sudden, having an “altar call,” as they say in the southern part of
Delaware.  They’re seeing the Lord because they better see it
quickly.   
   
We’ve got to change.  And we got to not just build back, we got to build
back better than before.  I noticed everyone around the world is using
that expression now, but it’s literal.  We’re the only country in the
world that has gone through crises throughout its career, through our
history, and we’ve come out stronger than when we went in.  We’ve got to
do that now.  
   
We have a chance to build back in a way that not only gets us back to
where we were yesterday, but gets us to a place where we are going to be
able to sustain that — sustain that position.  
   
For example, we got bipartisan support.  I know I get criticized for
trying to get bipartisan support, but we got it for the legislation I
wrote relating to the whole idea of infrastructure.  It’s real.  
   
And what I couldn’t get done in terms of climate there I was able to put
into a thing called the Recovery Act — the Build Back Better portion of
it.  Whether that passes or not, exactly how much I don’t know, but
we’re going get it passed.  And it has money in there for resilience.   
   
For example, it costs 2,500 bucks an acre for you guys to make sure that
you cleared forest floors.  Well, guess what?  Why can’t we have a
Civilian Climate Corps made up of thousands of kids — young people who
are looking for jobs, getting out and being trained to do it, to build —
to build back better?  
   
Everybody knows, if we have resilience — how many times, Gov, have you
had to shut down an electric transmission because of the wires coming
down from the forest?   
   
Well, we all know if we had extensive battery technology and storage,
it’d be a different world.  We all know that if we invested in being
able to run powerlines underground, it’d cost a hell of a lot more
money.  But if we made the investment — for every dollar we invest now,
we save six dollars.  That’s not hyperbole.  That is not hyperbole.   
   
We spent over $97 billion because of climate change, and we’re sitting
with our thumb in our ear, except here.  You’ve been fighting like
hell.  You’ve been moving in a way that few states have done.   
   
And, you know, the total loss, Gov — if I think of it in terms of back
East — the total loss to fires — of fires this past year are larger than
the state of — the entire state of New Jersey in terms of dis- — of
size.  The entire state.  You all may smile about that, but New Jersey
is a big state, man, and it’s critically important.  That’s how much has
been lost.  
   
And, by the way, the smoke from these fires ends up in New York, New
Hampshire.  It ends up — people not only worrying; you have to do it all
— thank God you’ve got a governor who understands there is a COVID
crisis, that everybody should be vaccinated.  Because guess what? 
Parents are not only worried now about whether their kids are going to
get COVID with the Delta variant, they’re worried about whether they can
breathe the air.   
   
So, there’s so much we can do.  I really mean it, from the bottom of my
heart.  There’s so much we can do.  It’s within our power to do it. 
Let’s not lose this advantage.   
   
I was just in the state — a neighboring state called Idaho.  Idaho, when
I got elected as a 29-year-old senator, was a Republican state.  I don’t
know what the hell happened.  (Laughter.)  I mean, excuse me — a
Democratic state; now it’s a Republican state.  Frank Church,
(inaudible), and others were the leading Democrats.  
   
But the governors (inaudible) was complimentary of your governor and
that we had to have mandates for vaccinations.  He’s getting the living
hell kicked out of him by his Republican colleagues, I think, but he’s —
but that’s what he’s doing.  So, there’s hope.  There’s hope.  
   
And, by the way, FEMA has done such an incredible job across the board —
across the board.  I was on the phone today with a guy who’s not real
crazy about me — the governor of Texas — offering him help for the
coming hurricane, letting him know, “Let me know immediately what you
need, when you need it.  Don’t wait.  Don’t wait.”  
   
So, folks, we have a chance.  We have a chance, because of the work
you’re doing, to make some significant change and literally — I know it
sounds like hyberbole — save a generation.  Not a joke.  Not a joke.   
   
If we don’t stay below 1.5 degrees centigrade, in terms of the Earth
warming, we’re in deep trouble, man.  And it’s not reversible.  It’s not
like you can go back and start over — like go back to “Go.”  You can’t
do it.  
   
So what you’re doing matters.  I think you all realize it, but if you
don’t realize it, you should.  It’s incredibly consequential.  
   
I just basically came to say thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you
for what you’re doing.  (Applause.)  
   
MR. GHILARDUCCI:  (Inaudible.)  
   
MS. EBERLIEN:  Mr. President, it’s so great to have you here.  And,
Governor, thank you.   
   
I’m showing you a map right now of the Caldor fire.  So, just to orient
you, this is where Grizzly Flats is at, right here.  Placerville is over
here.  And it goes all the way up here to South Lake Tahoe.  
   
GOVERNOR NEWSOM:  Yeah, just to situate us and so the President know,
give him a sense of where are we (inaudible).  
   
MS. EBERLIEN:  We are over there.   
   
GOVERNOR NEWSOM:  Not too many miles away.  
   
MS. EBERLIEN:  No.  No.  Not very far away.  
   
The ignition started right here out at Omo Ranch.  
   
Could you go the next slide, please?  
   
So, right down here is where it started.  You can see that first 12
hours or so, we had initial attack.  We were able to bring in crews.  We
had airtankers, we had helicopters that really worked on trying to
contain that as much as possible.  
   
But the exceptional drought that we’re in, the fuels that we have out
there — it caused it to go north.  And actually, it wasn’t super
wind-driven at the time.  This was fuels-driven.  So we have heavy fuels
on the landscape in this area.  
   
And you can see this is progression of the movement of the fire through
time.  So, right over here is the Grizzly Flats area; it got caught in
that first day or two.  
   
Up here is Sly Park.  And then, again, this is Highway 50, and you’ll
see we tried to contain it and keep it within that area.  It got up into
this area, moved over Christmas Valley, and then got into this — almost
into the South Lake Tahoe area at that time.  
   
And I want to say that, you know, the work of all of our — our team — we
have one team, one fire, one fight.  So, we’re a unified command with
CAL FIRE.  We have everybody from (inaudible) and all the local
jurisdictions sections helping us.   
   
We certainly have all of the work and effort of everybody suppressing
it.  But I also want to say: When you said “we can do more,” we can do
more.  And a lot of the fuels treatments that we did in this area of Sly
Park and this area right up here in South Lake Tahoe was enough that you
could reduce the flame level that we were able to work directly on the
fire and help save these communities and save these homes.  
   
This area, we did a lot of work that allowed people to evacuate, Mr.
President.  Yes, there’s absolute impacts, but it allowed people to
evacuate.  
   
So, being able to work with our partners — we have a shared stewardship
agreement with the state.  We have Good Neighbor Authority.  We are
primed and ready to be able to do more, just as you had said.  
   
GOVERNOR NEWSOM:  So, what you’re seeing is (inaudible) about 219,000
acres.  They are about — and Chief Porter will talk a little bit more —
I think you’re at over 67 percent contained.  
   
CHIEF PORTER:  Yes.  
   
GOVERNOR NEWSOM:  They said that this morning.  But, remarkably
(inaudible) and just reinforce: No fatalities.  Remarkable job of
evacuation.  And peak — I think we’re up, close to — what? — 53,000
people in the state have been evacuated in some form.  So it’s just an
extraordinary effort and, again, testament to this frame of partnership
that’s mutual — not just mutual aid, but the unified command structure,
which is just world-class.  
   
MS. EBERLIEN:  I’m going to turn it over to Chief Porter.  
   
CHIEF PORTER:  Thank you, Jen.  Mr. President, thank you for coming and
taking a look at this fire, but I want you to get the whole scale of
what’s going on as well.  
   
While this is 225,000 acres, roughly, it’s about 10 percent of what we
have burning or has burned in the state thus far, this year.  So, while
this fire started relatively small in this area and — what Jen said is,
the normal wind pattern is about night and day, night and day — we’re
going to seesaw.  We expected the fire to go this way or this way, not
this way.  It went completely 90 degrees out of any kind of plan or
normal path.  And that’s what’s happening.   
   
Everything is so dry because of drought, because of climate change.  And
the forests are just bone dry — bone dry.  So, what happened is, as this
all burned, all of this material went up in the atmosphere and it
started falling.  Unfortunately, it filled the air, and it carried the
fire into Grizzly Flats.  So, that’s what happened.   
   
These big waves happened, and then it burned very slowly for about a
week.  And then the winds came back, and it burned fast again.  And then
it slowed right in here.  And then, it burned — this is Kyburz — goes
right up in here.  This is Lake Tahoe.  So then, it burned from here,
all the way up through Twin Bridges, and jumped from the rim here over
one spot here, and then took out all of that above South Lake Tahoe.  
   
It’s not to be lost.  There’s this little jag here: fuel reduction. 
Fuels work.  It stopped the fire from taking out that part of that
community.  And then it was — made it — us able to direct the fire up
and around.  
   
Same thing, as Jen mentioned here, in the Sly Park area.  And there are
other areas throughout, including the Kirkwood area, that are part of
that.  
   
Can you go forward?  
   
So, for scale, Dixie fire now: Dixie fire — so, Caldor is about the size
of this piece of the Dixie fire.  This is all in addition to.  So, it’s
960,000 acres — almost a million-acre fire — today.  Again, fuels work. 
We saved this community of Chester.  And the economic base, the housing
base on all sides of the lake saved.  Westwood saved.  Susanville
saved.  All good fuels work around all of those communities.  We had
Greenville happen.  Greenville was in a really tough spot and had really
bad fire behavior that drew fire through it.   
   
But these two fires are the first two fires that we have in recorded
history that burned from the starting point on the west side of the
mountains — the mountain range is about center here — all the way to the
east side to the desert, basically — the High Desert.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s where I was looking.  (Inaudible) mountains.  
   
CHIEF PORTER:  Yeah.  So, if you could go back, I just want to jump back
real quick here.  
   
So, Lake Tahoe — this breakpoint right here, all the water on this side
of these lakes drains to the Sacramento Valley.  Everything there drains
down into Reno.  And that’s the first time we’ve had fire do this as
well.   
   
So, these are the first two fires that have done that.  In 11 months,
including the time when this fire started and the Dixie was still
burning, six of the seven largest fires in our history burned within an
11-month period.  It’s incredible what climate change is doing to us.  
   
So, with that, I think I’ll pass the attention to Don Ashton, the Chief
Administrative Officer for El Dorado County, where this fire took
place.  
   
MR. ASHTON:  Thank you, Mr. President, for coming.  Thank you,
Governor.  
   
Just a little bit about some of the damages we’ve been faced, what El
Dorado County has faced and the Grizzly Flats area.  We lost — the whole
community is essentially lost — we lost a school, we lost a fire
station, we lost a post office.  We lost about 440 homes in that area. 
About 25 percent of those people don’t have homeowner’s insurance.   
   
So what are we going to do?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  We’re going to take care of them.  
   
MR. ASHTON:  Thank you.  Thank you.  And if you head up the Highway 50
Corridor, we lost another 220 homes (inaudible).   
   
And then, one thing I want to reference — and Chief Porter hit on this
jag here — I want to talk about this little gap right here, where it
hopped over.  That’s the heroic efforts of our firefighters, from Cal
Fire, all the partner agencies throughout the nation, quite frankly. 
Those are all homes in that area.  They saved (inaudible).  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  So this is the mountain ridge here?  
   
MR. ASHTON:  The mountain ridge is probably right here.  
   
PARTICIPANT:  That’s a valley.  
   
MR. ASHTON:  This is the valley.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s the valley.  Okay.   
   
MR. ASHTON:  Right on the bottom of that mountain range.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I gotcha.  I gotcha.  Okay.  
   
MR. ASHTON:  Hundreds of homes right there in Christmas Valley that were
all saved.  We didn’t lose one structure in that area due to the efforts
of our firefighters and the heroes they are.  And then that’s a
testament of field management that allowed it to be controlled.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you know that old expression: God made man, and
then he made a few firefighters.  (Laughter.)  There’s truth to it.  Not
a joke.  And we don’t pay firefighters.  And the federal firefighters
are going to get a significant raise.  I was able to, by executive order
on the federal side, raise the salary to a minimum of $15 an hour, which
is way below, and the benefits.  
   
But, folks, too many of you — too many of the firefighters are working. 
They’re trying to figure out how to save their homes, number one; and
number two, how to, even if they’re not in harm’s way, be able to pay
for their mortgages.  They will pay for what they’re doing.  We owe
them.  We owe them a whole hell of a lot more.  Now, I’m not just saying
this.  I’ve been involved with the fire service for the last 40 years. 
And I’m telling you, it’s about time we heed a wake-up call.  
   
I can’t dictate — I won’t attempt to dictate what states can do or don’t
do.  But the federal firefighters are going to get rewarded.  And in
return, hopefully that puts pressure on making sure firefighters across
the board get this.   
   
I mean, Gov, I grew up in a neighborhood — a little steel town called
Claymont, Delaware, where you became — and I went to a little Catholic
school across from the fire hall.  You became one of three things: a
cop, a firefighter, or a priest.  (Laughter.)  I wouldn’t have qualified
for any one of them.   
   
But all kidding aside, it’s — these are the folks who — I mean, and —
and these smokejumpers.  I mean, thank God we have some crazy people
working with us.  (Laughter.)  No, I’m serious.  Think about it.  Have
you ever — I’ve been to some of these fires because I got involved with
our fire companies.  Have you ever, ever been to a fire where there’s a
house fire, where there’s a — where these guys jumping into —  
   
I got a phone call one day, Gov.  I was down doing “Meet the Press” on a
Sunday.  I commuted every day when I was a senator from Delaware to
Washington and back — 260 miles a day.  And I was rarely down there on a
Sunday, but I was doing “Meet the Press.”  I got a phone call: Lightning
strike hit — I live on a little pond — a 10-acre pond that borders my
property.  Hit a conduit in the side of the hill.  It went up underneath
and set on fire the internal part of my house, so the air conditioning
just was billowing out smoke.  
   
When the fire company came, the smoke was so thick — not a joke.  And
the firefighters — I mean, you could not see in the house, from the
basement floor all the way to the third floor.  Not a single thing.  And
my fire service went and they saved my wife, and, as she says, saved the
cat — (laughter) — and my ‘67 Corvette (inaudible).  (Laughter.)  
   
But all kidding aside, what these people do — what you all do is
incredible.  And, hopefully, when all of this has moved in the right
direction, we begin to reward — you know, it’s not any insult to law
enforcement, but more firefighters are injured or die, as a percent,
than police officers do.  Police officers (inaudible) wouldn’t take your
job in a heartbeat.  
   
But here’s the deal: We got to start to let people know — know what you
do for us so we can get the kind of support we need to make sure we
continue to have this capacity.  Because we’re going to wear people
out.  We’re going to wear it out because it’s not going to be over for a
while.  
   
I just want to say thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you to the
firefighters and law enforcement (inaudible).  (Applause.)  
   
MR. GHILARDUCCI:  (Inaudible) wrap up this briefing by just saying that
this whole context of climate change is really having an impact to a
state like California.  Since 2015, we’ve had back-to-back-to-back
(inaudible) wildfires.  We’re talking about wildfires like this that
have taken out whole communities.  
   
In 2017 to 2020 alone, we’ve lost 50,000 homes by wildfire in this
state.  That’s in the state that’s got less than 2 percent vacancy
rate.  (Inaudible) rural communities as a whole.  These are people who
live in these communities.  It’s an equity issue.  They don’t have the
services.  We lost the town of Paradise in 2018.  Now, in this fire, we
lost two towns: the town of Grizzly Flats and the town of Greenville. 
These are towns that you lost the store, you lost the hospital, you lost
the fire station —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Everything.  
   
MR. GHILARDUCCI:  — the school.  The whole nine yards.   
   
And this is why the whole issue on pre-disaster mitigation and the
efforts that the governor has raised here and has us working on — I know
that you’re interested in supporting through grants and others kinds of
things, but also that the disaster assistance be — the disaster
assistance you provided for the Dixie fire and the River fire, Mr.
President, was fantastic.  And now the Caldor fire.  And to work through
the individual assistance to help those people who are uninsured or
underinsured.  
   
The people who live in these small, rural communities are typically
seniors.  They’re underserved as a whole.  And so we can’t let that,
sort of, hang out there.  
   
So we appreciate all the world that you’ve done with that.  And we’re
going to continue to work on all the hazard mitigation efforts that do
the fuel treatment and really harden our communities as much as we
possibly can.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, Gov, there’s a lot that we can do, and it starts
off being a federal responsibility, in my view.  But there’s an awful
lot that has to be done, and it can be done.  
   
And you’re going to hear people say, “Biden is proposing all these big
projects, and the Build Back Better is going to cost all that money.” 
You know, let’s assume they do pass my $3.5 trillion proposal to Build
Back Better, which is $300 billion for fire mitigation, a whole range of
things.  Okay?  That’s over 10 years — over 10 years.  And it’s expected
that the economy will grow — the GDP, the economy, over the next 10
years, will be $299 trillion.  It’s going to be less than one fifth —
well, excuse me — five tenths of 1 percent of the entire GDP.  And we
pay for it.  
   
So, all this malarkey — you know, we know we have no problem coming up
with $2 trillion in tax cuts for people who don’t need it.  But — I’m
serious.  
   
So, we don’t — we can’t afford not to do it, but we can afford to do
it.  
   
And the last thing I want to leave you with: These are jobs.  Good
jobs.  When you think climate change, think of jobs.  These are
good-paying jobs that aren’t going to be $7 an hour or $9 an hour, or
$10, or even $15.  They’re going to be jobs that are going to provide
prevailing wage, because so much has to be built in terms of bridges and
homes.  I mean, there’s a lot we can do.   
   
So, please, don’t lose faith.  Don’t lose faith.  Again, keep it up. 
Thank you.
