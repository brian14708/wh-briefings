title: Remarks by President Biden on the Economy
---
 
East Room

2:00 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  I want to start by thanking the House
committees for working hard this week to advance critical components of
the economic plan that I’ve put before the Congress.  
   
I know we still have a long way to go, but I’m confident that Congress
will deliver to my desk both the bipartisan physical infrastructure plan
and the Build Back Better plan that I have proposed.  
   
And I’ve said many times before: I believe we’re at an inflection point
in this country — one of those moments where the decisions we’re about
to make can change — literally change the trajectory of our nation for
years and possibly decades to come.   
   
Each inflection point in this nation’s history represents a fundamental
choice.  I believe that America, at this moment, is facing such a
choice.  And the choice is this: Are we going to continue with an
economy where the overwhelming share of the benefits go to big
corporations and the very wealthy?  Or are we going to take this moment
right now to set this country on a new path — one that invests in this
nation; creates real, sustained economic growth; and that benefits
everyone, including working people and middle-class folks?  
   
That’s something we haven’t realized in this country for decades.  
   
The data — (clears throat) — excuse me.  The data is absolutely clear. 
Over the past 40 years, the wealthy have gotten wealthier, and too many
corporations have lost their sense of responsibility to their workers,
their communities, and the country.  
   
Just look at the facts.  CEOs used to make about 20 times the average
worker in the company that they ran.  Today, they make more than 350
times what the average worker in their corporation makes.  
   
Since the pandemic began, billionaires have seen their wealth go up by
$1.8 trillion.  That is, everyone who was a billionaire before the
pandemic began, the total accumulated wealth beyond the billions they
already had has gone up by $1.8 trillion.  Simply not fair.  
   
And it’s — how is it possible that 55 of the largest corporations in
this country paid zero dollars in federal income taxes?  They made over
$40 billion in the year 2020, and they’ve paid zero.  Think about that. 
Zero dollars in federal taxes on $40 billion in profits.  
   
How is it possible that the wealthiest billionaires  
in the country can entirely escape paying income tax on what they’ve
made?  
   
How is it possible for millionaires and billionaires that can pay a
lower rate of tax than teachers, firefighters, or law enforcement
officers?  
   
Here’s the simple truth.  For a long time, this economy has worked great
for those at the very top, while ordinary, hardworking Americans — the
people who built this country — have been basically cut out of the
deal.  
   
And I’ve said this from the time I announced I was going to run: I
believe this is a moment of potentially great change.  This is our
moment to deal working people back into the economy.  This is our moment
to prove to the American people that their government works for them,
not just for the big corporations and those at the very top.  
   
When I was sworn in as President, the nation was struggling to pull out
of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.  Job growth was
anemic, with just over 60,000 new jobs per month in the three months
before I was sworn in.  
   
Then we went to work and passed the American Rescue Plan back in March. 
And it worked.  It’s still working.  
   
Over the last three months, we’ve been creating, on average, 750,000 new
jobs per month.  Our economy is growing at the fastest rate we’ve seen
in nearly 40 years.  
   
Our recovery is unique in the world.  We’re the only developed country
in the world whose economy is now bigger than it was before the
pandemic.  
   
While this is all good news, I know many Americans are still struggling
to make it through each and every day.  
   
For too many, it’s harder and harder to pay the bills — food, gas, rent,
healthcare.  I get it.  We still have a long way to go to get the
economy where it needs to be.  
   
As I’ve said for a long time: Coming out of this economic crisis as deep
as the one we were in was never going to be easy.  But we’re doing it,
and we can continue to do it.  
   
COVID, supply chain issues, and bad actors seeking to profit off the
pandemic are all contributing to the challenges we’re facing.  
   
That’s why I’ve made getting COVID under control my top priority from my
first day as President.  Everything — everything, from our public health
to our economy, depends on this.  
   
We made enormous progress against the virus through the summer, and now
we’ve put ourselves in a strong position to battle this Delta variant. 
That’s why the actions I proposed on vaccines last week are so critical:
from requiring federal workers to get vaccinated; requiring healthcare
workers to be vaccinated; requiring employers with over 100 employees to
institute vaccine and/or test protocols, calling on — for them to be
able to know what their employers — their employees are doing before
they walk through the door; calling for vaccine or test requirements to
enter big venues; and a whole series of steps I proposed to protect our
kids in schools.  
   
Wall Street firms have analyzed the impact of these plans, and they’re
projecting that these new requirements will help 12 million more
Americans get vaccinated, which will help more businesses stay open and
more Americans back to work.  
   
The data shows that the overwhelming majority of Americans agree with my
proposal.  That’s — there’s no surprise, given that 76 percent of
American adults have already gotten at least one shot.  
   
But — but we’re facing a lot of pushback, especially from some of the
Republican governors.  The governors of Florida and Texas — they’re
doing everything they can to undermine the lifesaving requirements that
I’ve proposed.  
   
And some of the same governors attacking me are in states with some the
strictest vaccine mandates for children attending school in the entire
country.  
   
For example, in Mississippi, children are required to be vaccinated
against measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, hepatitis B, polio,
tetanus, and more.  These are state requirements.   
   
But in the midst of a pandemic that has already taken over 660,000
lives, I propose a requirement for COVID vaccines, and the governor of
that state calls it, quote, a “tyrannical-type move”?  A
“tyrannical-type move”?   
   
This is the worst kind of politics because it’s putting the lives of
citizens of their states, especially children, at risk.  And I refuse to
give in to it.   
   
These policies are what the science tells us we need to do.  They’re
going to save lives.  And they’ll protect our economic recovery as well,
and allow the economy to continue to grow.  
   
We’re also going after the bad actors and pandemic profiteers in our
economy.  There’s a lot of evidence that gas prices should be going
down, but they haven’t.  We’ll be taking a close look at that.  
   
Taxpayers in this country also have paid for extraordinary effort to
keep our country going over the past year or so.   
   
Unlike the last administration, which resisted oversight and allowed
taxpayers to be victimized by fraud, we’re working hard to protect
vulnerable Americans from having their identities stolen — as a
consequence of their unemployment check stolen as well.  
   
And we’re going offer organized criminal — we’re going to go after
organized criminals that defraud America or misuse COVID funds.  
   
Look, we’re also taking a closer look at places in our economy where
fewer and fewer corporate giants are controlling more and more of the
marketplace in the area that they work.  
   
Just look at agriculture and the food industry.  A very small number of
giant corporations now dominate the market, which gives them the ability
to drive up prices because they face so little competition.  
   
As we work to build healthier competition in our economy and crack down
on bad actors, the American Rescue Plan, which we passed in March, is
still working to give hardworking Americans — hardworking people some
relief.  
   
One of the best examples of that relief is the expansion of the Child
Tax Credit, which, in effect, is essentially a historic tax cut for
families with children.  
   
Just yesterday, 39 million working moms and dads got their direct
payment.  That money is going to help cover groceries, the mortgage, new
pairs of shoes — all the things that kids need.  It’s a tax cut for
working families.  
   
So, we’re working to provide as much relief as we can right now to
American families.  But here’s the truth: Yes, the pandemic has caused a
lot of economic problems in the country, but the fact is our economy
faced challenges long before this pandemic struck.  Working people were
struggling to make it long before the pandemic arrived.  
   
Big corporations and the very wealthy were doing very well before the
pandemic.  That’s why I’ve said — starting back in my campaign for
president — that it’s not enough just to build back; we have to build
back better than before.  And that’s how it all begins.   
   
Big corporations and the super wealthy have to start paying their fair
share of taxes.  It’s long overdue.   
   
I’m not out to punish anyone.  I’m a capitalist.  If you can make a
million or a billion dollars, that’s great.  God bless you.  All I’m
asking is you pay your fair share.  Pay your fair share just like
middle-class folks do.  But that isn’t happening now.  
   
Today, in this country, right now, the top 1 percent, for example, evade
an estimated $160 billion in taxes that they owe each year.  Not new
taxes, taxes that they owe.   
   
And the way it works is this: If you’re a typical American — like I
suspect most of the press people sitting in front of me here — you pay
your taxes.  Why?  Because you get a W-2 form.  It comes in the mail
every year.  
   
The IRS gets that information as well.  Your taxes get deducted from
your paycheck, and you pay what is owed beyond that.  That’s why about
99 percent of working people pay the taxes they owe.  
   
But that’s not how it works for people with tens of millions of
dollars.  They play by a different set of rules.  And they’re often not
employees themselves, so the IRS can’t see what they make and can’t tell
if they’re cheating.  
   
That’s how many of the top 1 percent get away with paying virtually
nothing.  It’s estimated by serious economists that that number is about
$160 billion collectively owed each year that doesn’t get paid.  It’s
not an even playing field.  My plan would help solve that.  For example,
it would give the IRS the resources it needs to keep up with the lawyers
and accountants in the super — of the super-wealthy.  
   
It would ask just for two pieces of information from the banks of these
folks: that amounts — the amounts that come into their bank accounts and
what amounts go out of their bank accounts, so that the wealthy can no
longer hide what they’re making and they can finally begin to pay their
fair share of what they owe.  
   
That isn’t about raising their taxes.  It’s about the super-wealthy
finally beginning to pay what they owe — what the existing tax code
calls for — just like hardworking Americans do all over this country
every Tax Day.  
   
Look — and like I said just a few minutes ago, 55 of the most profitable
corporations in America paid zero in federal income taxes on what
amounted to $40 billion in profit.  Not a penny.  That’s not right.  And
my economic plan will change that.  Not punish anybody, just make them
pay their fair share.  
   
But my Republican friends in Congress don’t want to change the law.  So,
what are they doing?  They’re attacking me and my plan — which is fine. 
But if we’re going to have a debate, let’s have an honest debate.   
   
My Republican friends are attacking my plan, saying it’s “big
spending.”  Let me remind you, these are the same folks who just four
years ago passed the Trump tax cut totaling almost $2 trillion in tax
cuts –- a giant giveaway to the largest corporations and the top 1
percent.  And listen to this: Almost none of that $2 trillion tax cut
was paid for.  It just ballooned the federal deficit.  
   
In fact, the unpa- — unpaid bills ranked up — racked up by the last
administration are projected to increase the national debt by more than
$8 trillion over time.  
   
What I’m proposing is totally different from that approach for three
reasons:   
   
First, my plan is paid for.  It’s fiscally responsible, because our
investments are paid for that by making sure that corporations and the
wealthy Americans pay their fair share.  
   
Second, we’re not going to raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000. 
That’s a lot of money.  Some of my liberal friends are saying it should
be lower than that.  But only corporations and people making over
$400,000 a year are going to pay any additional tax.  
   
And third, not only will no one making under $400,000 see their taxes go
up, the middle class are going to going to get some tax cuts — some
breaks.  
   
My plan benefits ordinary Americans, not those at the top who don’t need
the help.  It’s a historic middle-class tax cut, cutting taxes for over
50 million families.  
   
My Republican friends are making a different choice though.  They’d
rather protect the tax breaks of those at the very top than give tax
breaks to working families.  It’s that simple.  
   
But let me ask you this: Where is it written that all the tax breaks in
the American tax code go to corporations and the very top?  I think it’s
enough.  I’m tired of it.  
   
For me, it’s pretty simple: It’s about time working people got the tax
breaks in this country.  That’s what my plan does.  
   
But here’s what it also does: By asking big corporations and the very
wealthy to pay their fair share, it makes it possible to invest in
America, to invest in the American people.  
   
According to leading economists — forecasters like Moody’s and major
international financial institutions — my plan will create — make us —
create jobs, make us more competitive, and grow our economy and lessen —
lessen, not increase — inflationary pressure.  
   
I don’t know if it’s been handed out today, but, by the way, 15 Nobel
laureates in economics released a letter yesterday arguing that exame
\[sic\] — that exact same point.  
   
They said, and I quote — and this is from 15 Nobel laureates in
economics — quote, “Because this agenda…” — the one I’m talking about,
mine — “Because this agenda invests in long-term economic capacity and
will enhance the ability of more Americans to participate productively
in the economy, it will ease long-term inflationary pressures.”  It will
ease it.  
   
Let me highlight just a few provisions of my plan.  I know this is long,
and I apologize, but it’s important, I think.   
   
My plan lowers the cost of daycare and childcare and eldercare for
families and \[has\] the added benefit of allowing millions of people,
mostly women — who are not able to go back to work because of very young
family members or elderly people they’re taking care of — allow them to
go back to work.  It’s estimated in the millions that can’t go back.  
   
It lowers healthcare premiums for millions of families.  It lowers
prescription drug costs by giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower
drug prices.  And it strengthens Medicare by adding dental, vision, and
hearing coverage for — if you’re on Medicare.  
   
It also extends the tax cut for families with kids that we passed in the
American Rescue Plan in March.  
   
All of this will mean thousands of dollars in savings for the average
American family on some of the toughest and most important bills they
have to pay every month.  
   
My Republican friends talk a lot about inflation, but if you want to
talk about actually lowering the cost of living for people in this
country, my plan does just that.  
   
By strengthening the capacity of our economy, it will also reduce
inflationary pressures over the long run.  
   
Here’s something else my plan does: It confronts the crisis of extreme
weather events that we’re seeing all around us and around the world —
but just here in America.  We see it everywhere.  We know it’s real.  
   
In just the past few weeks — and there’s more to come — I’ve seen the
destruction of hurricanes in Louisiana, where winds got up to a hundred-
— gusts of 179 miles an hour; the deadly toll from flooding in New York,
where 20 inches of rain, and New Jersey, more than 11 inches of rain in
some areas.  
   
More than 5 million acres of our lands and communities have burned to
the ground in wildfires just this year alone.  That’s more than the size
of the entire state of New Jersey burned to the ground.  When I was out
in California, I flew over some of these areas.   
   
In addition, there’s a severe drought in the West and the Midwest.  
   
There’s a blinking code red out there for the nation.  We can’t wait to
act.  
   
Extreme weather, just last year, cost the American public $99 billion in
damage — $99 billion in damage last year.  And unfortunately, we’re
likely to break that record this year.  
   
And the evidence is overwhelming that every dollar we invest in
resilience saves six dollars down the road — when the next fire doesn’t
spread as widely or the power station holds up against the storm.   
   
We need to rebuild with resilience — with resilience in mind — so roads
are built higher; levees are built more — made more strong — stronger;
transmission lines are better protected, and so much more.  
   
You know, I hope we’re past debating climate change in this country. 
Now we have to act, and we have to act fast.  And my plan does that.  
   
Let me end with this.  This pandemic has been God-awful  
for so many reasons: the lost lives — as I said, over 660,000; the jobs,
the businesses lost; the lost time in school for our kids.  
   
But it does present us with an opportunity: We can build an economy that
gives working people a fair shot this time.  We can restore some sanity
and fairness to our tax code.  We can make the investments that we know
are long overdue in this nation.  
   
That’s exactly what my bipartisan infrastructure plan does — I should
say, our bipartisan infrastructure plan does: investments in roads,
bridges, highways; clean water in every home and every school; universal
broadband; quality and affordable places for families to live.  
   
And we can invest in our people — giving our families a little help with
their toughest expenses, like daycare, childcare, eldercare,
prescription drugs, healthcare, preparing our young people to compete
against any country in the world with preschool and community college.  
   
We can confront this crisis of extreme weather and climate change, and
not only protect our communities but create new opportunities, new
industries, and new jobs.  
   
In short, this is an opportunity to be the nation we know we can be — a
nation where all of us — all of us, not just those at the top — are
getting a share of the benefits of a growing economy in the years
ahead.  
   
Let’s not squander this moment trying to preserve an economy that hasn’t
worked too well for Americans for a long time.   
   
Let’s not look backward, just trying to rebuild what we had.  Let’s look
forward, together, as one America — not to build back, but to build back
better.  
   
Thank you all very much.  And God bless you all.  May God protect our
troops.  Thank you.
