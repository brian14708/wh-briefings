THE PRESIDENT:  (In progress.)  I tell you what, man — by the way, they
tell me the ones that are going to be offshore are going to be 100
meters long.   
   
SECRETARY GRANHOLM:  Twice as big.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Twice as long as — as big as this, per blade.  
   
Q    What have you learned on this trip, sir?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I learned on this trip that we made a great investment
in this laboratory.  I was out here in 2011.  It’s expanded
considerably, and we’ve brought down — just in the time that I was
running the Recovery Act, we brought down the cost of energy generated
by wind and solar cheaper than the cost of a new coal plant.  
   
These guys are changing the world, man.  No, they really — not a joke.  
   
Q    Mr. President, would you sign a reconciliation package with
slimmed-down climate measures?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m for more climate measures.
