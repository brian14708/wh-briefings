THE PRESIDENT: I thought we had a — a good trip to New Jersey and New
York. Those people need help. I’m confident we can get it to them and
I’m confident we can help change their circumstance. But — so, I thought
it was a good trip. I got a chance to talk to a lot of people. I hope
you got a chance to talk to some of them as well. But it — I think it
went well.

Q Mr. President, on COVID, you’re going to speak this week about the
next steps to combat the pandemic. What will you suggest? What will you
lay out?

And is it possible —

THE PRESIDENT: I’ll tell you tomorrow.

Q Is it possible to defeat the pandemic, or just control it at this
point?

THE PRESIDENT: I’ll talk about it tomorrow —

Q Are you worried, Mr. —

THE PRESIDENT: — on Thursday.

Q Mr. President, are you worried that the Taliban will get funding from
China?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, China has a real problem with the Taliban, so
they’re going to try to work out some arrangement with the Taliban, I’m
sure — as does Pakistan, as does Russia, as does Iran. They’re all
trying to figure out, what do they do now. So it will be interesting to
see what happens.

Q Mr. President, have you talked to Senator Manchin? And what do you
think this — how deep is his resistance, do you think, to the
reconciliation bill?

THE PRESIDENT: Joe — Joe, at the end, has always been there. He’s always
been with me. I think we can work something out. And I look forward to
speaking with him.

Q Are you comfortable with the timing of the bill? Do you think — seeing
what you’ve seen in New Jersey, today, and New York, should the first
bill be passed now to get that (inaudible)?

THE PRESIDENT: I — I’m comfortable with proceeding the way we’re
proceeding so far.

Thank you.
