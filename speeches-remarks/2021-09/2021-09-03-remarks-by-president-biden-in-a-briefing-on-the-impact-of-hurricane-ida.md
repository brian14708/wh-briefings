St. John Parish’s Emergency Operations Center  
LaPlace, Louisiana

1:50 P.M. CDT  
   
MR. RICHMOND:  Let me — let me thank everybody for coming here.  I’m
sure he doesn’t need any introduction, but I just want to say it’s good
to be back, but, more importantly, the President wanted to get here as
soon as, one, it wasn’t a distraction and draining resources.  So we’re
glad that the governor assured us of that and invited us down.  
   
But the President has been chomping at the bit to really make sure that
recovery is going well and to make sure that he can see hands on.  
   
But you don’t need to hear from me.  With that, I’ll turn it over to the
President.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, look, folks, you know, this storm has been
incredible, not only here but all the way up the East Coast.  I’ve been
spending time with — in talking with the governor a lot, but, in the
meantime, also with governors of my state of Delaware and Pennsylvania,
New Jersey, and New York, where there are more deaths than you have
here.  I hope that doesn’t change in terms of the number of lost
lives.  
   
And I have a daughter who went to Tulane.  And she runs a Boys and Girls
Club operation, and she called me and said, “Dad, when are you going —
why are spending a time talking to the governor of New York?  Why are
you not in Louisiana?”  (Laughter.)  So, you all got to write a note for
me that I’m down, all right?  
   
Look, you know, Cedric and — and the FEMA Administrator, we came because
want to hear directly from you all what is — what specific problems
you’re dealing with.  
   
We’ve been working with you on key areas to deliver more than 6.7
million meals and 6.1 million liters of water.  But sometimes what we
deliver and what is needed aren’t all the same thing.  And we’re
frustrated, I know — you got to be frustrated about the restoration of
power.  And I understand two gentlemen who run those two operations are
working like hell.  I think you got — you got about 25,000 linemen from
around the country here.  A couple have already given their life trying
to get things going.  
   
And — and so we’re working 24/7 with the energy companies — I think they
had to acknowledge that — to get the system up and moving.  And we also
deployed even more federal resources, including hundreds of generators
to restore power and — faster than we were able to do in Katrina.  
   
You know, it’s dangerous work, as I said, and I want to thank those
25,000 linemen from 32 different states.  I’ve always been — responded
in big time.

We’re also working with the phone companies so you can — you know, I
think the worst thing in the world, having been there in a different
circumstance, wanting to — you know, knowing things are terrible
outside, when you’re standing and wondering how your son, daughter,
mother, father, uncle, aunt, and how they’re doing and not being able to
get connected to them.

And so we’re moving as — as fast as we can to be able to provide access,
regardless who your provider was.  If your provider’s system went down,
you’ll be able to use any provider that’s on there; you just got to get
online.  So I hope that’s picking up around the state as well.  I’d like
to hear more about that.

But — and we’re moving as fast as we can to keep gas flowing in the
pumps.  I’ve authorized going into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  And
— but I know still, you know, there’s work to do in this area.  And
we’ve instructed my team to have all hands on deck to make sure that
that happens — that we have the, you know — and they’re going to make
this up — instead of us going to Exxon, kind of get back out there.  And
we’re going to be able to work that through.

And, to date, we’ve also provided $100 million in direct assistance
directly to folks in Louisiana, with that 500 bucks going into their
bank accounts so that they can deal immediately with emergencies.   
   
I’d love to hear from you if you’ve heard anything — feedback from your
constituents — about that at all.  Because sometimes it’s just that —
what you need that moment, and it can make a difference.   
   
And we also know there’s a heck of a lot more work to do and — and
that’s why we’re here today.  And my message today is — I think what
we’re all seeing, and I’m getting the same response from my Republican
friends — Republican friends here that are in the Congress: There’s
nothing political about this.  It’s just simply about saving lives and
getting people back up and running.   
   
And we’re in this together, and so we’re not going to leave any
community behind — rural, city, coastal, inland.  And I promise we’re
going to have your backs until this gets done.   
   
And so, I’m mainly here to listen, to see what’s on your mind.  Be able
— be able to ask a few questions.  And if they’re really hard questions
I can’t answer, I’ll turn to Cedric or the Director. (Laughter.)  As you
probably know about me, I’ll have an opinion. (Laughter.)  
   
At any rate, so thank you, thank you, thank you.  I’ll turn it back to
you, Cedric, and let’s see what we can do here.   
   
MR. RICHMOND:  Well, thank you, Mr. President.  We’ll turn it over to
the governor, who’s leading the statewide recovery.  
   
Governor Edwards.  
   
GOVERNOR EDWARDS:  Thank you, Cedric, and welcome back home.   
   
Mr. President, we appreciate you being in Louisiana today, and thank you
for accepting the invitation.   
   
And I want you to know that, on Tuesday of this week, Administrator
Criswell and I were in this very room because she had already come
down.  And it makes a difference to be on the ground, to meet with
people, and to actually see the damage.  So we appreciate you being
here.   
   
And — and I appreciate the pre-landfall declaration you signed very
quickly when I requested it.  And then when I requested the major
disaster declaration, you signed that as well.   
   
And doing things timely is really important.  So we were able to
assemble the largest urban search and rescue team in advance of landfall
in the history of our country, and it was tremendously helpful.  You
know, we had 1,300 people, including our own — but from, you know, I
think was 19 different states that came in to be able to do that.   
   
And it’s been a tremendously devastating storm.  We’re going to be a
long time recovering.  The initial part is about getting people’s lives
right-side up, saving lives, and that sort of thing.  And then the
recovery is going to be — you know, it’s going to go on for quite some
time.  And so, we know that you’re — you’re here with us today, but
you’re going to be with us for the long haul as well.   
   
I did want to point out that — that the immediate impacts of the storm
that were — we were up to nine confirmed deaths related to the storm
(inaudible).  And so very tragic anytime you lose life, but ult- — you
know, largely, that was a big success story.   
   
Secondly, the investments the federal government made in the levee
system around New Orleans were just so helpful.  There wasn’t a levee
anywhere in Louisiana, state or federal, that failed.   
   
We had a few of the minor levees that overtopped — and if your home got
water because of that, it’s not minor; it’s serious — but we’re talking
about very low numbers compared to what would have happened.   
   
So investing in infrastructure, in resiliency, and making sure that we
do things better and smarter, it does pay off, because this would be a
much more expensive storm to recover from had we not already made those
investments.  
   
So we welcome you.  We thank you for being here.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Can I say one thing, please?  (Laughter.)  
   
No, hell, you know, once you represent a district, you never stop
representing it.  You know what I mean?  
   
MR. RICHMOND:  That’s true.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  But, you know, one of the things I hope you keep an eye
on is — I mean, everybody to keep an eye on — is that, you know, I got,
kind of — not beat up, but I got criticized from my talking — when I was
running for office — we got to Build Back Better.   
   
Things have changed and so drastically in terms of the environment. 
We’ve already crossed certain thresholds.  We can’t build back a road, a
highway, and a bridge or anything to what it was before.  
   
I mean, you’ve got to build back to what it is now — what’s needed
now.  
   
And I know the head of the energy companies understand this really
well.  We have a significant piece of legislation, both the
infrastructure bill and a budget thing — a reconciliation bill that
calls for significant investment in being able to deal with what is
about to come.  
   
In other words, for example, when you guys are putting back up those
high-tension wires again — and that’s working — you’re not going to put
up the same exact system.  You got to — you’re going to have to build it
better, and its resiliency.  
   
And so, I just want you all focusing on — and as you take a look — and
I’m going to presume to send you copies of this stuff — take a look and
see if what we’re — what we’re suggesting makes enough sense to you. 
Not whether it’s enough money or not, or too much, but does it make
sense.  Does it make sense.    
   
For example, coming in and seeing all the polls down.  Well, you know, I
mean, we’re going to build back better.  I mean, you know, we know if
it’s underground, it costs a hell of a lot more money, but guess what? 
It saves a hell of a lot more money long term.  
   
And we know that the kind of stuff that goes across even — you saw the
high-tension stuff going down across the Mississippi, like it did once
in the Delaware River, which is a hell of a lot wider than the
Mississippi River.  It’s — you know.   
   
And — and so we have to — it seems to me we can save a whole lot of
money and a whole lot of pain — pain for our constituents — if when we
build back, we build it back in — in a better way.  
   
And it will create — and I realize I’m selling as I’m talking too, but
it’ll create really significant good-paying jobs.  Not 15-dollar-an-hour
jobs, but jobs of prevailing wage.  And it generates economic growth.  
   
But I just — I just hope we don’t go about deciding, just like — and you
and I talked a lot about it — the levee system, and the one the federal
government — that’s the only one I’m fully familiar with.  
   
I mean, that was a lot of money.  But think how much money it saved and
how many lives it saved.  So, I hope you’ll think about that.  
   
So when you hear the ra- — the word “resiliency” — and I know the energy
guys know this — it’s about making a system, from our transmission of
energy straight through to the highways we’re building and the bridges,
resilient to the changes that we’re taking — that we’re seeing happen.  
   
I’m sorry, I wanted to repeat that again.  But I — I just hope you take
a look at it and tell me if we need more or less, too.   
   
MR. RICHMOND:  Well, thank you, Mr. President.  I think, with that, it’s
a great way to segue to our FEMA Administrator, Deanne Criswell.  
   
MS. CRISWELL:  Thank you, Cedric.  Mr. President, Governor, so far, you
know, in addition to some of the numbers that you mention, we have about
1,200 responders from the federal family on the ground, and that doesn’t
include those that are back at our National Response Coordination
Center, as well as our Regional Response Coordination Center,
representing 22 different federal government agencies.  
   
We have, right now, 197 ambulances that have been actively engaged in
trying to help with managing your support for the healthcare system.  We
also have 12 mobile communication units.  Comms have been down, and so
we’ve sent them into the parishes to help increase some of the
communications until the cell towers could come back up.  
   
I’d also like to mention that we did just turn on the Transitional
Sheltering Assistance Program.  The governor asked for that, I think
yesterday or maybe the day before, which means now individuals that are
displaced can stay in a hotel for a short term while we’re looking at
what their long-term lodging situation is.  
   
And so, if they haven’t registered, if the people in your communities
have not registered yet, they should register for assistance.  Those
that have registered, we will reach out to them automatically. 

And we’ve also turned on the Blue Roof program.  We saw some of the blue
roofs as we flew in today.  And so, those who have damages to their
roofs, they can go to BlueRoof.us.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Let’s make it clear: The Governor is afraid of that
guy.  That’s why he insisted — (laughter).

ADMINISTRATOR CRISWELL:  So, we’ll have that available to help with some
of those temporary roofing repairs. 

And then the last thing I’ll just quickly mention is we know that
responder lodging is a concern.  I’ve heard that from you, Governor, as
well as some of your staff.

We are moving responder lodging into the areas.  We have 200 beds that
are already set up here in New Orleans — or, in New Orleans at the
airport.  We have 300 more en route to Morgan City.  And we have 300 en
route to Belle Chasse.  And then we’re also looking at bringing in a
cruise ship to help support responders. 

And this isn’t just for our federal responders, this will be for your
first responders as well.  And so, we’re actively pursuing additional
lodging to help support those that really need to be able to stay close
and support your communities. 

And this is just the beginning.  We’re going to be here until — until
your recovery is over.

THE PRESIDENT:  Not going away. 

MR. RICHMOND:  Mr. President, before I recognize our host — Parish host,
as we looked at those blue roofs, and I think this is important,
especially for the country to know, that as our federal program gets up
and running, we’ve provided blue roofs, but a lot of those roofs are up
because the people of Louisiana decided to get on their roof, put up a
tarp, mitigate their damage, and start that recovery process
immediately. 

So, the fact that you were able to get those tarps out to parishes so
people could pick them up and start their recovery was important.  And
looking at the vast number, it was just incredible and gives me a sense
of Louisiana pride to just show that when we get knocked down, we get
right back up. 

And with that, I’ll recognize —

THE PRESIDENT:  Can I make one other point?  One of the things that,
again, about resilience, where — you’re going to get the funding to
build back those roofs, but not the same roof — a roof that is more
resistant to higher winds, more resistance to hurricanes. 

So, it’s not just building back to what the roof was before, to build it
back better.  That’s kind of what I mean — that’s a classic example of
what I’m talking about — resilience — of changing the nature of it. 

MR. RICHMOND:  So, Mr. President, with that, I’ll recognize the Parish
President for St. John Parish, Jaclyn Hotard.  
   
MS. HOTARD:  Thank you, Cedric.  Mr. President, Governor, FEMA, and all
of our partners, thank you for all of the hard work that was done in
preparation for Hurricane Ida.  And thank you for the response so far on
the ground and for continuing to ramp up those efforts. 

Mr. President, from your track record, I know you will be a great
partner in our recovery.  Thank you for your support and your continued
support for the West Shore Lake Pontchartrain levee project.  And thank
you for calling out the insurance companies for distinguishing between
mandatory and voluntary evacuations. 

Mr. President, our immediate needs are power, water, communications, and
financial assistance for those who can’t return home and are forced to
stay somewhere else during the recovery.  And thank you. 

THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you. 

MR. RICHMOND:  You know, part of some of the dilemmas when we do
meetings like this is who we’re going to recognize and who we’re going
to recognize next, and Senate — now-Congressman Carter represents the
second congressional district, which we’re in and would be a logical
choice, but actually Congressman Graves has more seniority on him. 
(Laughter.)
