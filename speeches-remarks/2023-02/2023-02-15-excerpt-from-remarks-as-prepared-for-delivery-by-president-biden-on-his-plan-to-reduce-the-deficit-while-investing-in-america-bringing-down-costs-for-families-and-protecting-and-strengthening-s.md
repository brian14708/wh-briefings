Let’s be crystal clear about what’s happening.

If you add up all the proposals that  my Republican friends in
Congress have offered so far, they would add another $3 trillion to the
debt over 10 years. 

When I introduce my budget in a few weeks, you’ll see that people
making less than $400,000 a year will not see a single penny increase in
taxes, nor have they for the past 2 years.

You’ll see that my budget will invest in America, lower costs and
protect and strengthen Social Security and Medicare, while cutting the
deficit by $2 Trillion over 10 years.
