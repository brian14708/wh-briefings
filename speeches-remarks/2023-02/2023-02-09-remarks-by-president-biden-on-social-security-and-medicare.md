University of Tampa  
Tampa, Florida

1:57 P.M. EST  
   
THE PRESIDENT: Hello, Tampa!  (Applause.) Azucena, thank you for that
introduction.  Mayor Castor, thanks for the passport into the city.  I
don’t know where you’re sitting.  I’m looking.  There you are.  Thanks
for the passport.  
   
And I want to also thank the members of Congress here today: Kathy
Castor, who represents this district, and Darren Soto.  Both good
friends.  (Applause.)  And two champions for opportunity, healthcare,
and a safer climate for the people of Florida.  
   
And I can’t stand here and not tell you how much I admire Charlie
Crist.  Charlie?  (Applause.)  I don’t think you’re finished. 
(Laughter.)    
   
Look, there are so many things we could focus on today at this great
university, from education to foreign policy and a whole range of other
issues.  But earlier this week, I reported on the state of the Union.  I
said — (applause) — I said it’s because of the people of this country,
the resilience and the strength, the soul of the nation is strong and
the backbone of this nation is strong and the people of America are
strong.  
   
It’s never been a good bet to try to count us out.  Never, ever, ever.  
   
We’re often told that Democrats and Republicans can’t work together. 
But as I told my Republican friends on Tuesday, if we could work
together the last Congress — and we did — there’s no reason we can’t
work together to get things done as well in this Congress. 
(Applause.)  
   
And Pat Baskette, an old friend of mine, when I was up in the Senate for
270 years — (laughter) — knows I know what I’m talking about on that
score.  
   
We passed more major pieces of legislation in our first two years
together — Democrats and Republicans — than any administration in
history:  
   
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law — that was a trillion 200 billion
dollars we agreed on to make us number one in the world again.   
   
The CHIPS and Science Act, which is causing the investment of $300
billion — $300 billion to build these new “fabs,” they call them —
factories to make chips, which we invented here in America, I might
add.  
   
The PACT Act, which is to save the families and keep our commitment to
all those who found ourselves in real trouble.  (Applause.)  
   
We bipartisanly passed the Respect for Marriage Act.  (Applause.)  Don’t
tell me we can’t get along.  
   
Years ago, I wrote — and there was great consternation over it — but we
reau- — reauthorized it again: the Violence Against Women Act. 
(Applause.)   
   
The Electoral Reform Act.  (Applause.)  
   
And, folks, we did that in a bipartisan way.  Democrats and Republicans
did it.  I don’t know why they don’t want to acknowledge they had any
part of what’s making the country great again.  
   
But in addition, we passed the American Rescue Plan, the Inflation
Reduction Act.  
   
And the people sent a clear message: Fighting for the sake of fighting
gets us nowhere.  There’s things that — we got to get things done. 
That’s always been my vision for our country, and I think that’s what
the American people said in this off-year election.  
   
Yesterday, I went to Wisconsin — nice and warm like down here —
(laughter) — to talk about how we’re building an economy from the bottom
up and the middle out.   
   
I’m so tired of trickle-down economics.  Not a lot trickled down to my
dad’s table when we were growing up.  
   
Today, I came to Florida to talk about a critical piece of that plan —
giving families and seniors just a little more breathing room, as my dad
would say, to lower your healthcare costs, and especially important here
in Florida.   
   
As I’m not surprised — surprise to any one of you, it is to other people
around the nation — you have the highest percentage of seniors of any
state in the nation.  (Applause.)  The highest percentage.  
   
Folks on fixed incomes relying on Social Security and Medicare to get
by, they deserve a greater sense of security and dignity.  That’s what
my plan offers.  
   
Too many Americans lay in bed at night, staring at the ceiling,
wondering, “What happens if I get sick, if I get — if I get cancer or my
wife gets breast cancer or we — or the kids get really sick?  What
happens?  What happens?  Are we going to have to sell the house?  What
are we going to do?  How are we going to pay our bills?”  
   
I know my dad did that when he lost insurance at the company he worked
for.   
   
Look, I get it.  I signed the Inflation Reduction Act and took on the
most powerful interests we’ve been fighting for years — pharma — to
bring down healthcare costs so you can have a better night’s sleep. 
(Applause.)  
   
Although we passed it in the middle of last summer and we let people
know what was in it, no one saw it because it didn’t take effect until
January 1st of this year.  Not a minute too soon.  
   
One in ten Americans has diabetes.  Millions need, every day, insulin to
stay alive.  Insulin has been around for 100 years.  As a matter of
fact, the guy who invented it didn’t patent it because he thought it
should be available to everybody.  
   
It costs drug companies roughly $10 a vial to make, $13 total to package
it.  Yet, Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of
dollars more and making record profits.  But not anymore.  (Applause.)  
   
We’ve capped the cost of insulin at $35 for seniors on Medicare. 
(Applause.)  But there are millions of Americans not on Medicare —
millions — millions — including 200,000 young people with Type I
diabetes who need this insulin to save their lives.  Let’s finish the
job — (applause) — and cap insulin at $35 a month for everyone who needs
it.   
   
You know, we pay more — I know Charlie knows this — we pay more in
prescription drugs than any country in the world.  Let me say that
again.  The United States of America pays more in prescription drugs
than any country in the world.  And there are many drugs, like expensive
cancer drugs, that cost up to $10-, $12-, $14,000 a year.  
   
Well, as of this year, they can be charged no more and they can pay no
more than $3,500 no matter what drug they get.  And next year, it goes
down to $2,000 maximum they have to pay for drugs.  (Applause.)  No
matter how expensive the drug is, the total for the year is only — has
to be $2,000.  
   
And if drug companies raise prices faster than inflation, they’ll have
to pay Medicare back the difference.  They have to pay them back.  
   
We’ve also made common vaccines, like whooping cough and shingles, free
for — instead of $100 to $200 a shot.  They’re free for all Americans. 
(Applause.)  
   
And we’re finally giving Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices. 
(Applause.)  We’ve been trying to do this for years.   
   
And, by the way, if you’ll just hold for a second, one of the things you
— a lot of you know, who are in the military: We’re able to — at the VA,
they can negotiate the price they’re going to pay for their — the drugs
that soldiers and sailors and airmen, et cetera, need.  
   
But Big Pharma, up to now, has always stopped our ability to negotiate
with them.  Well, we’re the only — by the way, we’re the only group in
the world we can’t negotiate with — wouldn’t — couldn’t negotiate with. 
But we finally got it done.   
   
Bringing down prescription drug costs doesn’t just save seniors money,
it will cut the federal budget by hundreds of billions of dollars. 
(Applause.)  Not a joke.  Because instead of paying 400 bucks, they’re
going to pay 35 bucks for it.  That’s the government’s cost.  So, this
also brings down the deficit.  
   
Do you guys have to stand the whole time?  I’m sorry.  (Laughter.)  Why
don’t you bring them some extra chairs here?  For real.  Do we have
chairs out there?  That — that’s not right.  (Laughter.)   
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Are you sure?  I know you can do it, but —  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  All right.  If you want to come up on stage, you can do
that too, if you want to.  (Laughter.)  
   
Look, this is pretty basic.  It’s pretty basic.   
   
When I meet with the Repub- — new Republican leadership, they say
they’re not going to raise taxes on anybody at all, and they’re not
going to do that, they’re just going to cut.  
   
And they say, “What would you cut?”  I said, “Well, I’ll start off, if
you — if you don’t — if you don’t stop trying to do away with the
legislation I did to hold Big Pharma accountable, I’m going to cut, by
hundreds of billions of dollars, the debt.”  
   
And they looked at me like, “What the hell is he talking about?”  Well,
guess what?  You pay that cost.  
   
Republicans — Republican senators and congressmen — and there are a lot
of good ones — are still threatening to repeal the Inflation Reduction
Act, which contains this legislation.  
   
If Republicans in Congress have their way, the power we just gave
Medicare to negotiate lower — lower prescription drug prices goes away. 
The $2,000 cap next year on prescription drugs goes away.  The
$35-a-month insulin limitation goes away.  
   
And, by the way, I was able to get enacted an $800-a-year in savings for
Americans to get their health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.  
   
But guess what?  They want that to go away, too.  They’ve been trying to
get rid of the Affordable Care Act for years, and millions of people are
on it.  
   
If Republicans refeal \[sic\] the — repeal the Inflation Reduction Act,
we’ll lose that $800 as well.  And all the people who get healthcare
through the Affordable Care Act — 20 percent of all the people who get
their healthcare through the Affordable Care Act live in Florida — 20
percent.  And, by the way, that’s 3.2 million people.  And they’re still
trying to take it away.  (Applause.)  
   
And I might note, just parenthetically — I’ll get back to this, but — we
were able to do all this, and I cut the budget by $1.7 trillion. 
(Applause.)  One-point — it’s more than any President has in all of
American history.  (Applause.)  
   
And one of the reasons why — if you could hold for a second — one of the
reasons why is because I thought it was time people began to pay their
fair share a little bit.  
   
You know, in 2020, there were 55 American corporations of the largest
Fortune 500 companies who made $40 billion.  They paid zero — zero —
zero in taxes.  
   
Now, I really did something offensive to them: I made them pay 15
percent.  That’s less than — that’s less than a nurse pays or a
firefighter.  But that 15 percent — guess what?  It paid for all of
this.   
   
Raise your hand — (applause) —  
   
And I made a commitment when I got elected, and I’m going to keep it.  I
kept it; I’m going to keep it.  No one making less than $400,000 will
pay an additional penny in tax.  Not one single, solitary cent. 
(Applause.)  
   
So, folks, this is doable.  It’s just about — I mean, I’m not going to
embarrass anybody or myself here by asking you, “Anybody who thinks the
federal income tax system is fair, raise your hand.”  
   
It’s not — look, you got — right now, there are a thousand trillionaires
in Americas — I mean, excuse me, billionaires in America.  A thousand. 
It went up from six hundred and something — just in two years.  
   
You know how much they — average pay — the average percent of their
salary they — their income they pay?  Three percent.  Three.  That was
less than the police officers I met a little bit earlier.

Well, folks, look, make no mistake about it: If I — they try to raise
the cost of prescription drugs or abolish the Affordable Care Act, I
will veto it.  (Applause.)

Look, the Affordable Care Act also includes this offer: If a state
expands Medicaid — not Medicare — Medicaid for the poor, for low- — so
low-income folks can get healthcare, the federal government picks up 90
percent of the cost.  That’s the deal.  Ninety percent.

Well, guess what?  The state only pays 10 percent.  It’s a great deal.

Thirty-nine states said, “Yeah, send it to us.”  Only — only in Flor- —
11 states, including Florida, said, “No, no.  We don’t want Medicaid.” 
No, I’m serious.

AUDIENCE:  Booo —

THE PRESIDENT:  Over 1.1 million people in Florida would be eligible for
Medicaid if Governor DeSantis just said, “I agree to expand it.”

It’s not — this — this isn’t — this isn’t calculus. 

And, by the way, it would also keep rural hospitals open.  Why are they
closing?  No, think about this.  All across America.

I’ll just talk about Florida for just a second.

When folks don’t have Medicaid, they come in and they’re poor and
they’re rural folks, they — the hospital can’t charge them.  There’s
nobody to charge.  There’s no money.  They take care of them if they
come through the door.

But eight rural hospitals have already closed in Florida since 2005. 
Eight.  And seven others are at risk closing in rural Florida.  That’s
more than a third of all the rural hospitals in this state.  And it
matters.

Do you know what the reason — the further distance a hospital is from
your home, if you have a trag- — if you have an accident, the higher the
percentage is you’ll die, because it takes so long to get there, to the
ho- — nearest hospital. 

That’s — that’s just a statistic.

The only reason Medicare expansion hasn’t happened here is politics. 
It’s time to get this done.  (Applause.)  It really is.  And if you’ve
done it, you’ve been elected.  (Applause.)  I really mean it.

I really don’t get it.  It’s not like you’re the poorest state in the
Union.

Look, now, you may have seen we had a little bit of a spirited debate at
the State of the Union.  (Laugher.)  I — (laughs) — well, I guess I
shouldn’t say any more.  (Laughter.)  But we — particularly with Social
Security and Medicare.

Republicans seemed shocked when I took out the pamphlets they were using
about cutting Medicare and Social Security — read from, you know,
Senator Scott’s proposal; read from a proposal from the senator from
Wisconsin.  They were offended.  “Liar!  Liar!”

By the way, the last person who said that on the floor of the Senate got
censored by the Senate — by the Congress.  But there were about four or
five — I don’t know how many.

I reminded them that Florida’s own Rick Scott, as the guy who ran the
Senate campaign committee for Republicans last year, had a plan to
sunset.  Maybe he’s changed his mind.  Maybe he’s seen the Lord.  But —
(laughter) — but he se- — wanted to sunset — meaning if you don’t
reauthorize it, it goes away — sunset Social Security and Medicare every
five years.

Now, it’s not likely to get voted out, but I tell you — I tell you what:
It’s likely it got cut drastically if you had to do it every five years.

The very idea the senator from Florida wants to put Social Security and
Medicare on the chopping block every five years I find to be somewhat
outrageous, so outrageous that you might not even believe it.  But it’s
what he — I won’t do it again, but — well, I will.  (Laughter.)

Twelve-point American Rescue plan.  One of the points: “All federal
legislation sunsets every five years.  If the law is worth keeping, the
Congress can pass it all over again.”

Look, if it doesn’t get reauthorized, it goes out of existence.  If
Congress wants it, they got to keep it and they got to vote on the same
thing.

And then, in case there was any doubt, just yesterday, he confirmed that
he still — he still likes his proposal.

Well, I guarantee you, it will not happen.  I will veto it.  I’ll defend
Social Security and Medicare.  (Applause.)

Well, Senator Scott is not the only one.  Senator Johnson of Wisconsin,
in his own party plan, he laid out Social Security should be on the
chopping block every year.  But, look, in his case, as I said, he wants
to do it every single year.

Let’s remember what this is all about.  Some of you are on Social
Security or your parents or grandparents are.  You earned it.  You
earned every single penny, and you paid into every paycheck you ever
got.  From the time you were a teenager, you had money taken out for
those programs.

They’re more than government programs.  They’re a promise — a promise we
made: Work hard and contribute, and when the time has come for you to
retire, you’ll be there — we’ll be there for you to help you out.  It’s
been a sacred trust, the rock-solid guarantee generations of Americans
have counted on, and it works.

The number of seniors living in poverty has plummeted since Social
Security was created.  And now these guys want to cut it.  I don’t get
it.  I really don’t.  I don’t know who they think they are.

We saw, on Tuesday night, Republicans don’t like me — being called out
on this.  They were not very happy with me pointing this out.  But their
words speak —

Look, I know that a lot of Republicans, their dream is to cut Social
Security and Medicare.  Well, let me say this: If that’s your dream, I’m
your nightmare.  (Laughter and applause.)

And, by the way, that may be redundant; I think they already think I
am.  (Laughter.)  But —

But if anyone tries to cut Social Security, we’re going to stop it.  If
anyone tries to cut Medicare, we’re going to stop it.

And, look, when I called the Republicans out on this on the State of the
Union, they sounded — and they started yelling, “Liar” — not all — but
started yelling, “Liar! Liar!”

And I said, “That means you all are for keeping Social Security?”  And
they all stood up and said, “Yeah.”  I said, “Well, we got a deal.” 
(Laughter and applause.)

Sounded like they agreed to take these cuts off the table.  I sure hope
so.  I really mean it.  I hope so.  Because they stood up; the vast
majority of them said, “Yes, we will not cut Social Security or
Medicare.”  Now, granted, I’ll believe it when I see it.  (Laughter.)  
   
But we’re going to both lay down our budgets very soon. 

The Speaker of the House has been reasonable in terms of discussions
with me so far.  He talked about all these things.  I said, “Look, why
don’t we just…” — by — I think it’s March — first week in March — “…why
don’t we just lay out our budgets?  You put yours down, and I’ll put
mine down.  And our people will sit and compare them, decide where we
can make a compromise if we can make a compromise.”  When I put mine
down, they’re going to see I lowered the deficit this year by $2
trillion, in what I’m talking about.  
   
And, by the way, the last fellow who had this job, who never showed up
at the transition, I might add — but the last guy who had this job, he
increased the federal debt — which took over 200 years to accumulate. 
That’s what the debt is, by the way.  We talk about the federal debt. 
It’s every penny owed since the inception of this nation and the
interest rates that followed it.  Okay?  That’s what it is.

Just in four years, he added to that federal debt of over 200 years by
25 percent.  And, by the way, he had a $2 trillion tax cut, the vast
majority went to the super wealthy.  And guess what?  Didn’t pay for a
single, solitary cent of it.

I will not cut a single Social Security or Medicare benefit.  In fact,
I’m going to extend the Medicare trust fund for at least two decades. 
(Applause.)  And we’ll not raise taxes on anyone making over 400,000
grand.  And I’ll pay for it all, my proposals, by making the wealthy and
big corporations pay just a little bit more.

Like I said, do you think a trillionaire should be staying at 3
percent?  Look, I’m a capitalist.  I — if you can make a million or a
billion — I said “trillion.”  If you make a billion or a million
dollars, God love you.  But just pay something.  No, I mean it
sincerely.  Just pay something.

Capitalism without competition is exploitation.  Some Republicans in
Congress even threatened to have America default on its debt for the
first time in American history if we don’t agree to the cuts they want
or don’t agree to end — and they will not agree to any tax increases on
anything.

Well, Democrats have never, ever done that.  Our national debt has
accumulated well over 200 years.  We haven’t missed a payment ever in
America.  Why in God’s name would we give up the progress we made for
the chaos they’re suggesting?

This nation has gone through too much.  We’ve come too far to let that
happen.  And I won’t, and I don’t think you will either, at least not on
my watch.

Let me close with this.  Just look at what we’ve done over the last two
years. 

Twelve million new jobs created.  More jobs created in two years than
any time in American history.  (Applause.)  More than —

Eight hundred thousand manufacturing jobs.  Where in God’s name is it
written that we can’t lead the world in manufacturing again, like we
used to? 

The lowest unemployment rate in 50 years.  Inflation coming down six
months in a row with more to go.  (Applause.)

A record 10 million Americans have applied to start a small business. 
Ten million.  Never happened before.

It’s clear our overall economic plan is working, but there’s much more
work to do.  Now, let’s build on the progress we made.  Let’s protect
lower prescription drug costs for seniors.  Expand health coverage for
more who need it and can’t get it.  Defend and strengthen the Social
Security and Medicare system.  Keep building the economy from the bottom
up and the middle out.  We know we can do this. 

I’ve long said it’s never, ever — and I mean this from the bottom of my
heart — it’s never, ever been a good bet to bet against the American
people.  And I can honestly say — (applause) — we’ve got a lot — a lot
more to do, but I’ve never been more optimistic about America’s future.

Just remember who we are, for God’s sake.  We’re the United States of
America.  (Applause.)  Nothing — nothing is beyond our capacity if we
work together.

So God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops.  (Applause.)
