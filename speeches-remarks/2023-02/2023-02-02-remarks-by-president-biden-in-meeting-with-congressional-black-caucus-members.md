Oval Office

4:49 P.M. EST  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, folks, I want to thank the CBC for coming down,
and the leaders, to come down to the White House.  We’ve got a lot to
talk about.  
   
I want to congratulate Congressman Horsford on his election to this
body.  
   
REPRESENTATIVE HORSFORD:  Thank you.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  And he got elected early on, despite the fact I was for
him.  But anyway.  (Laughter.)  But congratulations.   
   
REPRESENTATIVE HORSFORD:  Thank you very much.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  And — and we talk about progress we made together and
the investments we made in the African American community, the Black
community, from — everything from HBCUs to — to jobs, to healthcare, and
a range of other things.  
   
But, to state the obvious, everybody knows that Tyre was buried — just
laid to rest.  The Vice President went to the funeral.  I spent time on
the telephone with his mom and his stepfather.   
   
And, you know, my hope is this dark memory spurs some action that we’ve
all been fighting for.  And — although, we just got to keep at it.   
   
I listened to Al Sharpton’s eulogy, which I thought was first rate.  And
we got to stay at it as long as it takes.   
   
The House passed police reform back in 2021 when the Democrats
controlled the House, and it passed the George Floyd Act.  And, Cory,
you worked like he- — like heck in the Senate.  You came close, but —
you know, and —  
   
But it’s — what we did — I was able to, through executive order, make
some significant changes at the federal level, which I want to share
with you all — not necessarily take the time today — but to go through
the implementation of each of the initiatives we put forward.  
   
The absolute deadline for each of the agencies to demonstrate that
they’ve met the requirements is the end of May — March.  And so, we — I
want to — we’ll meet before then, but I want to sit down and go into
detail about that.  
   
And — and — but I, most of all, would like to talk with you guys and you
— whatever you want to talk about.  But from my perspective is: How can
we make some progress on police reform of consequence and violence in
our communities?  And I assume that’s the primary thing we’re going to
talk about, but anything else is on the table.   
   
So, thank you all.  Do you want to say anything, Mr. Chairman?  
   
REPRESENTATIVE HORSFORD:  I just want to thank you, Mr. President and
Mr. Vi- — Madam Vice President, for making this a priority today.  
   
The death of Tyre Nichols is yet another example of why we do need
action.  But you’ve already led on the action that we’ve been able to
take through executive order.  
   
We need your help to make sure we can get the legislative actions that
are necessary to save lives and to make public safety the priority that
it needs to be for all communities.  So, I want to thank you for that.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you.  
   
Folks, we’re going to get to work.  Thank you for coming in.
