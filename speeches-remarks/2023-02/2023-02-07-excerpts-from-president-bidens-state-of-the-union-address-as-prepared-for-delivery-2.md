The story of America is a story of progress and resilience…We are the
only country that has emerged from every crisis stronger than when we
entered it. That is what we are doing again. Two years ago our economy
was reeling. As I stand here tonight, we have created a record 12
million new jobs – more jobs created in two years than any president has
ever created in four years. Two years ago, COVID had shut down our
businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much. Today, COVID
no longer controls our lives. And two years ago, our democracy faced its
greatest threat since the Civil War. Today, though bruised, our
democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.

My economic plan is about investing in places and people that have been
forgotten. Amid the economic upheaval of the past four decades too many
people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible. Maybe
that’s you watching at home. You remember the jobs that went away. And
you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children
to get ahead without moving away. I get it. That’s why we’re building an
economy where no one is left behind. Jobs are coming back, pride is
coming back because of the choices we made in the last two years. This
is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference
in your lives.

To my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last
Congress, there is no reason we can’t work together in this new
Congress. The people sent us a clear message. Fighting for the sake of
fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of
conflict, gets us nowhere. And that’s always been my vision for the
country: to restore the soul of the nation, to rebuild the backbone of
America: the middle class, to unite the country. We’ve been sent here to
finish the job!
