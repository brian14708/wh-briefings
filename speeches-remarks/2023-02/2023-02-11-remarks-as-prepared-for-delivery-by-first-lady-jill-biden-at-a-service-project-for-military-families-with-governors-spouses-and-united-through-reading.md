------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stewart, thank you for welcoming us to this beautiful place. As always,
we’re so grateful for what you and the White House Historical
Association have done to preserve our history and make it more
accessible to all.

Tammy, Abby, and all our Governors’ spouses, thank you for joining us
and for your commitment to helping our military families.

And Doug, I’m so grateful to have you here with us.

As you know, I had to miss the Alvin Ailey performance and lunch
yesterday because I wasn’t feeling well. And I was truly
disappointed—but I’m happy to be with you today to make a big difference
in some very special children’s lives.

When our son Beau was deployed in Iraq, I saw how much his children,
Natalie and Hunter, missed their daddy. No matter how much we tried, we
couldn’t fill his chair at birthdays or holidays, we couldn’t be the
voice that they wanted to hear at bedtime.

United Through Reading gives children the chance to hear that voice once
again. For one special moment, kids can share their favorite book with
the person they love most, and go to sleep knowing that—no matter the
distance—their service member is thinking of them, loving them, and
watching over them.

So on behalf of our national guard families, thank you for making those
moments possible.
