3:48 P.M. EST  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, everyone!  Good afternoon.  Please,
have a seat.  Please, have a seat.  
   
CaShawn and Lewis, I want to thank you for that introduction and for
just how you are inspiring so many folks.   
   
We were talking backstage, and the two of them really have worked so
hard to do what we all do — right? — which is we want to work hard,
we’re prepared to work hard.  And we want to know that there will be a
return on that and that the system will support hard work to allow
people to attain and realize their dreams.  
   
And the two of you are real role models for the importance of this
approach and the work we’re going to talk about today. And I want to
thank you for that and having the courage to be on a stage and talk in
front of so many people about what you both are doing.  I know you’re
going to get that home very soon. So congratulations to you both. 
(Applause.)  Thank you.  
   
So, it is good to be back in Maryland.  And it is good to be with former
Majority Leader, Congressman Steny Hoyer.  Steny, I want to thank you
always.  (Applause.)  I have shared many a stage and walked many a block
with Steny Hoyer.  He is always fighting for the people in Maryland.  It
is so good to be back with you.  
   
And to the leaders of Bowie State, I want to thank you.  Madam
President, I want to thank you for the warm welcome.  Where is she? 
There you are.  (Applause.)  I want to thank you for the warm welcome
and all the work you are doing for the future of America here at Bowie
State.  Thank you for that.  
   
And I want to thank all of the folks who are part of the HomeFree-USA
program, because you’re doing the work on the ground every day.  Thank
you.  (Applause.)  
   
So, our Secretary, Marcia Fudge, wanted to be here today to talk about
the incredible work that the Department of Housing and Urban Development
— the work they have been doing to expand access to housing on a number
of levels, including expanding access to counseling to help people know
how to be on a track to actually get a home and keep a home.   
   
And the work that she has done as the Secretary of HUD has been
extraordinary.  Her work is the work that is about making sure that more
Americans have and can receive trustworthy advice on how to buy a home,
how to lower their rent, and plan their financial future.  
   
So in her absence, about her I must say she is a former mayor, a former
member of Congress.  And now as the Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development, Marcia Fudge has been a true champion for the families and
homeowners of America.  And so, let us give her a round of applause —
(applause) — because we do rely on her leadership and partnership.  
   
So, today I will begin with a very brief and short story.   
   
So, for most of my childhood, our family rented.  And then there was
this one afternoon where my mother — our mother — called my sister Maya
and me in.  We were in high school at the time.  And she called us into
the kitchen, and she showed us this photograph.  And it was a picture of
a one-story, dark grey house with a shingled roof and a beautiful
lawn.  
   
And mommy, which is what we called her, was telling us that after her
years of saving, she was ready to become a homeowner.  And I remember
that day so vividly.  Our mother was so excited.  And we were,
therefore, so excited because our mother was so excited about what this
meant in terms of not only a symbol of her hard work, but what it means
to be able to have that symbol of pride in yourself, knowing also what
it means in terms of what you can do for your family.  I remember that
so well.   
   
And so, not only for my mother, but for millions of people across our
nation, that’s what that means.   
   
Homeownership is an essential part of the American Dream.  For so many
people, a home is more than simply a house.  It is community — the
community that comes from block parties, from cookouts, from lending a
cup of sugar to the person who lives next door.  A home represents
financial security, the opportunity to build wealth and equity that can
help put your child through college, afford retirement, create
intergenerational wealth within your family.  That’s what all of this
represents.  It is so much bigger than a piece of property.  
   
And for so many people, then, it is about what they can do to create a
foundation for a better future for themselves, for their family, and for
their community.  
   
For years, as you have learned, I have been meeting and talking with
homeowners about their dreams and about the challenges that they face to
become or be a homeowner.  As you’ve heard, when I was attorney general
of California, I met with so many families who at the time were weeks
away from losing their homes.  I traveled up and down the state of
California meeting with these families.  
   
And, you see, the folks that I met with for the most part were folks who
had trusted the system and the financial services system — trusted that
they would be treated fairly by these systems, by the big banks, but who
instead were victimized by predatory lending practices.  
   
And so, being attorney general, I held the banks accountable, as did
many of our partners around the country.  And for California, we were
able to secure $20 billion for the homeowners of California, inclu- —
(applause) — yes, for them — including millions of dollars for financial
literacy clinics and fraud education programs to teach people how to
fight against fraud and to avoid fraud.  
   
As attorney general, I also drafted and helped pass what we named the
Homeowner Bill of Rights, which was the first bill of its kind in the
nation to protect families from deceptive practices and from disclosure
in a way that — well, to get them disclosure in a way that they would
know what was happening with their future.  
   
And so, then, years later, and now as Vice President, this is the work
we continue.   
   
Now, most of you — Steny, you remember — we came into office, Joe Biden
and I, and started this — these last two years, but we started at the
height of the pandemic when we came into office.   
   
And so let’s remember that, at the time, millions of Americans had lost
their jobs and fallen behind on their rent or mortgage payments.  But
President Biden and I understood what was going on behind the scenes,
how that had happened.  We understood that people, through no fault of
their own, were on the brink of eviction or foreclosure.  And so we took
action, and we helped more than 8 million households pay rent.  And we
also put a pause on mortgage payments for nearly 3 million more
individuals.  (Applause.)  
   
And that brings us to today, where we are here to make an announcement
about how we can help more people in connection with their ability to be
a homeowner.  
   
So here’s how it works:  
   
So let’s say that you dream of buying a home like so many hardworking
people, and you have a steady job, and you work hard and you work good,
but your credit score could be a little bit better.  So even though
you’ve been saving, you still do not have enough for a 10 or 20 percent
down payment — as part of that scenario, right?  You’re working hard,
you have a dream, but you don’t have enough of that 10 or 20 percent
down payment.  Well, if you went to a bank, and if your credit score
weren’t perfect — if you went to a bank, it’s unlikely they would
approve you for a home loan.  
   
Well, you see, that’s not only a problem for that individual, that
presents a problem for our nation.  And I’m going to tell you why.  
   
We know that when we increase home ownership, it strengthens communities
and it strengthens our economy.  Homeowners are more likely to put down
roots.  Studies have shown homeowners are more likely to volunteer for
local charities, to vote in local elections, to start a small
business.  
   
And understanding, then, that whole dynamic, 90 years ago — about 90
years ago, our nation created the FHA loan program.  FHA loans were
created to help lower-income families buy homes.  And the way that it
works is by insuring those loans against default.  Because, arguably,
we’re talking about folks that might be higher risk on the books.  
   
And so, last year, millions of homebuyers used an FHA loan, and we’re
talking about folks who are nurses, who are students, who are car
mechanics, or small-business owners.  They’re the folks you know. 
Eighty percent are also first-time homeowners.  
   
So it has been a very helpful program, the FHA loan process.  But we
also realized, after talking to folks, it’s time for an upgrade. 
Because we have been traveling around the country, and we’ve been
talking with folks.  And for too many, what we realize is the monthly
cost of an FHA loan is still too high.   
   
That is why today I am proud to announce that starting on March 20th, we
are reducing mortgage insurance payments for all new FHA homeowners by
nearly 40 percent.  (Applause.)  
   
And what this means is: On average, homeowners will pay at least $800 a
year less on their mortgage, and that’s 800 more dollars in your pocket
for household expenses.  (Applause.)  
   
We expect that with this new approach, more than 850,000 Americans a
year will benefit from this discount.  Many will be first-time
homebuyers.  
   
And so this is part of our broader strategy.  Every day, Joe Biden and I
talk about and work together with our partners, like former leader Hoyer
— current leader Hoyer — to lower the cost for the people of our nation,
because you are a leader.  
   
For working families, we have reduced heating and electricity bills so
folks have more money in their pocket to buy things like school
supplies, replace the dishwasher, or take a family vacation.  
   
For seniors, we capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month so our seniors
don’t have to choose between filling a doctor’s prescription or paying
for groceries.  (Applause.)  
   
And for millions of students and parents and small-business owners, we
cut the cost of high-speed Internet bills by $30 a month to make sure
that we connect folks with the essential technology of the 21st
century.  
   
And so this work we do — this work we do, understanding we have to see
people in their whole selves, and all of the facets that are part of
every person that must be seen and addressed, we do this work because we
know that when we lower costs for working people, when working people
can buy a home, when working people can thrive, our nation thrives.  
   
So, in conclusion, I’ll say: Together, let us continue to create
opportunity and to invest in the ability of all Americans to realize
their dreams.  
   
May God bless you, and may God bless America.  Thank you. (Applause.)
