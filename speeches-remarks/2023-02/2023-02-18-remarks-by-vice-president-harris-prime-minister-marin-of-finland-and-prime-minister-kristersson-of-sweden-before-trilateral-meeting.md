title: Remarks by Vice President Harris, Prime Minister Marin of Finland, and Prime
  Minister Kristersson of Sweden Before Trilateral Meeting
---
 
*Commerzbank  
*Munich, Germany**

VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Well, it is my honor and privilege to be with
two very important friends of the United States and allies.  And we have
had brief discussions, and we’ll now go to a meeting where we’ll have
much more extensive conversation about our mutual commitment to the
transatlantic Alliance, to Ukraine and the people of Ukraine, and to the
work that we must do to strengthen all of the principles that we hold
dear.  
   
I was privileged and honored to be with the President of the United
States when he actually signed the papers about the accession of Finland
and Sweden to NATO.  And we are very excited about the trajectory of all
of this and the importance of the unity between our countries.  So, I
thank you both.  
   
And, Madam Prime Minister, if you’d like to say a few words.  
   
PRIME MINISTER MARIN:  It’s very important that we are here together at
the Munich Security Conference and that we are all speaking of Ukraine —
the help, the support that Ukraine needs.  
   
And it was very inspiring and very important what you said earlier in
your speech that whatever might happen in the future in the United
States, that you will continue supporting Ukraine.  I think that’s a
very powerful and clear message.  And I want to thank you for that and
also for your great support in our NATO application path.  
   
And hopefully, before Vilna, both countries will become members of
NATO.   
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  That’s right.  
      
Mr. Prime Minister.  
   
PRIME MINISTER KRISTERSSON:  Thank you, Vice President.  So pleased to
be here to meet with you and to our friends from Finland.  We are really
partners in supporting Ukraine.  Under not least your leadership, but I
think the European unity and the European and transatlantic unity has
been of paramount importance.   
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Yes.  
   
PRIME MINISTER KRISTERSSON:  And we started the process together with
Finland to join NATO, and we — we hope to fulfill — to complete it
together with Finland as well.  
   
Thank you so much.  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Well, we have lots of work to do together, and I
look forward to our conversation.  Thank you.  
   
PRIME MINISTER MARIN:  Thank you.
