Windhoek, Namibia

  
I’m here today because you are the keepers of democracy.  
   
As the first generation to be born into a free Namibia, the legacy that
your parents and grandparents created is now yours—yours to defend and
protect. Yours to grow. And as we look forward, we must remember that
the fight for democracy has no end.  
   
As time passes and challenges arise, it’s easy to quietly slip into the
waking-sleep of cynicism and apathy. It’s so much harder to bring
millions of people together and find consensus.  
   
And so, we must build on the foundation of democracy by lifting up those
voices that have gone unheard, particularly women and girls, people
living on the margins of society, or those vulnerable to abuse.   
   
By exercising our right to disagree and dissent, speaking up when we see
injustice, and supporting leaders who listen to our concerns. And,
becoming those leaders when we hear the call.  
   
In the United States, we are still defending and strengthening our
democracy, almost 250 years after our founding. And I’m so proud of
Americans—and especially young people—for continuing to use their voice
and fight for a better future for us all.  
   
It’s not easy. Democracy isn’t easy. It takes work.  
   
But it’s worth it. Because democracy delivers.  
   
Each generation inherits the world in their time. We often tell young
people that you’re the future. And it’s true.  
   
But sometimes, that message can sound like: “Wait.” Wait for some
far-off finish line that makes you wiser or more powerful. Wait for your
communities to listen to what you have to say. Wait, while others build
the future for you.  
   
I know, however, that there are things you want to change now. There are
problems that you can solve now. And you have gifts to offer the world
now.  
   
Yesterday, I met Moses. At age 17, he’s full of confidence, insight, and
charm. He spoke about his generation—your generation—and he summed it up
with one word: potential. That is what he sees around him—diversity,
drive, creativity, passion—things that can transform and bring new life,
if only we can put them to work.  
   
He said, “Potential is energy. It’s your choice to decide what to do
with it.”  
   
So let me ask you, what are you going to do with it?  
   
The other evening, I was talking to my husband Joe about this trip, and
he spoke of his admiration for all that you’ve achieved here—going back
to your struggle against apartheid. As a young United States Senator, it
inspired him to speak out forcefully, urging his country to do more.  
  
He understood then—as he does now—that our futures are intertwined.   
   
This past December, at the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, President Biden
announced a new approach—a much-needed shift. African voices, African
leadership, and African innovation all are critical to addressing the
most pressing global challenges and realizing the vision we all share: a
world that is free.  
   
The United States is committed to making sure that African countries not
only have a voice in organizations like the UN Security Council and G20,
but that those voices are valued as equal partners, working side by side
to advance our shared priorities like empowering women and youth,
strengthening global health, and building economic prosperity.  
   
Yet diplomacy isn’t just government-to-government work. It’s people to
people—heart to heart.  
   
I’ve traveled to the continent six times—but this is my first trip as
First Lady of the United States. I chose to come to Namibia because I
was inspired by the way your First Lady talked about your country when
we met in December. She told me about you, the people of Namibia.  We
spoke about all of the values that we share: liberty, democracy, and
equality. And the work we might do together.  
   
So, I was pleased to accept your first lady’s invitation to visit, and I
will cherish the memories I’ve made here. Thank you to Chancellor Naomab
and all who have welcomed me. You’ve shared the things that matter to
you. What inspires you, what change you want to see. Thank you for your
music, your poetry, your stories—like yours, Martha.  
   
You—the young people of Namibia—are not only our future but our
present.  
   
And as our world grows smaller, the connections between us matter more.
When people here are able to thrive, that success ripples beyond your
borders.  
   
Just look at the progress that has been made here for gender equality,
clean energy, and slowing the spread of HIV. Namibia is setting an
example for the world.  
   
Yes, you are the keepers of democracy.  
   
And when you speak up, when you decide to shape your nation into the
place that you know it can be, you inspire others to do the same.  
   
You show the world that change can happen—that young people can make it
happen. You can inspire them to fight for the future that they need
too.  
   
We’re listening. Your President and First Lady, your country, and my
country too. Because you matter to the United States.  
   
The future is not a far-away finish line. We are building it every day.
Raise your voice. Hold on to your dreams. And let’s create the world
that you want and need.    
   
May God bless the people of Namibia and the United States.  
   
Thank you.
