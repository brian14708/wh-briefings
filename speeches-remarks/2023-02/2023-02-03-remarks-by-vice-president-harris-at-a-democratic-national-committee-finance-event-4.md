Philadelphia, Pennsylvania*

4:49 P.M. EST  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good evening, everyone.  Good evening.  Good
evening.  (Applause.)  Sit.   
   
Thank you, Jaime.  I’m always so happy to be with you.  But most often,
you are just out there in our country, traveling around our country,
supporting Democrats everywhere.  And the work you are doing through the
DNC has been remarkable.  So, thank you.  And for that introduction,
thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)   
   
Well, good evening, Democrats!  (Applause.)  Okay, so they’re — one of
our team members, right after the new year, as we all returned to the
White House, asked me, “What’s your one word for 2023?”  And without any
reflection, I said, “Momentum.  Momentum.”   
   
Because of who our President is, because of the agenda that we
collectively set, we have a lot of good material to talk about. 
(Applause.)   
   
And we’ve got a lot of finger-pointing to do.  And by that, I mean
pointing at the results of the hard work.   
   
We’ve got a lot of good material.  When I look around this room at the
leaders and all of the work you did in 2020 that resulted in our
administration — together with Leader Clyburn, together with Senator
Coons, together with so many — what we were able to do — Lisa Blunt
Rochester — what we were able to do — (applause) — with our partners in
the Congress to get a Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, to get a CHIPS Act,
the Inflation Reduction Act.  
   
By the way, $370 billion explicitly going to climate.  But the way we’ve
totaled it up, probably going to be more like closer to $1 trillion.   
   
So much good work.   
   
So, it is incumbent now on all of us who believed and who knew — and,
yes, you worked so hard — to keep working hard.  It is now incumbent on
us to see it through.   
   
And one of the things that I’m so excited about, about all that we have
accomplished together is it also validates something that we, as
Democrats, I think, really believe, which is in the integrity and the
purpose of our government to do good work that lifts up the condition of
the American people.   
   
We now have so much to point to that validates the desires and the goals
and the dreams of American families, in terms of what they hope and
believe their government would care about and work on.   
   
They now know: Yes, you’re right to think that your government will fix
roads and bridges.  That’s kind of basic, but nobody got it done before
President Biden.  (Applause.)  
   
But, yes, you’re right to expect also that your government and its
leaders will invest in the future of our country.  So, the President is
going to talk in more detail tonight.  I’ll talk in more detail later
tonight.   
   
But we got a lot of good material, and momentum is on our side.  And so,
this is not the time to let up.  It’s not the time to pat ourselves on
the back.  It’s the time to see it through.   
   
And that’s going to take as much work, if not more, than everything that
everyone here put into where we are today.   
   
So, we are here to thank you.  We know who’s in this room, and you keep
coming back, election after election after election.  Yeah, Chris Korge
— he was like, “Yeah.”  (Laughter.)  Thank you.   
   
You keep taking the calls.  You keep answering the calls.  You keep
making the calls.  And we could not, in these positions, do what we do
were it not for you doing what you do that takes so much effort and
sacrifice and faith in the goodness of who we are as a nation and what
we are capable of achieving.   
   
And so, it is now my great honor and pleasure to introduce an individual
who I have the extraordinary honor of working with every day.   
   
And I’ll tell you guys something.  I see the President at all hours, in
all circumstances.  And I see what you all know, I’m sure, but don’t
necessarily see every day: He works so hard, and he really is guided by
his faith and belief in what is good and what is right.   
   
I see him make some of the most difficult decisions anyone could ever be
charged with making.  Because let’s get it straight: If it comes to the
Resolute Desk, if it comes to Joe Biden, it is because nobody else can
make the decision, because it’s so heavy, it’s so weighted, and the
outcome is not necessarily evident or clear.   
   
It takes courage.  And it takes the kind of vision and strength that we
have in our President, Joe Biden.  (Applause.)
