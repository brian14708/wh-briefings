2:53 P.M. CST  
      
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Hi, everyone.  (Applause.)  Oh, it’s good to see
everyone.  Hi.  Please have a seat.  I’m here to announce the shift
change.  (Laughter.)  
  
Oh, it’s good to be with everyone.  And, Mr. Vice President, Wade, thank
you for that introduction. (Laughter.)  
  
But really, truly, Wade, thank you.  It’s been great to walk around and
see the work that’s happening here.  And it really is wonderful to be
with all of you.  Matt, thank you for taking me around as well.  
  
And it’s so good to be back in Minnesota with so many incredible
leaders.  
  
I want to give a shout-out to the Governor, Tim Walz.  He can’t be with
us today.  He’s in Washington with a bunch of the governors who are
meeting there for their annual meeting.  But in his absence, I have to
talk about him.  
  
He has been a true champion and a partner to the President and our
administration, and, in particular, a champion for our climate and for
communities.  
  
In fact, as you all know, earlier this week, he signed a law that will
make Minnesota’s electricity 100 percent carbon-free by 2040.  That’s a
big deal.  (Applause.)  That’s a big deal.  
  
So, to Governor Walz; to the leaders who are here; the leaders of the
state legislature; the general, who is here; and to all of the activists
and organizers who fought for years to achieve these goals,
congratulations, and thank you for all that you are doing right here in
Minnesota to lead our nation forward.  
  
So, on Tuesday, our President, Joe Biden, spoke to the nation.  And he
declared that the state of our union is strong.  And he noted that over
the past two years, America has created over 12 million jobs,
unemployment has fallen to the lowest level that it’s been in 50 years. 
And since we took office, more Americans have started small businesses
than in any other two-year period in our history.  
  
Think about that.  Think about what that means for families, for
communities, for the children of America.  
  
But we all know that we still have more work to do to continue to build
a nation where all people, no matter where they live, have the
opportunity not only to survive but to thrive.  
  
And so that’s why we’re here today at New Flyer St. Cloud.  
  
I don’t have to tell anybody here: Businesses that do the kind of work,
combined with union leadership and workers, are building the future of
our nation.  And when I look around here and the work that is happening
here, everyone knows buses are our nation’s most popular form of public
transportation.  Most popular form of public transportation.  
  
Every day, millions of Americans ride the bus to go to work, to school,
to church, to the grocery store, to wherever they need to get.  
  
America’s buses get people where they need to go.  They are essential. 
And they are in desperate need of upgrade.  
  
The majority of our nation’s buses run on diesel fuel.  
   
Well, here’s the thing: Diesel exhaust is a poison.  Breathing diesel
fumes can cause headaches and nausea.  It can make asthma and chronic
bronchitis worse.  And it can even cause a risk for cancer.  Diesel
exhaust is also a greenhouse gas.  
   
Every year, gas-powered buses add millions of tons of pollution to our
atmosphere, which further accelerates the climate crisis.  But there is
a solution to all of this, and that solution is parked right over there
and right over there and right over there.  These buses — electric
buses.  
   
Because as everyone here knows, electric buses do not produce toxic
exhaust.  They are healthier for people, cleaner for communities, and
better for our planet.   
   
A few minutes ago, as Matt walked me around, I had the opportunity to
take a look at one of the buses that is being built in this factory.  It
is a model of American innovation.  No exhaust.  No diesel smell.  The
bus has Wi-Fi and even USB outlets next to every seat.  I mean, come on,
imagine.  You can charge your phone on your way home from work.  That’s
good stuff.  
   
And electric buses are also cheaper to run and more reliable than
gas-powered buses.  Cities and towns with electric fleets spend less on
gas and maintenance.  And as some of the leaders here can attest, that
means more money in the local budget to add more routes, more stops, and
more drivers.  And that means more reliable service.  So, you know, for
anyone who’s had to wait too long in the cold because the bus is late,
you know how much that matters.   
   
All of this to say electric buses are key to the future of public
transportation in America — which is why, since taking office, together
with Democrats and Republicans, we have invested over $5.5 billion to
put thousands of new electric transit buses on the streets of our
nation.  (Applause.)   
   
And we’ve also done that to create jobs.  (Bell rings in the
background.)  (Laughter.)  So people can have shift changes — (laughter)
— and have decent work hours and have good-paying union jobs! 
(Applause.)   
   
And it has meant jobs for steel workers in Ohio who make the glass for
the bus windshields.  Jobs for electrical workers in Wisconsin who
install and repair the charging stations.  Jobs for CWA workers here who
assemble hundreds of buses a year.  And jobs for the workers at a New
Flyer facility just outside of Louisville, Kentucky, who just this week
voted to unionize and join CWA.  (Applause.)  
   
And I want to recognize New Flyer management for your commitment to
build a positive and productive relationship with your workers.   
   
So, Minnesota, this is a transformative moment.  The climate crisis has
presented an historic challenge to our nation and to the world.  It also
presents an historic opportunity to create good jobs, to drive
innovation, to generate prosperity in all communities.   
   
You know, last August, our administration made the single-largest
investment to fight the climate crisis in history.  In just the last six
months, that investment has already created more than 100,000 clean
energy jobs.  Many — (applause).  
   
That includes many jobs that do not require a four-year college degree
but do require the kind of skills-building that the folks here train
people to do — jobs that offer salaries and benefits that allow folks to
raise a family, to buy a home, to take a vacation from time to time, to
retire with dignity.  That’s critically important.   
   
As we build America’s future, as we strengthen America’s economy, let us
also strengthen the working people of America.  We can do it all.  We
can do it all.  (Applause.)  
   
So, I’ll close with this.  As some of you may remember, in 2009, just a
few months after he was elected, then-Vice President Joe Biden stood in
this plant.  
   
At the time — who was there?  (Applause.)  Okay.  So, you remember.  And
I — Mayor, I know you were there.  We talked about that.   
   
At the time, here at this plant, you were producing cutting-edge hybrid
transit buses.  And then Vice President Biden said, and I’ll quote,
“This company is an example of the future.”  
   
Well, a lot has changed in the past 14 years.  But one thing has not:
You are still an example of America’s future.  (Applause.)  
   
So, I am here to say we are still counting on you because here in St. 
Cloud, you are not just building better buses, you are building a better
America.   
   
God bless you.  And God bless America.  Thank you.  (Applause.)
