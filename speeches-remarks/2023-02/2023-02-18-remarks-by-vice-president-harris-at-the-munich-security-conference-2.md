title: Remarks by Vice President Harris at the Munich Security Conference

*Hotel Bayerischer Hof  
*Munich, Germany**

12:44 P.M. CEST  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you, Christoph.  Thank you,
Christoph.  Thank you.   
   
Well, it is my honor to be back at the Munich Security Conference.  
   
As many of us remember, last year, on this stage, I warned of the
imminent invasion of Ukraine by Russia.  And let us all recall: Many at
the time wondered how we would all respond.  Many wondered: Could Russia
be stopped?  Would NATO come together?  Would NATO break apart?  And
would Ukraine be prepared?  
   
Colleagues, today, a year later, we know.   
   
Kyiv is still standing.  (Applause.)  Russia — Russia is weakened.   
   
The transatlantic Alliance is stronger than ever.  (Applause.)  And most
importantly, the spirit of the Ukrainian people endures.  
   
And under Joe Biden, President of the United States, our country has
demonstrated decisive leadership.  
   
As President Biden often says: The United States will support Ukraine
for as long as it takes.  We will not waver.  
   
And today, at this Munich Security Conference, I will describe what we
all continue to have at stake: the moral interest, the strategic
interest, and the reason Ukraine matters for the people of America, for
the people of Europe, and for people around the world.  
   
First, from the starting days of this unprovoked war, we have witnessed
Russian forces engage in horrendous atrocities and war crimes.  Their
actions are an assault on our common values, an attack on our common
humanity.  
   
And let us be clear: Russian forces have pursued a widespread and
systemic attack against a civilian population — gruesome acts of murder,
torture, rape, and deportation.  Execution-style killings, beatings, and
electrocution.  
   
Russian authorities have forcibly deported hundreds of thousands of
people from Ukraine to Russia, including children.  They have cruelly
separated children from their families.  
   
And we’ve all seen the images of the theater in Mariupol, where hundreds
of people were killed.  
   
Think of the image of the pregnant mother who was killed following a
strike at a maternity hospital, where she was preparing to give birth.  
   
Think of the images of Bucha.  Civilians shot in cold blood.  Their
bodies left in the street.  The jarring photograph of the man who was
riding his bike.  
   
Think of the four-year-old girl who the United Nations recently reported
was sexually assaulted by a Russian soldier.  A four-year-old child.  
   
Barbaric and inhumane.  
   
Long before I was Vice President of the United States, I spent the
majority of my career as a prosecutor, beginning as a young lawyer in
the courtroom and later running the California Department of Justice.  I
know firsthand the importance of gathering facts and holding them up
against the law.  
   
In the case of Russia’s actions in Ukraine, we have examined the
evidence.  We know the legal standards.  And there is no doubt these are
crimes against humanity.  (Applause.)  
   
The United States has formally determined that Russia has committed
crimes against humanity.  
   
And I say to all those who have perpetrated these crimes and to their
superiors who are complicit in these crimes: You will be held to
account.  
   
In the face of these indisputable facts, to all of us here in Munich:
Let us renew our commitment to accountability.  Let us renew our
commitment to the rule of law.   
   
As for the United States, we will continue to support the judicial
process in Ukraine and international investigations, because justice
must be served.  
   
Let us all agree, on behalf of all the victims, both known and unknown,
justice must be served.  Such is our moral interest.  
   
We also have a significant strategic interest.  The fight in Ukraine has
far-reaching global ramifications.   
   
No nation is safe in a world where one country can violate the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of another — (applause) — where
crimes against humanity are committed with impunity; where a country
with imperialist ambitions can go unchecked.  
   
Our response to the Russian invasion is a demonstration of our
collective commitment to uphold international rules and norms.  Rules
and norms which, since the end of World War Two, have provided
unprecedented security and prosperity not only for the American people,
not only for the people of Europe, but people around the world.  
   
Principles that state that sovereign nations have a right to peacefully
exist, that borders must not be changed by force, that there are
inalienable human rights which governments must respect, and that the
rule of law must be preserved.  
   
Indeed, this moment has tested our willingness to defend and uphold
these rules and norms.  And we have remained strong, and we must stay
strong.  Because if Putin were to succeed with his attack on these
fundamental principles, other nations could feel emboldened to follow
his violent example.  Other authoritarian powers could seek to bend the
world to their will through coercion, disinformation, and even brute
force.  The international order upon which we all rely could be at
risk.  
   
So, in the interest of global security and prosperity, one of our
defining missions is to uphold international rules-based order.  And
nations around the world agree.  
   
Consider, more than 140 countries voted at the United Nations to condemn
Russia’s aggression and to support Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial
integrity in defense of the core principles of the U.N. Charter.   
   
Of course, we have also seen nations like North Korea and Iran send
weapons in support of Russia’s brutal war.   
   
We are also troubled that Beijing has deepened its relationship with
Moscow since the war began.  
   
Looking ahead, any steps by China to provide lethal support to Russia
would only reward aggression, continue the killing, and further
undermine a rules-based order.  
   
Again, the United States will continue to strongly support Ukraine.  And
we will do so for as long as it takes.   
   
The American people, you see, are in awe of the resolve of the people of
Ukraine, in awe of their resilience and righteousness, their willingness
to fight for freedom and liberty, and the extraordinary tenacity and
leadership of President Zelenskyy.  
   
In fact, joining me in Munich are distinguished members of the United
States Congress.  Republicans and Democrats.  Members of the House of
Representatives and the United States Senate.   And they are here
together because they understand the stakes.  
   
The leadership of these members has been vital to America’s support of
Ukraine.  And President Biden and I know that their support for Ukraine
will continue.  
   
We also know Ukraine will continue to be supported by a united
transatlantic community.  (Applause.)  
   
So, Putin thought he could divide NATO.  Remember where we were a year
ago.  In this, he has failed.  
   
The NATO Alliance is stronger now than ever before, and the United
States commitment to NATO and to its Article 5 is ironclad.  
   
Just look at our track record over the past year.  Just look at our
multilateral cooperation.  Together, we have provided historic
assistance to Ukraine.  Together, we have dealt Russia a strategic
failure.  Together, we have imposed unprecedented cost on Russia.  And
together, we have pursued energy security and reinvested in our
collective defense.  
   
And we have come together to stand for our common values and our common
interests and our common humanity.  I have no doubt that this unity will
endure.  
   
I also have no illusions about the path forward.  There will be more
dark days in Ukraine.  The daily agony of war will persist.  
   
The global ripple effects will continue to be felt by countries near and
far — from Africa, to Southeast Asia, to the Caribbean.   
   
But if Putin thinks he can wait us out, he is badly mistaken.  Time is
not on his side.  
   
To be sure, Ukrainians will continue to be tried and tested, just as
they have been over this past year.  Transatlantic unity will continue
to be tried and tested.  And I am certain that Ukraine will rise to the
task, that the United States and Europe will rise to the task.  
   
So, my last point: America will continue our leadership in defense of
human dignity, in defense of rules and norms, and in defense of freedom
and liberty.  There is too much at stake to do anything less.  
   
Americans know well the meaning of independence.  We believe in the
fundamental importance of sovereignty and rule of law.  And we will
always stand on the side of justice.  
   
Colleagues, I do believe we all know when future generations look back
at this moment, they will see that we understood the task before us and
rose to the occasion.  
   
And so, to you I say: The United States of America is proud to be your
partner in this noble pursuit.  
   
Thank you.  (Applause.)  
   
AMBASSADOR HEUSGEN:  Madam Vice President, thank you for this very, very
strong speech, this commitment to transatlantic unity, this commitment
to the support of Ukraine.  And we have many, many representatives from
Ukraine here in the room, and they certainly were reassured by what you
have said.  
   
Let me ask you: You confirmed this U.S. support, but we all know next
year the United States will enter into an election campaign.  We are in
a democracy.  We know which side of the aisle the result will be.  How
sure are you that — or certain are you that what you have said that
Putin, who wants to wait us out, that in the end he will not succeed?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Christoph.  As I said, I believe and I
believe the American people understand the stakes.  And the stakes being
our moral interest and our strategic interest.  
   
I will tell you, I travel around the United States, and I have seen the
Ukrainian flag fly in places most of you have probably never heard of in
the United States: in store fronts — (applause) — in front of homes,
people proudly wearing — Americans proudly wearing the colors of
Ukraine.  The American people are aware of the images of Bucha.   
   
The American people take great pride in a fight for independence — that
being part of the foundation of our nation and in our principles and
values.   
   
I think about where the United States is going on this issue based on
the track record of where we’ve been.  You only have to look at where we
were a year ago and where we are today, in terms of the contributions
and resources that America has put into everything from ammunition to
artillery to air defense, from Stingers to Abram tanks, HIMARS,
Javelins.  
   
I look at it in the context of the United States Congress, which is here
in force.  I’m told it is the largest delegation, bipartisan and
bicameral, of the United States Congress to this meeting — to this
Munich Security Conference.  (Applause.)  
   
And how forward the United States Congress, in a bipartisan way, has
been in terms of the track record of our support just over the last
year, not to mention in a — it’s a technical term called an “omnibus” in
our budgetary processes — but at the end of last year, dedicating
another $45 billion for this upcoming year to support Ukraine.  
   
Our priority is to ensure Ukraine’s strength on the battlefield, and
that is our commitment.  And it is a commitment not only to the people
of Ukraine, but it is a commitment to our values and the principles we
hold dear as a nation.  And I cannot be here without also mentioning the
importance of the Alliance: Europe and what it has done; our host,
Germany.   
   
I was with Chancellor Scholz yesterday.  What we collectively have done
— we are not only joined, I think, by our values and our understanding
of the stakes and what is at stake in terms of a moral and a strategic
interest, we have been great colleagues in terms of pooling our
resources, coordinating our resources in a way that I believe will give
Ukraine the best support they need to fight this fight.  
   
AMBASSADOR HEUSGEN:  Well, thank you.  Thank you very much for this.   
   
And for the outsiders, it is indeed the impression that this
relationship — this transatlantic relationship; the relationship also
between European, the German government, and the U.S. administration —
is as strong as ever.  And thank you very much for — for this.  
   
If I may, nevertheless, there is something called IRA.  And —  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yes, the Inflation Reduction Act.   
   
AMBASSADOR HEUSGEN:  And it has raised a lot of concern on this side of
the Atlantic.  But we have been reminded also by members of Congress
about CBAM on our side.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  
   
AMBASSADOR HEUSGEN:  How do we prevent transatlantic rifts on very
important questions?  Business, trade issues are very important.  How
confident are you that these differences can be overcome and don’t
disturb this wonderful, but absolutely necessary, close transatlantic
relationship?   
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I’m very happy that you chose to raise this topic. 
So let me start with the spirit and the intent behind the Inflation
Reduction Act.   
   
One very important area of focus for us has been to address and take our
responsibility for what we must do in terms of the climate crisis,
which, of course, is global in nature.  And so — and, in fact, our
friends in Europe have been asking for years that we would actually step
up and do more.   
   
So under President Biden’s leadership, we are proud that — that the
United States has invested an historic amount in what we must do to take
on our role of responsibility in the climate crisis.  And by that, I
mean we have, with the support of Congress, dedicated $370 billion to
this effort.  
   
When I think of the impact on our friends, and the interconnection and
interdependence, if you will, between whatever we do in each of our — in
any of our nations and the effect on the others, we think of this
investment as having a global impact in predominantly two ways.   
   
One, the United States — I’d say this, sadly — is one of the biggest
emitters in the world.  And we need to reduce our emissions not only for
the sake of the health and wellbeing of the people of our own country,
but, as we know, the people of the world are impacted.  So this is a
historic and very significant investment to actually turn the tide on
that.   
   
And as you know, as many of our European friends and others around the
globe have done, we have set strict standards for ourselves based on
timelines.  So there is that, which is the goal of reducing
emissions.   
   
The other piece of it is: We are very excited about thinking about the
investment that we are making to spur innovation.  We are entering a
moment where we are creating a new economy, a clean energy economy.  And
if you think of us as being an investor, if you will, in creating
incentives for the private sector for scientists and academics to
research, develop, and innovate around a clean energy economy, this
investment that we are making will do that and have global impact.  So
that is how we think of it.  
   
But to your point, there are also issues that we need to address and do
that in close consultation with our friends around the world.  We have
created a task force — the United States-EU Task Force — closely
coordinating and in consultation around working out some of the specific
concerns.  And those conversations are continuing.   
   
I met with President Macron yesterday and Chancellor Scholz.  And I
think we are seeing some progress there, and the work will continue.   
   
AMBASSADOR HEUSGEN:  Well, thank you for this reaffirmation, because we
don’t need these quarrels at that time.  
   
If time allows, one last question, if I may.   
   
This Munich Security Conference is, of course, dedicated to Ukraine, to
the support of Ukraine, to confirm the transatlantic Alliance, but we
have widened the participation this year.  We have invited a record
number of representatives from the so-called “Global South,” because
while we have this unity between us, when you talk to representatives of
the Global South — and we had them on the podium this morning — you see
that many countries sit on the fence.  They see this as kind of a
continuation of the conflict between U.S. and Russia or NATO and EU and
— or European countries and Russia, and they feel the consequences.  And
they want to get it over with.  They have an equidistant position
there.  And why we had — and you pointed to the 141 votes.  
   
But when you talk to important partners in the Global South, they are —
they abstain.  They, you know, say, “Get it over with.  We don’t want to
take — take one side.”  And the point we’re making, of course, is this
is not East-West; this is about the rules-based inter- — the rule of law
that you mentioned.  But we have to do some convincing, because our
track record is also not the best.   
   
So what can we do together to win over those countries that continue to
sit on the fence?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, we have to treat them as partners.  
   
And you and I talked about this briefly as we were walking in, and I
thanked you — and I will thank you in front of the friends — for
bringing this issue to the stage and making it a part of the agenda for
this conference.  I agree it is an important subject.   
   
And I have met with many African leaders, leaders in the Caribbean,
CARICOM, and in Southeast Asia.  And what I believe is that they are
right to want to make sure their voices are heard on every level on this
topic, including the impact to their nations.  
   
You look at, for example, African nations and what Russia’s aggression
in Ukraine has meant in terms of food insecurity, energy insecurity. 
And these are nations, as we know, that are great importers of food and
energy.  So when the supply decreases, it has a significant impact on
their nations.  So I think it is important for us to recognize the
impact that Russia’s war has had on these nations.  
   
I think of it in the context of what we must do to also — on the
previous discussion — consider the impact to the climate crisis — of the
climate crisis on those nations.  We are some of the biggest emitters,
and the impacts are clear.   
   
I meet with CARICOM nations — so, island nations in the Caribbean — and
they tell me about how they’re seeing land erosion; how they are seeing,
through the extreme climate occurrences, a reduction in tourism and what
that means in terms of a depletion of their GN- — GDP.   
   
And so these are issues that we must keep in mind when we — when we have
this discussion with them as partners around what the solutions look
like, including standing in a unified way on these principles of
sovereignty and territorial integrity.   
   
My friend, the President of Ghana, I believe spoke yesterday, and I
think he captured it well when — I’m going to paraphrase — but my
understanding is he said that we need to dispense with this paradigm
that is about “us versus them” and think differently about the
relationship that we have.   
   
And for all of those reasons, I thank you for raising this, and I think
it is worthy of the type of elevation and the discussion that you are
giving it.  
   
AMBASSADOR HEUSGEN:  Thank you.  Thank you very much for this.  And this
will remain a theme here.  We’ll discuss this also next year.  And
maybe, Madam Vice President, can we already booked a hotel room so you
come back next year?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  
   
AMBASSADOR HEUSGEN:  Thank you for being here.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  (Applause.)
