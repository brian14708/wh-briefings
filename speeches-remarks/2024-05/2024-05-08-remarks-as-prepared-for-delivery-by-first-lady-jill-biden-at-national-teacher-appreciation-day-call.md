Happy National Teacher Appreciation Week!

I made you a promise: that as long as Joe is President, you will always
have a seat at the table. And I meant it.

Because being an educator isn’t just a job. It’s a calling. All of you
were called to this profession for a reason. You believe that a better
world is possible – and you make that world real, one student at a time.

And none of that could happen without the support of our unions.

In classrooms and hallways and cafeterias, in front of eager faces
during that Friday afternoon chaos, it may sometimes feel like we’re all
alone. But our union leaders show us that we’re never alone – that
behind each of us are thousands of educators in schools across the
country united through a common devotion to our students. I’m grateful
for all that they do for educators – and our students.

So, I’m honored to introduce, Becky Pringle and Randi Weingarten.

Thank you, Randi and Becky.

Right now, we’re in the last stretch of the school year – maybe for some
of you those last few days are just ahead or you’re in the final months.

I just finished final exams last Thursday and posted grades. And I know
that many of you probably still have final projects, exams, and
tabulating ahead. As days get longer and warm breezes begin to waft
through the air, butterflies and bees buzz outside. But, inside, those
warm days mean restless morning bus rides and distracted minds.
Boisterous cafeterias and unruly hallways. Hearts that long for the
freedom of summer.

And that’s just the teachers.

But there are magical parts of this time of year too. In the day-to-day,
we don’t always recognize how much this work matters. But, at the end of
a school year, we get to see how much students have grown. And how much
they’ve taught us – and our whole school community – as well. You can
see that in every parent’s smile of relief when they see you, every
child’s look of wonder when you show them all they can do.

So, I wanted to personally let you know how grateful the President and I
are for your incredible work.

To answer this call of service, is in itself, an act of hope. You look
at your students and don’t just see who they are today – you see all the
possibility of tomorrow. You help them find the light within themselves.

And that light lives on in all of you. Have a great summer.
