Palmer House  
Chicago, Illinois

5:16 P.M. CDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.  
   
Bob and Jane, thank you very much for hosting us, and thank you for that
introduction.  And most of all, thanks for your friendship and
partnership, and thank you for your support in this campaign and the
convention.   
   
I understand there’s going to be a convention in Chicago.  We’re excited
to come back to Chicago.   
   
Look, we’re into the spring — as we move into spring, we genuinely feel
I — a genuine excitement about the momentum and the excitement of this
campaign.  So far, we have 1.6 million individual contributors, 97
percent — 550,000 more than last time out and additionally — (applause)
— and 97 percent of them contributed less than 200 bucks.  They’re
monthly contributors.   
   
It matters, and it shows a genuine enthusiasm.  I don’t think anybody
has ever done that before.   
   
And we’re — we’re ramping up campaign headquarters and field offices,
hiring staff across the country, and — ahead of Trump’s MAGA
Republicans.  And we — you know, while we — the press doesn’t write
about it, the momentum is clearly in our favor.  All the polls moving
toward us and not — and away from Trump.  The lat- — the latest one, we
have up six points.   
   
I just came from Wisconsin, where the latest Quinnipiac Poll is — has us
ahead six points among registered voters.   
   
But the truth is, I don’t think any of the polls matter very — this
early around because it’s hard to get a good poll these days.  You know,
to be able to call someone on a cell phone and get them to answer — most
people don’t have hardlines anymore.  It takes a — you know, sometimes
30, 40 calls to get one person to answer.   
   
So, you know, we were just in Wisconsin to announce a $3 billion
investment from Microsoft to build a data center in Racine and power
artificial intelligence systems, probably the most significant
technological breakthrough in human history, and it has some potent- —
enormous potential for good and some potential for not so good.   
   
It’s being built on the same site that Trump promised Foxconn was going
to build and invest $10 billion in manufacturing — 10 billion.  Trump
showed up for that groundbreaking with literally gold shovels.  I mean,
the shovels were gold.  Okay?  And he promises they’re going to build
the “eighth wonder of the world.”   
   
Give me a break.  (Laughter.)  
   
He dug a hole, and he fell into it.  (Laughter.)  He just keeps digging
and digging more holes.  
   
You know, look, Trump’s trouble and — is in trouble, and he knows it. 
And, you know, after bragging about the reason Roe v. Wade was
overturned was because of him, he’s now worried the voters are going to
hold him accountable for what he said — I don’t know why we’d do that,
hold him accountable for what he said — and for all the cruelty and
chaos that’s been created as a consequence.   
   
You know, well, we have news for Trump: The voters are going to hold him
accountable.   
   
Trump did a long interview with Time Magazine.  Some of you may have
seen it.  And it’s on the cover, so please read it.  His words, not
mine.  He says states should monitor women’s pregnancies and prosecute
those who violate the ban.  Monitor.   
   
And that’s not all.  He said, “A lot of people liked what I did” with
the — meaning with regard to his Time Magazine interview, as well as
saying that he was responsible for Roe v. Wade being overruled.   
   
He uses phrases like — and I’m not making this up.  You can read it in
Time.  You can read it anywhere on the — online.  He said he’d be a
dictator on “day one.”  Asked if he thought violence would occur if he
lost, Trump said, “It depends.”  They asked him whether he’d accept the
results of this election.  He said, “It depends.”  “It depends.”  He
can’t understand how it could possibly be a result unless the — that he
could support unless he won.   
   
He calls the insurrectionists who are in prison — he calls them
“patriots.”  And if reelected, he says, “I will pardon every one of
them.”  Trump says that when he loses again in November — and that’s my
phrase — (laughter) — if he loses again in November, there’ll be a
“bloodbath” — a “bloodbath.”  
   
And he said a whole lot more.  But the bad news is he means what he
says.  He means what he says.  Unless you think I’m kidding, just think
back to the 6th of January.  This guy means what he says.   
   
But, look, chaos is nothing new for Trump.  His presidency was chaos. 
Trump is trying to make the — the country forget about the dark and
unsettling things that he did when he was president.  Well, we’re going
to not let them forget.   
   
We’ll never forget him lying about the pandemic, telling people it
wasn’t really that serious.  And saying all you got to do is inject a
little bit of bleach in your system.  I mean, for real.  That’s har- —
if you didn’t know about it, you’d think I — I mean, it’d be — but if I
did this in a campaign 10 years ago, they’d commit me.  (Laughter.)  
   
I mean, look, and that bleach he didn’t inject in his body; he just put
it in his hair.  (Laughter and applause.)  But, look, he’s got more hair
than I do.  (Laughter.)  
   
And we’ll never forget his love letters to Kim Jong Un of North Korea
and his admiration for Putin, telling him, “Just do what you need to do
if people aren’t moving your way.”    
   
And here’s what he said in that Time article: He may not come to the aid
of an ally, if attacked, in Europe or Asia, if he felt they weren’t
paying their fair share of their defense — would not come to their aid. 
Again, not my words.  You can read them in Time Magazine — quotes from
him.   
   
And I don’t think anybody wants to go back to that.  And I think we just
got to remember — remind people what’s going on.  
   
Look how far we’ve come.  We’ve created 15 million new jobs, a record
number of jobs in a three — three-quarter-year period of any president
in American history.  More people have health insurance today than ever
before in history in our country.  We took on Big Pharma, and we won,
lowering prescription drug costs for insulin for 35 bucks instead of 400
a month, and so much more that’s written into the law that’s going to be
coming into effect.   
   
For example, in 2025, no senior is going to be in a position to have to
pay more than $20,000 for their entire bills, if, in fact — I mean,
$2,000, if, in fact, you’re in a situation where you have a
$15,000-a-year cancer drug you have to take.  Nobody.  
   
We made the most significant investment in climate ever –ever, ever,
ever.   
   
I signed the most significant gun safety law in 30 years.   
   
I could go on, but the point is this: We’re lowering costs.  We’re
expanding opportunities and protecting freedoms.  It’s all at stake.   
   
Trump is still determined to terminate the Affordable Care Act.  He
tried 51 times.  He says he’s going to do it again.  That’s going to
have a profound — profound impact on people.   
   
I forget how — I have it in my — I don’t want to give the press here —
give the wrong number.  But if I’m not mistaken, we’re talking about
millions of people who, in fact, would not have insurance, because —
guess what? — you’re in a situation where you have to — if you have a
preexisting condition, you can’t get covered by most policies,
especially if you don’t have the money to pay a lot for the policies. 
But I could go on.   
   
Look, the reason why he wants to do away with the Amer- — the Affordable
Care Act is because it was Obamacare.  He can’t stand the idea of
associating himself with anything that had to do with Barack.   
   
He’s determined to get rid of the climate law.  We’re spending $369
billion on making climate change — for the first time in the history of
the world — the world — not — not in the United States, in the world,
we’re in a situation, as some of you well know, that we’re going to be
in a position to make significant changes.   
   
Because — and — and he wants — he wants to know why he — everybody wants
to know why he hates the — deal- — dealing with climate change.  Well,
first of all, he says — he knows that Big Oil doesn’t like it.  And he
says his plan for next time around is: drill, baby, drill, drill, drill,
drill.   
   
He’s determined to cut taxes.  I’m all for cutting taxes.  I made a
commitment no one und- — making under $400,000 a year would see a penny
of their federal tax go up, and I’ve kept that commitment and will.   
   
But he — you know, there’s a — we have a th- — now we have a thousand
billionaires in America.  I’m a capitalist.  That’s good if you can make
a billion bucks.  Just start to pay a little bit of your fair share.   
   
Guess what?  You know what the average federal rate of — tax rate is for
a billionaire?  8.3 percent.  Anybody want to trade that tax rate for
any — but all kidding aside, 8.3 percent.   
   
If we just moved to 25 percent — not an exorbitant amount — 25 percent,
it would raise $400 billion over the next 10 years.   
   
Imagine what could be done.  Imagine what could be done, from
eliminating a significant portion of the federal debt, all the way down
to making sure that we have childcare — a whole range of things.   
   
Look, but at the same time, he makes no excuse about wanting to cut
Social Security and Medicare.  And he — and he could so much other
damage.   
   
Look, I proposed the most comprehensive immigration reform in decades,
while Trump says immigrants are the — “poisoning the blood of America.” 
Well, I wonder how many of us would be here if that was the case when
our forefathers came — when our folks came.  He says the biggest threat
— the biggest threat is these — these criminals coming across the
border.   
   
Well, folks, the biggest threat is Trump’s — the one he poses to our
democracy.  And above all, what’s at risk in ‘24 are our freedoms, our
democracy.  
   
Look, let me close this.  This an election about competing values and
competing visions of America.  Trump’s values and visions are one of
anger, hate, revenge, and retribution.  “I will be your retribution.” 
“I will be your” —  
   
You know, I have a very different set of values that leads me in a
different direction for America, one of hope and one of optimism. 
(Applause.)  No, I mean it.  
   
I see an America where we defend democracy, not diminish it.  I see an
America where we protest and protect our freedoms when they’re — attempt
to be taken away and where we restore Roe v. Wade again as the law of
the land.   
   
I see an America where every — the economy grows from the middle out and
the bottom up, because that’s — when that works, everybody does well;
the wealth- — the wealthy still do well, and everybody does well — we
got a fighting chance — where working people finally have a fair shot;
where healthcare becomes a right, not a privilege; where we make insulin
affordable for everybody in America, capping prescription drug costs at
2,000 bucks a year for all — all — to all drugs.  
   
I can jump you on Air Force One with me as we leave here, and you have a
prescription from any American drug company, and you say — and how much
it would cost in your local pharmacy.  I can take you — you name the
country; you name the city.  I’ll take you to Toronto, Berlin, Belgium,
and Bel- — I could take it to — to Rome, to — and you’re going to be
able to get the same exact prescription for somewhere between 40 to 60
percent less.  
   
I see a future where we see the rest of the world as a dependable —
we’re seen by the rest of the world as a dependable and reliable
ally.   
   
Look what he’s saying.  He’s telling people just — if, in fact, you
don’t like what’s going on, he tells — straight up with Putin, he tells
it, but he talks about it in the world: If you don’t like what’s going
on in another country and you want to invade another country, if they
haven’t paid their share of what I consider necessary for their defense,
have at it.  
   
I see a future where we keep our pledge to cut carbon emissions in half
by 2030, lead the way in saving the planet in the climate crisis.  I see
a future where we rid our country of gun violence and ban assault
weapons again, and this time for real.  
   
Folks, this election really is about democracy.  It’s about democracy. 
It’s about freedom.  It’s about America.  That’s why I so badly need
you.  
   
We know we can do this together.  I’ve never been more optimistic about
our future.  (Applause.)  
   
We just have to remember who in the hell we are.  I really mean it. 
This is the United States of America.  We’re the only country in the
world that’s co- — come out of every crisis we’ve faced stronger than we
went in — every single one in our history.  Not another country can say
that.   
   
There’s nothing beyond our capacity.  There really is not a single thing
beyond our capacity as a nation when we do it together — when we
actually do it together, compromise, and get things done.   
   
So, folks, I’m confident we’re going to do well in this election but, in
no la- — small part, because of all of you.  You put me in a position to
be able to run this campaign in a way that is going to be able to make
the cases that need to be made to the American people.   
   
And as you well know, the American people usually don’t really begin to
hard focus in elections until sometime into the spr- — into the fall.   
   
But we’re setting up, as I said, our infrastructure we’re putting
together as a campaign.  He hasn’t — Trump hasn’t even opened a single
major office in any state.  He hasn’t moved at all.   
   
And so, I think we’re — I think we’re going to be in good shape but, in
large part, because of all of you.  
   
So, thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thanks,
everybody.  Appreciate it.
