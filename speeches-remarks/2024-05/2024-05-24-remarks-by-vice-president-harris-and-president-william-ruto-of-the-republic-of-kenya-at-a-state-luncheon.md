*U.S. State Department  
Washington, D.C.*

1:10 P.M. EDT  
   
     VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Good
afternoon.  
   
     I — I will start, of course, by thanking our extraordinary
Secretary Blinken.  You have been traveling the world at record pace. 
That you are standing still at this moment is an extraordinary feat —
(laughter) — given all you do.  
   
     SECRETARY BLINKEN:  It’s the Kenyan coffee.  (Laughter.)  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And it’s the Kenyan coffee.  But on behalf of
our country, I thank you, Tony Blinken, for all that you are.  Thank
you.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  
   
     And the Second Gentleman and I are honored to host this luncheon
with you and Ms. Evan Ryan and to welcome President Ruto and Mrs. Ruto. 
And to all of our distinguished guests — members of Congress, leaders in
every sector of our society –welcome and thank you for your work and the
partnership.  
   
     So, I strongly believe that African ideas and innovations will have
a significant impact on the future of the entire world — a belief driven
in part by the extraordinary creativity, dynamism, and energy of young
African leaders on a continent where, many of you may know, the median
age is 19; on a continent where one in four people who occupy space on
Mother Earth will be by the year 2050.  (Applause.)  
   
     And fueled, then, by that sense of optimism, last year, I had the
good pleasure of visiting the continent for a weeklong trip.  And it
turns out, it’s the longest I’ve spent on foreign soil since I’ve been
vice president.  (Laughter and applause.)   
   
     The goal of the trip — thank you.  The goal of the trip was to
highlight and strengthen our partnerships in government, in business,
and in the civil society; to increase private-sector investment; to
revise — to revise and upgrade the U.S.-Africa narrative, which is long
overdue; and to bring fresh focus to the innovation and ingenuity that
is so prevalent across the continent of Africa.   
   
     There, at an incubator, I met with tech entrepreneurs who are
taking small businesses online and strengthening supply chains.  I
convened young musicians and artists whose Afrobeats are influencing
music around the globe.  (Applause.)  I visited with climate activists,
farmers, women small-business owners, and students.  
   
     And at the end of that trip, I was more convinced than ever: The
continent of Africa represents the future of our world.  (Applause.) 
And I will add: Any leader that ignores the continent of Africa is doing
so at their own peril.  (Applause.)   
   
     Which brings me to Kenya, Mr. President.  No country on the
continent more embodies this spirit of innovation than Kenya.  Kenya, as
many here know, has Silicon Savannah, a $1 billion technology ecosystem
confronting challenges that range from the climate crisis to financial
inclusion to healthcare.  
   
     To address wealth inequity, innovators at M-PESA help low-income
people pay and repay microloans, and they have revolutionized the mobile
payments industry.   
   
     To help solve the problem and challenge of pollution coming from
plastics and to address threats to marine ecosystems, a Kenyan startup
now converts aquatic invasive plants into biodegradable plastic.   
   
     To tackle water security and, in particular, scarcity and drought,
a Kenyan startup now turns humidity from the air into clean drinking
water.   
   
     To help his deaf niece communicate, a Kenyan data scientist
invented a smart glove to convert sign language into audible speech
through a mobile app.  (Applause.)   
   
     And to — and to make healthcare more accessible and affordable, AI
is now being used for medical image scans and chatbots are providing
healthcare advice.  
   
     President Ruto, innovation has flourished under your leadership. 
You and I just left a fireside chat at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
Your leadership has been extraordinary.  And as I shared with you, with
our Ambassador Whitman: You really, as a leader, symbolize the
importance of the partnership between the United States and the
continent.   
   
     You ran, Mr. President, on a platform of promoting entrepreneurship
and strengthening your economy.  You have spoken powerfully about the
need to bridge the digital divide and that innovation will drive
economic growth.  Your work and this visit reinforces the point that
African ideas and African innovation will help shape the future of the
world.  The partnership between the United States and Kenya is grounded
in shared values and a shared vision for the future.  
   
We are grateful, Mr. President, for your commitment to democracy, your
commitment to take bold action on the climate crisis, your commitment to
broad-based economic growth, and your commitment to support global
security and stability — most recently, through Kenya’s leadership to
help stabilize Haiti.  
   
The fates of the American people and the Kenyan people are
intertwined.  
   
Secretary Blinken just spoke about Tom Mboya and the airlift.  I will
add: In 1959, when Mboya was in the United States gathering support for
the airlift, he joined in a march with American civil rights activists. 
Just blocks from here — just blocks from here, he spoke about our shared
struggle for political freedom, economic opportunity, and human
dignity.  And these 65 years later, I stand proud to acknowledge your
leadership, Mr. President, of these same principles.   
   
Later on that trip, Mboya was invited to Atlanta — I see the former
mayor here — by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  There, as they stood
together, Dr. King said, and I quote, “Our struggle is not an isolated
struggle.  We are all,” he said, “caught in an inescapable network of
mutuality.”   
   
So, to you, President Ruto, just as it was then and even more so today,
our people are interconnected and interdependent.   
   
And so, I will raise a glass and ask all to join.  To the U.S.-Kenya
partnership and in celebration of our network of mutuality.  
   
(Vice President Harris offers a toast.)  
   
Mr. President, cheers.  
   
And now I invite President Ruto to share a toast.  Thank you. 
(Applause.)  
   
PRESIDENT RUTO:  Madam Vice President, Secretary Blinken, distinguished
ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.  
   
AUDIENCE:  Good afternoon.  
   
PRESIDENT RUTO:  It gives me tremendous pleasure to come back to this
great building.  I was here two years ago.  And today, in my state visit
to the United States, we meet again to celebrate 60 years of
relationship between two friendly nations, the United States and
Kenya.  
   
Our relationship, based on a firm foundation of the values we share and
believe in — values of freedom, democracy, rule of law, inclusivity, and
equality — they were as present and meaningful many years ago; they are
so today.  
   
And as I come to the conclusion of this state visit, I am persuaded
beyond any doubt that the relationship between the United States and
Kenya and Africa is now onto a new pedestal.  (Applause.)   
   
I thank President Biden in a very special way for helping us reshape,
reengineer, and write a new narrative for our continent.   
   
We all believe in a Nigerian proverb that says, “Until the lion learned
to write, all stories favored the hunter.”  (Laughter and applause.)  
   
We have decided that we are going to write our own story.  And we are —
(applause) — and we started this last year, when I convened the
first-ever Africa Climate Summit.  The conversation, the narrative has
always been this continent of conflict, trouble, disease, poverty.  Yet,
that is not the story of Africa.   
   
Africa is a continent of tremendous opportunity: the largest reserves of
energy — renewable energy resources; 60 percent of the world’s arable,
uncultivated land; 30 percent of mineral wealth — global mineral wealth,
including those that are necessary for energy transition; the youngest
continent, which will produce 40 percent of the world’s worki- — working
— or workforce by 2050 and where a quarter of the world’s population
will be living, providing the world’s biggest single market.   
   
In short, Africa is a rich continent and a continent of opportunity.
 (Applause.)  
   
I am very happy that President Biden and this visit is giving us the
opportunity to rewrite and recalibrate the relationship between this
great superpower and our continent.  
   
And I am very proud that among the things we’ve agreed are not just
about Kenya and the U.S., it’s about Kenya and the continent of Africa —
from what we are doing around climate action; what we are doing around
the financial architecture of the world to make it fairer, to make it
much more sensitive, to make it much more agile, and to make it possible
for many African countries and those in the Global South — many
developing countries to access concessional resources for us to manage
the affairs of our people, and that no country will spend more money on
paying debt or on managing climate-induced crisis than they do on
spending on health, education, or social service.  (Applause.)  
   
I must commend the leadership of the United States — President Biden and
the many other leaders I met at the Hill, including the Black Caucus,
including the leadership — the joint leadership of the House and the
Senate.  And all of them shared the same views with us that it’s time
for a new relationship — to build a new relationship between our
continent and the United States as we encourage the United States to
take leadership on making sure that, together, we can have a freer, a
safer, a healthier, and a much more prosperous con- — globe for all of
us.   
   
Finally, we discussed many issues that today I find will give us new
opportunities, will open new frontiers, and will enlarge the horizon for
collaboration in making sure that we deal with the challenges that we
all face of insecurity, of stability, challenges of debt and other
financial challenges, but also give ourselves the opportunity to explore
the tremendous opportunities that exist for collaboration in ex- — in
exploiting our huge reserves and assets, using our human capital, and
connecting assets that we have in our continent to technologies from the
U.S., to financial results from the U.S., and creating a win-win outcome
that works for the U.S., works for Kenya, and works globally for all
humanity.  
   
I thank you.  (Applause.)   
   
Let me request you to raise our glasses as I propose a toast to the
long-lasting relationship, the good health, prosperous engagement,
stability, and prosperity for the people of the United States and the
people of Kenya.  
   
Cheers.  
   
(President Ruto offers a toast.)
