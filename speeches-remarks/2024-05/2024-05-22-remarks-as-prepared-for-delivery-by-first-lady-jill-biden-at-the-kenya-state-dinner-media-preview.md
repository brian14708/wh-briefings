The Cross Hall

Tomorrow night, we mark the 60th anniversary of the United States’
partnership with Kenya with an elegant dinner under the stars, in a
pavilion made almost entirely of glass, looking up at our one sky. 

While, outside, night surrounds us, inside, guests will be brought
together over the glow of candles, in a space saturated with warm pinks
and reds.

The night will feature special performances to honor President and First
Lady Ruto’s love of Gospel and Country music: the amazing Howard Gospel
Choir and the incredible Brad Paisley.

As guests leave, their path illuminated by our one moon, I hope they
will be filled with that same warmth I felt on my visits to Kenya – that
of a friendship that will endure, helping create a shining and
prosperous tomorrow.

Every detail of this State Dinner has been thoughtfully planned by so
many people from across our government – Joe and I could not have asked
for a better team. And, I am once again grateful for Bryan Rafanelli’s
brilliance and partnership.

Finally, to bring some of tomorrow’s hospitality to today – we will
share with all of you a little taste of the meal our incredible chefs
are preparing for the guests.

Now, please welcome, our Social Secretary, Carlos Elizondo.
