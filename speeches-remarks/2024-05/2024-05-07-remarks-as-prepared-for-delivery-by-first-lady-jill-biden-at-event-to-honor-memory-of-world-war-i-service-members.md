  \ Memory of World War I Service\_Members"

The East Room

Welcome to the White House!

“They were mortal, but they were unconquerable.” Those are the words
etched into the stone of the National World War I Memorial.

Through DC’s wilting heat and beating rain, the memorial shares the
echoes of our history, of the heroes – who gave their all so that others
could be free, for the hope that our world could know peace. That spirit
lives on in the service members who returned, and the families who
served alongside them.

The spouses and children left on our shores, who watched a piece of
their hearts walk away, who waited – with love and hope – for their
service members to come home. I know so many in this room are part of
that legacy – have family who served in World War I. America will always
remember your family’s sacrifice. And now, we can honor it for the world
to see in our nation’s front yard, because of all of you.

Military spouses and children may not wear the uniform, but they serve
our country too. That was true a century ago and it’s true now.

That’s why I started *Joining Forces*, my White House initiative to
support military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors.

The Bidens are a military family. My father was a Navy Signalman in
World War II. And our son, Major Beau Biden, served for a year in Iraq
as part of the Delaware Army National Guard. So, this is personal to us.

I know so many of you have worked long and hard to bring this memorial
to Washington. Your work commemorates a generation who changed our world
with their courage and sacrifice. And as we stand before the rippling
water and lines of soldiers, we feel our history weaving with our
present, stitching us to something greater than we are alone.

As your First Lady, as a military mom and military daughter, with all my
heart, thank you.

Now, please welcome, someone who has put so much heart and hard work
into making this memorial possible, Chairman Hamby.
