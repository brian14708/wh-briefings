Cabinet Room

4:42 P.M. EDT

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, hello, everyone.  Welcome to the Cabinet Room. 
Welcome.  And it’s great to see you all.  
   
We got some important meeting and business to do in a minute.  But I do
want to kick it off with one comment: Thank you, thank you, thank you,
thank you.   
   
You know, first, I want to thank you for your leadership.  I know it’s —
I may not look it, but I’ve seen it for a while.  I’ve been arou- — I
know I don’t look like I’ve been around very long.  I know that part. 
But — but never before have I seen the nation ask so much of our
military in so many parts of the world at the same time.   
   
In Europe, you’re equipping and training Ukrainian troops as they defend
their freedom against Russia’s vicious onslaught.   
   
In Africa, you’re working with our partners to take terrorists off the
battlefield.   
   
In the Indo-Pacific, you’re building alliances with Australia,
Philippines, Japan, and Republic of Korea and improving our relationship
with India as well and putting our nation in the strongest position we
can possibly be in.  
   
In the Middle East, you have stepped up to defend against a range of
unprecedented attacks on U.S. forces, Israel, and our partners across
the region.  
   
And I look forward to discussing — I think you’ve been remarkable.  I
look forward to discussing all these issues this afternoon.  
   
Next, I want to thank you for your commitment.  I know last year hasn’t
been easy.  I know, as you’ve faced crises abroad, you’ve also faced
unnecessary chaos here at home: polarized politics, which I’m sure
doesn’t confuse you at all, but it does me sometimes; and potential
shutdowns, performative stunts that impact on morale and readiness and
too many military families.   
   
But you keep going.  And you keep showing every person, with the most
heart to serve, you’re made up of an incredible group of men and women. 
And — and I know I’ve said it before, but I mean it — I don’t think
there’s any comparable counterargument — you’re the greatest fighting
force the world has ever seen.  And that’s a fact.  
   
And, you know, I’ve — I’ve had — I’ve had a vow since I’ve been a young
senator, and that is that, you know, we have a lot of obligations but
only one — only one overwhelming obligation: to prepare those we send
into harm’s way with all they need and to take care of them and their
families when they come home and when they don’t come home.  
   
And you’ve made progress on this front as well — over the last year, in
particular.   
   
I’m proud that, for the first time in nearly a decade, rates of sexual
assault and harassment are — within active-duty forces are down. 
They’re down.  And that’s because of your leadership.  
   
And, finally, as I said a moment ago, I know I’ve asked a lot of you but
— and everyone in this room, but I have one more request: Please pass
along my deepest thanks to all the servicemen and women under your
control and under your charge.  And I really mean it.  
   
Right now, all across the world, we’re defending our nation — they’re
defending it.  And every day, they’re risking their own safety for the
safety of their fellow citizens.   
   
So, this afternoon, I look forward to discussing a whole range of things
and how I can continue to help support your needs and what you’re doing
for us.   
   
So, I want to thank you again for being here.  And I’m going to ask the
press to leave and we get down to business.   
   
Thank you.  
   
Q    Mr. President, why debate in June?  Why do you want to debate in
June?  Are you worried about your position in the polls, sir?  
   
Q    President Biden —  
   
Q    Why do you want to debate so early, sir?  
   
Q    Did you see Trump says he’ll do a third debate?  Would you?  Why
not — why not debate a third time?  
   
Q    Are you looking forward to the debates, Mr. President?  Are you
looking forward to the debates, Mr. President?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I am. 

Come on.   
   
Q    You don’t want to debate RFK, Jr.?

THE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)
