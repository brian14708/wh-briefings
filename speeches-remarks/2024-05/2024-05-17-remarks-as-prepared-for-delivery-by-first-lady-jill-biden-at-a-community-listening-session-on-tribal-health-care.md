Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan

Thank you, Doug.

Aanii.

Chairman Lowes, President Gravelle, thank you for your kindness and your
leadership, for living the good life for your communities. And it’s so
wonderful to be here with Bryan and Liz. Joe and I are grateful to have
your voices and vision as part of our administration.

Yesterday evening, this community welcomed me with so much warmth. And I
had the opportunity to speak about my sister, and how communities can
come together to find healing and hope.

It’s an honor to be with all of you again today to talk about how each
of your communities have come together to address Tribal and rural
health.

Because your health matters.

That’s why Joe’s administration has taken historic steps to support the
incredible things that are happening at Tribal health centers like the
Sault Tribe Health Centers and the Bay Mills Health Center.

For the past two years, he’s made sure the Indian Health Service, and
the Tribal medical services it funds, can continue providing lifesaving
care without interruptions to their budget. And he is committed to
making that true every year going forward.

He’s fighting to increase the IHS budget, and make sure it’s stable and
continues growing over time, so that health systems like yours can
continue to flourish.

And Joe is honoring the Nation-to-Nation relationship – providing you
the funding and flexibility you need to design the health systems that
work for you. Because you know best what you need. And when Tribes
operate their own health systems, you make sure care meets the needs of
your community.

When people here are able to access consistent care – when they don’t
need to drive miles for treatments. When grandparents don’t have to live
in pain from an infected tooth, and mothers can get the prenatal care
they need close to home, and children can grow up knowing there’s always
someone they can talk to on their darkest days.

When lived experiences are at the center of care – it changes lives, and
saves them.

We’re here to learn about what’s working, how we can continue to be your
partners, and what we can do to support other communities who wish to do
what you have done here. 

The Second Gentleman and I are listening – and so is your President. We
are committed to working with you, so you can thrive.

Bryan?
