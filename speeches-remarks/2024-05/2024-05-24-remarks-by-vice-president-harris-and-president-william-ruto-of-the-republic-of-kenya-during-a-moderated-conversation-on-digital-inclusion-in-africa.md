*U.S. Chamber of Commerce  
Washington, D.C.*

11:57 A.M. EDT  
   
     AMBASSADOR WHITMAN:  Well, good morning — almost good afternoon —
and thank you both for joining us.  It’s really a privilege for the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce and, I think, our audience.   
   
     So, Madam Vice President, I’ll start with you if you don’t mind. 
So, you have been leader on Africa policy in the Biden-Harris
administration.  And you visited, you know — Suzanne mentioned Ghana,
Tanzania, and Zambia last year.  We missed you in Kenya.  (Laughs.)  
   
     VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  I’ll get there, I promise.  I will get
there.  
   
     AMBASSADOR WHITMAN:  And you focused specifically on investing in
innovation and investing in young people and investing in women.  
   
     VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Yes.   
   
     AMBASSADOR WHITMAN:  So, why did you take that approach?  And what
are your lasting impressions from the trip?  What did you learn that was
particularly interesting?  
   
     VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Thank you, Madam Ambassador.  And, Mr.
President, it is good to be with you on this stage.   
   
     I strongly believe that we are at a moment where we should revisit
and upgrade and update the narrative of the relationship between the
United States and the continent of Africa.   
   
     When you think about the continent, the median age is 19 years old
— 19.  It is predicted that by 2050, one in four people occupying space
on Mother Earth will be on the continent of Africa.   
   
     So, when I think of it just from that perspective, many could
rightly argue that the future is on the continent of Africa. 
(Applause.)  Yes.   
   
     I also think — and I’ll speak very candidly here — that we have to
revisit and — and revise the narrative around the relationship in a way
that appreciates that ours, the role of the United States, should not be
one of benevolence but of thinking about the relationship in the context
of partnership.   
   
     So, it is not about — simply about aid but about investment and
understanding the capacity that exists and has been proven to be strong
on the continent and therefore is worthwhile in terms of an investment,
understanding it will yield a great return on investment.   
   
     And when I think, Mr. President, in particular about your
leadership in Kenya, I think this is empirical evidence of the need — of
the imperative of the United States, through our government and private
sector, partnering with Kenyans, with the Kenyan government in a way
that recognizes the extraordinary opportunity for continued investment
writ large in innovation, thinking about what we must do as a global
community around addressing crises like the climate crisis, what we can
do through those investments that makes clear and real what we know to
be the growth that — broad-based economic growth that occurs wherever
and everywhere when you invest in women.   
   
     And then, doing that work through a partnership that also
appreciates it is good for American business to be invested in
relationships that contribute to global stability.  Global stability, of
course, results also in global economic stability.   
   
     And so, for all of these reasons, I simply believe it is the right
thing to do, not to mention the intertwined history between the
continent and our country.  But also, if we are going to be at all
forward-thinking, it is an imperative.  
   
     Frankly, as Vice President — and I say this as a devout public
servant — sadly, often our strategy around foreign policy is based on
the crisis of the moment.  And part of how I think about the future and
the imperative of the relationship with African nations is based on a
vision that public policy be formed and implemented now based on a
vision for the next 10, 20, and 50 years.   
   
     And again, that all brings me back to the continent of Africa, and
Kenya is an example of a vibrant partnership.   
   
     AMBASSADOR WHITMAN:  Great, thank you very much.  I — (applause). 
The “doing things before you have a crisis” —  
   
     VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Yeah.  
   
     AMBASSADOR WHITMAN:  — is a lot easier —  
   
     VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  How about that?  (Laughs.)  
   
     AMBASSADOR WHITMAN:  — than waiting until afterwards.   
   
     VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Yes.  
   
     AMBASSADOR WHITMAN:  Mr. President, you have been a tremendous
champion for tech and innovation in Kenya and its ability to spur
economic development and promote opportunity.  So — and also, by the
way, advancing gender equality and inclusion.  So, just love to hear
your point of view, maybe your evolving point of view on the power of
technology and what it can do for Kenya.   
   
     And for those of you who don’t know, Kenya was the dest- — the
largest destination for startup capital on the continent in 2023 — ahead
of Nigeria, ahead of South Africa, and ahead of Egypt — which is a quite
a remarkable achievement.  (Applause.)  
   
     PRESIDENT RUTO:  Thank you very much.  And thank you very much,
Vice President Kamala Harris, for finding time to engage with us in this
very important American Chamber of Commerce-Kenya meeting.   
   
     Speaking about technology and speaking about opportunities in the
technology space, three things come to my mind.  Technology is the
facility, is — is the instrument that we can use to leapfrog Africa from
where we are to the next — to catch up, if I may, with the rest of the
world.   
   
     We have the youngest population.  That young population is tech
hungry.  That young population, we have the opportunity to shape it in
the direction in which we think it should.  And that is why a country
like Kenya — we are investing 30 percent of our budget in education,
training, knowledge, skills.  We are investing $5 billion every — every
year.   
   
     And I said earlier, it — it’s money we believe is an investment
because if there is a single-most important asset that we have is our
human capital.  And as my sister Kamala said, we’re looking at the
continent that will have a quarter of the world’s population by 2050. 
Forty percent of the world’s workforce will be from the African
continent.  Therefore, it is not only about labor and, therefore, you
need the correct quality of labor, it is also about market.  The biggest
market ever will exist in the African continent.   
   
     And therefore, technology is the biggest enabler, the biggest
multiplier of what can be done.  And I — and I see it every day.  For
example, M-PESA took Kenya from a banking ratio of, I think, about 20
percent and tripled it, you know, just using technology.   
   
     Many more Kenyans, including my mother who has not been to school,
she operates M-PESA.   
   
     VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Yeah.  
   
     PRESIDENT RUTO:  She knows how to do it.   
   
     VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Right.  
   
     PRESIDENT RUTO:  You know?  So, that’s what happens to many people
in Kenya.   
   
     So, we look at technology as an enabler and as a mechanism through
which we can use the biggest resource we have in — in our young people,
and we can also use it to better deliver agriculture, health, education,
tax collection, government services.   
   
     In fact, for Kenya, we are moving all government services.  When I
came into office, we had 300 government services.  We’re now — we’ve now
moved to 17,000 government services on a digital platform, because that
is where the future is.  That’s how we can be able to efficiently
deliver government services, cost-effectively deliver government
services, accountably deliver government service.  So, accountability,
efficiency, effica- — the technology enables us to do all that much more
efficiently.   
   
     Therefore, Madam Kamala Harris, you are focused in the right
direction: on technology, digital space, young people, women.  I think
that that space is the space that will give us the greatest output as we
go into the future.   
   
     And it is, for example, the reason — just before you came in — we
have signed into a billion-dollar investment using American technology
from Microsoft, capabilities from G42 — capital resources from G42, and
renewable energy from Kenya, because Kenya has the extra asset of having
tech-savvy human capital.  G22 — G42 will tell you and Microsoft — and
I’m sure they are in this meeting —  
   
     VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  They are.  
   
     PRESIDENT RUTO:  — Microsoft will tell you —  
   
     VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Brad Smith is here.   
   
PRESIDENT RUTO:  — some of their best human capital come from Kenya. 
(Applause.)  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Yeah, that’s right.  That’s right.  That’s
right.   
   
AMBASSADOR WHITMAN:  Madam Vice President, you might be interested to
know that Kenya is the home to the only semiconductor technology on the
continent, and 70 percent of their engineers are women.   
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Ah!  
   
AMBASSADOR WHITMAN:  So, pretty remarkable.  (Applause.)  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Fantastic.  
   
AMBASSADOR WHITMAN:  So, I know how hard you’ve been working on the
Digital Inclusion Project.  And I think today you’re — you’re going to
talk a little bit about the progress that —  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Yes.  
   
AMBASSADOR WHITMAN:  — you’ve made and — and, you know, building on the
trip that you made to Africa.  So, maybe you can bring us up to speed on
what you’ve accomplished and — and how you’re feeling about the whole
program.   
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  I will, but first I just must thank you, Meg
Whitman — (applause) — for taking up the position of being ambassador. 
I’ve known the Ambassador for a long time, I say with a bit of bravado,
as a proud Californian and —  
   
AMBASSADOR WHITMAN:  Yes.  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: — and your work and your groundbreaking work in
technology is extraordinary.  And this is just the perfect moment that
you would step up and serve in this capacity.  And I thank you for
that.  (Applause.)  
   
AMBASSADOR WHITMAN:  Thank you.   
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Thank you.  Thank you.  
   
So, digital inclusion is — was at the heart of the idea for this
initiative that is focused on the continent.   
   
And I want to thank a few people who I know are here: Brad Smith is
here.  Michael Miebach is here.  It — it was — it was companies like
Microsoft, MasterCard — foundations — Melinda French Gates was one of
the earliest to contribute as much as $10 million for the women in
digital inclusion focused on women — the Ford Foundation.   
   
And so, essentially, this is how it all happened is a — a simplified
version.  I got on the phone, and I called a bunch of people.  And I —
and called them to say, “I know that you have some interest based on the
work that you’ve done before.  Can we collaborate in a focused way that
develops synergy around a public-private partnership?”   
   
And the foundation for the work being digital inclusion, understanding
that all business at this point is tech business and any business, any
economy that is going to grow, much less be sustainable between now and
the future, must integrate and adapt and adopt technology in a — in a
very — in an institutional way.   
   
And this includes, as you describe, Mr. President, your mother.  It
includes that it must be the people, not just the governments and the —
and the corporations, that understand how the technology works.   
   
Another piece of the focus was something I’ve long believed many of us
do: If you — if we are focused on strengthening economies, one of the
smartest ways to do that is to invest in women.  The reality is that
when you improve the economic condition — (applause) — when you improve
the economic condition of women, you improve the economic condition of
families, communities, and all of society benefits.  So, a lot of the —
the work then, in terms of the initial design, was to think of it that
way.   
   
It was also to layer upon the initiative: What are the — the current
crises that we must address in a way that we see opportunity for
economic growth?  The climate crisis being an obvious one.  The climate
crisis having a direct impact on agricultural economies.  And knowing,
then, that we are developing the — the most extraordinary smart
technology to help farmers.   
   
And when they have access to technology, when they are able to get
online, the services that are available will help them with crop
management; will help them determine what crop they should plant this
season based on satellite technology, which can predict the weather for
that period of time, so they are not bound by tradition.  Technology
which helps farmers determine whether there is too much water in drought
conditions that are being used on a specific plant — too much
fertilizer, which we know has an impact on the climate.  
   
All of this is facilitated — these traditions — these traditional ways
of either growing or not growing economies can be facilitated, like you
said, Mr. President, when we look at the issue of digital inclusion.  
   
So, we developed this partnership that is a public-private partnership. 
I know that Michael and Brad talked earlier about what we are doing
specifically, but the — the vision is that we can — and U.S. businesses,
in particular, can partner with our allies in a way that invests in the
infrastructure that allows these economies to thrive.  
   
I will also say I’m a big believer in public partnershi- —
public-private partnerships for two main reasons.  One, we — as
government, we have the — the scale.  We have the ability to scale.  But
truly, the private sector has the depth of skill and expertise, often,
that, when you combine it with the scale capacity of government, can
have a profound impact on large populations of people.   
   
The second point I will make, especially as vice president, is that
through these public-private partnerships, I can speak then with our
allies or potential partners around the globe.  I’m doing this work, for
example, in the northern part of Central America.  And I can then sit
down with world leaders and explain to them that private investment,
U.S. investment will be dependent and reliant on in- — in rule of law,
on democracy, on an adherence and respect for human rights.   
   
And understand then, in that way, the power of public-private
partnerships, especially when we are talking about these relationships
around the globe, understanding that increasingly U.S. business is
interdependent and intradependent with our allies and nations around the
world.  And these partnerships, then, make a lot of sense.  
   
AMBASSADOR WHITMAN:  Let me — that’s — let me follow that up quickly,
and we have just a few more minutes.  But, Mr. President, tell us a
little bit of how you think about these partnerships and how you think
about Americans — since we’re here in America — how you think about the
American companies and — and how they’re helping you to skill, to build
out this ecosystem.  
   
PRESIDENT RUTO:  Vice President Kamala Harris has said a very profound
thing about relationships — building the correct relationship.  We need
to recalibrate, you know, our — our engagement.  
   
Let me start with where we were at the Africa Climate Summit last year. 
At the Africa Climate la- — Summit last year, we pushed to change the
narrative around Africa.  
   
For a long time, it was about blame game: who caused this, why — why
this has happened.  We decided we cannot continue to be in the victim
corner.  Let’s get ourselves and project a new narrative.  Kenya — Kenya
and Africa can be part of the solution.  (Applause.)  You know?  
   
And — and for a moment, it — it looked strange, because people were
wondering, “We thought we were victims of climate change.  We thought we
didn’t cause it.  Africa caused only 4 percent.  Wh- — how can we be
part of the solution?”  
   
We’re saying we have the largest resources of renewable energy.  We have
the youngest population.  We have 60 percent of the world’s arable land,
which we can use smart agriculture.  We have the natural carbon sinks. 
We have the largest minerals that are even necessary for energy
transition.   
   
Why is a rich continent in a corner looking weak and defeated and — and
a victim?  
   
So, we — we decided to change the narrative.  And for the first time, we
had a different conversation.  We are discussing: Since we have
tremendous con- — potential, how do we move this to opportunity and to
investment?   
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  
   
PRESIDENT RUTO:  That is the conversation.  So, that’s point number
one.   
   
And we must have it both ways.  We have some work to do on our side. 
Our partners, like the U.S., have some work to do.  Aid will not get us
anywhere.  Extracting raw materials from Africa will not get us
anywhere.   
   
So, it’s — it’s balanced.  We — we must stop the extraction.  But we
must also think outside aid.  And the place to think is about
investment.  And when you are thinking investment, you must think about
how to bring both public and private investment.  And that is why
private-public engagement —  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Yeah.   
   
PRESIDENT RUTO:  — is ultimate.  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  That’s right.   
   
PRESIDENT RUTO:  It is necessary.   
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  That’s right.   
   
PRESIDENT RUTO:  I’ll give you examples.  We have the most modern
expressway in Nairobi.  It wasn’t built using government money.  It was
built using private-sector money in a PPP framework.   
   
It — it’s working.  I am now doing a PPP framework to deli- — to
transmit — for energy transmission.  We’re doing the first five
transmission lines in Kenya.  Why should government invest money in a
transmission line when we can only pay a (inaudible) charge for somebody
in the private sector who can invest their money?   
   
We’re looking at how we can also do it with the airports, how we can do
it the ports, how we can do it with the rest so, that way, we can bring
huge investment money into our economies without necessarily contracting
debt or looking for aid.   
   
Let me give a perfect example today here.  We just signed an investment
of a billion dollars.  You know?  It would take me ages — (laughter) —
to get a billion dollars from any government, including the American
government.  (Laughter.)   
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  It would take us that long too. 
(Laughter.)     
   
PRESIDENT RUTO:  You know?  It would take me ages, but the private
sector can do it.  They — they will bring the billion dollars —  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  That’s right.   
   
PRESIDENT RUTO:  — because it makes business sense to them.   
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  That’s right.   
   
PRESIDENT RUTO:  You know, they — they are investing.  They will make
money.  We will use our geothermal.  We will employ our young people. 
They will pay taxes.  Everybody will win.  They will make profits.  So,
it is win-win.   
   
So, we must also, as — as governments, as Africa, we must make ourselves
investment-ready so that, by eliminating barriers, eliminating
roadblocks, making it easy for those who want to invest in our corner to
do so.   
   
And that is why — one more thing.  That is why we are having an
engagement to make sure that Africa is not unfairly profiled as a risky
continent and thereby making investors — (applause).  You know?  
   
And — and it is the reason why I was having a very robust en- —
engagement with President Biden.  And I must thank him profusely,
because he agreed with me that we need a reform of the international
financial architecture so that we make it fairer so that all countries,
all continents can access finances without unnecessary profiling and
without making them pay more than they should.   
   
So — (applause) — believe you me, I think we are having the right
conversation.  I think we are right — we are having the right
conversation — and conversation around having a level playing field so
that both public and especially the private sector can do what they do
best and government can facilitate and do what we can do best. 
(Applause.)  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Right.   
   
AMBASSADOR WHITMAN:  Well, thank you very much.  It is my responsibility
— it’s my responsibility to get Madam Vice President to her lunch —  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Yes.  
   
AMBASSADOR WHITMAN:  — that she is hosting.   
   
But I want to commend your leadership on this subject.  Thank you for
what you do for Africa.   
   
And if you want to just say one last word, we really, really — a round
of applause for the Vice President.  She’s done a remarkable, remarkable
job.  (Applause.)  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Thank you.  
   
I will emphasize the point that President Ruto made: The — the capacity
that we have in public-private partnership is being illustrated around
our focus on the continent of Africa, and let it be an example as we
think about future-forward policy.  That is where the future is.  
   
We in government don’t have — not only the — necessarily the depth of
the skill, but we cannot pull together the billions of dollars, to your
point —  
   
PRESIDENT RUTO:  (Inaudible.)  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  — that we can do with these kinds of
partnerships that will have exponential and immediate impact.   
   
And I’ll just close with this.  President Ruto, I think that your trip
and your visit — this state visit — is, history will show, an inflection
point in how we are revising and upgrading the narrative of the
relationship between the United States and the continent of Africa, and
I thank you for that.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  
   
AMBASSADOR WHITMAN:  Thank you very much.
