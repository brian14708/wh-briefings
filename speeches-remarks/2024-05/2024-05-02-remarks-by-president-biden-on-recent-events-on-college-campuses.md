THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  
   
Q    Good morning.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Before I head to North Carolina, I wanted to speak a few
moments about what’s going on on our college campuses here. 

We’ve all seen the images.  And they put to the test two fundamental
American principles. 

Excuse me.  (Coughs.)  
   
The first is the right to free speech and for people to peacefully
assemble and make their voices heard.  The second is the rule of law. 
Both must be upheld.   
   
We are not an authoritarian nation where we silence people or squash
dissent.  The American people are heard.  In fact, peaceful protest is
in the best tradition of how Americans respond to consequential
issues.   
   
But — but neither are we a lawless country.  We are a civil society, and
order must prevail.   
   
Throughout our history, we’ve often faced moments like this because we
are a big, diverse, free-thinking, and freedom-loving nation.   
   
In moments like this, there are always those who rush in to score
political points.  But this isn’t a moment for politics.  It’s a moment
for clarity.   
   
So, let me be clear.  Peaceful protest in America — violent protest is
not protected; peaceful protest is.  It’s against the law when violence
occurs.   
   
Destroying property is not a peaceful protest.  It’s against the law.  
   
Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campuses,
forcing the cancellation of classes and graduations — none of this is a
peaceful protest.   
   
Threatening people, intimidating people, instilling fear in people is
not peaceful protest.  It’s against the law.  
   
Dissent is essential to democracy.  But dissent must never lead to
disorder or to denying the rights of others so students can finish the
semester and their college education.  
   
Look, it’s basically a matter of fairness.  It’s a matter of what’s
right.  There’s the right to protest but not the right to cause chaos.  
   
People have the right to get an education, the right to get a degree,
the right to walk across the campus safely without fear of being
attacked.  
   
But let’s be clear about this as well.  There should be no place on any
campus, no place in America for antisemitism or threats of violence
against Jewish students.  There is no place for hate speech or violence
of any kind, whether it’s antisemitism, Islamophobia, or discrimination
against Arab Americans or Palestinian Americans.  
   
It’s simply wrong.  There is no place for racism in America.  It’s all
wrong.  It’s un-American.   
   
I understand people have strong feelings and deep convictions.  In
America, we respect the right and protect the right for them to express
that.  But it doesn’t mean anything goes.  It needs to be done without
violence, without destruction, without hate, and within the law.  
   
You know, make no mistake: As President, I will always defend free
speech.  And I will always be just as strong in standing up for the rule
of law.  
   
That’s my responsibility to you, the American people, and my obligation
to the Constitution.  
   
Thank you very much.  
   
Q    Mr. President, have the protests forced you to reconsider any of
the policies with regard to the region?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No. 

Thank you.  
   
Q    Mr. President, do you think the National Guard should intervene?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No.
