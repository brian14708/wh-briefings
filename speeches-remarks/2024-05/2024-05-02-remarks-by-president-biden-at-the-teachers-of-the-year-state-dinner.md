East Room

THE PRESIDENT:  I’m Jill Biden’s husband.  (Laughter and applause.) 
Please have a — sit — please sit down.   
  
I’m going to be very brief.  I just came back from North Carolina —
(applause) — Wilmington, North Carolina.  (Applause.)  The mayor of
Wilmington, North Carolina, has spent time living in Wilmington,
Delaware.  (Applause.)  His daughter went to the University of Del- —  
  
Anyway, look, I’ll be very, very brief.  First of all, I want to say how
impressed I am with all that this woman does for the country and all —
no, I mean it sincerely.  
  
But, look, you know, you all are the reason why we — we have hope about
the future.  I really mean it.  Not a joke.  
  
And I was down in — in North Carolina — in Charlotte and Wilmington,
North Carolina — announcing a major multibillion-dollar program to make
sure we got all lead out of water in North Carolina — (applause) — and
the entire country.  
  
And I was with a bunch of schoolteachers who — they’ve discovered, in
Wilmington, a significant — a significant amount of lead coming out of
one of the fountains that was in one of the schools.  And I met these
four little kids who were in second grade, coming up — “Mr. Pwesident,
you got to do something.”(Laughter.)  And we’re going to do something.  
  
My — the point I want to make is that, you know, the idea that we can’t
do more in education seems to me to be a ludicrous notion.   
  
You know, how can we be the ma- — the most powerful, most meaningful
country in the world without having the best education system in the
world?  (Applause.)  
  
And teaching is not what you do; it’s who you are.  It’s who you — no,
for real.  I know that.  (Laughter.)  Believe me, I know that.  
  
By the way, I actually taught for a number of years in law school.  And
then I was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania.  No — I don’t
get an applause for that?  (Laughter and applause.)  
  
But all kidding aside, what I realized is how damn hard she works every
day and you all work every day.  
  
So, look, I just want to say I appreciate all you do.  You’re
incredible.  You’re — you are — as I’ve said before — I got criticized
for it the first time I said it — you are the kite strings that lift our
national ambitions aloft — literally, not figuratively.   
  
You are the kite strings.  You are the future.  You provide it for us.  
  
So, I just came by to say thank you.  I’m going to get the hell out of
here.  Thank you.  (Laughter and applause.)
