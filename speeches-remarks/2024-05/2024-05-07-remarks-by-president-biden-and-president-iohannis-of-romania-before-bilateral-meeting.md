Oval Office

2:15 P.M. EDT

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, Mr. President, welcome to the White House. 
Welcome back to the Oval Office.  
   
PRESIDENT IOHANNIS:  Thank you.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  We were reminiscing for a moment before you came in
that, back when I was a senator, 180 years ago, I fought very hard for
Romania’s admission to NATO.  And you — you’ve exceeded every
expectation.   
   
And 20 years ago, when you joined NATO for real, the — and every year
since, our nations have grown only closer, in my view — closer and
closer together.   
   
And we see it in Romania and American troops serving side by side across
NATO, and including in your country.  I believe there’s about 1,800
American forces there.  We thank you for that.  And — and we see our
work in strengthening NATO’s eastern flank.   
   
And I want to thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership, especially
in the Black Sea.  You’ve been incredible.  You’ve stood up, and the
help you’ve provided for Ukraine is — is real.  It’s significant.   
   
The — the unified support for the people of Ukraine — you’ve allowed a
number of refugees to come across, be in your country — about 8,000,
they tell me.  A whole lot.  And that’s really something.  And, also,
your security assistance to Ukraine, moving Ukrainian grain.   
   
And I want you to know the United States is committed to standing with
you.   
   
Today, we lay the foundation for the next 20 years.  I look forward to
our discussions and just say that we’ve got a lot to discuss, so I’m
looking forward to it.  
   
The floor is yours, sir.  
   
PRESIDENT IOHANNIS:  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  Thank you for
making this meeting possible on a short notice.   
   
I believe it is timely.  And I believe that you’re absolutely right: We
have a lot of issues to discuss.   
   
Let me just start by saying that we managed not only to — to be members
of NATO, thanks to you and others who really fought for us — 20 years
since Romania is a proud member of NATO — but we also managed to work on
our bilateral relationship, which became stronger and stronger.   
   
We have a Strategic Partnership.  And I think by making this partnership
strong, we also managed to make the transatlantic link strong.  In my
opinion, a transatlantic link is the cornerstone of our democratic way
of — of life, our values.   
   
And so, this is obviously linked to the way we see the future of our
nations; the way — how we manage to make our nations work better, live
better; how we manage to guarantee the security of our peoples; how we
manage to make our economies grow.   
   
And so, we have, really, a lot of issues we can discuss.  But also,
sometimes I believe it is important to underline that we managed to move
ahead and that we managed to have very positive results.  And, of
course, we will discuss things we still have to achieve.   
   
And so, maybe just an example: We are working together on a visa waiver
for Romania.  If this goes well, hopefully, not before long, we will
have results.   
   
But unfortunately, the most important issue is to find the way to
reinstall peace in Europe.  And helping Ukraine and the Ukrainians — you
set such a huge example how this can be done.  
   
Romania is trying its best, and we have some pretty good results.  I
think it is decent.  But nevertheless, we have to find ways to prevent
Russia to win this war in Ukraine.  And here we have to stay united.  We
have to work together.  And we will, as far as I can see.  
   
So, a lot of issues, Mr. President.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, there’s a lot of issues.   
   
Let me just say one thing.  I don’t think there’s any NATO partner who
has a stronger commitment to the Euro-Atlantic alliance than Romania and
the United States.  And it’s a value set.  It’s what we believe.  
   
PRESIDENT IOHANNIS:  Absolutely.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  And you’ve stepped up, and you’ve been incredible. 
And what you’ve done and what we’re going to continue to do together, I
think, is going to be significant, not only for Europe but for the whole
world.  
   
So, thank you.  
   
PRESIDENT IOHANNIS:  Thank you.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you all.
