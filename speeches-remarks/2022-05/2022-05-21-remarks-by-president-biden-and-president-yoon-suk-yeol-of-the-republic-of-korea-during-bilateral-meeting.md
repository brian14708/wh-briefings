PRESIDENT YOON:  (As interpreted.)  Mr. President, today we’re living in
the era of economic security, where economy is security and vice versa. 
The transformation of the international trade order and the disruption
of global supply chains are having a direct impact on the livelihood of
our people. 

The ROK-U.S. alliance should also move forward and adapt to this new era
of economic security. 

Yesterday, Mr. President and I, together, visited what can be described
as the “global epicenter” of cutting-edge semiconductor industry. 
There, I was able to feel the strength of our economic and technology
alliance. 

We will continue our cooperation in strategic industries, such as
microchips and EV batteries, in order to expand mutual investment and to
attain our common goal, which is building a resilient supply chain.

And, Mr. President, our summit talks today will provide a valuable
opportunity to further strengthen our cooperation and economic security,
as well as to discuss ways to work together and align our policies to
resolve many other pressing global challenges that we face together. 

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Mr. President, thank you for your incredibly warm
welcome.  It’s wonderful to be back in the Republic of Korea.  I’m
honored to be making this visit less than two weeks since you’ve been
inaugurated.  And congratulations. 

Mr. President, our alliances between our countries is built on shared
sacrifice.  And our joint commitment to the freedom of the Republic of
Korea and our firm opposition to changing borders by force has
flourished with decades of peace and cooperation.  And today, with this
visit, we’re taking the cooperation between our two countries to new
heights.

For decades, our alliance has been a linchpin for regional peace and
growth and prosperity, and it’s been vital to deterring attacks from the
DPRK.  And, today, our cooperation is essential to preserve the
stability and global — on the global stage as well. 

Our two nations are working together to take on both the opportunities
and the challenges of the moment: continuing to fight COVID-19, securing
the supply chains, tackling the climate crisis, deepening our security
cooperation to meet regional challenges, and writing the rules of the
road to ensure the Indo-Pacific is a free and open area.

So, thank you again for the welcome, Mr. President.  I’ve enjoyed our
conversations and getting to spend some time with you.  Matter of a
fact, we spent so much time, we didn’t get a chance to see the rest of
your people.

PRESIDENT YOON:  (Laughs.)

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  And I’m looking forward to continuing the great
friendship between our two nations.  Thank you.
