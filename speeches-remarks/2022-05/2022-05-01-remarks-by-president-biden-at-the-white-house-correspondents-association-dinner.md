Washington Hilton  
Washington, D.C.  
   
(April 30, 2022)

10:07 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Thank you,
Steve, for that introduction.  And a special thanks to the 42 percent of
you who actually applauded.  (Laughter.)  
   
I’m really excited to be here tonight with the only group of Americans
with a lower approval rating than I have.  (Laughter.)  That’s hard to
say after what we just saw.  (Laughter.)  
   
This is the first time a President attended this dinner in six years. 
(Applause.)  It’s understandable.  We had a horrible plague followed by
two years of COVID.  (Laughter and applause.)  
   
Just imagine if my predecessor came to this dinner this year.  Now, that
would really have been a real coup if that occurred.  (Laughter.)  A
little tough, huh?  (Laughter.)  
   
But I’m honored to be here at such an event with so much history.  
   
As already referenced, the very first President to attend the White
House Correspondents’ Dinner was Calvin Coolidge in 1924.  I had just
been elected to the United States Senate.  (Laughter.)  And I reme- — I
remember telling him, “Cal, just be yourself.  Get up there and speak
from the heart.  You’re going to be great, kid.  You’re going to do it
well.”  (Laughter.)  
   
Of course, Jill is with me tonight.  Jilly, how are you, kid? 
(Applause.)  I think — I think she’s doing an incredible job as First
Lady.  (Applause.)  The First Lady to continue working full-time, and
she does as a professor.  
   
She doesn’t pay much attention to the polls, though she did say the
other day: Instead of introducing myself as Jill Biden’s husband, maybe
I should introduce myself as her roommate.  (Laughter.)  
   
I’ve attended this dinner many times, but this is my first time as
President.  And the organizers had — had it hard — made it pretty hard
for me tonight.  Although the good news is, if all goes well, I have a
real shot at replacing James Corden.  (Laughter.)  
   
It was great having him over at the White House the other day, just as
he announced he’s leaving the show.  A great performer is going out on
top after eight years in the job.  Sounds just about right to me. 
(Laughter and applause.)  
   
And it’s tough to follow pros like James and Billy Eichner.   Billy,
where are you again?  Do you — where is he?   
   
Well, Billy, you’re famous for interviewing — your interviewing skills. 
Billy, you should know what you’re doing, pal.  You know it — you know
it well.  And you should — I think you should host “Meet the Press.” 
Maybe they’ll start to watch it again.  (Laughter.)   
   
I’ve never had — (laughs) — never had to — (laughs) — I’ve never had to
open — I’ll never be — I’ll never be invited to “Meet the Press” again. 
Anyway.  (Laughter.)  
   
I’ve never had to open before Trevor Noah.  Trevor is great.  When I was
elected, he did a show and he called me “America’s new dad.” 
(Laughter.)  Let me tell you something, pal: I’m flattered anybody would
call me a “new” anything.  (Laughter.)  You’re my guy.  
   
And, folks, it’s been a tough few years for the country.  That’s one
reason why it’s great to be here again.  
   
Everyone at the White House is so excited.  I told my grandkids and Pete
Buttigieg they could stay up late and watch this show tonight. 
(Laughter and applause.)   
   
Tonight — tonight we come here and answer a very important question on
everybody’s mind: Why in the hell are we still doing this? 
(Laughter.)  
   
I know there are — I know there are questions about whether we should
gather here tonight because of COVID.  Well, we’re here to show the
country that we’re getting through this pandemic.  Plus, everyone had to
prove they were fully vaccinated and boosted.  (Applause.)   
   
So, if you’re at home watching this and you’re wondering how to do that,
just contact your favorite Fox News reporter.  They’re all here,
vaccinated and boosted — all of them.   (Laughter and applause.)  
   
And, look, Fox — Fox News, I’m — I’m really sorry your preferred
candidate lost the last election.  To make it up to you, I’m happy to
give my Chief of Staff to you all so he can tell Sean Hannity what to
say every day.  (Laughter.)  
   
In fact, Ron Klain is here at the CBS table, which hired Mick Mulvaney. 
Mick, on CBS?  I was stunned.  I figured he’d end up on “The Masked
Singer” with Rudy.  (Laughter.)  
   
Amazing hire, guys.  Really quite amazing.   
   
Look, I know this is a tough town.  I came to office with an ambitious
agenda, and I expected it to face stiff opposition in the Senate.  I
just hoped it would be from Republicans.  (Laughter.)  
   
But I’m not worried about the midterms.  I’m not worried about them.  We
may end up with more partisan gridlock, but I’m confident we can work it
out during my remaining six years in the presidency.  (Applause.)  
   
And, folks, I’m not really here to roast the GOP.  That’s not my style. 
Besides, there’s nothing I can say about the GOP that Kevin McCarthy
hasn’t already put on tape.  (Laughter.)  
   
And, you know, at the same — at the same time, a lot of people say the
Republican Party is too extreme, too divisive, too controlled by one
person.  They say, “It’s not your father’s Republican Party.”  
   
Ronald Reagan said, “Mr. Gorbachev, tear this wall down.”  Today’s
Republicans say, “Tear down Mickey Mouse’s house.”  (Laughter.)   And
pretty soon, they’ll be storming Cinderella’s Castle, you can be sure of
it.  
   
But Republicans seem to support one fella — some guy named Brandon. 
(Laughter.)  He’s having a really good year, and I’m kind of happy for
him.  (Laughter and applause.)  
   
Let me conclude with a serious word.   
   
We live in serious times.  We’re coming through a devastating pandemic,
and we have to stay vigilant.  I know Kamala wanted to be here, for
example, and thankfully she’s doing well.  You should all know she sends
her best.  (Applause.)  
   
We’re in a time when what we so long have taken for granted is facing
the gravest of threats.  And I’m being deadly earnest.  
   
Oversear \[sic\] — overseas, the liberal world order that laid the
foundation for global peace, stability, and prosperity since World War
Two is genuinely, seriously under assault.  
   
And at home, a poison is running through our democracy of all — all of
this taking place with disinformation massively on the rise, where the
truth is buried by lies and the lies live on as truth.  
   
What’s clear — and I mean this from the bottom of my heart — that you,
the free press, matter more than you ever did in the last century. 
(Applause.)  No, I really mean it.   
   
I’ve always believed that good journalism holds up a mirror to ourselves
to reflect on the good, the bad, and the true.  Tonight, I want to
congratulate the awardees and the scholarship winners who carry on that
sacred tradition.  
   
We’ve all seen the courage of the Ukrainian people because of the
courage of American reporters in this room and your colleagues across
the world who are on the ground, taking their lives in their own hands.
 (Applause.)  
   
And although it’s not in Ukraine, it’s Russia — Mom, I’d like to meet
you and Dad to talk about your son.   
   
We just — we just saw a heartbreaking video: Nine have been killed
reporting from Kyiv — struck by a kamikaze drone strike after a shopping
mall attack; shot in the neck while decounci- \[sic\] — while — while
documenting Ukrainians fleeing; killed when Russian missiles hit the
television tower in a residential neighborhood.  One journalist from
Radio Liberty just killed days ago.  
   
So many of you telling the stories and taking the photos and recording
the videos of what’s happening there, the unvarnished truth shown —
showing the — the destruction and the devastation and, yes, the war
crimes.  
   
Tonight, we also honor the legacy of two historic reporters, and that is
Alice Dunnigan and Ethel Payne.  I’m glad you saw that tonight. 
(Applause.)  I didn’t know you were doing that.  These are the first
Black women to be White House reporters who shattered convention to
cover a segregated nation.  
   
We honor journalists killed, missing, imprisoned, detained, and
tortured; covering war, exposing corruption, and holding leaders
accountable.  
   
We honor members of the press, both national and local, covering a
once-in-a-century pandemic where we lost a million Americans, a
generation reckoning on race, and the existential threat of climate
change.  
   
The free press is not the enemy of the people — far from it.  At your
best, you’re guardians of the truth.  
   
President Kennedy once said, and I quote, “Without debate, without
criticism, no administration, no country can succeed,  
and no republic can survive.”  
   
The First Amendment grants a free press extraordinary protection, but
with it comes, as many of you know, a very heavy obligation: to seek the
truth as best you can — not to inflame or entertain, but to illuminate
and educate.  
   
I know it’s tough.  And I’m not being solicitous.  The industry is
changing significantly.  
   
There’s incredible pressure on you all to deliver heat instead of shed
light, because the technology is changing so much, the system is
changing.  But it matters.  No kidding.  It matters.  The truth
matters.   
   
American democracy is not a reality show.  (Applause.)  It’s not a
reality show.  (Applause.)  It’s reality itself.  And the reality is
that we are a great country.  
   
Our future is bright.  It’s not guaranteed, because democracy is never
guaranteed.  It has to be earned.  It has to be defended.  It has to be
protected.  
   
As you’ve heard me say many times: There’s not a damn thing this country
can’t do when we stand united and do it together.  And I know we can do
anything we want to do that’s right.   
   
I’ve been around a long time, as has been pointed out many times
tonight.  (Laughter.)  But I give you my word as a Biden: I’ve never
been more optimistic about America than I am today.  I really mean
it.   
   
At times of enormous change, it presents enormous opportunities.  For
despite all the crises, all the partisanship, all the shouting and the
showmanship,  
I really know this and you know it too: We are a great nation because
we’re basically a good people.  
   
And here in America, good journalism, good satire about our leaders,
about our society is quintessentially an American thing.  It
demonstrates the power of our example.  
   
And I, honest to God, believe it reveals our soul — the soul of our
nation.  And that’s what I’d like to toast tonight, if I may.  
   
(The President offers a toast.)  
   
To the journalists and their families, to the people and their elected
representatives, to the United States of America.  (Applause.)  
   
And by the way, Madeleine Albright was right: We are the indispensable
nation.  (Applause.)  
   
Ladies and gentlemen, I’m going to turn this over to Trevor now, strap
myself into my seat.  (Laughter.)  
   
And, Trevor, the really good news is: Now you get to roast the President
of the United States and, unlike in Moscow, you won’t go to jail. 
(Laughter.)  
   
The podium is yours.  (Applause.)
