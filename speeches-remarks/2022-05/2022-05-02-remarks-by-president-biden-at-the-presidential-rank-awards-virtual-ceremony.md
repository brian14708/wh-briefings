THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you all.  Kiran, thank you for the great job
you’re doing leading the Office of Personnel Management.   
   
And thank you, Diana — Diana.  And thank you most of all for the
difference you’ve made.  You’ve really made a difference in people’s
lives, and you saved people’s lives in the process — helping speed
resources to hospitals and healthcare workers on the frontlines when
they needed the help the most — because you and your team delivered.  
   
There are families who gather around the dinner table tonight, and it’s
completely filled — there’s no empty chairs.  A million people have
died.  A million people have died, but think of all of the lives you
helped save.  
   
You know, they may not know your name, but you have their gratitude. 
And that’s what public service is all about.  It’s that — it’s that —
what the President Rank Awards are all about.

They’re about the families in every corner of this country whose lives
all of you — all of you who are behind me on those screen — all of you
have touched.  Every single one of you.   
   
Those families may never know your names, but you have their gratitude.

It was my honor to re-establish these awards last year after the
previous administration made the decision to cancel them.  Because these
awards are about more than individual recognition.  They’re a reminder
to all of us — to everyone — of the extraordinary capacity, creativity,
diversity, and dedication of our federal workforce and a reminder — a
reminder of why you all — all the work you do matters so much.

You know, a couple of weeks before I was sworn in, in January 2021, I
sent a message to all career civil servants.  And I meant it at the time
and I still mean it.  I told them that we’re a team.  One team.  One
America.  And I meant it.

Over the last 15 months, you’ve helped us deliver so much to the
American people: helping stand up a wartime effort to get the country
vaccinated; getting checks into people’s pockets of families who needed
help, literally just to keep food on the table, keep a roof over their
heads; helping communities rebuild in the wake of storms and wildfires;
and caring for our veterans; cleaning up the polluted lands and waters;
implementing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to deliver good-paying
job opportunities and game-changing investments to communities all
across America; and so much more.

Most of all, you’ve restored the faith — the faith of millions of
Americans in their government — that their government sees them and
hears them, that we listen to them, respect them, and reflect them.

You’re helping restore their faith that democracy can deliver in
America.  And by restoring their faith and coming through for them
today, you’re helping strengthen our country for tomorrow, in a literal
sense.

Look, you and your colleagues couldn’t have done — if you had the
opportunity, looking back on it, probably would’ve — you could’ve done
anything — almost anything with your careers.  You’re so talented.  But
you chose public service.  And the families in every corner of this
country are better off today because you made that choice.

Not only are you helping to confront the great challenges of our time,
you’re showing America, the world that we can do — what we can do when
we come together and lead with honor and integrity, as you all have had
being recognized today, with a federal government that looks like
America and gets things done for all Americans.

So I want to say simply: Thank you, thank you, thank you — not only to
you, but to your families as well — for faci- — for the sacrifices
you’ve all made to serve our nation and to deliver for all those folks
around the kitchen tables tonight, and today and this morning and
tomorrow and the next day, who might never know your names.

It makes a difference.  I hope that these awards remind each of you of
why you’re here and why it matters.  
   
So, let’s keep it up.  Let’s keep delivering for the American people,
because I tell you what: We work for them, and we have to do our job. 
And you’re doing it incredibly well.

Thank you for all your exemplary work.  And congratulations to all of
you.  May God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops.   
   
Thank you all so very, very much.  Thank you.  
   
Q    Mr. President, when are you meeting with Austin Tice’s parents?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Today.   
   
Q    Mr. President, have you made a decision on student loan debt?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Not yet.
