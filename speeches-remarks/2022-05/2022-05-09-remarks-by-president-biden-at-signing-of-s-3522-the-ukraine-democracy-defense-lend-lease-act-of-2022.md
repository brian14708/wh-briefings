Oval Office

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, welcome, folks.  Today I’m joined by Senator
Cardin — Ben Cardin; Elissa Slotkin; and the Congresswoman Victoria
Spatz — Spartz, excuse me, who — I was just talking to her about still
having family back in Ukraine.  God love you.  

I — we’re going to — I’m about to sign a bill that these folks are
responsible — and, of course, the Vice President, excuse me.  Excuse
me. 

The — I’m signing a bill that provides another important tool in our
efforts to support the government of Ukraine and the Ukrainian people in
their fight to defend their country and their democracy against Putin’s
brutal war.  And it is brutal.  

I want to thank members of Congress here for getting this passed and
everyone who supported the bill.  And the bill demonstrates that support
for Ukraine is pivotal at this moment.

Every day, Ukrainians pay with their lives, and they fight along — and
the atrocities that the Russians are engaging in are just beyond the
pale.  And the cost of the fight is not cheap, but caving to aggression
is even more costly.  That’s why we’re staying in this. 

Yesterday, we celebrated VE Day — Victory in Europe Day — marking the
end of a transition of the devastation as a consequence of World War Two
and Allied nations’ defeat of the scourge of fascism in Europe.  

And today, Europe is honoring another important day on the anniversary. 
On May 9th, 1950, just years after the end of World War Two, Europe
began to work to strengthen the bonds of unity among the nations,
particularly the economic unity and the shared economic prosperity.  

The idea ultimately grew into the — what is now a 27-nation European
Union — an economic powerhouse and a global force for peace and close
partners of all — on all the issues we face.

And it really has — I’ve said from the very beginning: It’s — it’s
something that is good for everyone.  It brings these countries together
in ways that — and they cooperate closely economically.  They also
cooperate in other ways.  And you’ve seen it in their support for
Ukraine. 

And with Putin’s war once more bringing wanton destruction into Europe,
and to — to reaffirm the enduring commitment to the future grounded in
democracy, human rights, and peaceful resolution to disagreements, I’m
now going to sign this bill.  

And again, I thank my colleagues who are standing behind me.  And —
because it really matters.  It matters. 

(The bill is signed.)

There you go.  Done.  Thank you.  (Applause.)
