  \ Formula\_Event"

Dulles International Airport  
Dulles, VA

The sudden, senseless massacre in an elementary school—little children
and their teachers, Eva and Irma. Let us pray that God cradles these
broken families in the palm of his hand. But let us also pray that we
use the will and courage that God gives each of us so we can act—united
with common sense—to protect our children.

I’ve always said that food is love. But food is life, too.

Like all of us, I have been heartbroken to hear the stories of parents
searching for formula. As a mom and a nana, it’s impossible to hear
stories of children suffering and not imagine your own children in the
same position. Food is the first and most important way we nurture our
children.

Joe and his team have put solutions into place to get formula back on
the shelves.

Thank you to Nestle and FedEx for your partnership in this. Thank you to
Tarun Malkani, and Gerber, for his leadership. And I want to thank the
devoted service members of U.S. Transportation Command for their
critical role in Operation Fly Formula.

There’s more to do. We know that. Joe knows that. As Dr. Murthy said,
these shipments are only one part of the strategy.

I am here today to say to parents: You aren’t alone. At the highest
levels of Joe’s Administration, he and his team understand what you are
going through. They won’t stop until every parent can get the formula
their child needs.

Thank you.
