11:50 A.M. EDT   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good morning, Bears.  (Applause.)  Good morning to
all.  Secretary Mayorkas, thank you for your steadfast leadership on so
many of our nation’s most pressing issues.  I am grateful for your
dedication to public service for our country and to the safety and
wellbeing of our country.  
                                                                        
Admiral Schultz, Rear Admiral Kelly, congratulations to you both.  I was
honored to have some time to talk with you both before we came out.  And
we truly have a gift in your life of service.  Thank you for that.  
  
Governor Lamont, faculty and staff, family and loved ones: It is an
honor to be with you this morning.  
  
I am also proud to be joined today by my Military Aide, Lieutenant
Commander Lauren Milici, who graduated from this academy in 2009.  She
is — (applause) — yes.  She has traveled around the world with me, and
this is her last trip.  Lauren, I am so thankful for your service.  
  
And to the Class of 2022: Congratulations on this tremendous
achievement.  
  
All you have been through, from that first 5:00 a.m. wake-up call during
Swab Summer to dipping your rings in the waters of the seven seas at the
Ring Dance, you have traveled on this remarkable journey together.  
  
I hope you look to your left and look to your right and know you have
made lifelong friendships.  You have dedicated yourselves to
relationships that will last throughout your career.  
  
And you made it through, together, in such a demanding military training
and a rigorous academic program in order to serve your country in the
world’s greatest Coast Guard.   
   
A Coast Guard, I should note, that has been strengthened, of course,
under the leadership of Admiral Schultz, and a Coast Guard, as Admiral
Schultz mentioned, that will soon be led by Admiral Fagan, the first
woman in history to lead a United States military service. 
(Applause.)  
   
And to all the parents and loved ones who are here: I know  you are
feeling an immense sense of pride in these Cadets today.  And it is a
pride that I share, especially when I talk about them, which I do, with
other world leaders.  
  
President Joe Biden and I, well, we view our Cadets as our eyes and ears
and hands and hearts wherever you serve, at home or abroad.  You are
doing the critical work — you will be doing the critical work to protect
our country, to advance our interests, and to shape the trajectory of
world affairs.  
   
We applaud you all for all you have done — as families, as loved ones —
to develop the Cadets that they are today.  
  
I have had the personal honor of working closely with the Coast Guard
over the years, from my time as Attorney General of California to being
Vice President of the United States.  And I know who you all are.  I
know that you Cadets possess highest level of training, professionalism,
and excellence.    
   
And, Cadets, I will then share with you my perspective on where I
believe we are in the world today, the work of the Coast Guard, and your
role in both.  
   
I will start with how I see the world.  
   
You all graduate into a world that’s going to need your leadership — one
that is full of possibility and the promise of progress.   
   
At the same time, the world you graduate into is unsettled.  It is a
world where long-established principles now stand on shaky ground, where
the rule of law in places is strained, where rules and norms are under
question.  
   
We see this in Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, where
fundamental principles are under threat – principles that are well
grounded in the belief that sovereignty and territorial integrity of all
nations must be respected, the belief that  
all people have a right to peacefully choose their own leaders, and that
borders must not be changed by force.   
   
For a time, it seemed as though these rules and norms  
would prevail.  Now, they are being called into question.  
   
And the challenges we face are broader than Russia.  
   
Around the world, we see additional attempts to undermine the
rules-based order: nations that threaten the freedom of the seas,
criminal gangs and traffickers who skirt the rule of law and fuel
corruption and violence, those that manipulate and undermine the
foundations of international commerce.  
   
When I think about protecting the security of the United States and the
world, I am clear-eyed.  One of our defining missions is to strengthen
the international rules-based order — to defend it, to promote it, and
to build on it.  
   
Over time, this order has been tried and this order has been tested. 
And far too often, I will share with you, I think we have taken it for
granted.  Frankly, sometimes we forget how rare it is in human history
to have a period of relative peace and stability among nations.  
   
We must remember, upholding a system of laws, institutions, and common
understandings — this is how we ensure the safety and security and
prosperity of the United States.  And this is how we preserve stability
in the world.  
   
Cadets, this is where you come in.  
   
In addition to the work you will do at home, you will serve a vital role
in advancing our nation’s interests abroad.  
   
For example, just last week, in Washington, D.C., I chaired a meeting
with nine leaders from Southeast Asia.  I spoke with them about the
United States Coast Guard — about you — with pride.  
   
I informed them that we are sending a new cutter to Southeast Asia to
serve as a training platform; that we are sending additional Coast Guard
personnel to help them build their law enforcement capacity; and that we
are launching new initiatives to crack down on illegal, unreported, and
unregulated fishing in the region.  
   
(Bells begin to chime.)  
   
These leaders have told me before, and they said again: Ours is a vital
partnership.  And what I will tell you, as the bells ring, is the
presence of the United States Coast Guard is a reminder to the world
that we, as the United States, are committed to a free and open
Indo-Pacific and that it is a priority for our own national security.  
   
Of course, your influence abroad extends far beyond Southeast Asia.  The
Coast Guard has more than 60 bilateral and multilateral agreements
around the world.  When you partner with these foreign governments, you
strengthen our global standing.  
   
And to be clear, if our nation is to be strong abroad, we must also be
strong at home.  And every single American, in addition to you, Cadets,
has a role to play in bettering our nation.  
   
Today is a joyous occasion, but it is impossible to ignore that we
gather mere days after a horrific act of hate in Buffalo, New York —
another despicable attack in the epidemic, I fear that may be happening,
of hate that we must condemn.   
   
I spoke earlier about international rules and norms.  But there are also
rules and norms that what — we must, as Americans, hold on to as each
other, as Americans — rules and norms founded in the belief that a harm
against any one of us is a harm against all of us; that hate and
violence have no place here in America; and that we are — we are all in
this together as one nation, undivided.  
   
I look out at you, Cadets, and I see the very best of America.  I see a
group of individuals, each with your own life experience — a group who
came together to become a strong, cohesive unit in service of the
greater good; a group bound by shared values and the belief that out of
many, one.  Enter as many, leave as one.  
   
As a nation, we’re going to count on you to hold us to that ideal.   
   
Now, as officers in our Coast Guard, you will work together as a unit,
of course, to better our nation.  And your work every day is going to
help ensure the safety, security, and prosperity of the American
people.  
   
When you serve on a cutter in the Western Pacific, you will protect the
sea and the sea lanes, where billions of dollars of trade flow.  And you
will support the jobs and livelihood of millions of Americans.   
   
When you serve at port — a port like Savannah or Long Beach — you will
ensure that families have access to the goods they need, when they need
them, at a price they can afford.   
   
This is the connection between the work you do and all that happens
around the world, right into what happens in the households of American
families.   
   
When you patrol the American shores, looking for drug traffickers, you
will help prevent harmful products from reaching our communities.   
   
When you work on critical and emerging areas like cybersecurity and the
climate crisis, you will help push our country forward into new
frontiers.   
   
In everything you do, you will embody America’s values and you will
enhance our strength as a nation, which is why your role in both the
world and the Coast Guard is so important.  
   
Class of 2020, your lived experience makes you uniquely suited for the
task at hand.  I don’t have to tell you: You are a generation that grew
up online.  In fact, your class, of course, includes the first graduates
in the history of this institution that will have a degree in cyber
systems.   (Applause.)  That’s very impressive.   
   
You came of age in a post-9/11 era defined by threats like the climate
crisis and a global health pandemic.  
   
You are familiar with a world that, frankly, feels strange and new to so
many of us.   
   
And I believe you have the ability to see what can be, unburdened by
what has been; to learn from the past, but not be limited by it; to
identify new opportunities for our Coast Guard to lead both in today’s
unsettled world and far into the bright, beautiful future.   
   
We need your perspective, and we need your expertise.  In just a few
short minutes, you will take an oath and become officers in the United
States Coast Guard.  And as you do, I ask you: Remember how you feel
right now — your excitement about this journey, your excitement about
the world, about your service, about your future.  Remember how you feel
in this moment, because that will help guide you in each of your
assignments ahead.   
   
President Biden and I have great faith in your ability.  We know you are
ready — ready to serve.  And your country is so proud of you.   
   
Congratulations again.  May God bless you.  And may God bless the United
States of America.  (Applause.)
