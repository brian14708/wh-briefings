title: "Remarks by Vice President Harris After the Senate Vote on the Women\u2019\
  s Health Protection\_Act"
---
 
Q Madam Vice President, what does this vote mean? And what is your
message to women and childbearing people in America about what’s next?

THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah, so, I just presided over the Women’s Health
Protective Act vote. And sadly, the Senate failed to stand in defense of
a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body.

And let’s be clear, the majority of the American people believe in
defending a woman’s right, her choice to decide what happens to her own
body. And this vote clearly suggests that the Senate is not where the
majority of Americans are on this issue.

It also makes clear that a priority for all who care about this issue —
a priority should be to elect pro-choice leaders at the local, the
state, and the federal level, because what we are seeing around this
country are extremist Republican leaders who are seeking to criminalize
and punish women for making decisions about their own body.

END
