3:24 P.M. EDT  
  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Hi, everyone!  Good afternoon.  Good afternoon. 
How about Marisa?  (Applause.)  Welcome.  Have a seat.  Have a seat.  
   
It’s — what a joy it’s been to be with you all of you this afternoon on
this beautiful campus with these incredible young leaders, so many of
whom we met before I walked into here just now.  And, Marisa, you’re one
of them.  
   
I say to the Administrator: When we — when we meet young leaders like we
were with this afternoon, I know the future of our national is bright,
and I feel so very optimistic.  So thank you for that.  And to all the
administrators and teachers and coaches and parents who are just raising
these beautiful leaders.  
   
And today — so we are joined with a bunch of folks who are, of course,
dedicated to building a future for all our communities:  
   
The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Michael Regan,
who is a friend, who is a colleague, who is a national and an
international leader on these issues.    
   
Mitch Landrieu, who is here, who is our infrastructure coordinator and
has been doing some of the real detailed work of making sure that
everything the President has had as a vision about the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law actually hits the streets and gets to places like
right here where we are.   
   
Congressman Don Beyer.  There you are.  It’s great to be in your
district.  Gerry Connolly, thank you for your leadership — a neighboring
district.  He said, “I’m going to kind of try and own this district
too.”  (Laughs.)  But it’s great to be with both of you because I
definitely do see you in the halls of Congress working every day for the
people of this beautiful state.  So thank you both for your
leadership.  
   
And, of course, the National Education Association President, Becky
Pringle.  (Applause.)  Thank you for your leadership.  
   
And to all the teachers — just such noble and important work that you
do.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  
   
It’s not in my notes, but I’ll tell you, just on a personal level: My
first grade teacher, Mrs. Frances Wilson — God rest her soul — attended
my law school graduation.  I love our teachers.  I love our teachers. 
(Applause.)  I love our teachers.  
   
So to everyone here, including all the local elected officials, thank
you.  
   
And, of course, we should acknowledge all the folks who are here who
work so hard to make the students of our nation thrive.  And, again, as
I mentioned, it’s the teachers, it’s the administrators, it’s the staff
members, it’s the bus drivers — (applause) — it’s the folks who work in
the cafeteria, it’s the counselors.  It’s the — it’s everyone who is
part of this incredible ecosystem of education.    
   
So we are deeply grateful to all of you.  
   
I know we have a number of students today as well.  Can I — let’s see
all the students who are here.  There — (applause) — (laughs) — there we
are.    
   
So, congratulations to you and your classmates on getting close to
finishing up the school year.  You made it.  (Laughter.)  
   
So the President and I, and many of the adults gathered here — well, we
are working hard, all of us, together, to make sure that every one of
the children in our nation — all of these students — that they have the
opportunity, that they have the resources to live up to their
extraordinary potential.  And we know the potential is there.  The
question for us as leaders and the adults is whether we are putting the
resources and the priorities into allowing our children to thrive.  
  
 And so I think about this subject of our yellow school buses in that
regard.  Because think about it: Yellow school buses are our nation’s
largest form of mass transit.  How about that?  (Applause.)  Every day —
so, yes, and let’s applaud, because it’s gets them where they need to
go.  (Laughs.)   
   
And every day then — think about this in terms of the numbers — every
day in our country, more than 25 million children ride to and from
school on our nation’s fleet of school buses.  Every day.  And 95
percent of our nearly 500,000 school buses — now here’s the point — run
on diesel fuel.  
   
Diesel exhaust is a poison.  Breathing diesel fumes can cause headaches
and nausea.  It can worsen asthma and chronic bronchitis.  It can even
elevate the risk of cancer.   
   
If your child rides the bus half an hour to school and half an hour back
every day from the first day of kindergarten to high school graduation,
they will experience the equivalent of 90 full days of exposure to
diesel exhaust.  
   
And these fumes do not just threaten the health of our children; they
also threaten the future of our planet.  
   
Diesel exhaust is a greenhouse gas.  And every year, our nation’s fleet
of school buses adds millions of tons of carbon dioxide to our
atmosphere.   
   
Yet, for far too long, the danger posed by diesel school buses to our
planet and to our children has not received the attention it deserves. 
And that is why your voices — all of you here — why your voices have
been so important.  
   
Because here today, we have a number of activists and advocates,
including many parents, who have spoken out about this problem for years
— at school board meetings, at congressional hearings, at cookouts and
block parties.  And you have demanded action.  You have demanded a
solution.  Electric school buses is a big part of that.  
   
Because, you see, electric buses, they don’t produce tailpipe
emissions.  What’s the point there?  Well, tailpipe emissions irritate
the nose and eyes, they increase susceptibility to respiratory
illnesses, and accelerate our climate crisis.  
   
And this afternoon, we had, many of us — the administrator and a number
of us — the opportunity to be inside of a — an electric school bus.  And
it was fantastic.  
  
The press actually rode on an electric school bus, just so you know.  So
I think they got the real inside feeling for what this means.  Right?  
  
 And so, what we all experienced is, on an electric school bus, on an
electric bus: no exhaust.  No diesel smell.  I just met a young leader,
V, who was talking about everything that she can smell and what she
knows, in terms of the smell of pollution.  And you know how you usually
have to raise your voice to be heard when you’re on an idling bus?  This
bus ran quiet.  
   
Now, I’ve spoken to a number of drivers, for example, who have recently
switched to electric buses.  And they stressed the importance of a quiet
engine, which is much bigger than just you can have a conversation and
hear each other; it helps the drivers hear the road, which, of course,
helps keep our children safer.   
  
Electric school buses are also safer for our children’s health and a
more sustainable planet.  And electric school bus manufacturing creates
good jobs here in America.  That is why, for years, I have fought to
invest in electric buses.  
   
And as a United States senator, I introduced the first bill to invest
exclusively in zero-emission school buses.  We called it the Clean
School Bus Act.  (Applause.)  With a lot of moms.  
   
And as Vice President, I’ve worked closely with our partners in Congress
— these two congressmen in particular — during the drafting of the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to make sure that our nation prioritizes
this work as what we know is connected to the health and wellbeing of
our children, their education, and also, what we can do to see the
future in terms of innovation and manufacturing right here in the United
States.  
  
And so, today, as you’ve heard from the Administrator, we are announcing
$500 million in clean bus funding to go to schools across the country.  
   
Starting today, every school district in our nation can apply for
funding to purchase clean buses and to build the charging infrastructure
that we need to build across our country.   
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Yeah!  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  (Laughs.)  (Applause.)  
   
So, this funding is just the first part of the $5 billion we will invest
in clean school buses over the next five years through the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law.  Five billion dollars in five years.  
   
This investment, we believe, will be transformative for so many
people.  
   
Transformative for the parents of children with asthma and other
respiratory illnesses who will soon be able to walk their child to the
bus stop without worrying that the diesel fumes could trigger an asthma
attack.  For those of us who have had to take a child to the emergency
room because of asthma, we know what that fear feels like, what it
means.  
   
Transformative for the teachers working bus duty who will no longer have
to stand in a cloud of exhaust while they’re saying goodbye to their
students.   
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Mm-hmm.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Mm-hmm.  (Laughter.)  I heard the teachers. 
(Laughs.)  
   
Transformative for the school districts that will be able to use the
money that they would have had to spend filling up the buses with gas to
instead hire more teachers, to raise salaries — (applause) — or to
renovate classrooms — and renovate those classrooms not at this school,
but at many schools around the country that are in desperate need of
repair.  
   
And this investment will be transformative also for the workers of our
nation.  It will create good-paying jobs in communities across our
nation.  
   
You know, today, already, thousands of American workers are doing this
work.  I’ve seen it.  I’ve seen it firsthand.  It’s the work of building
the frames and the batteries and the tires for these buses.  Highly
skilled work, highly trained individuals doing this work right here at
home.  
   
In fact, last year, I visited the Thomas Built Buses factory in North
Carolina and talked with members of United Auto Workers Local 52-87, who
built the bus that I just was on.  I toured their factory floor and
spoke to electricians and engineers and machinists and mechanics.   
   
And we talked about what we’re all talking about right now: Electric
school buses, and electric vehicles in general, are the future.  
  
You know, I’ve been — among the many things that I do as Vice President
— meeting with world leaders.  I was just, earlier today, on a call with
President Macron of France.  Earlier this week, I was in the United Arab
Emirates.  The President and I just hosted the President of Finland and
the Prime Minister of Sweden.  
  
One of the things that we talk about often, with pride about who are as
America, is we really do think about the future and how can we be smart
in investing in the future.   
   
And one of the things that I love about this issue and what you all are
doing here in this community is it is about an investment in the future,
knowing, one, that when we invest in our children, we’re investing in
the future; and when we invest in innovation, when we invest in the
future of America’s workforce, when we invest in building the skills of
America’s workforce, we are investing in the future.    
  
These things are all connected.  But the future is not inevitable.  We
have to build it together.  We have to do this together.  
   
And so let us continue to do what we are doing and, on this very
subject, create a future in which every school bus in our nation is
zero-emission.  
  
I know that we all know this will be a safer and a healthier future for
every child in every community.  
   
So, thank you all again for what you have done and what you will
continue to do.  
  
May God bless you, and may God bless America.  Thank you all. 
(Applause.)
