7:06 P.M. EDT  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Please sit,
everyone.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.  
   
What an incredible room.  And, Judy Chu, thank you for that introduction
and for your leadership on so many levels.  
   
Tonight is a rough night.  We planned for a great celebration, but I’m
sure most of you have heard the tragic news about what has happened in
Texas.  
   
So I had prepared comments about tonight, which I will speak, but I just
first want to begin by saying a few words about the tragedy that
occurred today in Uvalde, Texas.  
   
As many of you now, the reports are that there was a mass shooting at an
elementary school, and the preliminary reports are that 14 children have
been killed.  And the details are still coming in, and of course the
President and I are monitoring the situation closely.  
   
So while we don’t know all the details yet, we do know that there are
parents who have lost children, families that have lost children and
their loves ones, of course, and many others who may have been
injured.  
   
So, I would normally say in a moment like this — we would all say
naturally — that our hearts break, but our hearts keep getting
broken.   
   
You know, I think so many — there’s so many elected leaders in this
room.  You know what I’m talking about.  Every time a tragedy like this
happens, our hearts break, and our broken hearts are nothing compared to
the broken hearts of those families.  And yet, it keeps happening.  
   
So, I think we all know and have said many times with each other: Enough
is enough.  Enough is enough.  
   
As a nation, we have to have the courage to take action and understand
the nexus between what make for reasonable and sensible public policy to
ensure something like this never happens again.  
   
So, the President will speak more about this later.  But for now, I will
just say to the people of Uvalde: Please know that this is a room full
of leaders who grieve with you.  And we are praying for you, and we
stand with you.  
   
And it is difficult at a time like this to think about much else, but I
do look around this room and I know who is here, and I know this is a
room full of American leaders who know and have the courage to take a
stand.   
   
And so let us, tonight, as we do every time we all get together,
recommit ourselves to having the courage to take action.  
   
And so that does bring me to the leaders who are in this room and the
leaders of APAICS.  And, again, I want to thank Chairwoman Judy Chu for
that kind introduction.  As a former member of CAPAC, I had the
opportunity to see her leadership firsthand, and she is truly a national
leader who lifts up the people of our country.  
   
And, of course, I’m honored tonight to be with Congresswoman Marilyn
Strickland; APAICS Board Chair Susan Jin Davis; and all of the federal,
state, and local elected officials who are here; and so many friends and
former colleagues.  
   
So this is the first time APAICS has gathered without the great
Secretary Norman Mineta, who I all know — I know we all miss.  And, you
know, Norm showed us what a leader could be.  I loved Norm.  I knew
Norm.  (Applause.)   
   
As a kid who group up — I think I see Norm’s family here.  There you
are.  I — as a kid who grew up in the Bay Area, I was born in the Bay
Area, Norm Mineta was a legend.  He was a legend.  In fact, many of you
may know — his family knows — my brother-in-law Tony West, who some of
you have worked with over the years, he was an intern in
then-Congressman Mineta’s office when Tony was a very, very mature
11-year-old.  (Laughter.)  Because that’s the kind of leader Norm Mineta
was.  
   
He, if he were here, would have great expectations of us in terms of
what this moment requires of us as leaders.  But throughout his life, as
long as any of us have known him — and we will carry our knowledge of
him and memory — he never thought that anyone was too young or too small
to deserve his attention and concern and investment.  
  
That’s the kind of leader Norm Mineta was.  He was a leader who
understood what is possible and a leader who understood what must be.  
  
And as I think about it, going forward, I say that, you know, Norm is
somebody who had the ability to — out of great sacrifice, out of great
tragedy — always still be so optimistic about who we are as a country.  
  
As we all know, he endured — through his own life experiences, along
with approximately 120,000 other Japanese Americans — virtual
incarceration.  We called it, for many years, “internment.”  
  
But Norm — but Norm decided that he understood the power of a
government; that he endured, he understood what a government could do. 
And he said — because he was the kind of leader — “I’m going to go
inside.  I’m going to run for office.  I’m going to hold office.  And
I’m going to lead with a sense of optimism about the best of who we
are.”  
  
Norm saw America’s during one — saw America during one of our darkest
hours.  And even so, he never gave up on our country.  
   
Instead, he chose to devote his career to public service.  And he worked
tirelessly to make our nation stronger, safer, and more just.  And he
was relentless in his efforts to bring together the AANHPI community in
pursuit of a better future.  
   
As he once said — and I will quote — “If we will act together, then we
are strong enough to withstand any evil, internal or external, that
threatens to unravel this beautiful tapestry that is America.”  This
room.  
   
After the events of today and the last two weeks in Buffalo, Laguna
Woods, and Dallas, Norm’s words take on a new sense of urgency.  
   
Today, we are witnessing, again and again, the terrible consequences of
hate and the consequences of violence.  But let’s not lose sight of the
beautiful tapestry that Norm spoke of.  
   
Because I do believe our country still embodies a most profound belief:
That we are in this together, as one nation undivided.  Out of many,
one.  
   
And so, this is a moment that calls on us to take action.  A moment once
again for all of us to join together in the collective fight against
hate and toward a better future for all people.  
  
And now I’m speaking specifically of the events — not today — that have
occurred though, in the last couple of weeks and for years before.  
   
For nearly three decades, APAICS has done the outstanding work to
promote AA and NHPI participation and representation in all levels of
government.  
   
We know our country is stronger and more just when policies reflect the
experiences and the perspectives of all people.  
   
We know that Asian Americans need to be in the rooms where decisions are
being made.  (Applause.)  That Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders
need to be in the room where decisions are made.  (Applause.)  We know
and have devoted our lives to understand the words when we say,
“Participation and access matter.”  It’s a lived experience for us.  
  
And I know, of course — like so many of you — I know firsthand what it
is like to be in the rooms where decisions are being made and be the
only person who looks like you or who has had your life experience.   
  
And so, I will remind us all that in those moments, we must always
remember — and I will say to you, those of you especially who are
starting out in your role of leadership: When you are in those rooms,
please remember you are never alone.  Look around this room and hold
onto the image to remember we are all in that room with you.   
   
And always remember, then, that what comes with that experience is also,
of course, a responsibility to know and remember that we carry the
voices of so many who are not in the room — and perhaps have never been
in the room — to carry those voices with us and to remind each other
always that we are in this together, supporting each other.  
  
And most importantly, I believe it is very much a part of the spirit of
this organization and its work to remember our collective responsibility
to speak up for everyone who is not in the room, for those voices must
be heard.   
  
So this is a unique responsibility that all of us here carry.  However,
it should not be ours alone.  It falls on every American, and especially
all of our elected officials, regardless of their party affiliation, to
fight for the promise of equal justice under law.  
  
And it will take all of us working together to uplift our nation.  And
slowly but surely, I’m confident that we, as elected leaders, are making
progress.  
  
And I know Judy mentioned it and I’ll just remind us all — think about
it: Just one year ago, members of Congress from both parties came
together to pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act.  
   
It was based on a resolution that I had introduced — (applause) — right?
— that I had introduced when I was senator, together with the phenomenal
Mazie Hirono, the phenomenal Tammy Duckworth — (applause) — condemning
the rise of anti-Asian sentiment in our country.  
   
And as I stood, then, later — a year later almost — as Vice President
with President Joe Biden in the East Room that day, while he signed the
bill into law, I looked around and I saw all the people in that room,
including many of whom are here today, who fought to ensure that this
law would be a significant step forward.  
  
We have seen progress.  And that law, of course, now provides resources
and training for law enforcement to accurately identify and report hate
crime.  And it addresses language and cultural barriers that make it
difficult for AA and NHPI communities to report those crimes.  
   
As of this month, hate crime resources are now available in 18 of the
most commonly spoken Asian languages.  But we know we have hundreds; I
know that too, so — but — (laughter) — it’s a start.  
   
And our administration has taken steps to address not only that which
holds us back but that which moves us forward.  
   
We have created over 8 million jobs since taking office — a
record-setting pace of job creation.  (Applause.)  We did that
together.  
   
Together, we all passed an historic infrastructure law that is already
delivering results for the American people and lowering costs for
working families through initiatives like the Affordable Connectivity
Program so more families can access high-speed Internet.  
   
And our administration is determined to increase representation.  We
have appointed AA and NHPI Americans at every level in our government. 
And we appointed and confirmed more AA and NHPI judges during our first
year than any other administration.  (Applause.)  
   
So, I’ll close with this: In spite of the obstacles that we face along
the way, the strength of our country has always been that we fight to
move forward — from injustice to justice, from darkness to light.  
   
And together, in spite of whatever the challenges may be, let us remain
focused on the path forward to a better future for all people.  Let us
remain focused on what many of you have heard me say all the time: Let
us remain focused on what can be — and our vision, collectively, of what
can be — unburdened by what has been.  
  
That is the beauty and the strength of this organization and the leaders
in this room.   
  
Thank you all.  God bless.  (Applause.)
