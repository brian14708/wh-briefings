  Mondale"

2:44 P.M. CDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you, Amy.  What Fritz is really saying
looking down is, “Joe, hide your Irish Catholic enthusiasm a little bit
and be more Norwegian.”  (Laughter.)   
   
A generous introduction.  You know, we got a chance to talk with the
family a little bit earlier and trying to console them, and I got
emotional.  But as my Grandfather Finnegan would say, “That’s the Irish
of it.”  
   
You know, I served with Fritz a long time.  He became a good and close
friend.  I was a kid when I got elected.  I wasn’t even old to be sworn
in.  I was only 29 years old.  And because everything is based on
seniority in the Senate, I got to hang out with folks like Fritz and
Hubert long before you’d ordinarily at my age — because by the time I
was there a second term, I was chairman of some major committees.   
   
And so, I’m going to talk more today about Fritz and what he pretend
didn’t exist but Fritz’s — Fritz’s sense of empathy.  Fritz had a
special way about him that I don’t think he would talk about.  I could
be wrong, but I never heard him talk about it.   
   
You know, there was a question that Fritz famously asked staffers who
came to work for him.  He’d say, “On the breakfast plate, what’s the
difference between the eggs and the bacon?”  Senator Smith and Klobuchar
know the answer.  (Laughter.)  
   
By supplying the eggs, the chicken made a contribution.  The hog was
fully committed.  (Laughter and applause.)  
   
And it always surprised Fritz I knew a little about agriculture. 
Delaware, my state, has a — and the Delmarva Peninsula has a $5 billion
industry: chickens.  A lot of chickens.  A hell of a lot more chickens
than people.  And it’s the biggest industry.   
   
But Fritz was always committed not merely to the work of his lifetime,
which all of you are familiar with.  Most people know, most of all,
everybody was blessed to know him in this state.  
   
You know, Reverend Hart-Andersen, members of Congress and our military,
distinguished guests; most of all, the Mondale family — Ted and William,
and Rebecca and Chan; all the grandchildren — Louis, Amanda, Berit,
Charlotte, Cassandra, Danielle; and all the dear friends of the family
that are here as well, because he always talked about you all as family:
I’m — I’m moved to be with you here today as an — honor one of the great
giants in American history.  And that’s not hyperbole.  Fritz was a
giant in American political history.   
   
You know, a great American who — but he also had a lot of great
Americans write about him and write things that related to him without
them even knowing it.  
   
The great American novelist Edith Wharton wrote, “There are two ways of
spreading light: to be a candle or the mirror that reflects it.”  Fritz
was both the candle and the mirror, in my view — a candle spreading
light and the mirror reflecting it.  
   
And today, I speak of a friend of five decades, about that light — the
light of friendship and what it meant to me personally, to my family.  
   
Fritz and I first met in one of the darkest moments of my life.  I had
not intended to run for the United States Senate.  I was involved — my
state, it was a great shame, was segregated by law.  We have the
eighth-largest Black population in America as a percent of population in
Delaware.   
   
I got involved in politics indirectly by getting involved in the Civil
Rights Movement as a kid, being the only white employee in east side of
Wilmington, an area called “The Bucket,” for years.   
   
And I was asked by a group of senior Democrats would I — I was a young
lawyer when I came back from law school.  And we were the only city in
America occupied by the National Guard for 10 months, with every corner
being occupied by National Guard members with a drawn bayonet because of
Dr. King’s assassination and the riots that took place in my home
state.  
   
And I had a job with one of the oldest law firms in the state — a “white
shoe,” as they used to call the law firm.  And after being home for six
months, I couldn’t do it anymore.  And I left and tried to — sought a
job as a public defender to represent the people I used to work with in
the — as a kid in high school and college.   
   
And so, I came to the United States Senate with a passion to do
something about civil rights.  And when I was elected, I ran initially
for the group — with a group I joined, a group of senior members of the
United States of the Delaware Democratic establishment to reform the
Democratic Party, because we were more a southern Democratic Party than
a northeastern Democratic Party.  You used to be able to be joined — the
Southern Governors’ Conference with the Mid-Atlantic Conference.  And
Democratic governors joined the Southern Governors’ Conference.  
   
But I couldn’t bring myself to be a Republican, even though they were
more progressive because of Richard Nixon when I registered.   
   
But I was asked to head up a committee of younger people to try to get
someone to run for the United States Senate against a guy who was a
decent guy, actually.  A little too conservative, but a decent guy.  And
one thing led to another, and I ended up being asked to run for the
Senate.  I had no intention of running for the Senate.  
   
But two years earlier, I had been elected to the county council.  And
Delaware is like a miniature Illinois.  One county is 60 percent of the
state’s population.  So, the councilperson — I represented a district
seven times as large as a state representative and three times as large
as a state senator.   
   
And I ran and won.  I ran only to be a good soldier to try to get out
Democrats voting.  And I wasn’t supposed to win.  The only reason I ran
— I was certain I wasn’t going to rin \[sic\] — win — because I didn’t
want to be a county councilman.  (Laughter.)  I wanted — I was just
setting up a law firm as a young senator — as a young man, I should
say.  
   
And so, what happened was I won in a district that was like 55, 56
percent Republican.  No Democrat had ever won.  Republicans saw
something in me I didn’t see: They saw someone who may want to go on and
run for office beyond that, so they reapportioned me from a four-year
term to a two-year term (inaudible) 65 percent district.   
   
And I was put in a position of up or out.  And a group of senior members
— a former governor, a former United States Senator, a former
congressman, and the chief justice of the — retired chief justice of the
Supreme Court, whose family had more senators than any family in
American history.  And they came to me — an off-year convention.  
   
I’ll never forget I was — how classic it was.  I was — there was a break
in the convention in Dover, Delaware.  I was at a little motel nearby.
 Had to — to go back and change with the younger people I was with.  And
I had my own room.  And, you know, the typical kind of — you drive up to
the front door, two headboards nailed on the wall, a desk nailed to the
other wall, and an 8 by 10 bathroom.  
   
So I was in, shaving.  I had my towel around.  Man, I just got a shower
and shaving, and I — there’s banging at the door. And I thought it was
one of those — a guy named Bob Cunningham was with me.  I said, “All
right, all right, all right.”  I went to the door and opened the door. 
There was a former two-term governor named Elbert –- Elbert Carvel, a
former congressman named Harrison, and the state chairman, and a former
chief justice.   
   
And I’m standing in a towel, shaving, and my — (laughter) — and the rest
of me stark naked.  And I said — they said, “We want to talk to you,
Joe.”  So I said, “Well, come in, gentlemen.”  I ran into the bathroom,
take off the shaving cream, hoping I can find something to put on.  I
had nothing to put on.  (Laughter.)  
   
So I came back out and I leaned against that desk and with a towel
around me.  I said, “Yes, gentlemen?”  (Laughter.)  And they said, “Joe,
we just had dinner.  We think you should run for the Senate.”  And I
said, “But…”  And the chief justice — former Chief Justice (inaudible)
said that.  I said, “Sir.”  I said, “I’m — I’m not old enough.”  He
said, “Joe, you obviously didn’t do very well on constitutional law.” 
(Laughter.)  I’m thinking, “Holy God, what did I do now?”  (Laughter.) 
And he said, “You only have to be 30 to be sworn in.  They can elect you
whenever you want.  You’ll be 30 seventeen days later.  
   
Well, I ran, and, to the shock and surprise of everybody, I won by a
staggering 3,100 votes.   
   
But here’s the point: I showed up on December 18th to hire staff.  I
hadn’t been sworn in yet.  And what happened was that I had gotten a
phone call that day from my fire department in Delaware.  And they put a
poor young woman on the phone who said, “You got to come home.  There’s
been an accident.”  And she went on to tell me — the poor kid had to
tell me there was an accident.  I asked, “What happened?”  She said,
“Your wife and daughter are dead, and your two boys may not make it.”   
   
And, you know, the last thing I wanted to do was go to the United States
Senate after that.  We had elected a governor — a Democrat.  He could
appoint a Democrat.  And I had my brother talking to him about who we’d
appoint.   
   
But there was Fritz and Joan.  They embraced me, cont- — contacted me. 
And it’s not just being nice, but bringing me in.  They came to the
hospital to see my boys.  They helped me find my purpose in a sea of
darkness and pain.  
   
And along — I was with Fritz, along with Mike Mansfield and Teddy
Kennedy and a few others who all came to see me and said, “Just come six
months.  You can go home after that.  We need you.”  We had 58
Democrats; they didn’t need me for a damn thing.  (Laughter.)  No, I’m
serious.  But I was so — such a rookie I thought, “Maybe they need me to
organize.”  (Laughter.)  
   
And they said, “Then you can leave.”   
   
And I used to show up every Tuesday at three o’clock in the Senate
chamber to get an assignment from Senator Mansfield.  Many times, Fritz
would walk me over.  And I thought all freshmen got assignments.  I
didn’t know that nobody gets an assignment in the Senate.  (Laughter.) 
It wasn’t until about five months or three months in that I realized
that was the case.   
   
But they kept me engaged.  They helped me get up when it was easy to
give up.  
   
My life changed again five years later.  No man deserves one great love
in his life, let alone two, but I met and married Jill Biden.  I had to
ask her five times.  (Laughter.)  True.  But being a spouse of a Senator
who was relatively well known, because of the celebrity of how I got
there and the accident, and inheriting two beautiful young boys wasn’t
easy.   
   
Once again, Fritz and Joan were there — were there spreading the light. 
Joan was one of the first people to reach out to Jill, and it meant the
world to us.  It meant the world.   
   
You just heard from my friend, Jon Meacham, Fritz was a master
legislator who shone a light on those who needed it most.  The desire to
lift up others stemmed from his youth, from his service as a corporal in
the U.S. Army, and those early days organizing for Hubert Humphrey in
parts of Minnesota that Democrats didn’t win.  
   
Fritz learned early the power of bringing people together.  And I know
that Fritz — for Fritz, no moment was brighter than when he joined
forces — because I was with him; I was just a bit player — with an
African American senator from — Massachusetts Senator Edward Brooke and
they passed the Fair Housing Act.  
   
I was on the same side — the same side of the chamber in the back where
Fritz was.  I remember the look on his face — literally remember the
look on his face.  Opened up neighborhoods diminished by segregation for
so long.  When the act passed, Fritz spoke on the Senate floor.  And he
said that, quote, “The words ‘justice’ and ‘fairness’ will mean more to
millions of our fellow Americans than they do — will never — meant more
to our fellow Americans than they do today.”  
   
That was Fritz spreading light, the light of our country, to families
who had never truly known its warmth.  
   
At every stage of our lives, at every inflection point, Fritz and Joan —
I apologize, as we say in the Senate, for the, you know, point of
personal privilege here — but they were there for Jill and me and my
family — not on a political level, but on a personal level.  It was true
that my — first days in the Senate when I needed help very badly, and it
was true in my last days in the Senate as well.  
   
In 2008 — and Fritz and I had become close friends, and I sought his
counsel many times — I was asked to join the ticket with Barack Obama.  
   
I was, as I usually was, on Amtrak going home.  I commuted every day. 
They later told me over 1,200,000 miles on Amtrak.  They should name a
station or something after me.  (Laughter.)  
   
But all kidding aside, he called me after it was clear he was the de
facto nominee.  And he said he’d liked me to join him on the ticket, at
least consider it; could he do a background check on me.  You know, we
have to do that background check.  And I said, “No thanks, Barack.”  I
thought he was just dragging that bloody (inaudible) through the Senate
like president — presidential nominees do to get everybody excited and
involved.   
   
And Barack told me, “No, no, no, there’s only one other person I’m
considering.”  I said, “Barack, I don’t want to be Vice President.”  He
said, “Why?”  I said, “Because you’re basically just standby
equipment.”  (Laughter.)  I said, “What I want to do — I’m — I’m…”  And
by that time, I had chaired two major committees.  I was fairly
influential in the Senate.  I said, “I can help you a lot more as a
senator.  I’ll do everything I can.  I’ll campaign throughout the
country for you.”   
   
Barack to- — asked me — he said, “Look, would you go home and talk it
over with your family?  Just talk it over.”   
   
So I did.  I called Jill from the train on my cell phone. And when I got
home — I was about halfway home when I had gotten the call.  And when I
got home, I went in.  And the first person I called was Fritz before the
family gathered in the back porch.  And I asked — I said, “Fritz, what
should I do?”  And he went into great detail.  (Laughter.)  I’m
serious.  As a matter of fact, he sent me a long memorandum he prepared
for President Carter when they were deciding how the relationship would
work.   
   
He told me, in essence, that the vice presidency holds no inherent
power.  None.  Zero.  The Vice President is merely — and it’s true — a
reflection of your relationship with the President of the United
States.  
   
About seven years ago, I joined Fritz at a forum in his honor at George
Washington University.  Fritz recounted that his greatest strength
wasn’t his expertise in a particular policy area; it was the genuine
personal relationship he built with President Jimmy Carter — a
relationship built on real affection and trust.  
   
They sat down for lunch together every week.  Fritz said, “Make sure you
get a commitment from Barack: Once a week, you have lunch to discuss
whatever is on either of your minds.”   
   
He was the first Vice President to have an office in the West Wing, just
a few steps away from the Oval Office.  That never happened before. 
They were over in the Executive Office Building across the street.   
   
That was the true strength of the vice presidency he said, a strength
that Barack and I replicated in our time in office and what I’m — Kamala
and I are doing today.  And she sends her regards to the whole family. 
She called me before I got in the plane.    
   
It was Fritz who lit the way.  His core — at his core, Fritz embraced
everybody with a belief that everyone is entitled to be treated with
dignity — everybody.  Dignity.  Not just the right to vote, dignity.   
   
He was loved by the American people because he reflected the goodness of
the American people, especially the people of Minnesota.  
   
You know, every senator wears on his or her sleeve the state they
serve.  But the love Fritz had for the people of Minnesota ran deeper
than that.  He loved you all, and you loved him back — it was obvious —
because Fritz reflected the very best qualities of this state: the
warmth and optimism that you reflect.  
   
At every turn, Fritz reflected the light of this nation, who we are and
what we can be.  He called me when I had said in the inauguration that
we’re the most unique nation in all of history.  We’re the only nation
founded on an idea.  Every other nation in the world is based on
geography, ethnicity, religion, race.  We’re founded on an idea.  “We
hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created
equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights,
including the right to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.”  And it
goes on.  
   
Fritz believed that in his gut.  I watched him every day for over 35
years in the Senate and when he was Vice President.  He united people,
sharing the same light, the same hopes.  Even when we disagree, he
thought that was important.   
   
I’ll never forget, on a personal level, what it meant to have a friend
like Fritz.  Less than four years after losing Eleanor to brain cancer
and just a year after losing Joan, Fritz was there to help me again when
Jill and I lost our son Beau to brain cancer after a year in Iraq.  
   
I’ll never forget how Fritz reflected so much love and light into our
family — again, at our darkest moments — nor will I forget coming here
to Minneapolis eight years ago to say goodbye to Joan.   
   
Most of you remember that Fritz went to the Mayo Clinic for quadruple
bypass the very next day.  He had delayed the surgery so he could be
with all of us to reflect her light.  And he put off treating his own
heart because, as all you know, his heart belonged to Joan.   
   
As I’ve said many times — I say to the family, seeing your mom and dad
together reminded me of that great line from Christopher Marlowe’s poem:
“Come live with me and be my love, and we shall all the pleasures
prove.”  
   
You can tell when a couple has been together a long time.  So looks at
each other with love — deep love.     
   
It’s been said that memory is the power to gather roses in winter. 
Well, Ted and William, your dad blessed you with an endless garden of
those memories and, most of all, the memory of two extraordinary loves:
a love of more than 58 years he spent together with your mom, and a love
of 51 years with your sister, Eleanor.  
   
In his farewell letter, Fritz wrote that he was eager to rejoin Joan and
Eleanor, two unbreakable loves.   
   
You know, Jill Biden wanted to do a garden at the Vice President’s
Residence — a picture of which shows on the screen outside here that I’m
standing in front of the Residence — so that every family that ever had
lived there, there was a garden with stones and engraving on each of the
stones with the name of the — the couple and the children.   
   
When I called Fritz to tell him about it, he came over to the house. 
And it was a summer day.  And he wanted — he said, “Can we go in the
house?”  I said, “Of course.”  He wanted to walk up to the third floor. 
He walked up to the third floor and then, to the end, there are bedrooms
in the third floor.   
   
And he stopped in front of a door and opened it and just stared.  And I
knew he was thinking something deep, and I went down the hallway.  And a
few minutes — a few minutes went by and he came down.  And he said,
“That was Eleanor’s room.  I so miss her.”   
   
Well, they’re all together now, for all time.   
   
Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, “An institution is the lengthened shadow of
one man.”  
   
There is no doubt that the institution of the Senate and the institution
— the institution of the Vice President reflect the profound legacy of
Fritz Mondale.  
   
But it’s not a lengthened shadow we see in those places; it’s his
light.  And it’s up to each of us now to reflect that light that Fritz
was all about, to reflect Fritz’s goodness and grace, the way he made
people feel no matter who you were.  
   
Just imagine what our nation could achieve if we followed Fritz’s
example of honor, decency, integrity, literally just the service to the
common good.  There would be nothing — nothing, nothing, nothing beyond
our reach.  
   
I hope we all can be Fritz’s mirror, continue to spread his light. 
Because you know he was one of the finest men you’ve ever known, one of
the most decent people I ever dealt with, and one of the toughest,
smartest men I’ve ever worked with.    
   
You were lucky to have had him.  (Inaudible) look at things, he was
lucky to have had you.   
   
God bless you, my dear friend.  Among the greatest of all Americans.   
   
The highest compliment, my Grandfather Finnegan used to say, you can
give a man or a woman — he was — the Irish of it is to say, “He’s a good
man.”   
   
Fritz Mondale was a good man.  (Applause.)
