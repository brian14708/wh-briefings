title: "Remarks by Vice President Harris Before Air Force Two\_Departure"

*Joint Base Andrews  
*Prince George’s County, Maryland**

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Hi.  So, we are — I’m leading a delegation on
behalf of the President and our administration to express our
condolences.   
  
The United States takes quite seriously the strength of our relationship
and partnership with UAE.  And we are going there, then, to express our
condolences, but also as an expression of our commitment to the strength
of that relationship and continuing to strengthen that relationship.  
  
I’ll speak also about what happened in Buffalo.  It’s horrendous.  It’s
horrendous.  In our country, we have to recognize that we may very well
be experiencing an epidemic of hate towards so many Americans that is
wrong.  It is taking on a level of violence — in the case of what
happened in Buffalo, and we’ve seen it in other places in our country. 
And we all must speak out against it.  
  
Hate against any one of us, we should interpret as being hate against
all of us, as a nation.  We are a nation that prides ourselves on our
diversity as an element of our strength.  And to see what has happened
yesterday —  
  
An 86-year-old grandmother who had just been taking care of her husband
in a nursing home, was just going to get some groceries.  
  
A security guard who dedicated his life as a law enforcement officer and
was known in the community to be one of the kindest, most gentle people,
who showed extraordinary heroism.  
  
I think we all have to know that this is something that we have to not
only speak about, but we’ve got to do everything in our power as a
nation to stop it — to stop it.  There’s too much at stake that we
should be working at and thinking about, not hating one another.  
  
END
