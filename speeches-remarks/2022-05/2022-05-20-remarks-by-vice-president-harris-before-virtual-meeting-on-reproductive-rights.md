THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, everyone.  And thank you all for
joining us.   
  
We gather today to talk about Roe v. Wade — a decision that has
protected a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body.  For
nearly half a century this deci- — this decision has been in
existence.  
   
Earlier this month, we learned that the United States Supreme Court is
poised to strike down Roe.  
   
If they do, it will be the first time in the last 50 years, at least,
that the Court has recognized a constitutional right only to take it
away.  
   
The strength of our country has always been that we fight to move
forward, that we believe in the expansion of rights, not the restriction
of rights.  So this, when and if it happens, will be an extreme step
backward, and it represents a threat not just to women, but to all
Americans.  
   
The right to privacy that forms the basis of Roe is the same right to
privacy that protects the right to use contraception and the right to
marry the person you love, including a person of the same sex.  
   
Overturning Roe opens the door to restricting those rights.  It would be
a direct assault on the fundamental right to self-determination, to live
and love without interference from the government.  
   
At its core, this is about our future as a nation, about whether we live
in a country where the government can interfere in personal decisions. 
This is about our future.  
   
Yet at the same time, we cannot deny that this decision will have real
and immediate effects on women around our country.  
   
So I am here today, joined by doctors, nurses, and leading advocates who
are on the frontlines against this war on women’s rights.  
   
Just half an hour ago, in Oklahoma, the state legislature passed one of
the most extreme abortion bans in the country — a ban that would outlaw
abortion from the moment of fertilization.  
   
Now, think about that for a second: from the moment of fertilization.  
   
It’s outrageous, and it’s just the latest in a series of extreme laws
around the country.  
   
Several of the medical professionals joining us today are seeing the
impact of these laws that are designed to punish and control women.  
  
Like many of you, I have spent my entire career fighting for women’s
health, safety, and wellbeing.  
   
The power a woman has to make decisions about her own body, I believe,
is directly connected to her power to make decisions about her future.  
   
I look forward to discussing how we can all work together to make sure
women in all of the states in our country have access to the healthcare
they need.  
   
Thank you all.  I look forward to our discussion.
