title: Remarks by Vice President Harris Before Air Force Two Departure
---
 
Abu Dhabi International Airport Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  So, we have been here — and I am here leading the
presidential delegation on behalf of the President and the American
people and our administration to express our condolences to a friend and
to a partner, the United Arab Emirates; to express congratulations also
to the new president; and to reaffirm the shared commitment we have to
security and prosperity in this region and also how the American people
have benefitted from this relationship in terms of security and
prosperity.  
  
And so, we were here to discuss the strength of that partnership and
that friendship and our commitment, going forward, to continue to work
at the strength of that relationship.  
     Thank you.
