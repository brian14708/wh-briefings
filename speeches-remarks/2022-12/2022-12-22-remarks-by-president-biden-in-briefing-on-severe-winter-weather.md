THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, this is going to be brief, folks.   
   
The storm — extreme cold weather — you can see it on the map the
estimated areas where they’re at the — you know, as low as 50 degrees;
where it’s that dark red, it’s below zero.  You know, it’s dangerous and
threatening.  This is really a very serious weather alert here.  And it
goes from Oklahoma all the way to Wyoming, and Wyoming to Maine.  And
it’s of real consequence.  
   
So I encourage everyone — everyone, please heed the local warnings. 
We’ve contacted — we’ve tried to contact 26 governors so far in affected
regions.   
   
And — and go to Weather.gov — Weather.gov for more information.  
   
And I know this is — you know, it’s like — this is not like a snow day,
you know, when you were a kid; this is serious stuff.   
   
And my team is prepared to help communities weather this — no pun
intended — this storm, this — this freeze, and — because we need to
cope.  They need to be able to cope if it’s necessary.   
   
I’m going to, shortly, be briefed by — by both FEMA and the National
Weather Service, and we’re going to start that briefing.  
   
And — but in the meantime, please take this storm extremely seriously. 
And I don’t know whether your bosses will let you, but if you all have
travel plans, leave now.  Not — not a joke.  I’m tell- — sending my
staff — my staff, if they have plans to leave on — tomorrow — late
tonight or tomorrow, I’m telling them to leave now.  They can talk to me
on the phone.  It’s not life and death.  But it will be if they don’t —
if they don’t get out, they may not get out.  
   
So, any rate, thank you all for coming in, and I’m going to do the
briefing now.  Thank you.  
   
(Cross-talk.)  
   
Thank you.  If I don’t see you, Merry Christmas.
