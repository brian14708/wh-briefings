East Room

7:16 P.M. EST  
  
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Good evening.  Hello, hello.  Good evening,
everyone.   
  
My name is Joe Biden.  I am Jill Biden’s husband.  And welcome.  All of
you, welcome to the White House.  
  
And, you know, we saw — as you saw coming in, we’ve decorated the
holidays around a theme, which every year the President picks a theme or
the First Lady picks a theme for the holidays.  And the theme this year
was “We the People.”  
  
These are the first words of our Constitution and the very idea of
America.  And they’re the leading words of many of your constitutions,
for: We the people of Kenya.  We the people of Namibia.  We the people
of Liberia.  We the people of the  
Federal Republic of Niger.  And so many others.  
  
“We the People” reminds us that our countries’ greatest strength lies in
just that: our people.  Our people lie at the heart of the deep and
profound connection that forever binds Africa and the United States
together.  
  
We remember the stolen men and women and children who were brought to
our shores in chains, subjected to unimaginable cruelty.  
  
My nation’s original sin was that period.   
  
We honor their descendants, who our generations have — for generations
have helped build this country and propel it to higher heights, leading
the charge, blazing new trails, and forging a better future for everyone
in America.  
  
We celebrate an African diaspora community in the United States,
millions strong, pulling <s>America</s> \[Africa\] and the United States
together in the tight embrace of family.  
  
I might add that includes my former boss, a man I was honored to serve
with, Barack Obama — beside him for eight years — who convened the first
U.S.-African Leaders Summit back when he was President.  
  
As leaders, our people inspire us.  They awaken us — they awaken in us
the possibilities that are within our grasp.  And there are so many
possibilities if we work together.    
  
They tell us hard truths that we need to hear.  And sometimes, we have
trouble listening.  
  
They challenge us to live up to the values enshrined in so many of our
founding documents and to be worthy of the responsibility given to us by
that sacred trust, “We the People.”  
  
In my years of being engaged in politics and in international relations,
I have never been more optimistic — and I mean it sincerely — I have
never been more optimistic about our shared future, because our people —
because particularly of our young people in all our countries.  
  
Together, we can deliver a world that is healthier and safer, more
equal, more just, more prosperous, and more filled with opportunity for
everyone.  
  
So please join me in raising your glass — if I can find one.  (Laughs.) 
This is mine here?   
  
WHITE HOUSE STAFF:  Yes, here.   
  
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Raising your glass to the people of America — to the
people of the United States, to the people of Africa, and to the promise
and potential of our partnership.  
  
Here, here.  (A toast is offered.)  
  
And now I present to you a man who you all know.  Mr. President, it’s
all yours.  
  
PRESIDENT SALL:  Thank you very much, President Joseph Biden, First Lady
Jill Biden, Madam Vice President Kamala Harris, Second Gentleman Douglas
Emhoff.   
  
Dear colleagues from Africa, ladies and gentlemen: On behalf of my
African colleagues, I thank you, Mr. President, for this wonderful
dinner on the occasion of the second USA-Africa Summit.   
  
Thank you also for your kind invitation.  We appreciate the time and
effort you and your administration have devoted to the preparatory
process of the summit over the past several months.  This is a testimony
of our longstanding, diverse, and vibrant relations.   
  
This afternoon, Mr. President, during the Business Summit, your speech
was so powerful, so inspiring, and so positive for our common future. 
We share the same spirit.  We want to advance our common agenda with you
and take our partnership to the next level in an inclusive approach,
bringing together governments, the private sector, civil society, and
the African diaspora.   
  
We have been walking in this direction since our arrival in Washington,
D.C., and we are confident that our summit will produce results that
reflect our shared commitment.   
  
On behalf of Africa, I invite all of you to join me for a toast in honor
of our host, President Joseph Biden, First Lady Jill Biden.  In honor of
the American people and for the reinforcement of American-African
friendship and cooperation, I thank you.   
  
(A toast is offered.)
