THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome.  It is my
great honor to convene this group.   
   
Needless to say, I think it has been clear over the last couple of days
that our administration strongly believes African leadership in
multilateral institutions is essential to address global challenges and
within multilateral institutions.  And our partnership will be grounded
in candor, openness, inclusiveness, shared interest, and mutual benefits
— because as I said on Tuesday, our administration intends to invest our
time and energy to fortify partnerships across the continent and within
multilateral institutions.   
   
We are guided not by what we can do for Africa but by what we do with
Africa.  And as the President announced, I will be traveling to the
continent next year, and very much look forward to furthering the
relationships that are being strengthened over the course of these
days.  
   
Earlier today, you met with President Joe Biden on Agenda 2063 and
discussed how we can support your leadership and vision of a fully
integrated African continent.  This session will build on that work.  In
particular, this session will focus on three key priorities: one, the
promotion of international rules and norms that advance prosperity and
security for all; two, a plan to strengthen cooperation between the
United States and Africa in multilateral institutions; and three, an
identification of ways to make progress within these institutions on
pressing challenges, including the issue of food security, climate
change, and security in the Sahel.   
   
I am grateful for the opportunity to hear directly from each of you so
we can build on areas of alignment and identify a plan of action through
which we can jointly manage global and regional issues.  
   
Regarding international organizations and initiatives, specifically the
U.N. Security Council and the G20, African countries should be
represented through permanent seats at the table.   
   
The United States joins African nations to seek consensus on a
significant expansion of the U.N. Security Council to include new
permanent seats for countries in Africa, Latin America, and the
Caribbean.   
   
As President Joe Biden announced earlier today, our administration will
also seek full membership for the African Union in the G20.  And we look
forward to working with the AU, the Indian G20 presidency, and other G20
members toward that end.   
   
Our cooperation in multilateral institutions is vital for so many
reasons, including that these are the institutions where we come
together to uphold rules and norms.  We gather at a time when many of
these international rules and norms are under threat — for example,
sovereignty and territorial integrity, unimpeded commerce, and the
peaceful resolution of disputes.   
   
Let us remember, these rules and norms exist for a reason.  They advance
security, stability, and prosperity around the world.  They protect
lives and livelihoods.  And when they are violated, the effects are felt
globally.  For example, Russia’s brutal war in Ukraine has led to
disruptions to food and energy supplies that affect all of our
economies.   
   
In light of this, we must all recommit to the rules and norms and the
founding documents of the U.N. and the AU.  We must defend them, promote
them, and build on them.   
   
Regarding the United Nations specifically, the Biden-Harris
administration has worked and will continue to work to restore and
strengthen America’s participation in the U.N.  We will stand firmly
behind the U.N. Charter and the spirit of the United Nations, which is
centered around collective action to address problems that affect us
all, including peace and security, public health, sustainable
development, and human rights.   
   
At the same time, we have heard from many of you who have concerns about
the ability of the United Nations to fulfill its mission.  As President
Joe Biden said at this year’s General Assembly, the United States takes
these concerns seriously.  We commit to a more inclusive, effective, and
credible Security Council, which includes promoting responsible behavior
by all Security Council members, such as refraining from the use of the
veto, except in rare and extraordinary circumstances.   
  
Of course, our multilateral engagement and partnership extends beyond
the U.N.  The United States is a longstanding supporter of the African
Union.  In 2006, the United States was the first non-African country to
establish a diplomatic mission to the AU.  Since then, we have worked
together to support peace building and prevent conflict across the
continent.  We have worked to strengthen the partnership between our
private sectors.  And together, our public health agencies have combated
Ebola breakouts and COVID-19.   
   
We also intend to strengthen the United States’ partnership with
regional economic communities.  We support these regional economic
communities because, of course, they help foster integration in Africa
and because each region, of course, has distinct challenges and
needs.   
   
Over the course of this session, let us work together to identify
additional areas of cooperation between the United States and these
communities.   
   
As you know, yesterday, during the U.S.-Africa Business Forum, the
United States Trade Representative signed a memorandum of understanding
with the Africa Continental Free Trade Area Secretariat to help increase
intraregional trade with Africa.   
  
In the past two years, we have made important progress together, and we
must and we will do more.  As part of this, the United States is
committed to working with African nations to strengthen our multilateral
cooperation.  I thank you each for your participation in this convening,
and I look forward to our discussion.   
   
And with that, I will now invite Commissioner Faki to speak. 
(Applause.)
