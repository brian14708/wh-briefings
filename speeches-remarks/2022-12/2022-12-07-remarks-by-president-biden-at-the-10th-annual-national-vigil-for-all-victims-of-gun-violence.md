THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  I’m sure if the lights were on all of you
instead of me, there’s a lot of people in this church that I know and
have not only consoled one another but have taken time to console me in
the loss of my family.

Jackie, thank you for the introduction.  More importantly, thank you for
your courage. 

Folks, events like this are hard.  They’re hard for all of you, because
it brings back the very moment that everything happened, no matter how
many years pass, no matter how many years go by.  And it brings it
back.  But your voices matter. Your voices matter a great deal.

Rector Morgan, thank you for welcoming us to St. Mark’s to remember, to
heal, and to fulfill a purpose.

Ten years ago, this nation’s vigil was created here in Washington to
pray for the souls of Sandy Hook and their families.

Ever since this — that time, this church has been opening its doors to
more victims and more families of a violence that rips at the very soul
— at the very soul of this nation.

To all of you here tonight, it’s under different circumstances, but I
know a little bit what the loss feels like.  It’ll be an anniversary on
the 18th of this month that I lost my wife and daughter and nearly lost
my two sons when a tractor trailer broadsided them.  And it’s not long
after that, the anniversary of losing my son.  I know that feeling.

Everyone is different, but I know that feeling.  You know, it’s like a
black hole in the middle of your chest you’re being dragged into.  And
you never know if there’s ever a way out.

And what I admire so much about all of you is you show up and remember,
because remembering brings it back — the very moment that it happened. 

But all of you, and all of you at the time — and I spent several days up
at Sandy Hook and then went back — at the time, it was — it was
astounding to see, even then, the courage that was represented.

Jill and I met with you, prayed with you, and have worked with you. 
We’ve seen you turn pain into purpose.  Together, we’ve made some
important progress: the most significant gun law passed in 30 years, but
still not enough.  (Applause.)  Still not enough.

Even as our work continues to limit the number of bullets that can be in
a cartridge, the type of weapon that can be purchased and sold, the
attempt to ban assault weapons — a whole range of things that are just
common sense.  Just simple common sense.

But, you know, we did it before.  You may remember.  In the ‘90s we did
it with the help of the very people in here, led by Speaker Pelosi in
the House and many others.  And we did it.  And guess what?  It worked. 
The number of violent mass murders reduced were significant.  A lot of
people’s lives were saved.

You know — and we can do it again.  (Applause.)

Scripture says, “The light shines in darkness, and darkness has not
overcome it.”

To all of you here tonight, you are the light.  You are literally the
light.  And your loved ones, your friends, they’re the light.  And
they’ll always be with you, no matter what happens.  They’re always with
you.

How many of you ask yourself, “What would my son or daughter want me to
do at this moment”?  They’re in your heart.  They’re part of you. 
They’re always going to be with you.

And at this national vigil for victims of gun violence, I ask the
country to join me in a moment of silence to remember every one of them.

(A moment of silence is observed.)

And we ask God to give us the strength to finish the work left undone
done on behalf of the lives we’ve lost and all the lives we can save.

May God bless you all and keep you safe.  (Applause.)
