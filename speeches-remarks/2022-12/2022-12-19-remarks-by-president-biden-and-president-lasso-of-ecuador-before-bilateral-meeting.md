Oval Office

1:41 P.M. EST

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Mr. President, in America we call this is “bringing
the press in out of the cold.”   
   
(Addresses press.)  Laugh a little bit.  That was pretty good.  You guys
have to admit that.  
   
Anyway, I’m glad to see you again after a successful summit we had, the
Summit of the Americas, in June, and to be able to return — to be able
to return a small amount of hospitality your family showed my wife,
Jill, when she visited Quito over the spring.  She enjoyed it so much I
wasn’t sure she was coming home.  (Laughs.)  
   
Today we’re going to keep building on the progress we’ve made. 
Together, we’ve made historic strides on migration.  And this afternoon,
we’ll discuss how we can deepen our security and our economic
partnership even further than it is right now.  
   
That includes our new joint investment programs that address security
needs for Ecuador’s prison system, your justice sector, and your
maritime security.  
   
And, Mr. President, since we both understand that working families are
the backbone of both our economies, I look forward to discussing how we
can keep delivering for those families under the Americas Partnership
for Economic Prosperity.  In both our countries.  
   
And, finally, I want to thank you for your moral leadership, your
condemnation of Putin’s brutal war against the Ukrainian people that
continues in ways we haven’t seen for a generation.  
   
You and I are united not only in our values but in our vision of the
future, one that’s both free and democratic.  
   
And in the new year, as Ecuador begins its term on the U.N. Security
Council, I look forward to continuing to work together to make this
vision a reality.   
   
I want to thank you very much for making the effort to be here.  
   
And as they used to say in the legislative body I worked, the United
States Senate: The floor is yours.  
   
PRESIDENT LASSO:  (As interpreted.)  Thank you very much, Mr.
President.  For me it is also a pleasure to be here with you after our
very nice visit together in Los Angeles and also after that very
pleasant visit with you and your wife, Jill, in Quito.  
   
So, for us, this is a great opportunity to come here and to reaffirm the
democratic freedom and human rights values that we share with the
glorious people of the U.S.   
   
Without a doubt, yes, we have been allies for decades now.  And I am
here to reaffirm that spirit that we share among us as allies in our
fight for democracy, for peace, and for justice, not only in the region
but also to support your vision throughout the world. 

So we were the first country in Latin America to condemn the awful war
from Russia into Ukraine.  We believe in multilateralism, and we also
believe in the rule of law.  And we also support dialogue as the means
for solving differences and disputes.  It is really remarkable to see
that after a pandemic we are now facing a war.  
   
So we will have a chance, after we visit with our friends of the press,
to share more on the issues we have in common.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, thank you very much, Mr. President.  We have a
lot to — a lot to talk about.  You have been a great friend and a
significant supporter, and that goes both ways.  And we have to figure
out how to expand and strengthen even an already strong relationship.  
   
And I want to thank the press for coming in.  We’re going to send you
back out in the cold.  (Laughter.)  The hallway is not much further
down, so you’ll get warm.
