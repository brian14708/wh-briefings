Roosevelt Room

10:53 A.M. EST   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Let me begin by thanking my team here.  They did one
heck of a job in averting what could have been a real disaster and — and
ended up with a good product.  But we still have more work to do, in my
view, in terms of ultimately getting paid sick leave not just for rail
workers but for every worker in America.  That is a goal I had in the
beginning, and I’m coming back at it.  
   
So — but good morning.  The bill I’m about to sign ends a difficult rail
dispute and helps our nation avoid what, without a doubt, would have
been an economic catastrophe at a very bad time in the calendar.  
   
Our nation’s rail system is literally the backbone of our supply chain,
as you all well know.  And so much of what we rely on is delivered on
our rail, from clean water to food and gas and every — every other
good.  A rail shutdown would have devastated our economy.   
   
Without freight rail, many of the U.S. industries would literally shut
down.  In the event of a shutdown, my economic advisors report that as
many as 765,000 Americans, many of them union members themselves, would
have been put out of work for the first time and — excuse me, within the
first two weeks of this — of the strike alone.  
   
Communities could have lost access to chemicals necessary to ensure
clean drinking water.  Farms and ranches across the country would have
been unable to feed their livestock.  And thanks to the bill Congress
passed and what I’m about to sign, we’ve spared the country that
catastrophe.   
   
At the same time, we ensured workers are going to get a historic 24
percent wage increase over the next five years, improved working
conditions, and peace of mind around their healthcare.  
   
And, look, I know this bill doesn’t have paid sick leave that these rail
workers and, frankly, every worker in America deserves, but that fight
isn’t over.  I didn’t commit we were going to stop just because of — we
couldn’t get it in this bill, that we were going to stop fighting for
it.  I’ve supported paid sick leave for a long time, and I’m going to
continue that fight until we succeed.  
   
And I want to thank Congress, Democrats and Republicans, for acting so
quickly.  I know this was a tough vote for members of both parties.  It
was a tough — for me.  But it was the right thing to do at the moment to
save jobs, to protect millions of working families from harm and
disruption, and to keep supply chains stable around the holidays, and to
continue the progress we’ve made and we’re — continue to see on the
economy.  
   
For months, you couldn’t look anywhere without seeing headlines
screaming “Gas prices at the pump are up.”  But, look, folks, gas prices
are down and you barely hear anything about it right now.  And they’re
continuing to go down.   
   
And there — there’s a lot more that’s going to happen.  And they’re down
more than $1.50 a gallon since the summer, and they continue to fall.   
   
And our economy continues to grow.  The economic report — the GDP is up
even more than it was previously thought.  We continue to create jobs —
lots of jobs.  
   
And today, we’ve learned that the economy added 263,000 jobs in
November.  And we’ve now created 10.5 million jobs since I took office,
more than any administration in history at this point in a presidency. 
And 750,000 of them are domestic manufacturing jobs — “Made in
America.”  
   
The unemployment rate remains near an all-time, 50-year low: 3.7
percent.   
   
And wages for working families — I want to say this again — wages for
working families, in fact, over the last couple of months, have gone up
— up.  These wage increases are larger than the increase in inflation
during that same period of time.  
   
And so, we’re in a position now where we — things are moving.  They’re
moving in the right direction.  
   
As we go into the holiday season, here’s what this all means.  The
Americans are working, the economy is growing, wages are rising faster
than inflation, and we’ve avoided a catastrophic rail strike.  
   
It means our plan to build the economy from the bottom up and the middle
out — you’re tired of hearing me say that, but it’s working.  The
wealthy are still doing very well while the middle class and the poor
are having a shot.  
   
I want to thank Congress once again for being partners today, for
averting this disaster and keeping our economy on a stable footing
during the holiday season.  
   
I want to thank you all.  And now I’m going to reach over here and sign
this bill and make it official.  
   
This is the House Joint Resolution 100.  Okay.  
   
(The resolution is signed.)  
   
And, by the way, I really can’t emphasize enough how much I appreciate
the team behind me working with business and labor to get this done to
avoid this.  
   
But otherwise, it’s a really good bill lacking only one thing, and we’re
going to get that one thing done before it’s all over.  
   
But anyway, thank you, thank you, thank you.  
   
Q    Mr. President, why aren’t you going to Georgia to help Senator
Warnock?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m going to Georgia today to help Senator War- — not to
Georgia; we’re going to help Senator Warnock because I’m doing a major
fundraiser up in Boston today for — for the — our next and continued
Senate candidate and senator.  
   
Thank you.  
   
Q    Mr. President, how soon should rail workers expect sick days?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  As soon as I can convince our Republicans to see the
light.
