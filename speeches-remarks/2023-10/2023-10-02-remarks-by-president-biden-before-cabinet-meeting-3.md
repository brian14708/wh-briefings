Cabinet Room

4:50 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, good afternoon, everyone.  
   
Thankfully, Congress passed and signed into law a spending bill to keep
the government open.  
   
And that’s good news to the American people because the government will
not shut down and a needless crisis has been averted — at least
temporarily — saving millions of Americans from needless pain.  
   
And — but the truth is we shouldn’t have gotten there in the first
place.  By the end of a governing crisis — it’s time to end these
constant — anyway.  I’m going to be good.   
   
This agreement averts the immediate crisis, but it ends in just 44
days.  And I strongly urge my Republican colleagues in the Congress not
to wait 44 days.  Don’t waste time like you did this summer and pass a
year-long budget agreement.  Honor the deal we made a few months ago
when they were threatening to renege on our national debt.    
   
And we cannot, under any circumstances, allow American support for
Ukraine to be interrupted.  Too many lives are at stake — too many
children, too many people.  I fully expect the Speaker and the majority
of the Republicans in Congress to keep their commitment to secure the
passage of the support needed to help Ukraine as it defends itself
against Russian aggression and brutality.   
   
Let’s all remember that we have the strongest economy in the world.  So,
let’s build on it.  Let’s build on what we’ve done.  
   
We are — and I — I told you before — I think Madeleine Albright was
correct.  We are the indispensable nation in the world.  And let’s begin
to act like it.  Make sure that American people and our allies and
friends around the world know what we are doing and what we intend to
do.  
   
That’s why I wanted to convene this Cabinet meeting: to get an update on
the progress we’re making on pressing priorities for our country.  And
those include understanding the promise and peril of artificial
intelligence, which we talked about last meeting.   
   
It includes taking action on gun violence, following up on our recent
announcement of the new White House Office on Gun Violence Prevention. 
That’s going to be overseen by the Vice President.  And today’s meeting
is going to provide an implementation update on both of those items.  
   
And with that, let’s get our meeting started.  
   
4:53 P.M. EDT
