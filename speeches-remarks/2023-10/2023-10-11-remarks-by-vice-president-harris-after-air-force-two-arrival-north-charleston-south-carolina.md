title: "Remarks by Vice President Harris After Air Force Two Arrival | North Charleston,\
  \ South\_Carolina"
---
 
*Joint Base Charleston  
North Charleston, South Carolina*

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Hi.  Well, it’s good to be back in Charleston, but
I want to just, first of all, say a few words about what’s happening in
Israel right now.  And needless to say, I’m completely outraged by what
has taken place.  We are looking at extreme acts of terrorism that must
be condemned in no uncertain terms.  There is absolutely no
justification for terrorism.  
  
The President and I take very seriously our commitment to Israel and to
the people of Israel to support them and, in particular, to give Israel
what it needs to defend itself.   
  
One of our highest priorities, of course, is the safety and wellbeing of
American citizens, and that will continue to be among our highest
priorities.   
  
It is also critically important that, as we have been, we will stay in
constant communication and contact with our allies, with our Israeli
partners, with members of Congress, as we have been doing these last few
days.  
  
In fact, this morning, I was on a call — and the President was on — with
Prime Minister Netanyahu, which is now one of many calls that have taken
place, to restate our commitment that is unwavering to stand with Israel
and the Israeli people.  
  
So, thank you.
