THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  
   
Before I speak about student debt relief, I want to make — take a minute
to talk about what took place yesterday in the Congress.  I’ll be very
brief.  
   
The House will now reorganize and select a new Speaker.  I know it’s
going to take some time.  But I remind everyone: We had a lot of work —
we have a lot of work to do, and the American people expect us to get it
done.   
   
The argument we reached was about what — what comes next, but we had an
agreement — we reached an agreement over the weekend — funds for
government, only another 40 days.  We cannot and should not again be
faced with an 11th-hour decision of brinksmanship that threatens to shut
down the government.   
   
And we know what we have to do.  It will be — and we got — we have to
get it done in a timely fashion.   
   
More than anything, we need to change the poisonous atmosphere in
Washington.  I know we have strong disagreements, but we need to stop
seeing each other as enemies.  We need to talk to one another, listen to
one another, work with one another.  And we can do that.  
   
I join with Minority Leader Jeffers — Je- — excuse me — Jeffries in
saying to our Republican colleagues: We remain committed to working in a
bipartisan fashion.  We — we’re prepared to do it as well, for the good
of the American people.   
   
Twice in the last six months, both houses came together on a bipartisan
basis — once to avoid default, once to keep the government open.  And
while we should never have been in the situation in the first place, I’m
grateful that leaders on both sides came together, including former
Speaker McCarthy, to do the right thing.    
   
Now, turning to student debt relief.  When I ran for President, I vowed
to fix our broken student loan program.  Because while a college degree
is still the ticket to a better life, that ticket has become excessively
expensive.  Americans who are saddled with unsustainable debt in
exchange for a college degree has become the norm.   
   
Since, my administration has taken significant action to provide student
debt relief to as many borrowers as possible as quickly as possible. 
That starts with making sure the existing system works in the way it was
supposed to work for student borrowers.    
   
We fixed what’s called the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program,
which was designed originally to make sure schoolteachers, firefighters,
social workers, and other public servants can get their student loans
forgiven if they make 10 years of payments and do 10 years of public
service.   
   
By the time I took office, that program had been placed for — in place
for nearly 15 years, but because of red tape, only 7,000 borrowers had
been helped.   
   
Well, today, thanks to the reforms, more than 700,000 borrowers have had
their debts forgiven.   
   
Just the other day, I spoke with Tanya and Chad, a married couple in
their 50s who both work at a public high school in Milwaukee.  For
years, they paid over $800 a month toward their student loans.  It meant
they couldn’t pay — put away any money away for their retirement.  And
this summer, thanks to fixes we made to the debt relief program for
people in public service, Chad and Tanya’s remaining balance was
forgiven.   
   
Tanya said, quote, “The amount of relief this gives us is
indescribable.”  End of quote.  Now they can finally start savings for
retirement.    
   
Next, we fixed what’s called the Income-Driven payment — Repayment
program.  And here’s how that works: If you have an undergraduate loan
after 20 straight years of straight paying — not missing — paying a debt
on a — on a monthly basis, whatever is left of your loan is forgiven at
20 years.   
   
But because of administrative failures, some people who did pay their
loans for 20 years or more did not get the debt relief they had earned. 
We fixed that and made sure borrowers got credit for every single
payment they made.    
   
As a result of these changes, today I’m announcing my administration has
approved an additional $9 billion in relief for 125,000 borrowers in
just the past few weeks under that program.  With the latest debt
cancel- — cancellation, in total, my administration has canceled $127
billion in student debts for nearly 3.6 million Americans.   
   
This kind of relief is lifechanging for individuals and their families,
but it’s good for our economy as a whole as well.   
   
By freeing millions of Americans from the crushing burden of student
debt, it means they can go and get their lives in order.  They can think
about buying a house.  They can start a business.  They can be starting
a family.  This matters.  It matters in their daily lives.  
   
This latest progress builds on other steps we’ve taken.  We made the
largest increase in Pell Grants in over a decade, helping students of
families making less than $60,000 a year get to college.  We’ve made
additional improvements to the Income-Driven Repayment program.  
   
Before I took office, student borrowers would pay no more than 10 perc-
— could pay no more than 10 percent of their discretionary income on a
monthly basis if they wanted to do it that way.  But under my
administration’s plan, which is called SAVE Plan, we reduced that to 5
percent for undergraduate borrowers.  It’s now the most generous
repayment program ever.   
   
Under this plan, no one with an undergraduate loan today or in the
future, whether at a community college or a four-year college, will have
to pay more than 5 percent of their discretionary income to repay these
loans.  This in- — that’s income after you pay for necessities like
housing, food, and other necessaries.   
   
You can sign up for the SAVE Plan at StudentAid.gov/SAVE. 
StudentAid-dash-gov-sla- — StudentAid-dash- — StudentAid.gov/SAVE.  
   
And remember, if you keep up your payments, after 20 years, whatever is
left in those loans is forgiven.  
   
And we’re still not done.  
   
As you might remember, last year I announced a major proposal for
student debt relief.  We were on the verge of providing more than 40
million Americans with real relief from their student debt.  The money
was literally about to go out the door, but Republicans el- — and
elected — Republican elected officials and special interests stepped up
and sued us.   
   
And the Supreme Court sided with them, snatching from the hands of
millions of Americans thousands of dollars in debt –student debt relief
that was about to change their lives.  
   
As I said at the time, I believe the Court’s decision to strike down my
student debt relief program was wrong.  But I promised I wouldn’t give
up.   
   
Since then, my administration has been pursuing a new approach grounded
in — under a different law: the Higher Education Act. This act allows
the Secretary of Education to compromise, waive, or release loans under
certain circumstances.   
   
Last week, the Department of Education took a critical step in this
process by identifying specific challenges that borrowers face in the
current system so we can move forward with a new rule to address these
changes.  
   
For example, there are many borrowers who have made payments for many
years, but because of interest, they still owe more than they originally
borrowed.  
   
My administration is doing everything it can to deliver student debt
relief to as many as we can, as fast as we can.  This in contrast to
House Republicans, who helped block the previous debt relief plan and
nearly shut down the government over the extreme demands, which would
have hurt hardworking families.  
   
But they had no problem with the Paycheck Protection Program — remember
that? — the PPP program during the — during the — the last several
years? — which was designed to help business owners who lost money,
which is legitimate, because of the pandemic.  Members of Congress got
over hundreds of thousands of dollars in order — because they lost —
their businesses lost money.   
   
That wasn’t a wor- — it was a worthy program.  But let’s be clear: Some
of the same elected Republicans who are members of Congress who were
strongly opposed to giving relief to students got hundreds of thousands
of dollars of relief for themselves to keep their businesses open. 
Several members of Congress got over a million dollars, and all those
loans were forgiven.  The hypocrisy of this, I find stunning.  
   
I supported that program, and I support the student debt program.   
   
My administration will continue to use every tool at our disposal to
help ease the burden of student debt so more Americans be f- — can free
— can be free to achieve their dreams.   
   
It’s good for our economy, it’s good for our country, and it’s going to
change their lives.   
   
Thank you very much.  
   
Q    Mr. President, a quick question on Speaker McCarthy, if I can? 
Speaker McCarthy — then-Speaker McCarthy said that the two of you
haven’t spoken directly in a long time.  Why is that?  And are you
committed to engaging more regularly with the next House Speaker?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  We had two agreements we shook hands with — on.  And I
assumed he was working with — I knew he was working with the Democrats
in the House and Senate.  It wasn’t for me to do anything.  If he wanted
to talk to me, I was available.  I’m available to whomever wants to talk
to me.  But the idea that I was going to somehow convince McCarthy to
change his view was not reasonable.  
   
Q    Could I ask you about the Ukraine (inaudible)?  Does the disarray
on Capitol Hill after your conversation with allies yesterday worry you
that you won’t be able to deliver the aid that the U.S. has promised to
Ukraine?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  It does worry me, and — but I know there are a majority
of members of the House and Senate in both parties who have said that
they support funding Ukraine.   
   
With your — I’m going to be announcing very shortly a major speech I’m
going to make on this issue and why it’s critically important for the
United States and our allies that we keep our commitment.  
   
Q    Mr. President, are you also concerned about the rest of your
domestic and foreign policy initiatives being in peril because of what
we saw happen yesterday?  The dysfunction in Congress, the chaos that we
saw on the House side, does that concern you in any way?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  The dysfunction always concerns me.  The programs that
we have argued over, we passed bipartisanly — I’m not concerned that
they’re going to all of a sudden come in and try to undo them.  Although
there will be some — there will be some, I’m sure.  There is a half a
dozen or more extreme MAGA Republicans — Republicans who would like to
eliminate despite everything I’ve done.  But I — I don’t think that’s
going to get there.   
   
Q    Mr. President, if I may, without additional funding, how long will
the United States be able to support Ukraine?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  We can support Ukraine in the next tranche that we
need.  And there is another means by which we may be able to find
funding for that.  But I’m not going to get into that now.  
   
Q    Mr. President, have you promised President Zelenskyy ATACMS for
Ukraine?   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Say again?  I’m sorry.  
   
Q    Have you promised President Zelenskyy during his visit in the White
House that you would provide ATACMS, the long-range missiles, for
Ukraine?   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I have spoken with Zelenskyy, and everything he’s asked
for, we’ve worked out.   
   
Q    Tell us a little bit more — tell us a little bit more about this
speech you’re going to give.  What argument are you going to make?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  Why don’t you wait and listen to it?   
   
I’m going to make the argument that it’s overwhelmingly in the interest
of the United States of America that Ukraine succeed.  And it’s
overwhelmingly in our interest — I’ve spent two and a half years putting
together coalitions that no one thought could be put together.  And
they’ve strengthened us across the board, not just as it relates to
Ukraine, whether it’s Japan and South Korea or whether it’s what’s
happening in Europe itself.   
   
And so, I think that it’s clear to the vast majority of the foreign
policy community on both left and right that this has been a valuable
exercise for the United States of America to increase the support we
have around the world.   
   
And what I don’t want to do is we put — we put together over 50 nations
— 50 nations supporting Ukraine.  And we have the — we are the organizer
of that.  I’ve met with — don’t hold me to the exact number — 16 or 17
yesterday.  We had a long conversation and made the case that I knew
that the majority of the American people still supported Ukraine, and
the majority of the members of the Congress — both Democrat and
Republican — support it.   
   
So, I don’t think we should let the gamesmanship get in the way of
blocking it.  
   
Q    Sir, not that they’re asking, but what’s your advice to the ne- —
next House Speaker?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  That’s above my pay grade.
