  \ Roundtable at Patrick Space Force\_Base"

\*\*\*

Thank you, Sheila.  
   
Secretary McDonough, thank you for fighting for our veterans and their
families every day. Denis, Joe and I are grateful for your leadership
and your partnership. Thank you for joining us today.  
   
Coming here to Patrick is a privilege and an honor.  
   
As some of you may know, the Bidens, we are a military family. When he
was seventeen, my father served as a signalman in World War II. And our
son, Beau, deployed to Iraq for a year as a member of the Delaware Army
National Guard.  
   
So, this is personal to me – and to your president.  
   
Your well-being and your happiness matter to us – and we want to know
what’s working and what could be done better.  
   
We just met with some of the Guardians working at the Cape.  
   
And I had the opportunity to talk to them about the important work
they’re doing, and about some of the unique challenges they face as
they’re deployed in place – the time spent away from family and friends
on long shifts and through odd hours. And I know that’s not easy for
their loved ones either.  
   
Because even though you don’t wear the uniform, you and your children
serve this country as well.  
   
That’s why we have to make sure that your service is an opportunity of
dignity and honor, of pride and accomplishment – for the entire
family.  
  
Joining Forces – my White House initiative to support military and
veteran families, caregivers, and survivors – is working to do just
that.  
   
And as I’ve traveled to bases around the country and across the world,
I’ve spoken with military families like yours to learn about their
experiences and challenges.  
   
When I brought those stories back to Joe, he listened.  
   
He called on all federal agencies to partner with the Department of
Defense to hire and retain military spouses.  
   
This past June, he signed an executive order to address the employment
challenges faced by military spouses in the federal workforce. So that
when you PCS you can take your job with you.  
   
The Biden-Harris Administration is also supporting spouses who are
trying to start a business.  
   
And through historic executive action, President Biden is improving
access to childcare for hard-working families, including military and
veteran families.  
   
Now, I know many of you joined Space Force from other branches of the
military. And I want to thank you for leaping toward this new
challenge.  
   
But I also know that being first comes with its own unique hardships –
that first, there aren’t many of you; that you’re spread across the
country in small numbers; and, often there’s no one to guide you because
no one has ever done this before.   
   
So, thank you for joining us today and thank you for your service and
your sacrifice.  
   
I look forward to learning more about your experiences and finding ways
for Joining Forces to support you.  
   
May God bless our troops, their families, caregivers, and survivors.
