State Dining Room

THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. Today, the people of Israel are under
attack, orchestrated by a terrorist organization, Hamas.

In this moment of tragedy, I want to say to them and to the world and to
terrorists everywhere that the United States stands with Israel. We will
not ever fail to have their back.

We’ll make sure they have the help their citizens need and they can
continue to defend themselves.

You know, the world has seen appalling images: thousands of rockets in
the space of hours raining down on Israeli cities. When I got up this
morning and started this at 7:30, 8 o’clock — my calls.

Hamas terrorists crossing into Israel killing not only Israeli soldiers,
but Israeli civilians in the street, in their homes. Innocent people
murdered, wounded, entire families taken hostage by Hamas just days
after Israel marked the holiest of days on the Jewish calendar. It’s
unconscionable.

You know, when I spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu this morning, I
told him the United States stands with the people of Israel in the face
of this terrorist assaults. Israel has the right to defend itself and
its people. Full stop.

There is never justification for terrorist acts.

And my administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and
unwavering.

Let me say this as clearly as I can: This is not a moment for any party
hostile to Israel to exploit these attacks to seek advantage. The world
is watching.

I have also been in contact with the King of Jordan, spoken with members
of Congress, directed my national security team  
to engage with their Israeli counterparts — military to military,
intelligence to intelligence, diplo- — diplomat to diplomat — to make
sure Israel has what it needs.

I’ve also directed my team to remain in constant contact with leaders
throughout the region, including Egypt, Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia,
Jordan, Oman, the UAE, as well as with our European partners and the
Palestinian Authority.

This is also a terrible tragedy on a human level. It’s hurting innocent
people — seeing the lives that have been broken by this, the families
torn apart. It’s heart breaking.

And Jill and I are praying for those families who have been impacted by
this violence. We grieve with those who have lost their loved their
ones, lost a piece of their soul. We have hope for a swift recovery for
many who have been wounded.

But we’re going to remain in close touch with Prime Minister — I,
personally, am going to remain in close contact with Prime Minister
Netanyahu as this situation continues to develop.

And let there be no mistake: The United States stands with the State of
Israel, just as we have from the moment the United States became the
first nation to recognize Israel, 11 minutes after its founding, 75
years ago.

Thank you very much.
