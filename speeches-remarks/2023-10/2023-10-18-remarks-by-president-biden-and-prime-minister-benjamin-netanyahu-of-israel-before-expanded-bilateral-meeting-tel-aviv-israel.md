PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  Mr. President, you are meeting with our
united war cabinet — united and resolved to lead Israel to victory. 
This will be a different kind of war because Hamas is a different kind
of enemy.   
   
While Israel seeks to minimize civilian casualties, Hamas seeks to
maximize civilian casualties.  Hamas wants to kill as many Israelis as
possible and has no regard whatsoever to Palestinian lives.   
   
Every day, they perpetrate a double war crime: targeting our civilians
while hiding behind their civilians, embedding themselves in the
civilian population, and using them as human shields.   
   
We’ve seen the cost of this — this terrible double war crime against
humanity that Hamas is perpetrating in the last 11 days.  As Israel
legitimately targets terrorists, civilians are unfortunately harmed. 
Hamas is responsible and should be held accountable for all civilian
casualties.   
   
We saw the cost of this terrible war crime yesterday, when a rocket
fired by a Palestinian terrorist misfired and landed on a Palestinian
hospital.  The entire world was rightfully outraged.  But this outrage
should be directed not at Israel but at the terrorists.   
   
As we proceed in this war, Israel will do everything it can to keep
civilians out of harm’s way.  We’ve asked them and we’ll continue to ask
them to move to safer areas.  We’ll continue to work with you,
Mr. President, to assure that the minimal requirements are met, and
we’ll continue to work together to get our hostages out.   
   
Mr. President, the road to victory will be long and hard, but united in
purpose and with a deep sense of justice and the unbreakable spirit of
our soldiers and our people, Israel will prevail.   
   
Thank you, Mr. President.

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. 

In the wake of Hamas’s appalling terrorist assault — it was brutal,
inhumane, almost beyond belief what they did — this cabinet came
together and — standing strong, standing united.

And — and I want you to know you’re not alone.  You are not alone.

As I emphasized earlier, we will continue to have Israel’s back as you
work to defend your people.  We’ll continue to work with you and
partners across the region to prevent more tragedy to innocent
civilians.

Seventy-five years ago, your founders declared that this nation would be
one based — quote, “based on freedom, justice, and peace.”  “Based on
freedom, justice, and peace.”

The United States stands with you in defense of that freedom, in pursuit
of that justice, and in support of that peace today, tomorrow, and
always.  We promise you.  
   
PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  Thank you.
