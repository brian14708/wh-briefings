Oval Office

10:56 A.M. EDT  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, Mr. Prime Minister, welcome.  Welcome to the
White House, and welcome to the Oval Office.  It’s been a long time
coming.  
   
And — and I — well, let me apologize again for not being able to make my
visit to Australia.  Things were a little bit in disarray here and
required to be home.  And so, that’s why I didn’t.  But I’m delighted
you’re here.  
   
And together, you know, we’ve worked together to really strengthen the
alliance, and I think we’ve actually deepened that strength. 

I think we’ve moved in a direction that — through our historic AUKUS
partnership with the United Kingdom, we’ve expanded economic involvement
with one another, with American investment in Australia being at an
all-time high under our administration.  
   
And in May, we strengthened our climate ties — thank you, thank you,
thank you for your move on climate; it’s a big deal — including
launching a new climate, minerals, and clean energy compact, because you
have great assets that we can all use to make sure that we move in the
direction of clean energy.  
   
And today, we’re taking our alliance even further with doubling down on
cooperation on technology and science.   
   
This morning, we’re going to discuss how all these efforts can help
advance a free, open, and secure Indo-Pacific.  And I look forward to
discussing how we can work together to address threats to the stability
in the region and the economic stability as well, supporting Ukraine in
the face of Russia’s bitter aggression, and to stand with Israel in the
wake of Hamas’s appalling terrorist attacks.   
   
So, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you very much for being here.  It’s an
honor to have you.  And thank you for your leadership and your personal
friendship.   
   
PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE:  Well, thank you very much, Mr. President.  It
is a great honor for me to be here as Australia’s Prime Minister.  
   
And our alliance, I believe, has never been more important, and it’s
also never been stronger.  We’ve added a third tier.  We have had
defense, and we’ve had the economic relationship — defense through
ANZUS, the economic relationship through our free trade agreement.   
   
But we’ve added a third part of this alliance front and center as well
through our clean energy, critical minerals, and climate change compact,
taking action to protect the world, to lower emissions, to take
advantage of the shift to clean energy that — the opportunity that
presents to grow economies as well, and to decouple — particularly for
developing nations — to allow them to develop in a way at the same time
as they’re reducing emissions.  And breaking that nexus between
industrialization and emissions is so important.   
   
The AUKUS agreement is so central.  And I thank you, Mr. President, for
the work that you’ve done in persuading legislators to make sure that we
put in place the measures that are necessary to encourage that two-way
transfer of defense technology that will be at the center of an
agreement that’s about peace and security in our region but also about
prosperity in our region as well.   
   
In addition to that, the work that we’re doing together in the Pacific
is very important.  I know that you’ve hosted Pacific leaders twice here
in the White House, and that has been very welcome.  
   
In today’s uncertain world, the alliance between Australia and the
United States and the way that we stand steadfast against aggression,
whether it be Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine or whether it be
Hamas’s terrorist attack on Israel, is something that can be relied upon
for us to stand up for our common values.   
   
And that’s why I very much welcome this visit and welcome the
cooperation that we’re having, as well as our personal relationship. 
This is our ninth meeting in just the 16 months that I’ve had the honor
of being Prime Minister, and I look forward to continuing to take the
relationship to a higher level, as we do every time we meet.  
   
Today, we’ll be advancing a technology agreement between our two great
nations as well.  And innovation is so important — that we’re able to
commercialize it to benefit both of our peoples. 

I thank you.   
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  You made one member of my administration incredibly
happy with your strong move toward the environmental protection — that’s
Secretary Kerry.  
   
PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE:  Indeed.  (Laughs.)  Indeed.  And he’s — he’s
shown great leadership, of course.   
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, he is.  That’s right.  
   
PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE:  And it is — it is so important for us.  
   
The — the other area of our cooperation is, of course, in working on
natural disasters.   
   
Later, I’ll be — I’ll be visiting your emergency management authority. 
We’ve set up a similar model nationally based upon what you’ve done
here, because climate change is — is real, and we can see its impacts
with wildfires, with floods.   
   
And that is just a reminder every time that we have a responsibility to
this and future generations.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, I was asked by Xi Jinping a couple of years ago
why I was working so hard with your country.  And I said, “Because we’re
a Pacific nation.”  He looked at me, and I said, “Yeah, we’re a Pacific
nation — the United States.”  We are, and we’re going to stay that
way.   
   
So, thank you.  Thank you, everyone.   
   
PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE:  Absolutely.  
   
Thank you.  
   
(Cross-talk by reporters.)

Q    Mr. President, on Israel, will you respond to attacks on U.S.
troops in the region?  Will you respond to attacks on U.S. troops in the
region, Mr. President?  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Whoa, whoa, whoa — well, you’re going to get — we’re
going to have a press conference after this.  We’ll be able to answer
your questions.   
   
Thank you.
