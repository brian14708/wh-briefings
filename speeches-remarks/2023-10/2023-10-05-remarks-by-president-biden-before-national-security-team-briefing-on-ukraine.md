Oval Office

12:17 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, General Brown, welcome to the Oval as Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs.  It’s great to have you here.  And your experience in
combat and your experience in administering at the Jus- — at the
Justice? — at the Defense Department and your leadership in just about
every theater. 

You’ve — you’ve been around the world, as they say, as a commander.  And
you’re a trusted leader of the Joint Force, and you’re accelerating the
change we need, both in terms of materiel and in terms of the
strategies.

And, C.Q., your insight and counsel, we’re looking for.  The — the
Secretary of Defense has been bragging about you a long time and so has
— has the head of the CIA.  So, we’re going to get going.

And, today, we’re going to discuss the — the intelligence matters that
are current.  You know, you’ve be- — you’ve kept current on all of
these, I know.  But we’re going to discuss Ukraine, Iran, the DPRK, and
also our continued advancement of stability in the Indo- — the
Indo-Pacific and that whole area.

So, anyway, there’s a lot we have to do.  And I just wanted to welcome
you and thank you for being here.  That’s why we let the press in here
for this.  We usually don’t have them in for the — for the PDB.  But,
welcome.

GENERAL BROWN:  Thank you.

THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, guys —

Q    Mr. President, are you going to tie Ukraine aid to the border? 
(Inaudible) aid to the border?

(Cross-talk.)

Q    You pledged not to build another foot of border wall.  What
changed?

THE PRESIDENT:  Nothing.

(Cross-talk.)

Q    Nothing has changed?

(Cross-talk.)

THE PRESIDENT:  I’ll answer one question on the border wall.  The border
wall — the money was appropriated for the border wall.  I tried to get
to them to reappropriate it, to redirect that money.  They didn’t.  They
wouldn’t.  And in the meantime, there’s nothing under the law other than
they have to use the money for what it was appropriated.  I can’t stop
that.

Q    Do you believe the border wall works?

THE PRESIDENT:  No.

Okay, thank you.
