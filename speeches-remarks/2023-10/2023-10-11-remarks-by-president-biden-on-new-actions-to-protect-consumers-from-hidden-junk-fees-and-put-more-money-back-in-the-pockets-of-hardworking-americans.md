THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)  
   
MS. CHONG:  Thank you.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  They’re going to walk you down those stairs.  
   
MS. CHONG:  Okay.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Watch your step.   
   
MS. CHONG:  All right, thank you so much.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Becky, thank you.  
   
Folks, before I begin — please have a seat.  Before I begin, I want to
say a few words why I’m a little late and what I — what we were doing. 
And let me — and I want to speak a little bit about what’s going on in
Israel right now.   
   
We continue to monitor the situation in Israel very closely, and the
Vice President and I and the bulk of my security team spoke with the
Prime Minister, Netanyahu, again this morning.  
   
And I’ll be speaking about this this afternoon during my meeting with
the Jewish American leaders.  
   
This attack has brought to the surface the painful memories and scars
left by a millennia of antisemitism and genocide against the Jewish
people.  
   
And in this moment, we have to be crystal clear: There is no
justification for terrorism.  No excuse.  And the type of terrorism that
was exhibit- — exhibited here was just beyond the pale.  Beyond the
pale.    
   
As I said yesterday, my commitment to Israel’s security and the safety
of the Jewish people is unshakeable.  The United States has Israel’s
back.  And we’re going to be working on this all through today and
beyond.  
   
But again, I apologize for — for keeping you waiting.   
   
Thank you, Becky, for that introduction and for sharing your story
that’s familiar to so many families.  
   
This gets down to a basic problem, a basic circumstance.  It’s just
about fairness.  It’s just about simple fairness.  You know, folks are
being — tired of being taken advantage of and being played for
suckers.  
   
That’s why I’m here with the Director of the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau Ro- — Rohit Chopra.  Where are you, Rohit?  There you
are.  Stand up.  Let people see who you are.  (Applause.)   
   
And the Chair of the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan.  Lina, stand
up.  (Applause.)  
   
They’re members of the Competition Council that I created to promote
competition across the economy and lower costs for families.  And I —
I’m not going to introduce everybody, but you know, we wouldn’t be
getting anywhere without the incredible support of the members of
Congress who are here today.  And we may have to go back and actually
change the law — change the circumstances.  And so, I’m counting on
you.  
   
Anyway, would all the members of Congress stand up so everybody can see
you?  (Applause.)  
   
In any fight I’m in, that’s the team I want on my side.   
   
Look, one of the key things I’ve asked the council to tackle are the
unfair fees known as “junk fees,” those hidden charges that companies
sneak into your bill to make you pay more because they can.  Just simply
because they can.  Charges that are taking real money out of the pockets
of American families.  
   
These junk fees can add up to hundreds of dollars, weighing down family
budgets and making it harder to pay family bills.  
   
These junk fees may not matter to the wealthy, but they sure matter to
working folks in homes like the one I grew up in.   
   
The way I think about it is the way my dad talked about it and the way
so many of you at home talk about it around the kitchen table.  How much
are your monthly bills?  And after they’re all paid, how much do you
have left for necessities?  It’s enough — is there enough lef- — is
there left over just to give you a little bit of breathing room?   
   
Well, these junk fees suck up all that breathing room, among other
things.   
   
Now think of today: How many folks are asking how much more do they have
to pay to cover those hidden junk fees that really add up?  
   
You know, over the past two years, my administration has taken, with the
help of the members of Congress, a number of steps to crack down on
unfair and deceptive junk fees in banking; hotels; concert; airlines;
retail housing — or excuse me, rental housing; cable; Internet;
healthcare.  A whole range of issues.  A whole range of them.   
   
For example, two summers ago, if your flight was canceled or delayed,
almost no major airline would guarantee you anything other than costing
you a fee to rebook that.  Even if it was their fault, you had to pay a
fee to rebook.    
   
Now 10 airlines rebook for free.  And I — (applause) — and I’m looking
to get the law passed so none of them can — they all have to do that.   
   
And that — that’s a win for consumers.  
   
Other companies have also responded to my call for action and adopted
so-called “all-in upfront pricing”.  That’s where companies fully
disclose their fees upfront when you start — when you start shopping and
— and there’s no real surprise at the end when you check out.  
   
This summer, I hosted business leaders at an event to announce the
voluntary changes that companies like A- — A- — Airbnb, DICE, and others
were making to provide customers with an all-in upfront pricing so
there’s no surprise.  
   
Tens of millions of Americans have already benefitted from this, and
that’s progress.  
   
Today, I’m proud to announce that my administration is taking our most
comprehensive action ever to eliminate junk fees in — and — in — fees in
industries and sectors across the board, across the entire economy.  
   
You know, if these rules are finalized, they won’t just be voluntarily. 
They’ll be made mandatory — mandatory.  (Applause.)  It would do more
than embarrass a company; it would make them mandatory.  
   
But first, here’s how: The Federal Trade Commission is proposing a new
rule that would ban hidden fees across the economy and require companies
to show consumers the all-in pricing upfront — upfront.  (Applause.)  
   
That includes what these fees are for, how much they amount to in full,
and whether they are refundable.  
   
Research shows that without — without realizing it, folks can end up
paying as much as 20 percent more because of hidden junk fees than they
would have paid if they could see the full price upfront and compare it
with other options.  
   
It’s wrong.  It’s wrong.  It’s just taking advantage of people.  And it
makes it harder for honest businesses who are trying to do the right
thing to compete with dishonest companies who trick customers into
thinking their prices are lower when they, in fact, are not.  
   
Look, if this proposed rule is finalized as proposed, the FTC would have
the power to impose financial penalties on companies that don’t disclose
their full upfront price and secure refunds for customers who have been
defrauded by companies charging hidden fees.  
   
Second, the Consumer Pr- — the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as —
is banning bank fees and credit unions from charging fees for basic
services like checking your account balance — checking your account
balance — (applause); retrieving old bank records; or looking up your
balance on a loan.  
   
You know, some banks charge as much as $30 for these services every time
you call.  It’s outrageous.  It’s really outrageous.  
   
And today, they’re making clear that th- — we’re making clear these fees
are now illegal.  
   
Look, we’re not stopping there.  There are tens of billions of dollars
in other junk fees across the economy and have direc- — I’ve directed my
administration to crack down on them as well.  
   
For example, later this month, the CFPB will — will propose another new
rule that would require banks to make it easier for customers to switch
banks — something banks have made really difficult for folks to do.  
   
This new rule would increase competition and deter junk fees.  
   
All of these actions are going to make a real difference in people’s
lives.  We’re already seeing how.  
   
Today, for example, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released a
report showing that, since I took office, nearly two thirds of the
largest banks have eliminated bounced check fees entirely.  And that was
a lot of money.  (Applause.)  
   
And by the way, they calculated: These bounced check fees for consumers
have declined by nearly $2 billion.  This isn’t — this isn’t chump
change.  This is a lot of money.  By $2 billion.  And that’s close to a
90 percent reduction.  
   
In addition, we’ve secured $140 million in refunds for consumers who
were charged illegal junk fees by these banks.  
   
And look — and we’re also sending new guidance to every federal agency
on how they can promote real competition in their work.  
   
You know, and as we take these actions, I continue to call on Congress
to pass what my friends in the front row here mostly support: Junk Fee —
the Junk Fee Pr- — the Junk Fee Prevention Act.  Hard to say. 
(Applause.)  
   
Anyway, but all kidding aside, I’m asking Congress to take the action so
this makes it a matter of law.  
   
Today’s actions are a part of my broader economic vision to move from
trickle-down economics to what everyone in the Wall Street Journal to
the Financial Times began to call “Bidenomics.”  I don’t think they
meant it as a compliment at first.  (Laughter and applause.)  
   
It’s about growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up,
not the top down.  
   
Last week’s jobs report shows Bidenomics is working.  We added more than
336,000 jobs last month.   
   
We’ve created more than — we’ve created more than 13,900,000 new jobs
since I’ve taken office.  That’s more than any president ever has in all
of history.  (Applause.)  And that’s more than —  
   
Look, and the unemployment rate has stayed below 4 percent for 20
straight months — the longest stretch in 50 years.  (Applause.)  
   
So, look, and inflation continues to fall, down nearly 60 percent from
last summer.  And now we now have the lowest inflation of any major
economy in the world, and we’re going to make it lower.  (Applause.)   
   
And in August, we announced the first 10 prescription drugs that
Medicare selected for negotiation under the Inflation Reduction Act. 
That’s a fancy way of saying: For many years, Big Pharma blocked us
along the way.  They kept prescription drug prices high and increased
their profits, extended patents on their existing drugs, and suppressed
competition instead of innovating.  
   
And, by the way, you order a prescription drug made in the United States
of America — you buy it in New York City or Washington, D.C., or Omaha,
Nebraska — it costs a hell of a lot more than the same exact drug by the
same company sold in Toronto, Canada; London; Rome; or anywhere else in
the world — the same exact drug.  You know, playing games with pricing
so they could charge whatever they want.   
   
But this time, we finally beat Big Pharma.  (Applause.)   
   
How long have we been trying to do this?  This has been going on a long
time.  None of the women in the front row here ha- — have been around
for more than two or three years, but some of the guys have been here
for a hell of a long time.  (Laughter.)  
   
But all kidding aside, think about it.  We’ve been fighting this fight
for a long, long time — long before I was president or vice
president.   
   
We passed the Inflation Reduction Act with no help from any of our
Republicans friends.  Every single one voted against it, but maybe they
will see the light.  
   
And among many important things it does, it finally gives Medicare the
ability to negotiate lower prescription drug prices like they can do in
the Vet- — with Veterans Affairs — like they do now.  
   
That’s not all — and, by the way, that not only saves the consumer.  It
reduces the federal budget.  Because guess what?  We don’t have to pay
that money out — taxpayers’ money — to reward these companies for
overcharging.  (Applause.)  
   
It’s something everybody forgets.  It’s over — well over a billion dol-
— anyway, I won’t get into how much it saved.  But I — I’ve kept you
sitting too long.   
   
But seniors on Medicare are now paying as much as $400 a month for
insulin.  Well, now they’re just going to pay $35 a month.  And I might
note: It costs these companies $10 to make the insulin — 10.  To package
it, you might be able to get it to $12.  And they’re still getting paid
$35, which is almost a 300 percent increase — more than a 300 percent
increase.  Now, I don’t get why — anyway —  
   
We’re also capping total out-of-price — out-of-pocket costs for seniors
on Medicare at $2,000 a year, even for expensive cancer drugs that can
cost $10-, $12-, $14,000 a year.  No matter what your prescription drug
costs are — beginning next year, no matter how much they are, no seniors
are going to have to pay more than $2,000 — $2,000.  (Applause.)   
   
And it matters.  
   
Look, let me close with this.  When I ran for president, I promised we
would not continue the trickle-down economics of the past.  Because
here’s the simple truth: Trickle-down economics represented the moment
we walked away from how this country’s middle class was built, in my
view.  Not a lot trickled down to my dad’s kitchen table, I don’t
recall.  
   
Bidenomics is another way of saying restoring the American Dream. 
Trickle-down limited the dream to those at the top.  But I believe that
every American willing to do hard work should be able to achieve it no
matter where they live in every part of the country.  
   
That’s the American Dream.  That’s Bidenomics.  
   
And that’s why I can honestly say I’ve never been more optimistic about
America’s future.  
   
We just have to remember who we are.  We are the United States of
America, for God’s sake.  
   
There is nothing — and I mean it sincerely — there is nothing beyond our
capacity when we work together.  
   
So, God bless you all.  Thank you for the strong support.  And may God
protect our troops.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)
