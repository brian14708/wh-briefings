State Dining Room

2:24 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  
   
You know, there are moments in this life — and I mean this literally —
when the pure, unadulterated evil is unleashed on this world.  
   
The people of Israel lived through one such moment this weekend.  The
bloody hands of the terrorist organization Hamas — a group whose stated
purpose for being is to kill Jews.   
   
This was an act of sheer evil.   
   
More than 1,000 civilians slaughtered — not just killed, slaughtered —
in Israel.  Among them, at least 14 American citizens killed.  
   
Parents butchered using their bodies to try to protect their children.  
   
Stomach-turning reports of being — babies being killed.  
   
Entire families slain.  
   
Young people massacred while attending a musical festival to celebrate
peace — to celebrate peace.  
   
Women raped, assaulted, paraded as trophies.  
   
Families hid their fear for hours and hours, desperately trying to keep
their children quiet to avoid drawing attention.  
   
And thousands of wounded, alive but carrying with them the bullet holes
and the shrapnel wounds and the memory of what they endured.  
   
You all know these traumas never go away.  
   
There are still so many families desperately waiting to hear the fate of
their loved ones, not knowing if they’re alive or dead or hostages.  
   
Infants in their mothers’ arms, grandparents in wheelchairs, Holocaust
survivors abducted and held hostage — hostages whom Hamas has now
threatened to execute in violation of every code of human morality.  
   
It’s abhorrent.  
   
The brutality of Hamas — this bloodthirstiness — brings to mind the
worst — the worst rampages of ISIS.  
   
This is terrorism.  
   
But sadly, for the Jewish people, it’s not new.  
   
This attack has brought to the surface painful memories and the scars
left by a millennia of antisemitism and genocide of the Jewish people.  
   
So, in this moment, we must be crystal clear: We stand with Israel.  We
stand with Israel.  And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to
take care of its citizens, defend itself, and respond to this attack.  
   
There is no justification for terrorism.  There is no excuse.  
   
Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people’s right to dignity and
self-determination.  Its stated purpose is the annihilation of the State
of Israel and the murder of Jewish people.  
   
They use Palestinian civilians as human shields.   
   
Hamas offers nothing but terror and bloodshed with no regard to who pays
the price.  
   
The loss of innocent life is heartbreaking.  
   
Like every nation in the world, Israel has the right to respond — indeed
has a duty to respond — to these vicious attacks.  
   
I just got off the phone with — the third call with Prime Minister
Netanyahu.  And I told him if the United States experienced what Israel
is experiencing, our response would be swift, decisive, and
overwhelming.   
   
We also discussed how democracies like Israel and the United States are
stronger and more secure when we act according to the rule of law.  
   
Terrorists purpo- — purposefully target civilians, kill them.  We uphold
the laws of war — the law of war.  It matters.  There’s a difference.  
   
Today, Americans across the country are praying for all those families
that have been ripped apart.  A lot of us know how it feels.  It leaves
a black hole in your chest when you lose family, feeling like you’re
being sucked in.  The anger, the pain, the sense of hopelessness.   
   
This is what they mean by a “human tragedy” — an atrocity on an
appalling scale.  
   
But we’re going to s- — continue to stand united, supporting the people
of Israel who are suffering unspeakable losses and opposing the hatred
and violence of terrorism.  
   
My team has been in near constant communication with our Israeli
partners and partners all across the region and the world from the
moment this crisis began.   
   
We’re surging additional military assistance, including ammunition and
interceptors to replenish Iron Dome.  
   
We’re going to make sure that Israel does not run out of these critical
assets to defend its cities and its citizens.  
   
My administration has consulted closely with Congress throughout this
crisis.  And when Congress returns, we’re going to ask them to take
urgent action to fund the national security requirements of our critical
partners.  
   
This is not about party or politics.  This is about the security of our
world, the security of the United States of America.  
   
We now know that American citizens are among those being held by
Hamas.  
   
I’ve directed my team to share intelligence and deploy additional
experts from across the United States government to consult with and
advise the Israeli counterparts on hostage recover- — recovery efforts,
because as president I have no higher priority than the safety of
Americans being held hostage around the world.  
   
The United States has also enhanced our military force posture in the
region to strengthen our deterrence.  
   
The Department of Defense has moved the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier
Strike Group to the Eastern Mediterranean and bolstered our fighter
aircraft presence.  And we stand ready to move in additional assets as
needed.  
   
Let me say again — to any country, any organization, anyone thinking of
taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don’t.  Don’t.  
   
Our hearts may be broken, but our resolve is clear.  
   
Yesterday, I also spoke with the leaders of  
France, Germany, Italy, and the UK to discuss the latest developments
with our European allies and coordinate our united response.  
   
This comes on top of days of steady engagement with partners across the
region.  
   
We’re also taking steps at home.  In cities across the United States of
America, police departments have stepped up security around centers for
— of Jewish life.  
   
And the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation are working closely with state and local law enforcement
and Jewish community partners to identify and disrupt any domestic
threat that could emerge in connection with these horrific attacks.  
   
This is a moment for the United States to come together, to grieve with
those who are mourning. 

Let’s be real clear: There is no place for hate in America — not against
Jews, not against Muslims, not against anybody.  We reject — we reject —
what we reject is terrorism.  We condemn the indiscriminate evil, just
as we’ve always done.  
   
That’s what America stands for.  
   
You know, just over 50 years ago — I was thinking about it this morning,
talking with the Secretary of State, the Vice President in my office and
— over 50 years ago, as a young senator, I visited Israel for the first
time, as a newly elected senator.   
   
And I had a long, long trip — or meeting with Golda Meir in her office
just before the Yom Kippur War.  And I guess she could see the
consternation on my face as she described what was being faced — they
were facing. 

We walked outside in that — that sort of hallway outside her office to
have some photos.  She looked at me and w- — all of a sudden and said,
“Would you like to have a photograph?”  And so, I got up and followed
her out. 

We were standing there silent, looking at the press.  She could tell, I
guess, I was concerned.  She leaned over and whispered to me — she said,
“Don’t worry, Senator Biden.  We have a secret weapon here in Israel” —
my word this is what she said — “We have no place else to go.”  “We have
no place else to go.”  
   
For 75 years, Israel has stood as the ultimate guarantor of security of
Jewish people around the world so that the atrocities of the past could
never happen again.   
   
And let there be no doubt: The United States has Israel’s back.  
   
We will make sure the Jewish and democratic State of Israel can defend
itself today, tomorrow, as we always have.  It’s as simple as that. 

These atrocities have been sickening.  
   
We’re — we’re with Israel.  Let’s make no mistake.   
   
Thank you.
