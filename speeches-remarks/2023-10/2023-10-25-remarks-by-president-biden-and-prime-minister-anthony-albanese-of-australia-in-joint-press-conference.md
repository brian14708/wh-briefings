  \ in Joint Press\_Conference"

Rose Garden

1:52 P.M. EDT  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  The sun is over there.  (The President removes his
sunglasses.)  I don’t need these.  (Laughter.) 

Hello, folks.   
   
Mr. Prime Minister, we’ve been in close touch since the moment you came
into office — please, sit down; I’m sorry — since you came into office,
and we’ve met all around the world.   
   
And now it’s wonderful to have you by my side here at the White House
and — as we advance our alliance even more — more than it’s already been
advanced.  It’s strong now; it’s getting stronger.   
   
Before I get to the progress Australia and the United States have made
today, I want to say just a very few words about the situation in the
Middle East.  
   
The anger, the hurt, the — the sense of outrage that the Israeli people
are feeling after the brutally inflicted devastation by Hamas is
completely understandable.  
   
Israel has the right and, I would add, responsibility to respond to the
slaughter of their people.  And we will ensure Israel has what it needs
to defend itself against these terrorists.  That’s a guarantee.   
   
We also have to remember that Hamas does not represent — let me say it
again — Hamas does not represent the vast majority of the Palestinian
people in the Gaza Strip or anywhere else.  
   
Hamas is hiding behind Palestinian civilians, and it’s despicable and,
not surprisingly, cowardly as well.   
   
This also puts an added burden on Israel while they go after Hamas.  
   
But that does not lessen the need for — to operate and align with the
laws of war for Israeli — it has to do everything in its power — Israel
has to do everything in its power, as difficult as it is, to protect
innocent civilians.  And it’s difficult.   
   
I want to thank the Israeli — the Israelis and the Palestinian — excuse
me, and President Sisi of Egypt for working with the United States to
make sure that food, water, and medical supplies are getting through to
innocent people in Gaza.   
   
The flow needs to increase, and we’re working very hard with our
partners to make that happen.  
   
We’re also working around the clock, together with our partners in the —
in the region, to secure the release of hostages and — including
American citizens behind — left behind and held by Hamas and the safe
passage of foreign nationals out of Gaza — not just Americans but
Australians and a whole range of people who are trapped in Gaza.    
   
I also want take a moment to look ahead toward the future that we
seek.  
   
Israelis and Palestinians equally deserve to live side by side in
safety, dignity, and peace.  And there’s no going back to the status quo
as it stood on October the 6th.  That means ensuring Hamas can no longer
terrorize Israel and use Palestinian civilians as human shields.  
   
It also means that when this crisis is over, there has to be a vision of
what comes next.  And in our view, it has to be a two-state solution.  
   
It means a concentrated effort from all the parties — Israelis,
Palestinians, regional partners, global leaders — to put us on a path
toward peace.  
   
In the past few weeks, I’ve spoken with leaders throughout the region —
including King Abdullah of Jordan, President Sisi of Egypt, President
Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, and just yesterday with the Crown
Prince of Saudi Arabia — about making sure there’s real hope in the
region for a better future; about the need — and I mean this sincerely —
about the need to work toward a greater integration for Israel while
insisting that the aspirations of the Palestinian people will be part —
will be part of that future as well.  
   
I’m convinced one of the reasons Hamas attacked when they did — and I
have no proof of this; just my instinct tells me — is because of the
progress we were making towards regional integration for Israel and
regional integration overall.  And we can’t leave that work behind.   
   
And one more word on this.  I continue to be alarmed about extremist
settlers attacking Palestinians in the West Bank that — pouring gasoline
on fire is what it’s like.

They — this was the deal.  The deal was made, and they’re attacking
Palestinians in places that they’re entitled to be, and it has to stop. 
They have to be held accountable.  And it has to stop now.  
   
Prime Minister — Mr. Prime Minister, I want to thank you for your
partnership and your friendship, quite frankly, during this difficult
hour.   
   
Over the past few weeks and for many months before, we’ve seen each
other and we’ve seen our alliance grow more critical than ever.  And we
need to make — continue to make this important progress.  In our
discussions today, we’ve done just that.   
   
First, we’re pioneering new advancements in innovation that is deepening
our cooperation in fields like biotechnology, advanced batteries,
quantum computing, cybersecurity, and a lot more.   
   
We’re also signing a new Technology Safeguards Agreement to create more
opportunities for American space companies to launch vehicles from
Australia.  
   
And we’ve launched a new artificial intelligence initiative between our
national laboratories to drive revolutionary and responsible research on
humanity’s biggest challenges: fighting hunger, curbing pandemics,
predicting natural disasters, and ending cancer as we know it — as a
matter of a fact, both of our wives are over at the cancer institute
right now — and — and so much more.  
   
Second, we’re accelerating action on climate change.  I thought we had a
very good meeting this morning and — with Secretary Kerry and your team,
and we’re all together on that.   
   
In May, we established the Climate, Critical Min- — Min –Climate,
Critical Minerals, and Clean Energy Compact to elevate our climate
cooperation alongside our defense and economic cooperation, and we’re
already beginning to see the impacts.  We’ve created a Critical Minerals
Taskforce to build secure critical minerals supply chains.  
   
We’re also investing in sustainable infrastructure in the Pacific
Islands, including $65 million for a subsea communication cable to boost
connectivity in the region.   
   
And we’re modernizing funding for small- and medium-sized  
businesses across the Indo-Pacific to help — to help the transition to
clean energy.  
   
And finally, our alliance — the alliance between Australia and the
United States is an anchor — and I believe this with every fiber of my
being — an anchor to peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and, quite
frankly, around the world.  
   
We see this through our work of the Quad partners — India and Japan — to
ensure the Indo-Pacific remains free, open, prosperous, and secure.  
   
I also see it through AUKUS, where, together with the United Kingdom,
we’re making a generational investments in our shared security.  
   
Last week, I sent Congress a budget request with commitments to boost
our sub- — our submarine production and maintenance capacity here in the
United States.  
   
And I want to thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, for the historic
investments Australia has made to strengthen the submarine industry base
as well.  
   
Democrats and Republicans alike understand the strategic value AUKUS
brings to our nations, and I urge Congress — I urge Congress to pass our
AUKUS legislation this year.  
   
We also see the strength of our alliance in our unwavering support for
Ukraine — both countries — as it defends its sovereignty against Putin’s
brutality and aggression.  
   
Australia is a critical partner together with the United States and 50
other nations — 50 other nations we’ve been able to put together — all
doing our part to support Ukraine.  
   
And I want to thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, for the new package of
military aid you recently announced, and I — it’s for Ukraine.  
   
Look, Australia and the United States also share, in my view, the
commitment to upholding the international rules of the road, including
freedom of navigation.  
   
Just this past week, the PRC vessels acted dangerously and unlawfully as
our Philippine friends conducted a routine resupply mission within their
own — their own exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea.  
   
I want to be clear — I want to be very clear: The United States’ defense
commitment to the Philippines is ironclad.  The United States’ defense
agreement to the Philippines is ironclad.  
   
Any attack on the Filipino aircraft, vessels, or armed forces will
invoke a mu- — our Mutual Defense Treaty with the Philippines.  
   
And, Mr. Prime Minister, today we renewed our commitment to defend the
values that are at the heart of this alliance, and we continue to stand
as one to forge a better future for both of us and all the region.  
   
So, I want to thank you, again, for being here.  Thank you for your
partnership and your leadership in this critical moment.  
   
And I’d like to now turn it over to you.  
   
PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE:  Well, thank you very much, Mr. President.  
   
Australia and the United States have stood together for more than a
century.  And it is indeed a great honor for me to stand alongside my
friend, President Biden, here today.  
   
At the heart of our alliance, the enduring values that our people hold
in common are faith in freedom and democracy, a belief in opportunity, a
determination to build a more prosperous and more peaceful world.   
   
Those values are timeless, and they have never mattered more than right
now.  
   
That’s why the relationship between Australia and the United States has
never been more important.  And it, of course — it has never been
stronger than it is right now.  
   
We work together to promote peace and security across the Indo-Pacific,
to uphold the stability which has generated unprecedented economic
opportunity for the nations and the people of our region.  
   
For Australia, this is about investing in our capability and investing
in our relationships.  
   
Today, President Biden and I discussed the progress being made on
Australia’s acquisition of nuclear-powered, conventionally armed
submarines, which we announced with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in March
in San Diego.  
   
We are conscious that this is only the second time in history that the
United States has shared this technology.  And this fact speaks to the
deep trust of our alliance and the significance of the challenge that we
face together.  
   
Australia appreciates the administration’s efforts to operationalize
AUKUS and work with Congress to pass the legislation needed to realize
our AUKUS ambitions.  And I certainly appreciate, once again, Mr.
President, your call for this legislation to be passed this year.  
   
AUKUS will drive innovation and cooperation to provide the United
States, Australia, and the United Kingdom with improved capability to
help secure peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific.  
   
Our cooperation is already unlocking transformative opportunities for
jobs and skills and research, from Virginia to South Australia to
Western Australia.  
   
Australia and the U.S. have a strong and growing partnership in new
technology, from medical research to AI.  And I join President Biden in
welcoming Microsoft’s $5 billion additional investment in Australia,
which we announced this week here in Washington.   
   
The President and I agree that innovation is vital to addressing the
environmental challenge of climate change and seizing the economic
opportunities of clean energy.  The Climate, Critical Minerals and Clean
Energy Transformation Compact that we signed in May in Hiroshima is very
much central to this.   
   
Climate change and clean energy becomes a third pillar of our alliance,
alongside our security cooperation through ANZUS and our strong economic
ties with the free trade agreement between our nations at its center.  
   
The compact lays the foundation for our two countries to advance climate
and clean energy action this decade, both at home and globally.  Today,
we agreed new measures under the compact to support our energy
transition, including the establishment of an Australian and U.S. Clean
Energy Industry Council, comprised of business and public finance
leaders to advise government on clean energy industry development and
cooperation.   
   
We’re working closely with the United States to build end-to-end
sustainable, reliable, and transparent supply chains for critical
minerals.  Of course, Australia has abundant supplies of these critical
minerals that will drive our economies throughout this century: lithium,
cobalt, copper, vanadium, and rare earths.   
   
We want to connect that with American markets, investors, and technology
in a way that creates new jobs and opportunities for industry and
workers in both of our nations.  Cheaper, cleaner energy will reduce
costs for households, but it will also power a new generation of
manufacturing.   
   
Our alliance is also delivering for the Indo-Pacific region bilaterally
and increasingly with our partners in the Quad.   
   
Australia and America are supporting the connectivity of the region, and
today we announced a new funding for subsea cables in the Pacific;
further support for infrastructure development, including efforts to
increase the Pacific’s access to financing; and that we’ll work together
through a new Pacific banking forum to ensure that our friends in the
Pacific maintain access to the global financial system.   
   
Today, we also discussed our joint position opposing Russia’s illegal
and immoral invasion of Ukraine.  Australia stands with Ukraine.   
   
And President Biden welcomed the package for further assistance that I
announced yesterday.  This will provide Ukraine with additional military
assistance, utilizing the innovative technology that’s produced by
Australia’s defense industry partners.   
   
Finally, of course, last night and again today, we spoke about the
situation in Israel and Gaza.  Australia unequivocally condemns the
terrorism of Hamas.  We grieve for the loss of every innocent life,
whether that be Israeli or Palestinian.   
   
In times of crisis, respect for international humanitarian law is
paramount.  It is a recognition of our common humanity.  And I commend
the President for his leadership that he has shown and the example that
he has set.   
   
Today, I announced that Australia will provide an additional $15 million
in humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza — this adds to the $10
million Australia has already committed — and will help deliver
lifesaving assistance such as emergency water and medical services.   
   
The friendship between Australia and the United States was forged in
hard times.  We’ve served and sacrificed together in the cause of
peace.  We’ve helped each other through natural disasters.   
   
Australians and Americans share a rich history, but we always have our
eye on the future.  We’re united by a determination to overcome the
challenges that we face, and we share an ambition to seize those
opportunities which lay ahead of us.   
   
Ours is indeed an alliance in which we celebrate what we’ve achieved up
to now but we focus on the future — a future of great opportunities, one
that’s stronger because of this alliance.   
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  All right.  We’re going to take a few questions
now.   
   
Mr. Garrison, USA Today.   
   
Q    Thank you, Mr. President and Prime Minister Albanese.  Welcome to
Washington.   
   
Mr. President, I want to ask about the conflict — the war in the Middle
East.  Twenty-four U.S. troops have been injured during 10 drone or
rocket attacks on bases in Iraq and 3 in Syria over the past week. 
You’ve told Iran to, quote, “be careful” as your administration tries to
prevent the Israeli-Hamas war from expanding into a larger Middle East
conflict.  But should Americans be worried that the war already is
escalating?   
   
And after you answer that question, I’d like one more follow-up,
please.   
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  About one or two more, huh?  
   
Q    Two or three.  (Laughter.)  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Joey, look, we have had troops in the region since
9/11 to go after ISIS and prevent its reasser- — reemergence in — in
both — anyway, in the region — having nothing to do with Israel at
all.   
   
My warning to the Ayatollah was that if they continue to move against
those troops, we will respond, and he should be prepared.  It has
nothing to do with Israel.   
   
Q    Well, let me — let me ask my follow-up here.  I want to discuss —
oh, here we go — yeah, your conversations with Prime Minister Netanyahu,
who, obviously, you’ve known for decades, and you had a very emotional
trip there last week to Israel.  Have you sought assurances from him
that he will hold off on a ground invasion into Gaza until the safe
relief — release of the hostages can be assured?  And, of course, those
include 10 unaccounted-for Americans.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  No.  What I have indicated to him is that if that’s
possible to get these folks out safely, that’s what he should do.  It’s
their decision, but I did not demand it.  I pointed out to him: If it’s
real, it should be done.  
   
Thank you.  
   
Q    But aren’t these hostages in jeopardy if there is a ground
invasion?   
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  You want to make a speech?  (Laughter.)  Now, look —  
   
Q    Yes?  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  — obviously, they’re in jeopardy.  The question is
whether or not there’s any way of getting them out.  If we can get them
out, we should get them out.  
   
Q    Prime Minister — Prime Minister Albanese — and welcome, again, to
Washington — President Biden canceled his May trip to Australia because
of debt ceiling talks in Congress to avoid a first-ever default here in
the U.S.   
   
More recently, congressional action has stalled as House Republicans try
to pick a Speaker.  However, it does appear, since we’ve been out here,
that the House has elected a Congressman, Mike Johnson from Louisiana,
to that role.   
   
But are you worried that grid- — the gridlock in Washington will hold up
the transfer of nuclear-powered subs to Australia as part of the AUKUS
agreement?  And are you concerned, more broadly, that the dysfunction
makes the U.S. a less reliable partner?  
   
PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE:  I regard the United States as a very reliable
partner.  And I regard the relationship that I have with the President
as second to none of the relationships that I have around the world or
indeed domestically, for that matter.  (Laughter.)   
   
It’s a — it’s a relationship of trust, and I think this visit symbolizes
that.  This is the ninth visit that I’ve had with President Biden.  I
got to meet President Biden when he was Vice President Biden just — just
next door here some years ago.  
   
And I’m very confident in the discussions that I’ve had with Democrats
and Republicans that there is very broad support for the AUKUS
arrangements, and that there will be support for the legislation going
forward.  And I think that would be a very good thing.  It is in the
interest of Australia, but it’s also in the interest of the United
States.   
   
And everyone that I have spoken to — similarly in the United Kingdom —
across the political spectrum are all supportive of the AUKUS
arrangements.   
   
Q    And regarding the Israel-Hamas war, I wanted to ask —  
   
PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE:  Well, we — we —  
   
Q    Yeah?  
   
PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE:  — we in Australia have managed to get it so we
get once question each.  So —  
   
Q    Hey, I figured I’d try and ask a sec- —   
   
PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE:  Yeah, good try.   
   
Q    Anyway, all right.   
   
PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE:  But, Channel 10 Australia.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Go get ‘em, Joe Joe.  (Laughter.)   
   
Q    President Biden, just staying with AUKUS.  AUKUS is in many ways
your creation.  It’s Australia’s largest-ever defense deal, and Prime
Minister Anthony Albanese has gone all in.  Can you give a personal
guarantee that you can get all the necessary legislation through
Congress and lock in this deal, essentially future-proofing it, before
the end of his presidential term?  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Do you know anyone in elective office who can give a
personal guarantee that it happens?  I won’t — I — I’m not going to —   
   
Q    Well, we’d like you to try.   
   
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  No, I’m going to try, and I believe it will get
done.   
   
Look, last week we requested $3.4 billion in — in supplemental funds to
boost submarine production and maintenance to meet U.S. needs and also
support AUKUS.  Australia is making a significant — a significant
investment in the United States and its ability to produce submarines as
part of this deal.  And more importantly, it’s important that Congress
move quickly.   
   
And the fact is that I’m confident that we can get this done, because —
you remember when we put it — the deal together?  The response — the
Democrats and Republicans in the United States — the response around the
free world was, “This is a very, very good thing.  A very good
thing.”   
   
So, the question is not if but when and I — and Joe Joe told us that
they — we got a new Speaker or will likely have a new Speaker.  I hope
that’s true because we have to get moving.  We have to get moving.  And
so, I’m — I am confident that we’re going to be able to get the money
for AUKUS because it’s overwhelmingly in our interest.   
   
When I was asked — when we put together the deal, I was asked by Xi
Jinping were we just trying to surround China.  I said, “No, we’re not
surrounding China.”  We’re just making sure that the sea lanes remain
open, he doesn’t univer- — unilaterally be able to change the out — the
rules of the road in terms of what constitutes international airspace
and water space, et cetera.  And so, that’s what this is all about. 
It’s about making sure we have a close —  
   
And it’s in addition to the fact that we put together the Quad, which
they didn’t like.  The Quad is a very important piece as well.  It’s
about maintaining stability — stability in the Taiwan Strait, the Indian
Ocean, the whole — that whole area.  And I think it’s going to increase
the prospects for long-term peace rather than do anything else.  
   
PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE:  Your turn.   
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Oh, I get to ask.  I’m going to get to — okay.   
   
PBS.  Ms. — Ms. Lopez.  
   
Q    Mr. President, thank you.  If I may, I have a breaking news
question and then an Israel one.   
   
First, after 22 days, House Republicans just elected Mike Johnson of
Louisiana as the Speaker of the House.  Johnson advocated conspiracy
theories about voting machines and a rigged election in 2020.  He
encouraged his colleagues to join a lawsuit to invalidate the results of
four states.  So, if you win reelection in 2024, are you worried that a
Speaker Johnson would again attempt to overturn the election?  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  No.  
   
Q    Why not?  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Because he can’t have — look, just like I was not
worried that the last guy would be able to overturn the election.  They
have about 60 lawsuits, and they all went to the Supreme Court, and,
every time, they lost.  I understand the Constitution.  
   
Q    And if I may, very quickly — in the 18 days since Hama- — Hamas
killed 1,400 Israelis, the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry says
Israeli forces have killed over 6,000 Palestinians, including 2,700
chil- — children.  You’ve previously asked Netanyahu to minimize
civilian casualties.  Do these numbers say to you that he is ignoring
that message?  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  What they say to me is I have no notion that the
Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed. 
I’m sure innocents have been killed, and it’s the price of waging a
war.   
   
I think we should be incredibly careful.  I think — well, not “we” — the
Israelis should be incredibly careful to be sure that they’re focusing
on going after the folks that are the pr- — propagating this war against
Israel.  And it’s against their interest when that doesn’t happen.   
   
But I have no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are
using.  
   
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  
   
Prime Minister Albanese, you’re traveling to China early next month. 
President Biden has said China should expect, quote, “extreme
competition from the United States.”  Do you support extreme competition
with China?  And what does that look like for you?  
   
PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE:  Well, we have strategic competition in our
region.  That’s a fact that we are living with.   
   
The relationship with — with China is one where the principle that I
bring to it is to cooperate where we can, disagree where we must, but
engage in our national interest.   
   
It is in Australia’s interest, as well as China — but, I believe, in the
global interest — for us to have a relationship where there is
dialogue.  And hence, I welcome the fact that I have been invited to
China.   
   
I’ll be traveling at the same time as we will commemorate 50 years since
the first visit by an Australian prime minister, Gough Whitlam, to China
in a — a short period of time now.  And I think that is a positive
thing.   
   
It is good that various senior representatives in the U.S.
administration have had meetings with their Chinese counterparts in
recent times, because dialogue is always a good thing.  Through dialogue
comes understanding and comes a diffusion of tension.  
   
We want a peaceful and secure region, but we want one as well that’s
based upon the rule of law and where national sovereignty, including
issues such as the South China Sea and the — the right of passage in
that important waterway there — the East China Sea, the Taiwan Strait —
is respected.  And that is Australia’s position.   
   
We cooperate very much with the — with the United States on those
matters and on others.   
   
But I look forward to a constructive dialogue when I visit Shanghai and
Beijing.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  The context of extreme competition was not conflict. 
Read the whole paragraph.  I talked about — we’re going to have — we’re
going to compete with China on every way according to the international
rules — economically, politically, and other ways — but not — I’m not
looking for conflict.  
   
PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE:  Geoff.  
   
Q    Yeah, Geoff Chambers from The Australian.  
President Biden, as mentioned, Prime Minister Albanese flies to Beijing
next Saturday to meet the Chinese President and Premier.  Your
administration has raised deep concerns over a very long period of time
about the Chinese communist government’s aggressive coercion and
intimidation tactics; maritime claims in the South China Sea, as we’ve
seen with the situation with the Philippines; state-sponsored
cyberattacks.   
   
Last week, we heard from the spy chiefs talking about theft of
intellectual property on an industrial scale and obviously, human rights
abuses.  What do you make of China’s reengagement with Australia?  Can
Australia trust Beijing?  And can Australia do business with China?  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  “Trust but verify” is the phrase.  And, look, China is
having their own internal and external difficulties right now.  China’s
economic growth is stagnant compared to what it was.  China has engaged
in activities that Russia and many other activities that — that others
have engaged in in terms of intimidation and dealing with other
countries.   
   
But the fact is that I have met with Xi Jinping more than any other
world leader has.  I’ve had over 68 hours of private meetings, just he
and I with simultaneous interpreters — starting back when I was vice
president, because it wasn’t appropriate for a president of the United
States to be meeting with the vice president.  So, I traveled 17,000
miles with him.   
   
And I’ve subsequently — in addition to that 68 hours, I’ve also had
another — they tell me — they keep meticulous contact as I — another, I
think, 12, 15 hours of discussions, just he and I.   
   
And I think that he is realizing that there are — for example, his Belt
and Road Initiative — well, we’re going to compete on that.  And we’re
going to — we’re doing it a different way.  The Belt and Road Initiative
has been a debt and a noose for most of the people that signed on.  
   
We are working with our G7 partners to provide infrastructure for the
very nations that he’s trying to deal with.   
   
We want to — for example, the G — at the G20, we were able to act on a
proposal I had to bring — to build a railroad all the way from Riyadh,
all the way through the Middle East, Saudi Arabia, Israel, up through
Greece, and then across the — not the railroad, but pipeline across the
— the Mediterranean up into Europe.  To y- —  
   
Q    So you’re the more reliable partner?  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Pardon me?  
   
Q    You’re the reliable partner in terms of when you say you’re going
to deliver something, the U.S. and its partners deliver things.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, I — I hope the United — not just me — I hope the
United States is a reliable partner when we act.  But it wasn’t just the
United States that agreed on that.   
   
Because, look, even to this day, when my discussions with — with — with
the — with the Saudis, the Crown Prince, was he wants to see a
reconciliation take place.  It’s overwhelmingly in his interest.  It’s
in Saudis’ interest.  It’s — the idea that you’d have the nations of the
Middle East cooperating economically and politically changes the
dynamics significantly.   
   
And so, I — I just think that it is — it’s something that it’s in
everyone’s interest — including, long-term, in China’s interest.   
   
Q    I just had one for the Prime Minister as well.  Have you had a
chance to speak to Benjamin Netanyahu?  I know there’s been efforts
made.  Obviously, the President was — was there in Israel last week. 
Are you still endeavoring to speak to the Israeli Prime Minister?  
   
PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE:  I — I am.  I have spoken with the Israeli
ambassador on a number of occasions.  We continue to — we understand
that, obviously, Mr. Netanyahu has — has pressures on, which at the —
the top of the list is not — is — is not the discussion with the
Australian Prime Minister.   
   
We understand the pressures which are there, but we have a request for a
call in.   
   
Thank you.
