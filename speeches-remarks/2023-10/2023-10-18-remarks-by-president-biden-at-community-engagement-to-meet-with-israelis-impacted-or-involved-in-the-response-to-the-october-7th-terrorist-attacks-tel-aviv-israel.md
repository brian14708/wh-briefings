THE PRESIDENT:  Folks, there is an Irish poet named William Butler
Yeats, and he wrote a line — he said: Too long a suffering makes a stone
of the heart. Too long a suffering makes a stone of the heart.  
   
The thing that I found at just this real quick meeting with all of you
is none of your hearts have turned to stone yet.  Every one of you
talked about what you have to do — every one I talked to — about having
to reach out, talked about, whether or not they were a Jew or a Muslim,
reach out.   
   
And, you know, I’ve often said I remember the first time that I was in
Israel with Golda Meir.  She was — just before the Six-Day War.  And she
was telling me how terrible everything was, which it was.   
   
She kept flipping the maps up and down behind her.  And all of the
sudden, she looked at me, and she said, “Would you like a photograph?” 
And I thought, “That’s unusual.”  And w- — she just got up and walked
out that door outside her office. 

And we’re standing there having a photograph taken like you and I are
standing, looking at the press.  And she — without looking at me, she
turned and she — like this, and she said, “You look worried, Senator.” 
I said, “I am.”  She said, “Don’t worry, we Jews have a secret weapon in
our fight: We have no place else to go.”  
   
Well, the truth of the matter is, if there weren’t an Israel, we’d have
to invent one.  The truth of the matter is that I believe that yo- — as
I went home and said — I got in trouble at the time, but it was true:
You don’t have to be a Jew to be a Zionist.  You don’t have to be a Jew
to be a Zionist.  

And I think the security and safety of Jews worldwide is anchored in the
re- — the continued vibrance of the State of Israel.  That’s what I
think it’s about at its core.  
   
And so, I’ve admired you — you all, this country for so long.  And I’m
convinced that the more people know the — your responses to what’s
happening as opposed to just what war and peace is about, the more
they’re going to be inclined embrace — embrace Israel.  
   
And — but I have a lot more to say.  But I’d like to talk to you in
private, if I can.  (Applause.)  
   
Q    What evidence have you seen (inaudible)?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  The data I was shown.  The data I was shown by my
Defense Department.
