InterContinental Presidente  
Mexico City, Mexico

10:42 A.M. CST  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, Mr. Prime Minister, it’s great to see you here. 
When we talked at the G20, we talked about the need for us as partners
to continue not only to stay partners, but to increase our
coordination.  And that’s something that — that we’re going to do.  
   
I think your phrase was: “When we work together, we can achieve great
things.”  And I believe that.  I know the American press is tired of
hearing me say this, but I’m optimistic.  I’m optimistic about the
future and the near term.  And it’s going to be hard, but there’s a lot
we can do together.  
   
And the fact is we’ve been partners and friends.  We’re NATO partners. 
We’re involved in the — the North American Leaders’ Summit.  Today,
we’re going to be going over and seeing our — our counterpart, the
President of Mexico.  
   
But I think what we should be doing and we are doing is demonstrating
the unlimited economic potential that we have when we work together and
— in the hemisphere, and to help the entire hemisphere.  
   
And there’s a lot we’re going to be talking about, including clean
energy.  We should be the clean energy powerhouse of the world.  And
that’s not hyperbole; I genuinely mean that.  
   
And we’re also in a situation where we’re in the process at home — and
you are as well, and we’ve talked about it — of strengthening our supply
chains so that no one can arbitrarily hold us up or a pandemic in Asia
cause us to not have access to critical elements that we need to do
everything from build automobiles to so many other things.  
   
And, together, I think we’re achieving some really significant things. 
Today, we’re going to discuss how we can try to help stabilize Haiti and
how we can deal with migration and, at the same time, bolster our
national security.  
   
So, I want to thank you again.  You’ve always been there.  Whenever I’ve
called, you’ve picked up the phone.  Obviously, it’s the same here.  
   
I don’t think we have — as I told one foreign leader who was with a
different perspective than — than you and I have on world peace — and I
said to him — I said, “Well, I’m lucky.  I got Canada to the north and
Mexico to the south and two oceans on either side.  You’ve got…” — and
then I described his circumstance.  And he just looked at me like
“Ooh.”  (Laughter.)  
   
But it’s true — we got to make the most of it.  And so, thank you for
everything.  
  
PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU:  Thank you, Joe.  It’s so good to be able to —
to spend a little time with you here on — on some more local issues.  
  
You and I have been working so closely on significant global issues,
whether it’s the pressures of China and Russia, and Russia’s illegal
invasion of Ukraine, and the need to continue to stand up strong for
democracy, for the rule of law, for — for opportunities and inclusive
economic growth around the world.  
  
But, as you say, there are tremendous things that we can build on here
at home.  
  
North America is the largest free-trading bloc in the world, larger even
than the European Union.  We have a tremendous amount to contribute to
the world in goods and services but also in technologies and solutions
that the world really needs.  And our capacity to work together has
brought us to places of extraordinary success.  But at a time of
disruption around the world, a time of very real challenges, we can and
must be doing even more.  
  
So I’m really pleased with all the work that our folks have been doing
over the past many months and years on aligning or coordinating so that
we’re leading the way on the — on the — the net-zero transition we all
have to do while at the same time ensuring that individual Canadians and
Americans and Mexicans and others around the world can see themselves in
the future in an optimistic way and understand that, yes, we’re at a
time of challenges and strife, but, you’re right, there’s a lot of
reasons to be optimistic, especially for those of us in our countries.  
  
But it’s going to take a lot of work, something that neither you nor I
nor mostly our citizens have ever been afraid of.  Rolling up our
sleeves and building that better future and those better communities is
absolutely essential.   
  
So, as we talk about issues, whether it’s Haiti, whether it’s some of
the challenges in South America, whether we talk about critical minerals
and energy and how we’re going to continue to move forward to create
those efficient and resilient supply and value chains that we need,
there’s a lot that we’re going to be able to do together.  
  
(Speaks in French.)  (No translation provided.)  
  
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Every time you end like that, I think to myself, “I
should have spent more time when I was in college.”  (Laughter.)  I took
French for years, but I never –  
–  
   
Anyway, thank you.
