title: "Remarks by Vice President Harris After Visiting Calumet\_Fisheries"

Calumet Fisheries  
Chicago, Illinois

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, it’s been a good day being in Illinois, in
Chicago.   
   
And the reason we’re here is it’s about this bridge and bridges across
America, and the work that we have done that has been — I think will
prove to be historic in terms of this phase of the growth and strength
of our country.  It is about uplifting communities.  It’s about,
obviously, repairing and upgrading our infrastructure.  It’s about
jobs.  And it really is about strengthening America.  
   
There is so much about where we are right now that I think should be
about thinking about the future and investment in the future.  And
that’s what this work represents.   
   
It’s real work, it’s hitting the ground, and it’s going to be making a
difference for communities and across our nation.  
   
So, thank you all for being here.
