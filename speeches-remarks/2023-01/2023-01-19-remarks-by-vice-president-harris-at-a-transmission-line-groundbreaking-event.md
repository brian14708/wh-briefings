THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, all.  Thank you.  Good afternoon,
everyone.  Good afternoon.  Please have a seat.  
   
Kyle, thank you for those words and for your work.  I had the great
pleasure of spending a little bit of time with Kyle and his colleagues
on the other side of this tent, talking about their work.  And it’s
extraordinary what you guys are doing.  It’s highly skilled work.  It is
transformational work.  
   
I asked Kyle to explain a little bit about, you know, if you’re talking
with folks, to help them understand what it involves, what do you talk
about, how do you feel about it.  
   
And he said, “You know, it’s more than a job.”  He said, “It’s a
lifestyle.”  He said you — “It takes time away from your family, but you
make incredible friends that become like family in terms of being on the
ground and doing this work.”  
   
So, Kyle, thank you so very much.  Thank you.  We can applaud all that
he and his colleagues are doing.  (Applause.)  
   
And thank you to all the linemen of the IBEW.  I will say it is great to
be back in Arizona.  
   
Governor Katie Hobbs, I want to thank you for your leadership and for
welcoming us to this beautiful state.  
   
We are joined today also by two true champions in the fight against the
climate crisis, and of course that is the Secretary of Energy, Jennifer
Granholm, and the Secretary of the Interior, Deb Haaland.  Thank you
both for your leadership.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  
   
And it is also good to be here with the leaders of Ten West and CAISO. 
Thank you for all that you are doing.  This is truly a partnership.  
   
So, you know, when I was a child, my family would take road trips, like
I’m sure many of us.  And I remember sitting in the backseat of my
mother’s Dodge Dart.  It was yellow; she let us pick out the color. 
(Laughs.)   
   
And we’d be sitting in the backseat, me and my sister, and trying to,
you know, figure out how to occupy the time.  I’ll date myself by saying
sometimes we would occupy the time by counting how many VW Bugs that we
saw drive by.  (Laughs.)  People are nodding.  
   
But also, sometimes, just looking out the window.  And I remember
watching the miles and miles of electric wires flash by the window.  And
it was — it was kind of mesmerizing to just see those lines as we were
driving the roads.  And those wires, they seemed endless.  
   
Well, let’s think about it.  Today, America has more than half a million
miles of transmission lines, enough to wrap around the globe 24 times. 
These lines connect the power plants, where electricity is created, to
homes and businesses and schools and hospitals across our nation.  
   
Think about it: Every time you turn on a light or charge your laptop or
plug in your air conditioner or put leftovers in the fridge, you rely on
the power delivered by our nation’s network of transmission lines.  And
that network is in desperate need of an upgrade.   
   
So, America is at the start of an historic transition away from fossil
fuel plants that pollute our communities and toward cleaner and safer
energy sources.  
   
Today, on the plains of Kansas, off the shores of New York, and in the
deserts of Arizona, our nation is building new sources of energy — in
particular, new wind and solar farms, which generate clean power for
millions of families.  
   
But there’s a challenge.  Those wind and solar farms are often far away
from the communities that they power.  In many cases, the infrastructure
we need to move clean electricity from where it is created to where it
is most needed has not yet been built.  
   
And so, to create our clean energy future, we must construct thousands
of miles of new high-voltage transmission lines all across our
country.  
   
And that is why we are here today.  
   
The Ten West Link transmission line will stretch from Arizona to
California.  It will deliver electricity from wind and solar farms out
here in the desert, to big cities like Phoenix and Los Angeles and San
Diego, and to rural communities like Blythe and Quartzite — Quartzsite. 
This electricity will be clean electricity.  Solar panels and wind
turbines do not produce toxic fumes that poison our air or dangerous
chemicals that poison our water.  
   
And the energy delivered by these lines will not just be cleaner, it
will also be cheaper.  On average, you see, clean electricity is less
expensive than electricity generated from traditional sources.  
   
And more transition to transmission lines means more clean energy for
our communities.  And that means more money in the pocket of the
American people, more money to buy groceries, to invest in home repairs,
to pay for your kid’s college, and to save for your retirement.  
   
New and upgraded transmission lines will also help make sure communities
have enough power to meet peak demand, which will increase energy
reliability, which means it will help prevent against that one bad storm
or wildfire that knocks out the lights.  
   
That’s fewer blackouts, fewer summer nights without the A/C, and fewer
of those cell phone alerts that tell you to turn off or reduce
nonessential power so the grid doesn’t overload.  
   
And all of this also creates jobs — good-paying jobs, union jobs.  Jobs
for IBEW linemen who will build and repair these lines.  Jobs for young
people looking to start a career in clean energy and the clean energy
economy.  Jobs that will help our nation finally take on the climate
crisis as the crisis that it is.  
   
You know, for years, we have witnessed the impact of the climate
crisis.  For years, we have also experienced the impact of the climate
crisis.  
   
Communities have been wiped out by wildfire, destroyed by hurricanes,
and choked by deadly heat.  
   
Here in Arizona, record-breaking droughts have made access to clean
water increasingly uncertain.  
  
In my home state of California, over the last month, records have been
set.  Rain has flooded neighborhoods and washed away farmland.  And at
least 20 people are dead, including a child, in this most recent
episode.  
   
And yet, for far too long, our nation has not acted with the urgency the
climate crisis demands.  And here’s the thing: It’s not because the
science has been unclear.  Scientists have warned us for years about the
dangers of greenhouse gas emissions.  
   
It’s not because we lacked solutions.  We know how to reduce our
emissions and protect our communities.  No.  None of that.   
  
It’s because we have failed, for so long, to have folks who are fighting
for action — you know, so many so-called leaders who lacked the
political will and courage to act.  
   
Well, now I think we’ve turned the page and there’s consensus across all
kinds of lines: that it’s time to take this crisis seriously, that that
time has arrived.  
   
And so, last year, we all joined together — activists and organizers,
parents and students, Native leaders, civil rights leaders, business
leaders, and union workers.  And together, we made the largest
investment to fight the climate crisis in American history.  
   
And today, across our nation, we are putting that investment to work.  
   
We are breaking ground on a solar panel factory in Alabama, a battery
factory in Michigan, and a semiconductor factory in Chandler.  
   
So, Arizona, I’m here today because this project demonstrates a very
important point.  It shows that when we invest in climate, we also
invest in families, in communities, in opportunity and prosperity for
all people.  
   
When we invest in climate, we build a safer, cleaner, healthier, more
just, and more prosperous country.  
  
When we invest in climate, we invest in America.  
   
May God bless you.  And may God bless the United States of America. 
(Applause.)  
  
Thank you all.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
