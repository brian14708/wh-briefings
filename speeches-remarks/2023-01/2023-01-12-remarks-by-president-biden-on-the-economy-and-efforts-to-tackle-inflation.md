THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  Sorry I’m a little late.  And I’m due at
the — please, have a seat — the National Cathedral at a little after
11:00.  
   
But good morning.  Today, we’ve got some good news — good news about the
economy.  For the sixth month in a row, inflation has come down. 
Measured over the last 12 months, it has fallen 6.5 — to 6.5 percent. 
That’s down from 7.1 percent the month before.  It’s down from 9.1
percent this summer.  Inflation is now at its lowest level since October
of 2021.  
   
When we look at the — at the — just the last three months, we see that
inflation fell to 1.8 percent on an annualized basis.  It’s down from
more than 11 percent in the first three months of last year.   
   
So, the data is clear: Even though inflation is high in major economies
around the world, it is coming down in America month after month, giving
families some real breathing room.  And the big reason is falling gas
prices.  
   
My administration took action to get more oil onto the market and bring
down prices.  Now, gas is down more than $1.70 from its peak.  And that
adds up to a family with — a typical family with two vehicles to a
savings of $180 a month, every single month, that stays in their pockets
instead of being spent at the pump.  
   
Food inflation is slowing as well.  Last month, we saw the smallest
increase in food prices in almost two years.  And much of that increase
was due to the avian flu outbreak, which has driven up the egg prices
around — in the United States.   
   
It’s not just gas and food prices though.  When we look at what
economists call “core inflation,” which takes out energy and food, we
see welcome news as well.  
   
Core inflation is down to the lowest level in a year.  Over the past
three months, core inflation has come down to 3 percent on an annualized
basis.  That’s down from more than 6 percent at the beginning of 2022. 
The cost of goods is actually falling as prices for everything from
computers to used cars are coming down as well.  And inflation in the
core services is moderating as well.  
   
You know, and as inflation is coming down, take-home pay for workers is
going up.  Workers’ wages are higher now than they were seven months
ago, adjusted for inflation.  Wages for lower-income and middle-income
workers have gone up even more.  
   
It all adds up to a real break for consumers, real breathing room for
families, and more proof that my economic plan is working.  
   
When I came into office almost two years ago, the economy was flat on
its back, as you all remember.  Millions of people had lost their jobs
through no fault of their own.  Millions — millions who kept their jobs
saw the hours and paychecks cut.  Hundreds of thousands of small
businesses permanently closed their doors.  
   
People were hurting badly.  That’s what we inherited.  The pandemic was
raging and the economy was reeling.  
   
We acted decisively to put in place a new strategy that would build a
rescue — would rescue the economy from the pandemic downturn.  At the
same time, we laid the foundation for a stronger, more resilient economy
for decades to come — an economy that grows from the bottom up and the
middle out.  
   
Now, two years in, it’s clear — clearer than ever that my economic plan
is actually working.  Here’s what we’ve learned just last week:  
   
Unemployment is the lowest it’s been in 50 years.  I’ll say that again:
the lowest unemployment rate in a half a century.  
   
My first two years in office were the two strongest years for job growth
on record.  We created nearly 11 million jobs, including 750,000
manufacturing jobs.  And they were the two of the strongest years ever
for small-business creation as well.  
   
And today, the unemployment rate is near record lows for  
Blacks and Hispanic — Black and Hispanic workers, near record lows.  And
it’s the lowest ever on record for people with disabilities.  
   
We’re seeing American families breathing a little easier.  
   
More Americans have health insurance than they did ever in our history. 
Fewer families are facing foreclosures today than before the pandemic.  
   
And we still have more work to do though, but we’re clearly moving in
the right direction.  And there are more — there’s more breathing room
in store for American workers and families.   
   
Starting last week, as of January 1st, a month’s supply of insulin is
now capped at $35 for seniors on Medicare.  Some were paying hundreds of
dollars every month for their insulin, but not anymore.  
   
Starting last week, if Big Pharma raises prices faster than inflation,
they’re going to face big penalties.  
   
Starting last week, Americans can get tax credits when they install
energy-efficient appliances in their homes, like heat pumps or solar
panels, or when they buy electric vehicles.  
   
These were all pieces of what — that big law that we passed last year. 
Now, they’re kicking in and Americans are starting to feel the benefits
in their everyday lives.  
   
But that’s not all.  
   
We’re seeing historic investments in American manufacturing turn into
new factories and new jobs from Arizona, Ohio, Georgia, New York.  
   
Companies have announced nearly $300 billion in manufacturing
investments here in the United States since I became President.  Instead
of exporting jobs, like we did for decades, we’re now creating jobs and
exporting product.  Creating jobs and exporting product, that’s the
idea.  
   
Now, the House has elected a new Speaker.  I can- — called to
congratulate him, and I’m ready to work with him or any Republican in
Congress to make progress on the Amer- — on the — for the American
people.  
   
But like many Americans, I was disappointed that the very first bill the
Republicans in the House of Representatives passed would help wealthy
people and big corporations cheat on their taxes at the expense of
ordinary, middle-class taxpayers.  And it would add $114 billion to the
deficit.  Their very first bill.  
   
House Republicans campaigned on inflation.  They didn’t say, if elected,
their plan was to make inflation worse.  
   
Plus, House Republicans introduced another bill: blocking action that
would help lower gas prices and help consumers.  
   
And on top of that, House Republicans are preparing to vote on a
national sales tax bill.  National sales tax, that’s a great idea.  It
would raise taxes on the middle class by taxing thousands of everyday
items from groceries to gas, while cutting taxes for the wealthiest
Americans.  
   
And if I’m not mistaken, what they’ve introduced — it also would totally
eliminate the IRS.  It feels good, except all going to be sales tax.  Go
home and tell your moms.  They’re going to be really excited about
that.   
   
Come on.  Is this how House Republicans are starting the new term:
cutting taxes for billionaires, raising taxes for working families, and
making inflation worse?  
   
Well, let me be clear: If any of those bills make it to my desk, I will
veto them.  I will flat veto them.  
   
I’m ready to work with Republicans, but not this kind of stuff.    
   
If they try to cut Social Security or Medicare, which Americans have
been paying into with every paycheck since they have ever have had — got
their first paycheck, I’ll use my veto pen to stop that as well.  
   
But if Republicans want to work together on real solutions to lower
inflation, create more jobs, build an economy that works for everyone,
I’m ready.  
   
Let me close with this.  Today’s inflation numbers are good news — good
news about our economy.  And we have more work to do, but we’re on the
right track.  
   
We’re seeing bright spots across the country where great things are
happening.  Roads and bridges are being built.  Factories are coming
online.  People back to work again.  Families breathing a little bit
easier.  
   
That’s why I can honestly say — and you’re heard me say this before and
I mean it from the bottom of my heart — I’ve never been more optimistic
about America’s future than I am today.   
   
We just have to remember who in God’s name we are.  You’ve heard me say
it many times: This is the United States of America.  There’s nothing —
nothing beyond our capacity if we work together.   
   
So God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops.  
   
(Cross-talk by reporters.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  O- — okay.  
   
Q    Mr. President, classified — classified material next to your
Corvette.  What were you thinking?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Let me — they’re — I’m going to get a chance to speak on
all this, God willing, soon, but as I said earlier this week, people —
and, by the way, my Corvette is in a locked garage.  Okay?  So, it’s not
like they’re sitting out in the street.  But at any rate —  
   
Q    So the material was in a locked garage?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, as well as my Corvette.  
   
But as I said earlier this week, people know I take classified documents
and classified material seriously.  I also said we’re cooperating fully
and completely with the Justice Department’s review.   
   
As part of that process, my lawyers reviewed other places where
documents might of — from my time as Vice President were stored.  And
they finished the review last night.  
   
They discovered a small number of documents with classified markings in
storage areas and in file cabinets in my home and my — and my — in my
personal library.  This was done in the case of the Biden Penn — this
was done in the case of the Biden Penn Center.   
   
The Department of Justice was immediately — as was done, the Department
of Justice was immediately cla- — notified, and the lawyers arranged for
the Department of Justice to take possession of the document.   
   
So you’re going to see — we’re going to see all this unfold.  I’m
confident —  
   
Q    When did you find there was a second batch of documents?  
   
(Cross-talk by reporters.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  
   
Hey, how you doing?  Good to see you!   
   
Q    How’s your wife?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  She’s good.   
   
Q    How is the First Lady, sir?  How is the First Lady?   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  She’s doing really well.  She — she was under a long
time — for five hours — because what they were doing is they take out —
they do the Mohs, meaning remove what they thought what might be
cancerous — and they have to then go back and test it and see what it
was.  But she’s doing really well.   
   
She’s up.  We had a — we had breakfast this morning.  She’s a — she’s
recovering.  And she’s going to be sore for a while because of the work
they did on her eyes.  And — but under — you know, that’s where one of
these — these were.  But she has a — a zero- — a 0 to 1 percent chance
of ever — the return of any cancer.   
   
And so, thank God, she’s doing really well.  Thank you for asking.
