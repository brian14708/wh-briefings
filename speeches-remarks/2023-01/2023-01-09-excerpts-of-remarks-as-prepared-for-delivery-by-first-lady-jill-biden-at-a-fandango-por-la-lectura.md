Mexico City, Mexico

\*\*\*  
I am truly honored to be with you all this afternoon. Thank you for this
very warm welcome. Dr. Gutiérrez Müller and I met last year when I had
the pleasure of hosting her, and her son Jesus, at the White House for
Cinco de Mayo. And a few months later, I was able to show her the
Library of Congress in Washington D.C. We had a wonderful time walking
the historic halls—filled with books that tell the stories of our
countries.   
  
I was struck then, by how much we have in common: our love of literature
and our passion for learning and for helping others learn. Our
friendship grew out of that shared love. So, yesterday when I saw
Beatriz, it was like reuniting with an old friend. Thank you for making
my visit to Mexico City so very special.  
  
\*\*\*  
Art is powerful.   
  
Poetry and prose, dance and music, they can unite us across time, and
languages, and borders. They show us that our differences are precious
and our similarities infinite.

We’ve just marked the 200<sup>th</sup> year of bilateral relations
between our two nations. Over the centuries of our partnership, many
things have changed, but the deepest ties that bind us remain the
same.  
  
We share an understanding that freedom—of faith, of speech, of press—is
the foundation of democracy—and that the voice of the people can never
truly be silenced.  
  
We believe that family makes us whole. That these bonds—forged or found,
created by choice or chance—give us refuge from the sorrows of life,
strength for the trials we face, and a home that can never be taken
away.  
  
We believe that love is the mortar that holds us together. Love for each
other—that inspires us to give our hearts, no matter the cost. Love for
our countries—that pushes us to fight for justice and opportunity. Love
for our world—that makes us bold and brave, so we can build the better
future that we know we need.  
  
And I see that future here today—in you and students like you around the
globe. The talent, and creativity, and new ideas inside of you will
touch lives far beyond your borders. You will help shape our world.  
  
\*\*\*  
That’s why Beatriz’ work and this event mean so much. And it’s why we’re
going to work together to make sure your future is bright.   
  
So, to the next generation of poets and singers, dancers and
dreamers—each of you have something special and unique to offer—I hope
you are inspired to keep reading and most of all, to tell your own
stories. Your voice is more powerful than you know.   
  
Thank you.
