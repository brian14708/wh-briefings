Private Residence  
New York, New York

2:31 P.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Stacey, thank you as well. 
Appreciate it.  And, particularly, thank your daughter for permission to
be here.  (Laughter.)

You know, this is what in our business we call a busman’s holiday.  The
Leader of the Senate has to listen to me again.  (Laughter.)

LEADER SCHUMER:  Always —

THE PRESIDENT:  Meaning the senator from Jersey has to be there in the
back corner.  If I were you, I’d check if that door opens so you could
sneak out.  (Laughter.)

And who else is here, the elected offi- —  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Kirsten.

THE PRESIDENT:  By the way, she is the best thing New Yo- — New York has
got going for it.  (Applause.)  And, by the way, she changed the law and
the military, in terms of how women are treated in the military.  It’s a
big deal.  (Applause.)

Look, let me say that one of the things that — when I — when I ran — and
a lot of you helped me when I announced back in 2020 — I said I was
running for three reasons.  One was to restore the soul of America.  And
the second one was to rebuild the country from the middle out and the
bottom down — the bottom up and the middle out, because that way, the
poor have a shot, the middle class do well, and the wealthy still do
very well.  And thirdly was to unite the country.   
   
The third is turning out to be the hardest thing to do.  But we’re
getting there.  We’re getting there.  And there’s an awful lot that
we’re collect- — and, by the way, I wouldn’t have been able to do any of
the things that were referenced a moment ago without the Democratic
representatives who are in here.  And I mean that sincerely. 

They not only helped; they went to war for me.  They went to war for the
positions we took.  And — and it’s paying off. 

I mean, you know, we’ve created, like you said, more jobs than any
administration has in two years.  We have 750,000 new manufacturing
jobs. 

Like I said earlier today, where is it written that we can’t be the
manufacturing capital of the world?  We are exporting product and
importing jobs, as opposed to exporting jobs and — and — and, you know,
the other way around.

So there’s a lot — but there’s a lot more to do, because there’s a lot
of people that are still being left behind in areas of the country that
are feeling alienated by — by where they are.  And a lot of it has to do
with sins of the past and — and hard feelings that exist, because for a
while — it reminds me a little bit of when I got elected when I was a
29-year-old kid in 1972.

I became a close friend with George McGovern.  But you remember, we were
— there was a — the liberals in those days were referred to as
“limousine liberals.”  We — we didn’t pay nearly as much attention to
working-class folks as we used to.  And — and the same thing is
happening today.

You look at — and we were just talking — I was just being instructed. 
But she did a polling — data that was done: “Why is the country so
divided?  Why do we remain divided?”  And look how divided we are based
on geography. 

You know, one of the reasons why, with your help, I won in 2020 was I
was able to bring back a signifi- — significant number of women who were
in suburbia.  They used to almost all work — or vote for us.  And not
enough, but a fair number of blue-collar workers.   But blue-collar
workers used to always be our folks.  They were with us from the
beginning.  They were the people who thought we cared most about them. 

Well, right now, you know, the favorability of most Democrats is in the
60s among college-educated people.  And people without a college
education, it’s closer down in the 40s and below, because a lot of
people think we left them behind.  And it has to do more with attitude
and — than it does with policy. 

And so, we’ve gone out of our way, with Chuck’s great help in the
Senate, to — to try to focus on these folks. 

For example, today we announced that, with the Recovery Act — excuse me,
with the — the infrastructure bill that we passed, we’re going to, over
time, spend $16 billion renovating the entire transportation system here
in New York City.  (Applause.)  But it’s going to have a profound impact
on everything that — from —

You know, look, this is not your father’s Republican Party. 

AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Laughs.)

THE PRESIDENT:  This is — no, I really mean it.  This is a different
breed of cat.  These guys — I mean, they have been straight out — I know
the press is here; they’ve heard me say this before — they say they want
to get rid of Social Security.  Now, there — now I’m told that the
Leader is saying, no, he didn’t — they don’t mean that.  (Laughter.) 

They want to get rid of Social Security and Medicare.  They — because
they want to cut the deficit.  They want to make sure we can mov- —
moving toward dealing with the national debt. 

Well, I’d just point out that the last guy who was President increased
the national debt that was over 225 years and increased the entirety of
that debt by 25 percent in four years.  In four years.

The two years since we’ve been in power, we’ve reduced the national
debt, so far, $1.7 trillion in two years.  The — the debt — $1.7
trillion.  
And we still grew the economy.  But we did it because we paid for
everything.  We paid for everything, and we grew the economy at the same
time.

We’re finding ourselves in a situation where you talk about this party
denying the existence of climate change.  That is not true.  Well, you
ought to have traveled with me on at least 16, 17 helicopter flights
around America where I’ve literally watched more timber burn to the
ground than the entire state of Missouri.  As you go through everywhere
from New Mexico all the way up to Idaho and all the West Coast.  And
it’s just incredible the damage being done.

And, you know, we have a — if we don’t stay under 1.5 degrees Celsius
incr- — we’re going to have a real problem.  It’s the single-most
existential threat to humanity we’ve ever faced, including nuclear
weapons. 

And so we have a real big problem.

We inherited a — a foreign policy that said that — “America First,”
which basically put America last.  We lost more of our friends and
allies than any time in modern American history.

We are at a point where, much to my — as — as I know Cory and others
know, much of my time has been spent just putting back together the NATO
Alliance, the European Union, our relationships with — with — with Japan
and South Korea, what’s going on in the South Pacific. 

I mean, I’ve spent literally hundreds of hours, either in person and/or
on Zoom, with these world leaders putting them back together.  And
they’re together, because they understand that America is back.  
   
I showed up at the first meeting of the G7, when I got elected
President, in England.  And I sat down and I said, “America is back.” 
And Macron looked at me said and he said, “For how long?”  (Laughter.) 
No, for real.  “For how long?”  
   
You know, we had significant divisions within Europe about what we’re
going to do not just about Ukraine, but about unity overall.  What was
the role of the — of the European Union?  It was — it turns out it’s a
great adjunct to everything we’re doing, if we do it correctly.  But, in
fact, the last guy said it was a problem; we — it shouldn’t exist, it
shouldn’t be around.  
   
So I guess what I’m saying is that it was a pretty low bar to climb
over, but there was an awful lot of — an awful lot of ground to be made
up.  
   
And you think that what would happen is that there would be a little bit
of, as we Catholics say, an epiphany in the Republican Party.  Well,
instead it’s been the exact opposite.  They’ve just doubled down.  
   
Look at what the present leader of the Republican Party — a decent man,
I think — McCarthy — look — look what he had to do.  He had to make
commitments that are just absolutely off the wall for a Speaker of the
House to make in terms of being able to become the Leader.  
   
I can’t imagine, Chuck, you making one of those commitments. 
(Laughter.)   
   
LEADER SCHUMER:  It took us one vote, and it was unanimous. 
(Laughter.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, beyond that, look —  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  I voted twice.  (Laughter.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Beyond that, look, you know, I — when I got elected —
and I’ll end this in a little bit.  But to your — when I got elected
when I was a kid, when I was — I wasn’t old enough, as Karen Adler’s
family remembers, because her dad helped me out early on — was I found
myself — I was only 29 years old; you had to be 30 to be sworn in.  But
I got elected before I was 30.  But at time to be sworn in — 17 days
later, I became eligible to serve.  
   
And because I won so young, and I won against a guy — he was a decent
man; he supported me the next time I ran.  His name was J. Caleb Boggs. 
He was a mainstream Republican.  He was one of the guys who was very
deeply engaged in setting up the situation in terms of the affordable —
excuse me, the environmental legislation.  He was a — he was a decent
guy.  
   
But I’d always get asked by every new person running for office — in
Delaware, particularly — if it was their first time.  They’d say,
“What’s the secret?”  There had to be a secret if I won and if I was
something special.  And I said, “There is a secret.  One, what do you —
what’s worth losing over to you?  Have you figured out what’s more
important than having the job?  What do you wor- — what’s worth risking
losing over?”  Because people can smell it.  People can tell when you
really mean it.  
   
And there are certain changes that under no circumstance would any of us
in this room make the kind of commitments that the Republicans are
making now.   
   
And the idea — for example, I don’t — I don’t think anybody should — I
think you should be will be a millionaire and a billionaire in America. 
Just pay a little bit of your fair share.  Just pay your fair share. 
Not an exorbitant amount.  Nothing over — you know, there’s no one — in
the proposals I’ve put forward, no one making less than $400,000 would
have a penny in their taxes raised.  And there’s — no one is going to be
paying, like in days past, 60 percent or anything like that in taxes. 
We’re talking in the 20s, in the 30s percentile, depending on income.  
   
But these guys literally are proposing, unless they changed their mind
again — proposing doing away with the IRS.  Now, that sounds good,
right?  (Laughter.)  Except one thing: They want — here’s — they want to
replace with a 30 percent sales tax.  A 30 percent sales tax, which —
meaning somebody who’s a schoolteacher, a firefighter, or a cop would be
paying more in taxes than you pay in this room, each one of you.  Not a
joke.  And 30 percent sales tax — everything from your house to your car
to your eggs that you purchase.  
   
So I don’t know what’s gone haywire here with this Republican Party. 
But there’s two things that I think we have to run on: what we stand
for, what we did, and what we need to do more of, and what we’re
unwilling to do under any circumstances.  
   
And part of that is to make clear to the Republican — to the country
that we are not going to tolerate or put up with these MAGA Republicans,
these Republicans in — you know, more than just — the Trump Republican
Party.  Thirty percent of that — 30, 35 percent of that party is Trump’s
party.  And he has a very different view.   
   
And, by the way, I can assure you windmills don’t cause cancer. 
(Laughter.)  And so on.  
   
I mean, but think of the bizarre things that are still being
proposed.   
   
So, there are enough Republicans, I believe, that — and Chuck has done
it — that we can get help from on important things.  
   
LEADER SCHUMER:  Yep.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  And there’s enough Republicans in the House of
Representatives now who, on very critical things, will vote with
Democrats when they start talking about the really crazy stuff.  But we
can’t take our eye off the ball.  We can’t take our eye off the ball.  
   
And I’ll conclude by saying — there are a couple things we have to do. 
We didn’t get enough done on education this time out.  The idea that all
—  
   
Is any — look, for example, when — when we — one of the reasons why we
became the most powerful nation in the world is we were the best
educated nation in the world, because at the turn of the 20th century,
we were the only nation in the world that had universal education. 
Other countries had better higher education than we did.  For example,
in England and other places, on balance, it was better, but never
overall, because we thought that 12 years of free education was
necessary.   
   
If we were doing it all over today, did anybody think we’d start and say
12 years is enough for 21st century — the second quarter of the 21st
century?  All the data shows, over the last 10 years, of great
universities — and I won’t go into the specific details, but — point out
that if you’re in a situation where you’re going to a school, no matter
what your background, no matter what home you came from, if you start
off in school at age three — reading, writing arithmetic — as opposed to
daycare — daycare is better than not; I’m not being critical of daycare
— you increase by 56 percent the chance you’ll get through 12 years of
school and go on to either an apprenticeship or two years in college.   
   
Now, what are we doing?  Our Republican friends voted against that idea
— the idea that we shouldn’t have access to two years of post-high
school, either as apprenticeships and/or for community college.  We can
not only afford to do that, we can’t afford not to do that.  It’s
critical that we, in fact, improve our education system.   
   
And, by the way, that includes, believe it or not, paying teachers
more.  (Laughter.)  You know?  (Applause.)  No, I — no, I mean it.   
   
You take a look prescription drug costs.  Now, you know, I mean, even
people who have means find themselves in real difficulty in terms of
prescription drugs, in terms of the cost.   
   
I remember when my son Beau, before he died — he had — he has ankylosing
spondylitis, and he had a particular drug at the time they were taking. 
And it was — he took a shot; it was twice a month.  And it cost $3,000 a
shot.   
   
Now, he had a larger family.  We could all help out.  But the idea of
someone paying $3,000.  Now, it’s now — we’ve gotten that under control,
that piece.   
   
But the idea we pay — for example, what we’re going — what’s going to
happen in — in 2025, just like — for example, the prescription drug
costs for seniors — it should be for everyone — who are on — in fact,
need insulin for Type 2 diabetes, it’s gone from an average of $400, as
high as $800 a month, depending on the insurance you have, to $35 a
month.  And guess what?  They’re still making 350 (inaudible) percent
profit.  It costs 10 bucks to make it and another 2 bucks to package
it.   
   
And there was a patent that — the guy who decided, when he invented the
drug — the insulin — he didn’t even patient it because he wanted it
available.  Well, guess what?  It makes no sense — drug companies
charging multiple multiples of that.   
   
And so, we have to be in a situation where we have — and, by the way,
the beginning — we got passed — with the help of the men and women in
this room, we got passed a limita- — a drug — you cannot raise your
price of a drug beyond the cost inflation now, or else what’s going to
be — because what’s going to happen is the federal government coming to
take a — charge you the difference — the drug company.   
   
And in addition to that, anybody who is in a position where they have
drug costs, beginning in 2025, no senior will have to pay more than
$2,000 a year.  Some of the cancer drugs, as you all know, are $14-,
$15,000 a year.  They’ll not have to pay more than $2,000 a year.  
   
Concluding point — and I realize I’m rambling a bit here.  The
concluding point I want to make to you is: It’s really important we let
people know what we’ve done.  Let people know.  Because we haven’t — we
haven’t — it’s only just kicking into place.  We pro- — essentially
promised people that insulin would be 35 bucks.   
   
Well, we passed it six, eight months ago.  It only kicked in in
January.  I’m finding people calling and saying, “My God, my insulin was
only $35.  It’s a gigantic difference.”  
   
And, by the way, there are 200,000 young kids who have Type 2 diabetes. 
And a lot of parents have no ability to pay for the (inaudible).   
   
So I was in this town meeting not long ago, and I think it was in rural
Virginia, and a woman stands up and says, “I have two daughters.  They
both have it.  I can’t afford the drug, so we — we cut it in half.  We
cut it in…”  
   
I mean, there’s just — there’s so many things, but we can now go out and
make our case.  And what I’ve done: I’ve set up an inter-Cabinet now
that is called the “Implementation Cabinet.”  The existing Cabinet
members whose job is to just do nothing but let people know what we have
already done — what we’ve already done.  (Applause.)   
   
I’m sorry, I’m going to stop because I’m making you all cough. 
(Laughter.)  
   
But at any rate, so there’s — there is a lot more to be done.  And if we
do just a little bit more in education and a little bit more in terms of
healthcare, a little bit more in terms of what we’re doing in terms of
the environment, and a whole hell of a lot more on what we’re going to
spend — spending at one point $2 trillion for infrastructure for the
next 10 years.  And we’re creating thousands and thousands of
good-paying jobs.   
   
And, by the way — by the way, I don’t know where it’s written that says
we can’t be the manufacturing capital of the world again.  We used to
spend 2 percent of our entire GDP on research and development investing
in America.  It’s now 0.7 percent.   
   
One of the reasons why I was able to attract $300 billion in investment
for semiconductor factories and construction is because we have the best
workers in the world.   
   
The Japa- — the — a Korean company is investing over $100 billion.  I
asked “why” when I met with the CEO from South Ca- — South Korea.  He
said, “Because you have the best workers and the safest environment in
which to do what you have to do.”  
   
So there’s a lot — we underestimate what we have.  And I’m going to —
I’m determined — determined to make it better.   
   
I have been doing this a long time, but I’ve never, never never — my
word as a Biden — been more optimistic about the prospects for America
not only leading the world, but increas- — being the most economically
viable nation in the world again.  
   
That’s what we can do.  I’m going to, as my mother would say, “hush up,
Joe.”  I’m talking too much.  (Laughter.)  Thank you.  (Applause.)
