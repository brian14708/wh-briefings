  Bilateral Meeting
---
 
*Vice President’s Residence  
*Washington, D.C.**

9:59 A.M. EST  
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Well, I’m very happy to welcome you to my home,
Prime Minister.  You and I have spent a good deal of time together in
Tokyo, in Bangkok, and — and now here.  And as we have discussed many
times, the relationship between the United States and Japan is
ironclad.  
  
You and I have talked about, certainly, the priority that we both have —
and I will speak for the United States — in terms of ensuring security
and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific — and we’ve discussed that before —
and also our shared priority in space exploration.  We have talked about
that before.  We will discuss that again today.  And, in fact, our two
countries today will sign an agreement —  
  
PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:  Yes.  
  
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  — that furthers our cooperation in terms of our
space activity.  
  
So, welcome to my home.  It is good to see you again.  
  
PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:  (As interpreted.)  Well, thank you.  This is my
first visit to Washington, D.C., as a prime minister.  I think the last
time I met with the Vice President was back in November of last year. 
But I’m happy to meet with you again here.  And thank you for graciously
inviting me to a breakfast meeting.  
  
And as Madam Vice President pointed out, I look forward to exchanging
views today on various topics, including the Japan-U.S. alliance, as
well as establishing a free and open Indo-Pacific, and, of course, on
space cooperation, that I know you are very eager about.  
  
So, I look forward to our very frank and candid discussions today.  
  
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Thank you.  Welcome.  Welcome.  Welcome.
