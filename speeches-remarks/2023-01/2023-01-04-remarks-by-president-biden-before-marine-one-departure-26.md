Q    Mr. President, what do you make of the fight for Speaker right now?

THE PRESIDENT:  With regards to the fight over Speaker, I — that’s not
my problem.  I just think it’s a little embarrassing it’s taken so long
in the way they’re dealing with one another.  And the rest of the world
is looking.  They’re looking at, you know, can we get our act together. 

And — but I — what I’m focused on is getting things done.  And one of
the things I’m going down to Kentucky and Ohio today is to demonstrate
we can get things done.  We passed an enormous bill bipartisanly, and it
works.  And we’re starting off — the first major initiative we’re
announcing today is a billion dollars.

Listen, we can’t be the number-one economy in the world unless you have
the number-one infrastructure in the world.  
Q    When should we anticipate an announcement on your reelection?

THE PRESIDENT:  In time.

Q    In time?

And why is it so important to go to Kentucky today?

THE PRESIDENT:  Why is it so important?

Q    Yeah.

THE PRESIDENT:  We worked like hell to get the most significant
infrastructure bill in our history of the United States, other than the
Eisenhower Interstate Highway System. 

And we’re about to cha- — look, I think our administration has begun to
move the economy in the direction where we’re investing in America
again.  We’re the leading economy in the world.  How can you remain the
leading economy in the world absent having the greatest infrastructure
in the world?  And it’s just the beginning.

Q    And how worried would you be if the stalemate in the House goes on
after today about the ability of Congress and you to govern?

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, not me.  Congress to govern.  Congress.

Q    On Pope Benedict.  Pope Benedict.  What did he mean — what did Pope
Benedict mean to you as a Catholic?

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I — I had an opportunity to spend some time with
Pope Benedict, a couple hours.  And — and he was a great — and it
reminded me of going back to theology class.  We spoke about Aquinas and
about “Summa Theologica” and the whole litany.  I found him to be
relaxing and very rational.   
   
And he was a more conservative view within the Catholic realm than I
have and (inaudible) Pope — the present Pope, in terms of his
philosophy, his view.  But I — I admired him.  I thought he was a fine
man.   
   
Q    You’re not attending his funeral tomorrow though.  Why?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No.  Well, why do you think?  
   
Q    Well, you tell me.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  You know why.  I can’t —  
   
Q    You can tell me, sir.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, the reason I’m not attending the funeral tomorrow is
because it takes an entourage of a thousand people to show up — not
literally.  But we would — we would move everything in the wrong
direction.   
   
I inquired about that.  And they’re — people are sending mostly their
apostolic delegates, their — the folks in Rome.  That’s what we’re going
to do.  We would just get in the way.   
   
But I — I’ve made my views known.  I’m — at any rate, I think he was a
fine man.  
   
Q    Thank you, sir.  
   
Q    Does any part of you — well, first of all, who do you think the
Speaker is going to be?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I have no idea.   
   
Q    Okay.  Is any part of you enjoying seeing the other party having
such a hard time right now?   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No.  And I really mean this.  Look, how do you think it
looks to the rest of the world?  We’re finally coming out of — you know,
the first time we’re really getting through the whole issue relating to
January 6th.  Things are settling out.  And now, for the first time in
100 years, we can’t move?   
   
I mean — I really mean it.  I know you know international relations. 
It’s not a good look.  It’s not a good thing.  It’s the United States of
America.  And I hope they get their act together.
