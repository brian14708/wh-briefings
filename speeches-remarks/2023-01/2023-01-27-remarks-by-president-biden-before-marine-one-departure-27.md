Q    Talk to us about Tyre Nichols, Mr. President.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I spoke with Tyre’s mother and expressed my
condolences, and told her that I was going to be making the case to the
Congress to pass the George Floyd Act.  We should get this under
control.  I can only do so much in an executive order at a federal
level.   
   
And — and the prayers — I was really pleased that she called for no —
peaceful protests, no — no violence, no movement at all.  And so, I —
you know, I spoke with her about, I don’t know, 10, 15 minutes.  And —  
   
Q    How concerned are you, sir, about the violence and the potential
for that?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well — well, I am.  I’m — I’m obviously very concerned
about it.  But I think she has made a very strong plea.  She’s obviously
in enormous pain.   
   
She talked about, as you heard her when she spoke publicly — but she
also talked about how — how she didn’t know what she was going to do. 
And I told her that — that it — that — I told her I had some idea of
what that loss was like and that although it’s impossible to believe
now, the time will come when his memory brings a smile before a tear. 
And she said she already is thinking about what — what he would want her
to do, which is — which is very positive.  So —  
   
Q    What is at stake tonight, sir, with the nation watching this video
tape and what could happen?  What is at stake?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  What’s at stake is, first of all, innocent people’s
lives, number one.   
   
Number two, it has a lot to say and do with the image of America.  It
has a lot to do with whether or not we are the country we say we are —
that we’re a country of law and order and means by which we can
peacefully protest and let the courts make their judgments.  
   
Thank you very much.
