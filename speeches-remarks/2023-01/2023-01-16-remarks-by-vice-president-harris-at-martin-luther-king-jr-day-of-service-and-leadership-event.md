*Washington, D.C.**

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Happy King Day, everybody.  (Applause.)   
    
So, I’m here with Secretary Cardona, our Secretary of Education, and we
wanted to come here to thank you all and to highlight the work that you
all have been doing.  
   
And our table here, I think it’s table number one, we’ve been having a
very extensive conversation about why each of you has decided to use
your role as leaders to invest in the future of our country through our
children.  
   
You know, I have always, in the many offices I’ve held — and I have held
a few — when I do policy work, I will almost always challenge my team
when we’re talking about any issue.  And it varies from — you can
imagine — technology, to what are we doing about climate, to what are we
doing about — you name the subject.  
   
And I will challenge them by asking to test the relevancy of our work. 
Tell me — and think first, and then tell me, “How will this affect a
child?”  
   
Ask that question always, when anyone is presenting what they believe to
be the greatest idea or plan for the moment or the future for our
country: “How will it affect a child?”  
   
And because of the work that you each have been doing and are doing
today, you will be able to help answer that question with honesty and
accuracy in a way that will challenge us to think about the direction we
are headed as a country, consistent with Dr. King’s dream about who we
are and who we should be.  
   
Because Dr. King, of course, the day we celebrate — and the day we
celebrate, capturing the spirit of who he was and what he wanted, which
is we celebrate it then as a day of service — is to understand the
possibilities that have been yet unachieved which we must work toward,
the ideals upon which our nation was founded that we still have yet to
achieve but we get closer each day when we believe in what is
possible.  
   
And you all, as students, here have dedicated yourselves to that
approach, to your leadership in our world, in our country. And it is a
noble pursuit.  
   
I believe that we measure strength not based on, you know, if you flex,
what does that look like — (laughs) — but I think the greatest measure
of the strength of any individual will be revealed based not on who you
beat down, but based on who you lift up.   
   
If you ever question your reason for being, what is your purpose,
whether it matters — and I know I’m preaching to the choir right now —
the answer will come when you realize the impact you can have on another
human being, by everything from a kind word to doing what you all have
been doing.  It’s extraordinary.  And it’s an extraordinary sign of the
strength that we each possess and, when we do it as a community, the
impact that we can have on our world.  
   
So, in the spirit of Dr. King Day, I say thank you to all of you.  I
know when I look at the students here, our future is bright.  So keep
doing what you are doing.  Our nation and our world are counting on your
leadership.  So, thank you all.  Thank you.  (Applause.)
