  \ Park\_Shooting"

Monterey Park, California *

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  So, I am here and have arrived in Monterey Park
today to express our deepest condolences and sorrow for the violent and
tragic and useless thing that happened here.   
   
On behalf of the President and Dr. Biden, Doug and myself, we express
what I know our nation feels in terms of mourning the loss of those who
have died and were killed here.  And, of course, we pray for the
recovery of those that were injured.  
   
You know, we’ve already had, in our country, this year already — we’re
in January — it’s estimated over 40 mass killings already.   
   
And, tragically, we keep saying the same thing.  I have had the
unfortunate experience of visiting many of these sites, and sometimes
within days of a massacre like this.  
   
We will always, as a compassionate nation, mourn for the loss and pray
for those who survive and are recovering.  But we must also require that
leaders in our nation, who have the ability and the power and the
responsibility to do something, that they act.   
   
California has been courageous as a leader on the issue of smart gun
safety laws.  But we also need Congress to act, because, truly, if we
are to have a uniform approach that is a statement of where we, as a
nation, I think — where we are on these issues, then Congress must act
so that we can get at least one step closer to what is right and what is
reasonable, understanding that to do so is to fully support the Second
Amendment, but to understand we need reasonable gun safety laws in our
country.  
   
So I am here, again, to express the sentiments of the President, the
First Lady, and the Second Gentleman, and our country.  
   
I will be meeting with some of the families.  I’ve met with the sheriff
and the county supervisor and the mayor, and I will meet with some of
the first responders.   
   
But, again, to all of those who are here covering this tragedy, continue
to also cover the importance of requiring elected officials and leaders
to have the courage to do the right thing when it comes to just what is
reasonable and right.   
   
Thank you.   
   
Q    Can this Congress do anything?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  They absolutely can.   
   
Q    You think they can accomplish?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  They have the power to do something.  Can they do
something?  Yes.  Should they do something?  Yes.    
   
Q    Will they?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Will they do something?  That is where we all must
speak up and speak to our elected representatives about what we have a
right to expect that they will do for the — in the interest of the
safety and security and the wellbeing of people like those whose lives
were ended (inaudible), people around our country.  They can, yes.  
   
                                    END
