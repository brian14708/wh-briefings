THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Hi, everybody.  (Applause.)  Can we hear it for
Michelle Obama?  (Applause.)  
  
     Oh, good —  
  
AUDIENCE:  We’re not going back!  We’re not going back!  We’re not going
back!  
  
     AUDIENCE:  Kamala!  Kamala!  Kamala!  
  
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you all.   
  
     Michigan!  Michigan!  (Laughs.)  (Applause.)  
  
All right, gu- — we’ve got 10 days to go.  (Applause.)  And the thing
that I love about everybody here is we love hard work.  Hard work is
good work.  And we are going to win.  We are going to win.  (Applause.) 

And it’s going to be close, and we know that, and we know the stakes. 
And we also are here together because we love our country and we are
prepared to fight for the best of who we are.   
  
Many of you’ve heard me talk about this: We’re not fighting against
something; we’re fighting for something.  (Applause.) 

And through our campaign — our campaign — yes, we will win.  That is our
highest and that is our achievable goal.  We will win.  And in the
process, over these next 10 days, we are also doing the work of building
community, building coalitions, reminding folks that we are all in this
together, lifting each other up, reminding ourselves and each other that
we have so much more in common than what separates us.   
  
That’s what our campaign is about.  It is a people-powered campaign. 
(Applause.)  And because it is a people-powered campaign, we will win,
because we know what we stand for, so we know what to fight for. 
(Applause.)  
  
     And when we fight —  
  
     AUDIENCE:  We win!  
  
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — we win.   
  
     God bless you.  I’ll see you soon.  (Applause.)
