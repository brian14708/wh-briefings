PRESIDENT BIDEN: Got everybody?

Well, Mr. Prime Minister, welcome to the White House. We were just
talking very briefly that I spent a little time in Slovenia early on,
and it’s a beautiful, beautiful country.

Twenty years ago, when I was a United States senator, I pushed very hard
for your country’s admission to NATO, as you know, because I knew then
what I know now: We’re stronger and a safer world when we stand together
with good partners like you.

We’ve seen it in support for the brave people of Ukraine as they defend
themselves against Russia’s brutal aggression. And we see it in — in our
work to support democracy and prosperity across the W- — the Western
Balkans. And we see it — and we saw it earlier this past summer when we
secured the release of 16 people, including four Americans, unjustly
held in Russia. And I want to thank you. It was a feat of diplomacy. I
want to thank your country for your support and your leadership and
partnership that made it possible. And that’s not hyperbole. You made it
possible. Thank you.

We made it clear to anyone who questions whether our allies matter —
well, they just look at what you did. And they — you matter a great
deal.

And so, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
And we look forward to our discussion today.

The floor is yours.  
  
PRIME MINISTER GOLOB: Mr. President, dear Joe, just couple of words, and
that is that, with a little help of true friends, nothing is impossible.
And I think that’s really what our joint effort with the prisoner swap
demonstrated to all of the world. And let’s continue to work in a true
fr- — friendship and with a lot of trust.

PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, there’s a lot we agree on. So, welcome. Good to
have you here.

PRIME MINISTER GOLOB: Glad to be here.

PRESIDENT BIDEN: And we got to get our — get moving.

Thank you all.
