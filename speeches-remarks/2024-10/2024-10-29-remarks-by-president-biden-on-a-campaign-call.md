6:53 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  (In progress) — and your friendship.  And thanks to
everyone —  
   
MS. TERESA:  So, President —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  — at Voto Latino.  (Inaudible.)  
   
MS. TERESA:  So, President Biden, before we get started — before we get
started, I just want to say, literally, three and a half years ago, we —
when we were hunkered down, we were doing Zoom calls very similar to
this, you came in and you talked to our community, and you said, “Maria
Teresa, we are going to have the largest climate change legislation, the
biggest infrastructure,” and you listed 20 things, and he’s like, “Will
you be there with me?”  And I said, “Absolutely.”  And I said, “Do you
think we’re going to get it done?”  You’re like, “Absolutely.”  And you
know what?  You have.   
   
So, I’m incredibly grateful for all the work that you’ve done, and I
would love for you to say a few words to — to the community based on
your ability to deliver every single time.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  We got it done.  I didn’t get it done.  Every major
thing we tried to do, from over a trillion dollars in infrastructure to
work on communities that need help to health care to — I mean, a whole
range of things, and we got it done.  
   
As I said earlier, your partnership, your friendship, and your
leadership has really made a big difference.  And thank everyone at
Latino — you know — excuse me, thank everyone at your organization, Voto
Latino, for all you do.  You know, you’ve always had my back, and I
think it’s fair to say I’ve always had yours.  
   
This is it.  This is it.  Seven days to Election Day, and the stakes
couldn’t be higher.  And that’s not a — that’s not an exaggeration.  The
choice couldn’t be clearer.  
   
Presidential historians tell us the most important thing about a
president is character — does he or she have character.  Kamala has
character.  She’ll always stand up for Latinos, but not just Lati- —
she’ll stand up for everyone who deserves to be stood up for, and that’s
all Americans.  
   
Donald Trump has no character.  He doesn’t give a damn about the Latino
community.  He’s failed businessman.  He’s — he only cares about the
billionaire friends he has and accumulating wealth for those at the top.

You know, he says immigrants are “poisoning the blood” of our country. 
Give me a break.  He wants to do away with the birthright citizenship. 
Who the hell else said that in the last 100 years? 

And just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a
“floating island of garbage.”  Well, let me tell you something.  I don’t
— I — I don’t know the Puerto Rican that — that I know — or a Puerto
Rico, where I’m fr- — in my home state of Delaware, they’re good,
decent, honorable people.  The only garbage I see floating out there is
his supporter’s — his — his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable,
and it’s un-American.  It’s totally contrary to everything we’ve done,
everything we’ve been.    
   
Now, Trump has di- — tried to divide the country based on race,
ethnicity, anything that does harm, to take their eye off the ball about
what the terrible things he’s done and will do.  But Kamala Harris has
fought for all Americans and will be a president for all of America.  
   
Look, folks, we’ve gotten a lot done together, as you pointed out. 
Look, Maria Teresa, we did everything from the infrastructure bill to
health care to making sure that veterans are taken care of.  I mean,
across the board, we’ve done so much.  We’ve created over 16 million
jobs.  More Latinos have jobs than ever before.  
   
Look, a quarter of all — here’s the way I look at it.  A quarter of all
the children in our schools today are Latino — are Latino, a quarter of
them.  How could we possibly not invest everything we have in a quarter
of our population that’s going to be our future?  It’s going to make a
major, major, major, major piece of what this country looks like and
what we think and what we believe.  So, these are going to have to be
the doctors, the teachers, the scientists, and, yes, presidents.  
   
You know, I know we’ve asked a lot of each other, but I’m talking to you
about one more thing and asking you, as a favor, all of you listening,
to vote.  Get out early and vote.  Do it early.  
   
You know, I — I know the long waits on Election Day are all too common,
especially in Latino communities.  You know, I cast my ballot
yesterday.  I stood in line for 40, 45 minutes with all the people in
Delaware, and I cast my vote yesterday in my home state.  I waited in
line with a lot of other people.   
   
There was a woman ahead of me, an elderly woman, who was in her 90s in a
wheelchair, and it was a heavy wheelchair and the person pushing it was
having trouble, so I spent time with her.  She — she’s — she’s over 90
years old, and she’s breaking her neck to vote because she knows how
important it is.  
   
Today is National Vote Early Day.  Let me say it again.  Today is
National Vote Early Day.  Remind folks to vote early, to return mail-in
ballots.   
   
Vote for access to a good education so everyone has an opportunity. 
Vote to eliminate not — what Trump wants — he wants to eliminate the
Department of Education and no early education.  We’re fighting like
hell, and we’re fighting like hell for early education because, you
know, it increases exponentially the prospect of success for our sons
and our daughters.   
   
Vote to give our daughters the same opportunities we give our sons,
instead of taking away their rights.   
   
Vote to make sure we maintain a significant health care that would
provide for our parents and our families and basic health care for all
Americans.  Trump is trying like hell to get rid of it.  More people
have health care now than ever before.  He says he’s going to — wants to
get rid of it.  
   
Vote to continue the progress we made on job growth — the growth in jobs
for everyone, including Latinos — a significant job growth.  
   
Vote for comprehensive imm- — immigration reform instead of mass
deportation.  What’s he talkin- — think about it.   
   
You know, I travel the world because of my role as president and my
knowledge of foreign policy.  I get inquiries from other heads of state,
“Does Trump really mean it?  Are you really going to send out the police
to gather up thousands and millions of people and deport them?”  What
the hell is going on here?  Vote for comprehensive immigration reform
instead of mass deportation.   
   
In short, vote to keep Donald Trump out of the White House.  He’s a true
danger to not just Latinos but to all people, particularly those who are
in a minority in this country.   
   
You know, we have to vote to elect Kamala as president, Tim Walz as vice
president.  It’s (inaudible) — it’s never been more important.  
   
We’ve known each other a long time, Maria Teresa — a long time.  And I
want to tell you something I can say without equivocation.  Our
democracy is at stake.  And to translate that into pure English — and
that’s wh- — I should be able to speak Spanish, but I can’t.  We should
be able to talk about what this means.  
   
He wants to fundamentally change the way our Constitution works.  He
wants to take away people’s rights.  He wants to concentrate power in
the hands of a very few — people like him.  
   
So, go to IWillVote.com and make your plan to vote early.  Make it
today, because voting early (inaudible) now basically through election. 
Make a plan to vote, please, please, please.  Your vote is critical.  A
Latino vote is critical.  Let’s make it heard.  
   
I want them to remember who you are and who we are.  We’re the United
States of America.  And there’s nothing, nothing at all beyond our
capacity when we do it together.  
   
So, God bless you all.  And God bless you, Maria Teresa, for all you’ve
been doing.  We have more to do, but we got to get it done.   
   
This el- — this election is the most consequential election we’ve ever
voted in, no matter how old or how young you are — this election.  
   
God bless you all.  And God protect our troops.  
   
MS. TERESA:  Thank you so much, President Biden.  And I have to tell
you, what you really — what you are saying is a clarion call.  It’s a
multicultural democracy, and it’s us, as Americans first, that will save
this country and our democracy.  And I’m so grateful for the time —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  The reason why we’re strong.  
   
MS. TERESA:  — you’ve spent with us.  (Inaudible.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  We’re the most diverse country, and that’s why we’re
strong.  That is our strength.  
   
MS. TERESA:  Right.  (Laughs.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible) our weakness.  It’s our strength.  
   
MS. TERESA:  No, I call it our superpower — our superpower.  And I
always say, like, you don’t have to take my word for it.  The reason
that you have disinformation around race is because the Russians and the
Chinese recognize that racism is our Achilles heel, but it — they also
recognize that it’s our multiculturalism that is our superpower and our
strength.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  We bring all the best of every culture together.  We
really do.  It’s not hyperbole.  That’s a fact.  
   
MS. TERESA:  It’s true.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Sometimes I think our folks (inaudible) don’t realize
it, but it’s truly a fact.  Anyway.  
   
God love you for what you’re doing.  Keep it going, kid.  
   
MS. TERESA:  I’m super grateful.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Keep it going.  
   
MS. TERESA:  Yeah, we’re not done yet.  We’re just getting started.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  We’re not even close to done.  
   
MS. TERESA:  (Inaudible.)  (Laughs.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  And I may be — I may be leaving office on January 20th,
but I’m not leaving.   
   
MS. TERESA:  I — I —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m not leaving.  
   
MS. TERESA:  You promise?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m leaving office, but I’m not leaving this fight.   
   
MS. TERESA:  (Laughs.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  God love you.  Thank you so much.  
   
MS. TERESA:  I’m going to remind you of that.  Much love.  Say hello to
Jill.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you don’t (inaudible) — I’m going to ask for your
help and let me join you.  
   
MS. TERESA:  I will always be there, President.
