Vice President’s Residence  
U.S. Naval Observatory  
Washington, D.C.

SECOND GENTLEMAN DOUGLAS EMHOFF: Thank you.  
  
As we gather here on what was the deadliest day for Jewish people since
the Holocaust, I am filled with pain and despair.  
  
This is an incredibly challenging day for Jews around the world – myself
included.  
  
October 7 hit us hard as a community.  
  
We are still hurting. And today feels just as raw as it did one year
ago.  
  
What happened on October 7 is seared into our souls.      
  
I can’t stop thinking about the hostages and their families, and all of
those we’ve lost over the past year.  
  
Earlier today, I attended AJC’s National October 7 Memorial
Commemoration at Sixth & I and recited a prayer for peace – that we all
see the day soon when this war and bloodshed come to an end.  
  
As the first Jewish spouse of an American President or Vice President, I
take this role incredibly seriously.  
  
Kamala is the one who encouraged me to use the platform I have to fight
antisemitism and hate. She’s also the person who encouraged me to lean
into my faith.  
  
When we first moved into the Residence, we affixed a mezuzah on the
doorpost, alongside our family.  
  
Now, as we prepare to leave a legacy of our time here, we plant this
pomegranate tree to honor this solemn day and for the families who will
come after us to enjoy.  
  
This is the first tree we planted since moving in, and it will be the
first fruit tree ever planted by a Second Family at the Residence.   
  
Kamala and I are proud to continue a tradition with symbolic meaning for
every family that’s lived here.  
  
And it is especially meaningful to me that this property will now always
commemorate the pain of the Jewish people, as well as the resilience and
hope of the Jewish people.    
  
May the memories of those we’ve lost be a blessing.  
  
Thank you.
