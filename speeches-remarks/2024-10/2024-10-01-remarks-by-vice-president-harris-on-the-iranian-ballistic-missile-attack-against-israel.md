title: "Remarks by Vice President Harris on the Iranian Ballistic Missile Attack Against\_\
  Israel"

Josephine Butler Parks Center  
Washington, D.C.

4:42 P.M. EDT

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  So, today, Iran launched approximately 200
ballistic missiles at Israel in a reckless and brazen attack.  I condemn
this attack unequivocally. 

I am clear-eyed: Iran is a destabilizing, dangerous force in the Middle
East, and today’s attack on Israel only further demonstrates that fact.

Earlier today, I was in the Situation Room with President Biden and our
national security team as we monitored the attack in real time and
ensured that the protection of U.S. personnel in the region is
paramount.  I fully support President Biden’s order for the U.S.
military to shoot down Iranian missiles targeting Israel, just as we did
in April.

We are still assessing the impact, but initial indications are that
Israel, with our assistance, was able to defeat this attack.  Our joint
defenses have been effective, and this operation and successful
cooperation saved many ic- — innocent lives.

As I have said, I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend
itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist militias.  My commitment
to the security of Israel is unwavering. 

And let us be clear: Iran is not only a threat to Israel; Iran is also a
threat to American personnel in the region, American interests, and
innocent civilians across the region who suffer at the hands of
Iran-based and -backed terrorist proxies.

We will never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to defend
U.S. forces and interests against Iran and Iran-backed terrorists.  And
we will continue to work with our allies and partners to disrupt Iran’s
aggressive behavior and hold them accountable.

Thank you.
