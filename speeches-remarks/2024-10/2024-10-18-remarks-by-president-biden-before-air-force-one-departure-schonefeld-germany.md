Q    Mr. President, what did you achieve today?

THE PRESIDENT:  We had very good meetings today with the Quad.  There
was an almost — there was unanimity on continuing to support what’s
going on in Ukraine, helping the Ukrainians. 

We also talked about the Middle East.  We think there’s a road to peace
there.  It’s going to be harder.  It’s going to be difficult.  But we’re
all on the same page.  So, there’s total unanimity.  And — 

Q    Did your predecessor come up in the discussions?

THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t know who my predecessor is.

Q    Can you give us a sense about the Middle East piece?  Do you — you
said it’s going to be harder.  Do you have any sense of a timeline?  Are
you putting more pressure on Netanyahu? 

THE PRESIDENT:  There’s an opportunity, in my view — and my colleagues
agreed — that we can probably deal to the — Israel and Iran in a way
that is — ends the — the conflict for a while.

Q    Say that again.

THE PRESIDENT:  That ends the conflict.  In other words, that stops the
back and forth. 

We think that there’s a possibility of working to a ceasefire in
Lebanon.  And it’s going to be harder in Gaza, but we agree that there
has to be an outcome, what — what happens the day after.

Q    Mr. President, do you have a good understanding right now what
Israel is going to do in response to Iran’s October 1st attacks and when
they will actually respond to Iran?

THE PRESIDENT:  Yes and yes.

Q    Can you tell us?

THE PRESIDENT:  No and no.

Q    Sir, did you hear any concerns about the upcoming American
election?  Are your fellow leaders worried?

THE PRESIDENT:  They’re interested.

Q    Do you — did you get reassurance from Netanyahu yesterday on your
phone call that they’re willing to come to the table on a ceasefire?

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I — I’m not go- — we’re in the middle of
discussions on that.  We’re not — I’m not going to get into that.

Q    Mr. President, is there any chance that you would — on Ukraine —
that you would change your mind on long-range weapons, allowing them to
strike deeper into Russia, which is one of the main proposals that
Zelenskyy put out?

THE PRESIDENT:  In — in foreign policy, there’s never a, “Well, I never
change my mind.”  Right now, there is no consensus for long-range
weapons (inaudible).

Q    What would have to happen for you to change your mind on that —

THE PRESIDENT:  I’m not going to speculate.

Q    — and NATO membership?

Q    What’s the consensus on the Ukraine victory plan from the Quad
meeting?

THE PRESIDENT:  Say it again.

Q    The consensus on the Ukraine victory plan from —

THE PRESIDENT:  We’re —

Q    — the Quad meeting?

THE PRESIDENT:  We’re going to stay with Ukraine.  We’re going to make
sure they continue to have capabilities.

Thank you.
