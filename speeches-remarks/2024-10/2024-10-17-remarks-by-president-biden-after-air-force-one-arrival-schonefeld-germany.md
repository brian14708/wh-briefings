THE PRESIDENT:  It’s a good day for the world.  We got Si- — I called
Bibi Netanyahu to congratulate him on getting Sinwar.  He has a lot of
blood on his hands — American blood, Israeli blood, and others.

And I told him that we were really pleased with his actions and,
further, that now is the time to move on — move on, move towards a
ceasefire in Gaza, make sure that we move in a direction that we’re
going to be in a position to make things better for the whole world. 

It’s time for this war to end and bring these hostages home.  And so,
that’s what we’re ready to do.  That’s what we’re going to be — and I’m
sending Tony Blinken to Israel — I guess he’s going in five days — four
days — four or five days.  Anyway, he’s going.  And I talked with Bibi
about that.  We’re going to work out what — what is the day after now,
what — how do we secure Gaza and move on. 

So, thank you very much.

Q    Do you feel more hopeful, sir, about a ceasefire?

THE PRESIDENT:  I do.  I do feel more hopeful.

Q    Do you have a sense of when he will end the war, sir?

THE PRESIDENT:  Hopefully, he — very soon.
