THE VICE PRESIDENT:  So, yesterday, we learned that Donald Trump’s
former chief of staff, John Kelly, a retired four-star general,
confirmed that while Donald Trump was president, he said he wanted
generals like Adolf Hitler had.

Donald Trump said that because he does not want a military that is loyal
to the United States Constitution.  He wants a military that is loyal to
him.  He wants a military who will be loyal to him personally, one that
will obey his orders even when he tells them to break the law or abandon
their oath to the Constitution of the United States.

In just the past week, Donald Trump has repeatedly called his fellow
Americans the “enemy from within” and even said that he would use the
United States military to go after American citizens.

And let’s be clear about who he considers to be the enemy from within. 
Anyone who refuses to bend a knee or dares to criticize him would
qualify, in his mind, as the enemy within, like judges, like
journalists, like nonpartisan election officials.

It is deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous that Donald Trump would
invoke Adolf Hitler, the man who is responsible for the deaths of 6
million Jews and hundreds of thousands of Americans. 

All of this is further evidence for the American people of who Donald
Trump really is.  This is a window into who Donald Trump really is from
the people who know him best, from the people who worked with him side
by side in the Oval Office and in the Situation Room.

 And it is clear from John Kelly’s words that Donald Trump is someone
who, I quote, “certainly falls into the general definition of “fascist,”
who, in fact, vowed to be a dictator on day one and vowed to use the
military as his personal militia to carry out his personal and political
vendettas.

Donald Trump is increasingly unhinged and unstable.  And in a second
term, people like John Kelly would not be there to be the guardrails
against his propensities and his actions.  Those who once tried to stop
him from pursuing his worst impulses would no longer be there and no
longer be there to rein him in.

So, the bottom line is this.  We know what Donald Trump wants.  He wants
unchecked power.  The question in 13 days will be: What do the American
people want?

     Thank you.
