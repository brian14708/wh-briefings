 THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, Governor, I want to thank you — General,
Administrator.  I came out to talk with the folks who have been doing
God’s work on the ground here in the last several days. 

The work that is happening here and that continues really is the best of
what we can do to bring federal, state, and local resources together in
a way that is coordinated with one purpose and one purpose only, which
is bringing relief, support, and help to the people who are most in need
and desperate for help and desperate to be seen and heard.

I just spoke with members of the National Guard to thank them.  They,
like so many who are on the ground doing this work — whether it be
through FEMA, the governor’s office, state offices — they — many of them
who are doing this work have been directly hit themselves.  We are
talking about people who are leaders, who are from the communities that
have been hardest hit. 

And I think we all have to recognize and thank them for the nobility of
their work and their calling, which is to leave their home, to leave
their families who may need the kind of resources that they can
provide.  But they have taken an oath.  They have taken on a job that
says to them they must go and help those who are in need, many who may
be strangers to them.

So, I came here to find out what’s going on on the ground, to find out
what more we can do in terms of federal aid, such as what we announced
today, and the federal support we’re giving to Mecklen- — Mecklenburg
County in terms of disaster relief — the work that we are doing, which
is $100 million to assist with the rebuilding of Interstate 40.  And
also, again, just to thank the folks on the ground for what they are
doing every day.

And, again, I want to thank you, Governor, Administrator, General,
everyone who is here — Colonel — for all you are doing on behalf of
everyone in this region and our nation.  You all are doing extraordinary
work, and we are forever grateful to you all.  So, thank you. 

     Thank you all.
