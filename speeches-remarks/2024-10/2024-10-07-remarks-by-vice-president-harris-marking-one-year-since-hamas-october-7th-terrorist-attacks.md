THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  In a few moments, Doug and I will
plant a tree here on the grounds of the Residence of the Vice President
of the United States, and we dedicate this tree to the 1,200 innocent
souls, in an act of pure evil on October 7, 2023, who were massacred by
Hamas terrorists. 

Forty-six of our fellow Americans were killed in this brutal terrorist
attack, including a singer from Missouri who died shielding her son from
bullets, an academic and peace activist who studied in Seattle and who
was the grandson of Holocaust survivors, and a dancer from California
who was killed alongside her fiancé while attending the Nova Music
Festival. 

I am devastated by the pain and loss that occurred on October 7, and
Doug and I pray for the family and loved ones of all of those who were
lost, and may their memories be a blessing. 

Today, I know many Jews will be reciting and reflecting on the Jewish
prayer for mourning, the Kaddish.  The words of the prayer are not about
death; it is a prayer about our enduring belief in God, even in our
darkest moments.  So, as we reflect on the horrors of October 7, let us
please be reminded that we cannot lose faith. 

The Jewish philosopher Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel wrote, and I quote,
“Religion begins with a consciousness that something is asked of us.” 
So, in this moment, on the one-year commemoration of October 7, what it
— what is asked of us?  What is asked of us?

First and foremost, I believe that we must never forget.  I will never
forget October 7, and the world must never forget. 

What is asked of us: We must work to ensure nothing like the horrors of
October 7 can ever happen again.  And on this solemn day, I will restate
my pledge to always ensure that Israel has what it needs to defend
itself and that I will always work to ensure the safety and security of
the Jewish people here and around the world.

What is asked of us: We must reunite the hostages held in Gaza with
their families, and I will never stop fighting for the release of all
the hostages, including the American citizens, living and deceased:
Omer, Edan, Sagui, Keith, Judi, Gadi, and Itay.

What is asked of us: We must uphold the commitment to repair the world,
an idea that has been passed on throughout generations of the Jewish
people and across many faiths.  And to that end, we must work to relieve
the immense suffering of innocent Palestinians in Gaza who have
experienced so much pain and loss over the year. 

What is asked of us: We must continue to see light amidst the darkness. 
As the late Rabbi Jonathan Sacks said, “A people that can walk through
the valley of the shadow of death and still rejoice is a people that
cannot be defeated by any force or fear.” 

That is why today we plant a pomegranate tree, which, in Judaism, is a
symbol of hope and righteousness.  So, for years to come, this
pomegranate tree will stand here, spreading its roots and growing
stronger, to remind future vice presidents of the United States, their
families, and all who pass through these grounds not only of the horror
of October 7th but the strength and the endurance of the Jewish people. 

It will remind us all not to abandon the goal of peace, dignity, and
security for all.  And it will remind us all to always have faith. 

Thank you.  And I will now turn it over to the second gentleman, my
husband, Doug.
