  \ Heritage Month\_Reception"

5:54 P.M. EDT  
   
THE FIRST LADY:  Thank you.  (Applause.)  
   
Thank you, Alexa.  And I’m excited to see your generation forging new
connections to our past and shining such a bright light into our
future.  
   
And I’m also grateful to the National Italian American Foundation. 
(Applause.)  John, Robert, you’ve all — you’ve helped so many people
experience our heritage in Italy and preserve it here in the United
States.  So, thank you.  
   
*Buonasera*, everyone.  (Laughter.)   
   
AUDIENCE:  *Buonasera*!  
   
THE FIRST LADY:  And welcome to the White House.  
   
When I was a little girl, I learned what it means to be Italian American
in my grandparents’ tiny, well-worn kitchen — and not only because there
were ribbons of pasta — homemade pasta and sauce bubbling over on the
stove.  
   
No, the most important lesson that I learned in their kitchen was that,
when you’re Italian American, there’s always room for one more chair at
the table — (applause) — enough bread toast to feed one more guest,
enough space in our hearts for another friend to become like family.   
   
And even when times are hard, there’s —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Looking at me.  (Laughter.)  
   
THE FIRST LADY:  There’s always enough time to — (the president makes
the sign of the cross) — (laughter) — enjoy the pleasures of life
together.  
   
My grandparents also taught me to never waste an opportunity to invite
more people to the table and make a difference together.  So, I knew I
had to bring those values of love, abundance, and service to the White
House as the first Italian American first lady.  (Applause.)  
   
That’s why I’ve used this platform to give more women a seat at the
table in discussions about their own health — (applause) — to hear from
military families about how we can support them, to uplift community
college students.   
   
And I’ve had the opportunity to bring so many more people inside the
historic walls of the White House by creating new educational
experiences that allow more Americans to immerse themselves in this
house, the People’s House; by using these rooms to celebrate the young
people who are changing our world; by honoring the immigrants who helped
build this country; and tonight — (applause) — thank you — and tonight,
gathering with this community — my community — to celebrate our
culture.  (Laughter.)  
   
So, it’s been the honor of my life to serve as first lady.  And during
my time here, I’ve often thought of my great-grandparents leaving
everything they knew behind to chase the promise of America.  And then,
when they arrived on Ellis Island to take their first strides into a new
life, I don’t think that they could ever have imagined that a group of
hundreds of Italian Americans — coming together in the White House.  
   
When our roots run deep, there’s no limit to how high we can reach.  So,
tonight, I hope that you feel the power of our ancestors’ values beating
inside of us as we carry their legacy forward; that you feel home — you
feel at home, eat good food, and end up with a little something sweet
together, as a family.  (Laughter.)  
   
Now, it’s my pleasure to introduce a man who’s always felt at home —
(laughs) — with Italian Americans.  (Applause.)  In fact, Joe first met
my family at a big cookout at my grandparents’ house in Hammonton, New
Jersey.   
   
So, I was pretty nervous, you know, about Joe coming to meet my family. 
But as soon as Joe pulled up into the driveway — and you kn- — you can
picture this — my tiny grandmom bolted out of the house, bounded down
the porch steps, in her housecoat and her apron, and she gave Joe this
huge hug, as if she’d known him his entire life.  And before he could
even get a plate, Joe was greeted not as a stranger but as family.  
   
Over the years, I’ve seen the Italian American community extend the same
joyful love and support to Joe.  You mean so much to him.  (Laughs.)  
   
So, please welcome — I don’t know why I’m getting so emotional — your
president, my husband, Joe.  (Applause.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Welcome to the White House.  (Applause.)   My name is
Joe Biden, and I’m Jill Biden’s husband.  (Laughter and applause.)  
   
Now, I may be Irish, but I’m not stupid.  (Laughter.)  I married Dominic
Giacoppa’s granddaughter.   
   
And five years ago, I want you to know, I received the Sons of Italy Man
of the Year award.  To the best of my knowledge, I’m the only
non-Italian ever to receive that award.  (Laughter and applause.)  There
was a large crowd when I received that award.  It was down by the train
station.   
   
You know, I said I — I moved from an Irish Catholic neighborhood in
Scranton to an Italian Catholic neighborhood in Claymont, Delaware.  And
I went from a — where — a place where you ended like Finnegan and Murphy
and all that, down if your name didn’t lend — end in “O,” you’re in real
trouble.  (Laughter.)   
   
I was one of the few guys whose name didn’t end in “O.”  I’d look out
there and look at all my friends.  You know, I accepted the award and
named some of the guys I grew up with next door: Sonny Daramo, whose mom
would say, “Joey, it’s not sauce; it’s gravy, Joey.  It’s gravy, Joey.” 
(Laughter and applause.)  Oh, you think I’m kidding.  I’m not. 
(Laughter.)  
   
No, Anzilotti, De- — Sabatino, Buchini, Bifferato, Ceni, Congialdi,
Deluterio, Monaco — no, you think I’m kidding —  Tancr- —  
   
By the way, after I talked about it, I looked down at that crowd and
said, “You know…” — thinking about it, I said, “I deserve this damn
award.”  (Laughter.)  “With that many Italian friends, man, I deserve
that award.”  (Laughter.)  
   
Thank you, Alexa, for being here and sharing your pride in your family
and your heritage.   
   
Look, and it’s great to see so many friends from the National Italian
American Foundation, you know, the Sons and Daughters of Italy, and so
many other Italian American leaders and organization from all across the
country.  
   
You know, I can honestly say I wouldn’t be president without you.  I
wouldn’t be president without the Italian American community.   
   
Now, what she didn’t say is we do have something in common.  I’m
Catherine Eugenia Finnegan — Irish Catholics background.  You guys, a
lot of you are Catholics, you know.  (Laughter.)  I know you don’t admit
it as much, but there — (laughter).  
   
This month is about celebrating the extraordinary contributions and
proud, proud herita- — heritage of Italian Americans to our nation.  And
it’s kind of endless.   
   
For some of our families, your story is America’s story.  It stretches
back generations.  For others, it just started.  No matter when these
st- — stories of immigrants who left everything behind to travel across
the ocean in pursuit of the American dream just for a shot — just a
simple shot.  You and your ancestors worked hard to help build this
country and build the middle class.   
   
People like my college friend, the late Congressman Bill Pascrell — he’s
been — Bill, Jr. is here.  Where — where are you, Bill?  (Applause.) 
There you are.   
   
I used to kid his dad all the time.  I said, “You know, Delaware may be
the second-smallest state in the Union, but we own the Delaware River up
to the highwater mark in New Jersey.”   (Laughter.)  There was actually
a Supreme Court case about that.  Anyway.  (Laughter.)  
   
But he represented New Jersey, and his son represents the House of
Representatives.  And Bill did it for 27 years, when he passed away this
summer.  He was the grandson of Italian immigrants, a giant in the
community, and a devoted patriot to the nation.  You got good blood,
kid, as my dad would say.  (Applause.)   
   
He was a part of a proud, proud heritage of Italian Americans who enrich
every part of American life: entrepreneurs, educators, scientists,
chefs, diplomats, doctors, servicemembers, veterans, athletes, actors,
artists, and so much more.  There’s nothing the Italian community is not
engaged in — I mean, virtually nothing.  There’s noth- — no community
you don’t excel in.  
   
But I also know it wasn’t always easy.  Many of your ancestors faced
horrific discrimination, like my ancestors faced horrific
discrimination, when they first came to our shores.  Yet, even in the
face of — Italian Americans proved that they had the resilient spirit
and a devotion to family and community, an unshakeable faith in the
promise of a better tomorrow.   
   
You know, my dad used to have an expression.  He’d say, “Joey, family is
the beginning, the middle, and the end — the beginning, the middle, and
the end.”  It’s a faith that has carried through to today, both at home
and abroad.   
   
Italian Americans are central to our nation’s deep friendship and
strategic partnership with Italy.  I’ve — I’ve worked out a really good
relationship with the Italians.  I’m — well, Ital- — I better have done
that but at home.  (Laughter.)  But all kidding aside, with th- — with
Italy.  What a magnificent country.  
   
You know, and — anyway, I won’t get started.  But — (laughter) — you
know, the bond between our countries is founded on a shared principle
and shared commitments, including the shared support for the brave
people of Ukraine as they defend themselves against Russia’s illegal
(inaudible).  (Applause.)  
   
I might add, they have a female leader.  (Applause.)  I wish Sonny
Daramo were here to hear that.  (Laughter.)  
   
In addition, Italy’s remarkable stewardship with the presidency of the
G7 this year, as well as Italy’s long-standing contributions to
transatlantic security through NATO — look, and their strong leadership
in the European Union — it underscores how important Italy’s role is on
the global stage, not just, you know, for America but for the
world.     
   
You know, let me close with this.  You know, Michelangelo famously said
he “saw an angel in the marble, and I carved until I set it free.”  “I
saw an angel in the marble, and I carved until I set it free.”  To me,
that’s the essence of what Italian Americans have done to our country
for our entire history.  You’ve carved until you set us free.  I’m — I’m
being dead- — deadly earnest.    
   
We’re all reminded that when Jill and I had the honor to host one of the
greatest singers of all time, in my view, Andrea Bocelli, here at the
White House for Christmas in our first year in office, he performed with
his son and his daughter as if they were a choir of herald angels.  They
were incredible.  You know, with their God-given talent, the Bocelli
family moved our hearts, pierced our souls — and I mean this sincerely —
I have all of the music on my — and they embodied the spirit and beauty
of all that connects us as people.  A powerful reminder that America’s
story depends on — not on any one of us but on — not on some of us but
all of us.   
   
It’s a story I see in all of you, working tirelessly — tirelessly to
help realize the promise of America — and I mean it — for all
Americans.  Not a joke.  Because some of you have been on the short end
of the stick like my family growing up had been.   
   
This is what the Italian American Heritage Month is all about.  It’s
about celebrating and connecting, feeling the pride in heritage and
community, remembering who the hell we are.   
   
We’re the United States of America, and there’s nothing beyond our
capacity when we do it together — nothing, nothing, nothing. 
(Applause.)  No, I really mean it.  
   
So, thank you.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.   
   
And I want to tell you, you know what made me mo- — the — probably one
of the most famous guys in my family — the whole family?  Not being
president.  I took her to a beautiful little island off of Sicily. 
(Laughter.)  And she keeps saying, “I’m going back.”  (Laughter.)  
   
THE FIRST LADY:  Soon!  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  “With — with or without you.”  (Laughter.)  
   
So, folks, all kidding aside, thank you.  You’re an incredible
community.  (Applause.)   
   
THE FIRST LADY:  Thank you.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  You’re an essential part of my life.   
   
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)  Enjoy the day.   
   
God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops.   
   
Thank you.  (Applause.)  All right.
