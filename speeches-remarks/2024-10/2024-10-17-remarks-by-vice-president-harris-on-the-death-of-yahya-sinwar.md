THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Today, Israel confirmed that Yahya Sinwar, the
leader of Hamas, is dead and justice has been served, and the United
States, Israel, and the entire world are better off as a result.  
  
Sinwar was responsible for the killing of thousands of innocent people,
including the victims of October 7 and hostages killed in Gaza.  He had
American blood on his hands.

Today, I can only hope that the families of the victims of Hamas feel a
sense and measure of relief.  
  
Sinwar was the mastermind of October 7, the deadliest day for the Jewish
people since the Holocaust — a terrorist attack that killed 1,200
innocent people and included horrific sexual violence and more than 250
hostages taken into Gaza, including 7 Americans, living and deceased,
who remain in captivity; a terrorist attack that triggered a devastating
war in Gaza — a war that has led to unconscionable suffering of many
innocent Palestinians and greater instability throughout the Middle
East.  
      
In the past year, American special operations and intelligence personnel
have worked closely with their Israeli counterparts to locate and track
Sinwar and other Hamas leaders, and I commend their work.  
  
And I will say to any terrorist who kills Americans, threatens the
American people, or threatens our troops or our interests, know this: We
will always bring you to justice.  
  
Israel has a right to defend itself, and the threat Hamas poses to
Israel must be eliminated.  
  
Today, there is clear progress toward that goal.  Hamas is decimated,
and its leadership is eliminated.  
  
This moment gives us an opportunity to finally end the war in Gaza, and
it must end such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the
suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their
right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination.  And it is
time for the day after to begin without Hamas in power.  
  
We will not give up on these goals, and I will always work to create a
future of peace, dignity, and security for all.  
  
     I thank you all.
