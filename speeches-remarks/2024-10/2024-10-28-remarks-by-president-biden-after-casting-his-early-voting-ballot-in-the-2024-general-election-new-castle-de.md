THE PRESIDENT:  First-time voter.  (Pointing to voters.)

Q    Mr. President, do you want to —

Q    Mr. President, is this bittersweet for you today?

THE PRESIDENT:  Pardon me?

Q    Is this bittersweet for you?

THE PRESIDENT:  No, this is just sweet. 

Q    Do you think she will win?

THE PRESIDENT:  I think we will.  I think it’s a —

Q    Mis- — Mr. President, can you come here and comment on former
President Trump’s rally yesterday?  He was saying a bunch of stuff about
immigrant —

THE PRESIDENT:  Embarrassing.  Just simply embarrassing.  It’s beneath
any president, but that’s what we’re getting used to.  That’s why this
election is so important. 

You know, most of the presidential scholars I’ve spoken to talk about
the single most consequential thing about a president is character. 
Character.  And there’s — he puts that in question every time he opens
his mouth.

Q    Mr. President, Egypt has a new proposal for a ceasefire — a two-day
ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.  What do you think about it?

THE PRESIDENT:  I’m — my staff is talking to them right now.  I’m going
to get out here, get on a secure line, and follow up on that. 

We need a ceasefire.  We should end this war.  It should end.  It should
end.  It should end.

Q    Prime Minister Netanyahu stressed that negotiations under fire is
better than negotiation during ceasefire.  What do you think about that?

THE PRESIDENT:  I’ll reserve that for my discussion with him.

Q    Mr. President, will we see you and Vice President Harris this
week? 

Q    Mr. President, can you talk a little bit — are we going to see you
with the vice president, Harris?  But also, do you wish more like
candidates like Lisa Blunt Rochester were using you as a surrogate?

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’ve done a lot of surrogate stuff.  And the fact
of the matter is that I’ve also had to be president at the same time, so
I’ve been in all the — all the battleground states.  I’ve been
campaigning, but I also have to con- — continue my job as president. 

Q    Will you be on the trail with the vice president this week, sir?

THE PRESIDENT:  I’ve been on the trail.  What — there’s –we’ve — we talk
all the time, and they’re asking me to — where they think I should be to
help them the most.  I’m going to be in Pennsylvania.  I’m going to head
to Scranton and a few other places.  So, (inaudible).

Q    Sir —

Q    Are you concerned about North Korea?  Ten thousand troops now.

THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  And you got — I don’t even want to — it’s very
dangerous.  It’s very dangerous.

And the idea that Kamala’s opponent is talking to Putin and discussing
what should be done — I mean —

Anyway.  I — I’m not —

Q    Sir — sir, Elon Musk is handing out checks to registered voters —

THE PRESIDENT:  Tell him I registered. 

Q    — registered — 

THE PRESIDENT:  A million dollars. 

Q    Do you think that’s legal conduct?  Do you think that’s election
interference?

THE PRESIDENT:  I think it’s totally inappropriate. 

Thank you.
