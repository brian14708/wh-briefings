THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mayor. 

And I am here in Augusta to — to thank all of the folks who are here on
the ground doing this extraordinary work.  And, you know, I’ve been
reading and hearing about the work you’ve been doing over the last few
days.  And I think it really does represent some of the best of what we
each know can be done, especially when we coordinate around local,
state, and federal resources to meet the — the needs of people who must
be seen and must be heard. 

These are very difficult times.  And in a moment of crisis, I think that
really does bring out the best of who we are, and you each epitomize
that important and good work.  
  
So, I’m here to thank you and to listen.

And — and, Senator, I want to thank you for the work that you’ve been
doing on behalf of the state, because I know you’ve been talking to me
and the president and many others about making sure that the federal
resources get to this beautiful state.  
  
 So, thank you all.  
  
 And, Mayor, I am now listening.
