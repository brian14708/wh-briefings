Roosevelt Room

1:21 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, folks, Kamala and I have just received a briefing
from senior leaders across our administration from Hurricane Helene and
— and Hurricane Milton.  And to state the obvious, I’m sure you feel the
same way, our heart goes out to all those folks who — who’ve lost not
only personal property but their homes and some lost lives — and
grieving after the aftermath of the — the tornados, brutal winds, record
downpours, and historic flooding.   
   
I must have spoken in the last three days to 50 to 75 members of the —
in Cali- — from North Carolina all the way down to Florida, talking to
mayors and county executives and — anyway, it’s just — it’s amazing
what’s going on.   
   
And, you know, this is the third major storm — third major storm to hit
California — I mean, excuse me, Florida, in three months.  And experts
estimate that as — and it’s early — early estimates — it could be more;
it could be less — but estimates that it’s caused damages around $50
billion from Hurricane Milton alone — just alone, $50 billion.  
   
And I want everyone in the impacted areas to know we’re going to do
everything we can to let you — help you pick back up the pieces and get
back to where you were.   
   
We’ve been in constant contact, calling and reaching out to over 40
state and local officials, as I said, and they — they need — we have to
give them a little bit of hope.  I mean, some of you have been through
crises.  You know the one thing you wonder about when things are really
bad is, is there hope?  Is — is anybody coming?  What’s going to
happen?  And that’s what — that’s what’s happening right now.  State and
local officials are — are doing everything they can to help these folks
recover.  
   
At my request, the primary focus of today’s briefing has been on the
power restoration and debris removal, because there are urgent needs.   
   
Milton left over 3 million people without power, but with the dedication
of 50,000 powerline workers — 50,000 powerline workers from 43 states
and the country of — and Canada have stepped up and come down to help
and to restore — they’ve already restored power to 1 million people so
far.   
   
And, by the way, if you ever watch these guys and women climb these
poles in the middle of nowhere, this is — anyway, they’re — they’re
risking this while they’re doing this work.   
   
And I’ve — we just spoke to the CEOs of the public and private electric
utilities to thank them for surging their — their restoration crews to
people urgently needing power, even in the communities they don’t
serve.  That’s one of the points: A lot of these folks are going into
the communities they have — they don’t serve at all and just
volunteering.  And the energy sector is real.   
   
And, by the way, our secretary, Jennifer Granholm, of Energy, is — she
calls it a “mini NATO,” a — a commitment to mutual assistance and
another shining example of Americans — literally someone — when push
comes to shove, they stand up and take care of one another.  
   
We’re going to continue to prioritize this effort until everyone is
reconnected and back online.   
   
We’ve been able to get this work done quicker because of critical
infrastructure investments we’ve made, but when I was vice president —
both when I was vice president and since I’ve been president to harden
the grid — the grid — you all know it, but “the grid” meaning, for your
listeners, the electric power grid that transmits power — harden the
grid by incorporating innovative technologies like burying transmission
lines underground, replacing wood power poles with concrete power poles
that don’t snap in the wind.   
   
To reduce the impact of extreme weather and climate change, we have to
continue making these investments.  We were just talking about it with
the utility companies and with our team here and with — with the
secretary.   
   
You know, over the years, the past several years, Florida has taken the
money, back when we — I got when we were vice president — when I was
vice president, to invest in putting these lines underground.  It costs
a hell of a lot more to put the lines underground than it does up in the
air, but — up to six times more or seven times more — but it makes
sense, be- –and anybody who says, “We don’t want to spend the money,”
think of the three storms.  Ev- — after every damn storm, it’ll wipe out
the power grid; you’ve got to rebuild it.  And so, if you can keep it so
it’s not wiped out, it makes a long-term savings.  
   
And the other thing that’s a big deal is debris removal.  FEMA and the
Corps of Engineers and the Florida National Guard are now on the ground
helping the state clear debris — debris to reopen roads and critical
ports as well. 

I mean, s- — you’ve seen the pictures.  Some of you have been there. 
You see wh- — for example, in North Carolina, where half a mountain
comes down and the bridge rolls into the water, and you’ve got — you’ve
got piles.  I mean, you — you see at the end of a — end of a river in a
cul-de-sac.  I mean, piles are three, four, five feet high with all
kinds of debris in there.  It’s going to take a lot of time and money to
remove it.  
   
But the Army Corps and the Florida National Guard in Florida are on the
ground helping clear this debris and reopen the roads.  A- — and so, we
can make — they have to do it for other reasons, to make critical
deliveries of food, water, and tarps and lifesaving supplies.  
   
The Coast Guard is leading the effort to reopen the Port of Tampa, which
you — as you all know, because we’ve — everybody’s been covering it and
they’ve done a good job of doing it — covering it because it’s a port
that delivers a lot of — a lot of fuel that goes into the region and
goods that are necessary.  It’s critical for the economy of the
region.  
   
And — and, again, let me say that the misinformation out there is not
only just disgusting, but it — it’s dangerous and it’s misleading.  And,
again, the first thing it does — and I mean this sincerely.  I don’t — a
lot of you have been through these crises, some of you personally.  But
people desperately want hope — “Tell me it’s going to be okay.”  “Tell
me it’s going to be okay.”  And they’re in real trouble, a lot of
them.  
   
And to hear this malarkey you’re hearing from some of the people we — I
won’t even get into, but — I’ll lose my temper.   
   
But, anyway, the truth is we’re providing all the resources that are
needed.  
   
Let me close with this.  I want to thank you again to our brave first
responders, powerline workers, state and local officials, and neighbors
helping neighbors and so many more.   
   
Look, it’s a team effort.  I know that sounds corny, but it really is a
team effort and everybody in the game here.  
   
We — we’re looking at it very seriously, and we’re working together. 
And it’s made a big difference.  I think we’ve saved lives — not me, but
we, all of those folks out in the field have saved lives.     
   
But there’s more to do, and we’re going to do everything in my power to
get it done.  And the fact of the matter is that we’re in a situation
where — well —  
   
SECRETARY GRANHOLM:  She’s (inaudible) —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I — I know.  I’m going to go to the vice president in a
second.   
   
The — she — she’s my boss here.  (Laughter.)  (Inaudible.)  
   
SECRETARY GRANHOLM:  I wasn’t sure if you saw it.  (Laughs.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  We’re — we’re going to be —  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Mr. President —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Wa- — hang on one second, Madam Vice President.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Sure.  (Laughs.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  We’re going to — we’re going to be going to the
Congress.  We’re going to need a lot of help, going to need a lot more
money as we — as we identify specifically how much is needed.  
   
So, I’m just telling everybody now.  I don’t want to hear the — this is
going to be the end of it.   
   
So — and so, with that, I’ll le- — I’ll yield to the president — I mean,
the vice president.  (Laughter.)  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  And thank you to all of
the men and women represented at the agencies that are represented by
the members of the president’s Cabinet for the work that they’ve been
doing around the clock.  
   
In the wake of Hurricane Milton, we have, of course, witnessed
widespread devastation.  Homes and neighborhoods have been severely
damaged.  Millions of people are without power and thousands without
clean water.  
   
To the people of Florida, and — you must know — and to the — all of
those in the region, our nation is with you.  We see your incredible
strength and resilience, and we are working around the clock to keep you
safe.  We continue to coordinate resources with local and state
authorities, including food, water, medical supplies, and generators,
and we will continue to work with the teams on the ground to restore
water and power as quickly as possible.  
   
In the coming days and weeks, President Biden and I will make sure that
the communities that are there on the ground and have been affected will
have the resources they need not only to respond to the storm but also
to recover.  And we will continue to keep communities in Florida,
Georgia, North and South Carolina, and across the Southeast — ensured
that they will recover from Hurricane Helene.  
   
Finally, I will say once again, as Secretary Mayorkas and I have
discussed, to any company or individual that is using this crisis to
jack up prices through illegal fraud or price gouging, whether it be at
the gas pump, the airport, or the hotel counter, we will be monitoring,
and there will be a consequence.  
   
The bottom line is this.  We are in this for the long haul, and the
support and the coordination between federal, state, and local
authorities and leaders has been extraordinary and will continue for as
long as it takes.  
   
I thank you all.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  
   
(Cross-talk.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Holler louder.  Holler louder.  I can’t hear you.   
   
Q    Mr. President, are you worried about —  
   
Q    The misinformation that you’ve been talking about that you’re so
worried about?  Do you —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Say again.  
   
Q    The misinformation that you’ve been —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  
   
Q    — talking about related to this hurricane and the recovery
efforts.  Do you think it’s temporary, or do you think and worry that
this might be a permanent state of being for this country?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I think it’s a permanent state of being for some extreme
people, but I don’t think it’s what the country is about.  It’s — we’re
— we’re breaking through it.  We’re breaking through with the truth.   
   
And if you’ve noticed — and I’ve really been proud of — I’ve been on the
phone, talking with a lot of Republican mayors and governors.  They’re
standing up saying this is — not — not Joe Biden, but conservative,
hardcore Republican governors, hardcore Republican mayors standing up
and saying, “It’s got to stop.  It’s got to stop.”  
   
And — and I — I believe it’s — there’s nothing permanent about it.  I am
pleased that more Americans are coming together in a purely voluntary
way.  I mean, this is who the hell we are.  When America is in trouble,
we all jump in and try to help, help your neighbor.  And that’s ma- —
bas- — basically what’s happening.   
   
But what — the thing that bothers me the most is there’s a lot of people
who get caught in these crises who are basically alone — you know,
widowers, wi- — widowers, people in hospitals, people who are all by
themselves.  And they don’t know — and they lose contact, and they get —
and they just get scared to death — scared to death.  And — anyway.  
   
So, I think it’s a — I think those who have been spreading these lies to
try to undermine the opposition are going to pay a price for it.  
   
Q    Mr. President, are you worried about this effect —  
   
Q    But do you think Donald Trump is singularly to blame for all of
this?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, he’s not singularly — but he’s just the biggest
mouth.  
   
Q    Mr. President, will you ask —  
   
Q    Mr. President, have you spoken to Speaker Johnson —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, I haven’t —  
   
Q    — on calling Congress back?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  — but we’re going to — I’ve spoken to Republicans who
want to speak to Speaker Johnson.  And I think Speaker Johnson is going
to get the message that he’s got to step up, particularly for small
businesses.   
   
Q    Do you plan to meet with DeSantis in Florida?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I — I’ve spoken to him.  If he’s a- — if he’s available,
yeah.  He’s been very cooperative.  I’ve had no — we’ve had — we got on
very, very well.   
   
(Cross-talk.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Let me —  
   
Q    Are you as- — are you asking Israel to stop hitting U.N.
peacekeepers?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Absolutely, positively.   
   
Q    What — what about nuclear —  
   
Q    Mr. President, will you — will you approve Mr. Trump’s request to
use military aircraft in the final stages of the campaign?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m sorry?  
   
Q    Will you approve Mr. Trump’s request to use military aircraft in
the final stages of the campaign?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  As long as he doesn’t ask for F-15s.  No, I’m being
facetious.   
   
Look, I’ve told the department to give him every — every single thing he
needs for his — at any other — as — as he were a sitting president, give
all that needs.  If it fits within that category, that’s fine.  But if
it doesn’t, he shouldn’t.
