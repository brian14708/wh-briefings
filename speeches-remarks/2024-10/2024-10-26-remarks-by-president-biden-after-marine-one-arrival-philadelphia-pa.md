THE PRESIDENT: I assume you want to talk about Elon Musk being here
illegally.  
  
I’m only joking. What you got?

Q Mr. President, what do you say to the men that supported you but are
not supporting Harris?

THE PRESIDENT: They’re making a mistake, in my humble opinion.

Q On the Iran strike, is — is this the end of it?

THE PRESIDENT: On the Iran strike, I had a — I had a long — the reason
we’re a little late — I was on with the intelligence community for the
last half hour — (inaudible) hour. And it looks like they didn’t hit
anything other than military targets. My hope is this is the end.

Q Mr. President, the Chinese seemed to have hacked the Trump and Harris
campaigns. Will there be repercussions for Beijing?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, I got to find out more about that, but I’m getting
that brief when I get back as to what they did, how much they hacked,
and so on.

Q But if you find out that they did it, will there be repercussions?

THE PRESIDENT: We’ll have to talk about it.

Q Mr. President, did you get a heads-up from Israel on the Iran strike?
Did you get any heads-up?

THE PRESIDENT: Yes.

Q How worried are you that former President Trump seems to be talking to
Bibi Netanyahu quite frequently?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, you know, the — the criticism is Trump is talking
with Bibi, but Trump works for — for — Trumps works — Bi-

Trump work — talks to Bibi and his good multibillionaire friend talks to
him a lot too. So, I guess they’re all three friends.

Q Are you — are you not concerned at all that he seems to be doing
diplomacy while he’s not really representing the United States?

THE PRESIDENT: Yes.

Q What did you —

THE PRESIDENT: But I’m not surprised.

Q Sorry, sir. What did you think of Trump’s “America is garbage” comment
comparing America being an — essentially in the trash can?

THE PRESIDENT: Look, Trump has no class at all. Zero. None.

Think — all kidding aside, if we — if this wasn’t a political campaign,
how would you characterize the man in terms of his — his manners, his
decency?

I mean, it’s beneath a president.

Q Mr. President, the North Korean troops in Russia — what kind of
options do you have to respond to that? And when might we see a response
there?

THE PRESIDENT: We have options, and it depends on what they do.

Thank you so very much.
