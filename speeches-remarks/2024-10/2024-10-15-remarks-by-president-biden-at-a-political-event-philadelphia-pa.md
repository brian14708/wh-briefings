6:44 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, Philadelphia!  (Applause.)   
   
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello. 
(Applause.)  
   
AUDIENCE:  Thank you, Joe!  Thank you, Joe!  Thank you, Joe!  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you.   
   
AUDIENCE:  Thank you, Joe!  Thank you, Joe!  Thank you, Joe!  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  
   
AUDIENCE:  Thank you, Joe!  Thank you, Joe!  Thank you, Joe!  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Look, folks, you know, I represented Delaware, but I
wouldn’t have gotten elected without Philadelphia, and that’s the
truth.  (Applause.)  
   
Thanks to Bryan Bush and the Sheet Metal Workers Local 19 for hosting us
tonight and — and along with the leaders and members of other labor
unions across the country.  
   
Folks — and I want to thank my good friend Bobby Brady.  You know —
(applause) — if you’re ever in a foxhole and you’re looking for help,
you want him next to you, man.  (Applause.)   
   
You know, you’ve got great leadership in this state: Governor Shapiro,
who I talk to all the time, and Lieutenant Governor — two of the best in
the nation.  (Applause.)  You’ve got two of the best U.S. senators in
Bobby Casey, from my hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania — (applause) —
and John Fetterman, who is doing a tremendous job.  (Applause.)  He does
better in short pants than most people do in long pants.  (Laughter.) 
You have an incredible, historic mayor in Cherelle Parker.  Madam Mayor,
thank you.  (Applause.)  
   
Folks, we’re in the homestretch.  Let me ask you: Are you going to
reelect Bob Casey to the U.S. Senate?   
   
AUDIENCE:  Yes!  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Are you going to elect Erin McClelland state
treasurer?   
   
AUDIENCE:  Yes!  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Are you going to elect Eugene — hey, where — is Eugene
here?   
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Debate.  He’s on the debate.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  He’s in a debate.  Well, I tell you what, you better
elect him attorney general.  (Applause.)  
   
Are you going to elect my buddy Malcolm Kenyatta as the auditor
general?  (Applause.)  
   
And most importantly, let me ask you: Are you going to elect Kamala
Harris president of the United States of America?  (Applause.)   
   
Well, folks, look, four years ago, I picked Kamala to be my vice
president.  I picked her because she is smart and tough.  She was a
first-rate district attorney in — out in California, an attorney
general, and then U.S. senator.  But most of all, I picked her because
she has character and she has integrity.  (Applause.)  Incredi- —  
   
And I must admit, I picked her because she had one endorsement that
mattered most to me.  My son Beau Biden was the attorney general of the
state of Delaware, and I give you my word, when — before he left to —
headed off to Iraq for a year, he said, “Dad, I met the next generation,
man.”  He worked with her.  He worked with Kamala.  I’m no- — I’m not
joking.  As attorney generals, they worked together to take on the big
corporations.   
   
And, folks, he spent the next year stationed in Iraq with those
God-awful burn pits the size of football field and 10-feet deep,
incredible — used to incinerate everything from wastes of war to
chemicals, tires — just like up in 9/11, all those firemen.  Smoke thick
with poison spread through the air and the lungs of our troops.   
   
And Beau, like many others, shortly after he got home, he was diagnosed
with Stage 4 glioblastoma, which is a death sentence.  He lasted for a
wh- —  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, man.     
   
He lasted for a long while.   
   
But Beau was the attorney general of Delaware at the same time she was
the attorney general of California.  As I said, he told me — he told me,
“Dad, she’s an extraordinary leader.  She’s the next generation.  Take a
look at her, Dad.”  And she’s been that and more to me.  (Applause.)  
   
 I’m one of the few people in American history who has been vice
president and president, and I know both jobs — what they take.  And I
can tell you, Kamala Harris has been a great vice president.  She’ll be
a great president as well. (Applause.)   
   
When I decided it was time to pass the torch to the next generation, I
knew — I knew who I wanted to replace me.  I endorsed Kamala
immediately.  And if you’ve seen the campaign Kamala has run, it proves
I’m right.  The enthusiasm went off the charts.  Her convention was
great.  (Applause.)  
   
She beat Trump so badly in the debate he’s scared to death to beat her
again.  (Applause.)  That’s a fact.  Tough guy, right?  Tough guy. 
Because he knows he’d lose again.  That’s a fact.  He is a loser.  
   
Look, now I’m proud of our record the past four years.  Maybe you saw
Rachel Maddow last night, who did a whole lot of — raised a lot of
questions.  If you’re making business decisions about who’s doing a
better job on the economy, she said, “The Biden-Harris economy has been
— not only left every other rich country in the world in the dust, it’s
left the Trump administration in the dust.”  
   
Well, folks, that wasn’t hard to leave him in the dust.  (Laughter.)  I
think he lives in the dust.   
   
We created 16 million jobs, more jobs than have been created in a single
term in all of American history.  (Applause.)  More people are working
today than ever before.  Wages for working people are higher than they
have ever been before.  And more people have health care insurance than
before.   
   
And what does Trump want to do if he wins?  He wants to use his favorite
word: “terminate.”  No, I’m serious.  This guy means what he says, man. 
He wants to terminate the Affordable Care Act.  He’s been trying to
succeed, and he failed every time.  
   
If he does, though, 40 million Americans will lose their health care —
40 million.  And 100 million will lose their protections because they
have preexisting conditions.   
   
Trump likes to call himself “pro-business.”  We all know Trump is a
failed businessman.  He inherited $100 million, and he got bankrupt —
how many times?  I can’t keep track — including bankrupting a casino in
Atlantic City, which is pretty hard to do.  (Laughter.)  How’s that
possible?  I thought the house always won.  (Laughter.)   
   
Trump wasn’t only a loser in 2020, he’s a loser in everything he
does.   
   
Meanwhile, on our watch, businesses of all sizes are surging.  A record
number of small-business applications — 19 million so far since we’ve
gotten elected — and every single application is an act of hope. 
(Applause.)   
   
Folks, remember when Trump got elected — if he got elected, the stock —
he told — if I got elected, the stock market would crash?  I just wish
to hell I — I was — I was listed for 36 years as the poorest man in
Congress, so I didn’t have any stock.  But any rate — (laughter).  
   
But if he means the stock market crashed through record highs, he was
actually right.  It’s the highest it’s ever been in American history. 
And, by the way, it must be irritating to a guy to turn to Fox News and
hear the Biden-Harris stock market is stronger than ever in history. 
(Applause.)   
   
Look, folks, unemployment is at historic lows for everyone, including
Blacks and Latinos.  We have the smallest racial gap — wealth gap in 20
years.   
   
Wages have grown faster than inflation for more than a year now. 
Inflation is down to 2.4 percent.  In fact, it’s now back to
pre-pandemic levels, and it’s still going down — not up, down. 
(Applause.)  Along with it, interest rates are beginning to drop.   
   
The data shows the benefits of economic recovery are benefitting
working- and middle-class folks more than the top.  New data from the
National Labor Relations Board shows the number of workers filing for
union representation has doubled since I became president — doubled. 
(Applause.)  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Thank you, Joe!  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  You got it, man.  
   
AUDIENCE:  Thank you, Joe!  Thank you, Joe!  Thank you, Joe!  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, I —  
   
AUDIENCE:  Thank you, Joe!  Thank you, Joe!  Thank you, Joe!  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  My grandfather would roll over in his grave if I wasn’t
— he’d say, “Joey” — from Scranton — he’d say, “Joey, you’re union from
belt buckle to shoe sole.”  He said it a little more colorfully than
that.  (Laughter.)  
   
The Biden-Harris administration is the first administration in five
decades to increase union petitions.  (Applause.)  It’s simple.  They
know, you know, Kamala and I know: Wall Street didn’t build America. 
The middle class did, and unions built the middle class.  And that’s a
fact.  (Applause.)  
   
And I make no apologies for being the most pro-union president in
American history.  (Applause.)  
   
Folks, I mean it.  Under our administration, we’ve made the most
significant investment in public safety in history: $15 billion to law
enforcement through the American Rescue Plan.  And not a single
Republican voted for it.  The result?  Violent crime is down to a
50-year low.  (Applause.)  The murder rate is at the largest ever re- —
reduction.   
   
And Trump’s response?  Lie after lie that somehow the stats are fake. 
He says they’re making up the numbers.  
   
Not only that, for weeks, Kamala and I negotiated the strongest
bipartisan border deal in American history.  One of the most
conservative senators from Oklahoma and a progressive Democrat from
Connecticut worked four weeks on it, got it passed, introduced it in the
Congress.  What happened?  
   
We funded more agents, judges, high-tech machinery, and all the like. 
But Trump knew it was a good deal, so he called for it — he called — he
got on the phone and started calling Republicans to say, quote, “You
can’t vote for this because it will help Biden and hurt me.”  
   
He’s a great American, isn’t he?  
   
So, Trump and the Republicans killed the deal.  But Kamala and I didn’t
stop.  We surged resources and increased enforcement.  We took executive
action.  We worked with Mexico.   
   
And despite what all Trump’s friends say, there are fewer border
crossings today than the day he left office — right now.  (Applause.)  
   
But let me say it again.  There are fewer people coming into this
country illegally as I stand right now than the day he left office.  And
we’re going to —  
   
And, look, I got to say and Kamala will say: She’s going to do more for
comprehensive reform.  That’s one of the main things that got to get
done.  
   
So, let’s set the record straight.  More people are working today in
America than any time since Trump left office.  That’s just a fact.   
   
More people have health insurance than when Trump was president.  More
people are earning higher wages.  The stock market is even higher. 
(Applause.)  
   
401(k)s are stronger.  Violent crime is down.  Murder is down.  And
fewer people are crossing the border.   
   
And Trump calls that a hellscape?  Talks about America being a failed
nation.  Where the hell is he from?  (Laughter.)  
   
No, I’m serious.  Think about it.  A president calling America a “failed
nation.”  It makes me angry.  
   
I say America is winning.  (Applause.)  We’re the most powerful nation
in the world, the most respected nation in the world, and every other
country in the world would like to be like —  
   
Trump says we’re losers, but the only loser I know is Donald Trump. 
(Applause.)  
   
Look, don’t get me wrong.  There’s more work to be done.  Kamala and I
have specific plans to bring down the cost of housing, childcare,
eldercare, and more.  How we solve these challenges is going to — will
help make the next president — who is president.  Every president has to
cut their own path.   
   
That’s what I did.  I was loyal to Barack Obama, but I cut my own path
as president.  And that’s what Kamala is going to do.  She’ll be — she’s
been loyal so far, but she’s going to cut her own path — (applause) —
how to further economic growth, how to keep making it easier to start
and grow a business, how to make a border more secure, how to make
health care even more affordable, how to make housing more affordable,
how to make childcare and eldercare more affordable — all of which, if
we do, actually grows the economy and cuts the deficit.  (Applause.)   
   
Folks, Kamala will take the country in her own direction.  And that’s
one of the most important differences in this election.  Kamala’s
perspective on our problems will be fresh and new.  Donald Trump’s
perspective is old and failed and, quite frankly, thoroughly, totally
dishonest.   
   
Look, what is — what’s his idea for our economy?  He says he wants to
give another tax cut — a $5 trillion tax — that’s not a joke — a $5
trillion tax cut for the wealthy.  Last time he did a $2 trillion tax
cut and set the biggest debt — increased the national debt more than any
other president has in any single term.   
   
And, by the way, to pay your ta- — his taxes to the wealthy, he wants to
cut Social Security and Medicare.  
   
AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No- — not a joke.  Not a joke.  
   
In addition to t- — in addition to terminating the Affordable Care Act,
he wants to repeal what we did to lower prescription drug costs.  He
wants to bow down to Big Pharma again.   
   
Kamala and I finally beat Big Pharma — (applause) — and we gave Medicare
the — Medipare —  Medicare the power to negotiate presiction drugs —
prescription drugs, like the FA does for veterans — look — the VA.  
   
And seniors with disabilities are now paying $35 a month instead of
$400.  (Applause.)  And starting in January, all the seniors on Medicare
will have a total prescription drug cost capped at $2,000 a year, no
matter how much they have to spend.  (Applause.)   
   
Cancer drugs — (coughs) — excuse me.  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  We’re not going back!  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  We ain’t going back.  
   
AUDIENCE:  We’re not going back!  We’re not going back!  We’re not going
back!  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  And, by the way, our Medicare reforms not only save
seniors on Medicare money.  Do you know how much they — know how much
they save the taxpayers?  $160 billion, that one passage.  (Applause.) 
Why?  Because Medicare is paying $35 instead of $400, for example.  
   
Trump wants to take all that away.  But Kamala wants to expand
everything so it — gets for everybody in the nation.  
   
Look, she wants to cover the elder under Medicaid.   
   
Trump would get rid of the $369 billion Kamala and I passed — the most
ever in the history of the world — to deal with climate change.   
   
And, by the way, no climate change out there, right?  (Laughter.)  I
just spent a week — from Florida to North Carolina.  It’s devasting. 
You know why?  Because the ocean water is warming, increasing
significantly the threats of significant weather.   
   
How does it make you feel, after the latest hurricane that have ripped
through the country, knowing that we’re going to cut back on —  
   
And I — just, look, Trump wants a new sales tax — a new sales tax on
goods we — go- — go- — excuse me — on goods we import in sig- — in
significant numbers.  Up to 85 percent of all the seafood we eat is
imported, 60 percent of the fresh fruit, 40 percent of the vegetables. 
We import coffee, clothing, and so much more.  And according to all the
economists, if his sales tax were to, in fact, pass, the average family
would have an increase in their cost of $400 a year — or $4,000 a year —
excuse me — $4,000.  
   
And, look, it’s a surprise that we got a guy who can’t afford to say the
word “union” wants to get overtime on hardworking folks taken away.   
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  He’s a scab!  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, no.  He’s doing it again.  That’s what he says.  He
said — he and his allies say they support workers and the middle
class.   Give me a break.   
   
Look, this is from the same guy who calls himself a great protector of
women.   
   
AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  (The president makes the sign of the cross.)  Come
on.   
   
AUDIENCE:  Fire Trump again!  Fire Trump again!  Fire Trump again!  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  And, folks, look, this is the same guy who has been held
liable for $83 million for sexual abuse and mu- — and defamation.  Same
guy, for getting rid of Roe v. Wade.  The same guy who has three other
major cases waiting for him when he loses.   
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Thirty-four felonies!  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  And, by the way, 34 felonies.  And so far, he hadn’t
gotten sentenced.  He got the sentence kicked back, but I want to watch
that sentence.  (Laughter.)    
   
Look, Donald Trump is not running for you; he’s running for himself.  I
think he’s running to stay out of jail.   
   
What’s he got left?  Trump’s whole came down — come down to demonizing
immigrants, calling immigrants “animals,” saying they don’t have “good
genes,” saying they poison the blood of our country.  It’s sick.   
   
You know, it’s designed to prey on our worst fears.  It’s un-American. 
Think about it.   
   
Trump hides all his racism — or used to.  But now it’s just out front. 
He has the same ideas on race as the 1930s.  Trump’s ideas on the
economy are from the ‘20s.  Trump’s idea on women are from the ‘50s. 
And, folks, this is 2024.  We can’t go back.  (Applause.)   
   
AUDIENCE:  We’re not going back!  We’re not going back!  We’re not going
back!  
   
THE PRESIDENT: We’ve made too much progress.  We have to keep moving
forward.   
   
And, folks, for all the talk about issues and policies — it’s all
important, the real measure of a president is character, integrity,
judgment, temperament.  Because here’s what I can tell you: Every
president is confronted with crises no one saw coming.  And in that
moment, what matters about a president is the president.  Does he have
integ- — does she have integrity, a code of honor that they live by? 
What belief system guides their decisions?  How do they handle
pressure?  How do they respond when things don’t go their way?  Will
they uphold their oath and honor the Constitution?   
   
With Donald Trump, we know the answer.  Just ask yourself:  How did
Donald Trump handle COVID — the crisis when he saw it coming?   
   
How — we know from Bob Woodward’s book how Trump lacks character and
can’t be trusted.  Trump deliberately led the American people to believe
that it wasn’t a dangerous thing, COVID.  I remember how he told us to
inject bleach.  Remember that?  Bless me, Father.  
   
In the middle of the COVID crisis, this guy gave Putin — when it came
out recently, he gave Vladimir Putin te- — COVID tests that were
desperately needed by Americans and he — at home, and he gave it to
Putin.  Trump cares more about kissing up to Putin than he cares about
your sons and daughters.  (Applause.)   
   
You know, we lost over a million people in COVID.  Think about how many
we could have saved if it wasn’t for his pure incompetence and
selfishness.   
   
Think about the 2020 election Trump lost.  Kamala and I beat him by 7
million votes, but Trump couldn’t accept it, despite the rulings of more
than 60 courts, including the Supreme Court.   
   
He embraced the Big Lie that threatened the lives of elected officials
and poll workers.  He sent violent mobs to the U.S. Capitol on January
6th to stop a peaceful transfer of power.   
   
AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  He sat in the dining room over by — off of my present
office, the Oval Office, and did nothing for three hours as police were
being alack — attacked and killed, lawmakers were forced to hide for
their lives.  
   
According to the report, when Trump saw — told the mob was looking for
Mike Pence to hang him, you know what Trump’s response was?  “So
what?”  
   
AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Let me tell you something.  You can’t be
pro-insurrection and pro-American.  If you can’t denounce January 6th,
you have no business being president.  (Applause.)   
   
And, look, Trump hasn’t changed.  I would argue he’s gotten worse. 
Clearly, he lost the election in 2020.  He snapped.  No, I mean it. 
He’s become unhinged.  Look at his rallies.  
   
Last night — last night, his rally stopped taking questions because
someone got hurt, and guess what?  He stood on the stage for 30 minutes
and danced.  (Laughter.)  I’m serious.  What’s wrong with this guy? 
(Laughter.)   
   
Listen to him.  How he’s going to — after the institution of democracy,
if Trump is elected again, he says he’ll use the Justice Department to
attack his political enemies.  He says he’ll fire 500,000 civil servants
and replace them with Trump loyalists.   
   
AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  He just said he could use the U.S. military to go after
U.S. citizens he disagrees with.  He said it.   
   
He still refuses to accept the results of 2020, and he’s refusing to
accept the results of the 2024 election if he loses again.   
   
Look, folks, every generation faces a moment where democracy has to be
defended.  This is our moment.  I believe it in — I believe it in my
core.  (Applause.)   
   
When we beat Trump in 2020 — when we beat Trump in 2020, we saved
American democracy.  Now we have to do it again in 2024.  (Applause.)  
   
Folks, let me close with this.  More than anything in this election, we
have to decide who we want, what we want America to be.  Who is
America?   
   
Kamala will be a president who believes in the America that still stands
for the core proposition that stated in this — this nation — started
this nation right here in Philly — (applause) — where the Declaration of
Independence was signed, where the Constitution was written, and where
we determined the power of our institutions of government are determined
by the power of the people.  The power based — the very idea of America:
We’re all created equal, deserve to be treated equally throughout our
lives.   
   
We’ve never fully lived up for it, but, unlike Trump, we’ve never walked
away from it.  And I’ll be damned if we’ll walk away from it now. 
(Applause.)  
   
Folks, we got a lot of work to do, especially here in Pennsylvania,
especially in Philadelphia.  (Applause.)  How you go and what you turn
out is going to determine the outcome of this election.  (Applause.)   
   
We have to talk to our friends, our families, our neighbors, our
coworkers.  We have to beat back the lies with truth.  And most of all,
we have to vote and get out the vote.  (Applause.)  
   
Philadelphia, are you ready?  (Applause.)   
   
Well, let’s get this done, and let’s remember who we are.  (Applause.) 
We’re the United States of America.  (Applause.)  And nothing, nothing
is beyond our capacity when we work together.  (Applause.)  
   
God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops.  Thank you. 
(Applause.)  
   
Thank you.   
   
AUDIENCE:  Thank you, Joe!  Thank you, Joe!  Thank you, Joe!  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  By the way, I married a Philly girl.  (Applause.)
