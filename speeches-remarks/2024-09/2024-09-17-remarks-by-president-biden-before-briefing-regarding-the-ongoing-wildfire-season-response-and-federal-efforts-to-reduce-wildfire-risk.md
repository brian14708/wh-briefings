THE PRESIDENT:  Okay? 

I’m about to receive a briefing on everything we’re doing to support the
people and communities threatened by these horrific wildfires.  And
they’re — and they’re devastating.   
   
I — as I was saying to my staff before you came in, since I’ve been
president, I’ve flown over more of these wildfires — from Arizona to
Idaho and Montana and all that whole crescent — than makes up the entire
state of Maryland burned to the ground.   
   
And — and there’s a lot that has to be s- — we’re not going to be able
to speak to all of it tonight, but — today, but we’re going to talk a
little bit about California and — and what’s going on in Oregon as
well.  
   
Nationwide, nearly 37,000 — 37,000 wildfires burning over 7.3 million
acres, more land than some of the states that we occupy. 

In California, they have three major wildfires destroying homes and
displacing thousands of people — I mean, thousands of people.   
   
In Oregon, there’s nearly 1.8 million acres burned.  And it sounds like
it’s something good when you say it’s a record, but it’s a bad state
record.  It’s real.  
   
And my administration is working closely around the clock to control
these fires and protect our people, but it’s always a matter of
resources.  And I look forward to this briefing from key members of my
administration, who’ve been working like hell on this, and two frontline
governors.  
   
And, by the way, what I’d like to do is I’d like to make the — we’ve
raised the pay to $29 an hour.  I want to make that permanent for the
fire- — these firefighters.  Anyway.  
   
So, that’s what we’re going to be talking about, folks.  And thank you
for making the effort to come in.  Appreciate it.
