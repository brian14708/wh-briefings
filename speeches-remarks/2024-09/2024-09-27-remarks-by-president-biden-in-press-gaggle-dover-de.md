Q    Mr. President, did you — do you support Israel’s decision to try to
kill Nasrallah?

THE PRESIDENT:  We’re still gathering information.  I can tell you the
United States had no knowledge of or participation in the IDF action. 
We’re ga- — we’re gathering more information.  I’ll have more to say
when we have more information. 

Q    You say you support Israel’s decision —

THE PRESIDENT:  I — 

Q    — to defend itself.  Do you support what they did today with the
strikes in Beirut?

THE PRESIDENT:  We have to get more detail.  I don’t know enough to
answer that question.

Thank you.

Q    Are you worried about escalation?

Q    On U.S. Steel, sir.  On U.S. Steel.  The timeline has been pushed
back three months.  Some are interpreting that that you might changing
your mind about how you feel about that deal.  Do you have any comment
about how you feel about that deal?

THE PRESIDENT:  No, I don’t — I haven’t changed my mind.  (Inaudible.)

Q    Sir, how concerned are you about escalation right now in Lebanon?

THE PRESIDENT:  I’m always concerned about that.  I’m always concerned
about that.

Q    And your reading on the hurricane: How bad does it look down there
right now?

THE PRESIDENT:  It looks bad.  At least 25 people dead.  There’s still
rising waters.  We don’t have enough information yet.  There’s one dam
in North Carolina that’s also in question.
