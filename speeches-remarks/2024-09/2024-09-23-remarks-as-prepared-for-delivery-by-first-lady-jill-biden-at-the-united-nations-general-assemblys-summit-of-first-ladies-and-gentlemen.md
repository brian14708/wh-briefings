New York City, New York

Thank you, Ambassador.

I’m grateful for your leadership and tireless work.

It’s an honor to be here.

Mrs. Zelenska—Olena—when I found out that you were gathering this group
of leaders, including the incredible First Ladies here to my left, I
knew I had to show my support, even if briefly.

You and I met more than two years ago in Ukraine after Putin’s invasion.

We walked through a public school that had been converted into a
shelter—a place of learning forced to become a refuge from war.

I saw the tears of mothers, permanently brimming on the edges of their
eyes.

The slope of their shoulders.

The tension in their bodies.

The way they reached for their children’s hands or touched their hair as
if they couldn’t bear to lose connection, even for a moment.

The Ukrainian mothers I met are never far from my mind.

We continue to stand with them and with all the people of Ukraine.

The past several years have been a painful reminder that when children
are in danger anywhere in the world, they are more vulnerable
everywhere.

But the reverse is also true.

Seeing the plight of children at home helps us see the challenges that
children face across the world—and then we can share our resources and
solutions to make all of them safer.

As an educator, I know that when one student has a breakthrough, they
lift up the entire class.

I also know that when we support schools, we strengthen homes and
neighborhoods.

And defending our children today, allows us to fight for their future.

A future where they learn, play, and explore without fear, no matter
where they live.

Where they can build the promise of long, flourishing lives.

And where mothers can stand with clear eyes, shoulders at ease, trusting
that their beloved children will come back to them safe.

Mrs. Karis—Sirje—and Olena, I’m so grateful that you’ve brought us
together to lay the foundation for that future.

I know it will be stronger because of our partnerships.

Olena, we continue to admire your selfless courage.

Amid such suffering at home, it would have been enough for you to just
speak out for the people of Ukraine.

But you chose to look beyond your borders, calling on world leaders to
see our shared challenges with new clarity and boldness.

We’re here to offer our continued love and support to you.

We stand with Ukraine today and for the future.
