PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, Sheikh Mohamed, welcome back to Washington. 

PRESIDENT BIN ZAYED AL NAHYAN:  Thank you, sir.

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  You’ve been a good friend.  Our countries have — our
strategic partners have rooted in decades — literally decades of close
cooperation and friendship.  And I welcome the chance to open a new
chapter. 

We — UAE is a nation of trailblazers, always looking — always looking to
the future, always making big bets.  And that’s something our countries
have in common and our people have in common.

In fact, it’s a cornerstone of our growing cooperation in AI, in clean
energy, in space, and investing in infrastructure to connect regions. 
And for many years, our forces also stood shoulder to shoulder in the
same most difficult places.

Today, we honor that legacy and carry our relationship forward, as UAB —
UAE is going to become a major defense partner of the United States,
joining only one other country: India.

We also will discuss our efforts to end the war in Gaza and a number of
regional issues.  I’ve been briefed on the latest developments in Israel
and Lebanon.  My team is in constant contact with their counterparts,
and we’re working to de-escalate in a way that allows people to return
to their home safely. 

Mr. President, I want you to know that I remain committed to the UAE’s
security.  And I look forward to our discussion; it’s going to cover a
lot of areas. 

So, again, welcome.

PRESIDENT BIN ZAYED AL NAHYAN:  Thank you, Mr. President.

(As interpreted.)  Your Excellency, Mr. President, I am pleased to meet
with you once again, and I would like to thank you for the warm
reception.  And I look forward to continuously discussing our
relationship between the two nations. 

And I would like to reaffirm that the United Arab Emirates has a firm
and unwavering commitment to work with the United States of America for
the sake of deepening the strategic partnership between our two
nations. 

Once again, Your Excellency, Mr. President, I am pleased to meet you,
and I would like to extend to you and the American people the best of
wishes. 

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you.

Thank you, everyone.
