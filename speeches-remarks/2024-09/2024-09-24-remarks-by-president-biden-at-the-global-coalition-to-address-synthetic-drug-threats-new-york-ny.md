1:57 P.M. EDT  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  To all the — my fellow leaders from nations
around the world, thank you for being here.  It makes a big
difference.  
  
A couple of years ago, a father who I got to meet from a small town here
in the United States wrote me a letter about his daughter.  Her name was
Courtney.  She was bright and smart, she had a laugh that was
contagious, and wanted to travel the world.  But in high school, she
became addicted to pills.   
  
Her father eventually brought her to a treatment facility, but his
insurance company wouldn’t cover the cost.  They said, quote, “It wasn’t
a matter of life and death.”  
  
A month later, Courtney died from a fe- — fentanyl overdose.  She was
just 20 years old — 20 years old.   
  
In his letter that he wrote to me, he described life without his child. 
He said, and I quote, “There is no greater pain.”  “There is no greater
pain.”  
  
I told him I know what it’s like, having lost several children myself —
two children.  There is no greater pain.  They still live in your heart,
but there’s no greater pain.  
  
Ladies and gentlemen, that’s why we’re here.   
  
Too many people all across our nation have stories like this.  Too many
families have suffered unbearable pain and unbearable loss.   
  
Opioids are the deadliest drug threat in our history.  I’ve been working
on drug control for a long, long time — since the days I was a senator,
but this is the deadliest of them all.  
  
For years, too little has been done to beat this threat here at home and
around the world.   
  
In fact, before I came to office, overdose deaths in our country were
increasing by more than 30 percent year over year.   
  
But when I became president, I made beating the opioid <s>endemic</s>
\[epidemic\] a central part of the Unity Agenda, something that our
entire nation could rally around and has.   
  
For over the last four years, we’ve turned that agenda into action.  My
administration made Nal- — excuse me, Na- — made Naloxone, a lifesaving
overdose reversal medicine, available over the counter.  You can
purchase it over the counter for the first time.  We invested over $80
billion across 50 states to expand access to addiction treatment and
support.  I issued an executive order that cut cartel leaders off from
fina- — our financial system, including issuing 300 sanctions.  And I’ve
deployed hundreds of advanced X-ray ou- — machines to stop the threat of
pills and powder coming across our border.   
  
Because I want to be clear: This is — this is a national security
threat.   
  
In July of this year, I signed a national security memorandum.  It
officially recognized that fact, that it is a national security threat. 
It calls on every part of our government to do more to stop fentanyl and
protect our homeland from this threat.   
  
But as all of you know, this a global challenge and it requires a global
solutions.   
  
So, we established the Tri- — the Trilateral Fentanyl Committee with
Canada and Mexi- — and Mexico to stop narcotics from crossing our
border.   
  
I reignited counternarcotics cooperation with China to increase law
enforcement cooperation and tackle the supply chains of precursor
chemicals and pill presses.   
  
And I directed my team to build this coalition — this Global Coalition
to Address Synthetic Drugs.  As all of you here know, this coalition now
has, as the secretary of State said, 150 nations as part of it.

The result of these efforts: More fentanyl has been seized at our border
in the last two years than the previous five years combined — in the
previous five years combined.  Nearly 60,000 pounds of fentanyl have
been seized.  That’s enough to kill every single American many times
over.   
  
Dozens of major cartel leaders and traffickers are now behind bars.   
  
And I’m proud to announce, for the first time in five years, overdose
deaths are actually coming down across America.  The latest data shows a
10 percent drop.  That’s the largest decrease on record.   
  
Folks, this matters.  These aren’t just facts and figures.  They’re
families — families who don’t have to bear the loss of a child, a
parent, a spouse — families who are kept whole.   
  
But there are too many that are still dying.  There’s so much more that
needs to be done.

So, my message today is very simple: We can’t let up.  We cannot let
up.  
  
Drug manufacturers and cartels continue to adapt their practices,
develop new chemicals, move fast to evade our efforts.  We have to move
faster.  
  
They continue to exploit the global supply chains to expand their
networks.  We’ve got to cut them off.   
  
They continue to fuel violence, corruption, and instability.  We’ve got
to protect our people and our communities.   
  
So, that’s why I’m calling on every nation here to commit to our new
global coalition pledge.  This lays out the action we must all take to
seize more drugs, stop more cartels, save more lives.   
  
I also want to thank the leaders here who are stepping up and launching
a new initiatives today to advance coalition efforts all across three
key — key areas.  First, disrupting supply chain, including production
and distribution of illicit — of illicit drugs.  Secondly, detecting
emerging drug threats and increasing information sharing across all our
countries.  And thirdly, preventing more deaths by treating more people
through public health interventions, increased access to lifesaving
medications.  
  
It’s possible.  It’s about disrupt, detect, prevent, and treat.   
  
Together, we’re making it clear: Enough is enough is enough.   
  
Let me close with this.  As leaders, we all have one solemn
responsibility: protect our people from harm.   
  
Together, through this coalition, I believe we can do just that.  We can
disrupt the cycle of violence and instability that drug cr- —
traffickers create.  We can get our people the care they need and
deserve.  We can save lives, but only — but only if we come together and
work together.  The choice is ours.   
  
And I believe there can be only one answer: We can, we will, and we
must.   
  
So, thank you all for being here.  Let’s get to work.  
  
And I want to — you to hear from other leaders in this room as well.   
  
So, thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)
