The South Lawn

Welcome to the White House!

“Back to School” means different things, depending on who you ask.

For students, it’s about reuniting with friends after a summer apart,
learning new subjects, and trying out for sports teams.

For teachers like me, it means re-imagining our classrooms, and showing
students all that they can do.

For parents, it’s a huge sigh of relief—right?

I’ve also been thinking about what “Back to School” meant four years
ago.

The pandemic was still raging. And our schools were silent. Teachers had
to reach out to students through Zoom squares. Bus drivers dropped off
Wifi hot-spots to neighborhoods with no connection. Counselors took call
after call from parents in tears, just trying to juggle it all.

Our educators came to the rescue.

Thank you for being the heroes we needed.

As President, Joe has had your back and been your champion.

His Administration helped reopen our schools safely, made historic
investments in public schools, fixed student loan relief for public
servants. And Joe is fighting to make sure educators are paid what
you’re worth.

Since he took office, 30 states and Washington, D.C. have increased
teacher pay.

For my last “Back to School” season here at the White House, I wanted to
celebrate all of that progress.

Thank you to the President’s Own Marine Band for providing the
soundtrack for today’s festivities. I’m so grateful to you and your
families for your service to our nation—and so is your
Commander-in-Chief.

We also have several Teachers of the Year with us. I got to meet so many
of you at the first-ever State Dinner for Teachers of the Year a few
months ago. I am amazed by the love and care you pour into your students
and classrooms.

And it’s great to have Secretary Cardona here, along with his wife,
Marissa, who is also an educator. Secretary Cardona—Miguel—you spend
every day thinking about how to best support students, and lifting up
teachers and schools. Joe and I are grateful for your commitment to our
nation’s learners.

With each new school year, we stand on the precipice of possibility.

Teachers will broaden horizons from their classrooms, parents will see
how much their kids can grow and learn, students will let their
imaginations soar. And Joe and I will be cheering you on. 

But tonight, everybody remember: it’s not a school night.

So please have fun on the best lawn in America.
