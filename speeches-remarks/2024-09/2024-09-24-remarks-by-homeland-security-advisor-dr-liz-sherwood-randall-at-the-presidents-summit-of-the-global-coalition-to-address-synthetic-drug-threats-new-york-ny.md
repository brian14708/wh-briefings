Good afternoon.  I am Liz Sherwood-Randall, President Biden’s Homeland
Security Advisor.    
   
In closing, on behalf of the Biden-Harris Administration, I want to
thank each of you for joining us here today. In particular, I want to
express our gratitude to each of the Heads of State and Government and
your cabinet members who accepted President Biden’s invitation to
participate and make an enduring commitment to this vital endeavor.    
   
This is the first ever gathering on this scale of leaders from every
continent across the planet who are dedicated to the fight against
fentanyl and synthetic drugs.  And that reflects how seriously we take
the threat that it is creating in our respective homelands.  
   
As you may know, I have devoted much of my life to countering the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. I view fentanyl as a
weapon of mass destruction. The lessons from that enduring challenge are
directly relevant to the fight against illicit fentanyl and synthetic
drugs today.  
   
This is a global problem that requires a global solution.  None of us
can meet it effectively alone. We need to weave a strong and resilient
web of committed countries, and we need to work in close collaboration
with partners in international organizations and the private sector.
 That is the only way we can meet the moment.  And the moment is now. We
are in a fight to save lives.  
   
So I especially want to thank each of the Coalition Members whose
leaders have agreed to mobilize new initiatives to:   
   
*Disrupt *the supply chain for fentanyl and other illicit goods   
  
  
*Detect *emerging drug trends; and  
  
  
*Prevent and treat *those affected by this crisis, through increased
public health interventions and distribution of life-saving
medications.  
   
Because of the new initiatives, we will be doing even more than we have
already done to map and *disrupt* transit routes, establish early
warning systems to *detect* new drug trends before they reach crisis
levels, and *prevent* deaths by expanding treatment, training more
health care workers, and distributing life-saving medications.  
  
I urge each of you to participate in these accelerated efforts.  And I
also encourage each of you to sign on to the Member Pledge that we
shared with you. This pledge to take additional steps in each of our
countries reinforces our collective commitment to turn words into
concrete actions.  Together we can make a real difference in our
communities by disrupting drug traffickers and protecting our people
from harm.  
  
On behalf of President Biden, thank you again for joining us here in New
York today, and I look forward to our ongoing work together.
