Q    Mr. President, what do you say to Vladimir Putin’s threat of war?

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  I say to you: Be quiet until I speak.  Okay?  That’s
what I say.  Good idea?

Q    Well, what do you say to Vladimir Putin’s —

Q    Sir —

Q    — threat of war, sir?  It’s a serious threat.

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, I — well, I — you’ve got to be quiet, and I’m
going to make a statement here.  Okay?

All right.  Anyway. 

Mr. Prime Minister, welcome.  Welcome back to the White House. 

Often said there’s no issue of global consequence where the United
States and Great Britain can’t work together and haven’t worked
together.  And we’re going to discuss some of these things right now.

First, Ukraine.  I want to thank you for — for the U- — U- — UK’s
leadership on this front.  The United States is committed to standing
with you to help Ukraine as it defends against Russia’s onslaught and
aggression and clear that Putin will not — make it clear Putin will not
prevail in this war and the people of Ukraine will prevail.

Second, the Middle East. 

PRIME MINISTER STARMER:  Yeah.

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Today, we’ll discuss our work to secure a deal in the
Middle East to release the remaining hostages that are he- — being held
by Hamas, bring an immediate ceasefire, increase the flow of
humanitarian aid to Gaza.

And thirdly, we’re going to be talking about the Indo-Pacific.  No
region more important to our future.  And I’m so proud that under our
AUKUS partnership with Australia and with — with Australia the last
three years, we’ve made the region more free, open, and secure.

So, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you again for being here.  And I look
forward to our conversation.

PRIME MINISTER STARMER:  Mr. President, thank you very much for those
words.  Thank you for the invitation to be back here just two months
after our last meeting here.

And it’s really important to us — great allies, that special
relationship — to have this time to talk about the global issues you
have just identified, starting, of course, with Ukraine, where I think
the next few weeks and months could be crucial.  Very, very important
that we support Ukraine in this vital war of freedom.  And so, I look
forward to discussing that with you.

The Middle East, of course, again, vital over the coming weeks and
months.  And elsewhere in the world.

I think that, historically, we’ve shown the strength of our
relationship, that we are strategically aligned, we have common cause on
these global issues.  And therefore, it’s very important us — for us to
have this opportunity to talk them through, not just as a matter of
tactics but also the wider strategy that underpins them.

So, thank you for the invitation.  It’s very good to be here again.

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Good to have you back.

Q    What do you say to Vladimir Putin’s threat of war, Mr. President?

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  I don’t think much about V- — Vladimir Putin.

Q    Mr. — Mr. President —

Q    Do you take that threat seriously?

Q    — can you tell us, sir: How close are you to — to agreeing to have
missiles go into deeper Russia?  How close are you to that decision?

(Cross-talk.)

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  We’re going to discuss that now.

(Cross-talk.)  

(President Biden gives a thumbs up.)
