PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, General Secretary, it’s great to see you again,
have you here in the United States.  We appreciate it.

Is this simultaneous interpretation?

One year ago, in Hanoi, we began a new era of relations with Vietnam and
the United States, and we elevated our partnership to the highest level
as possible.  Since then, we’ve been — I’ve been very proud of the
progress we’ve made.

First of all, we made historic investments in semiconductors and supply
chains.  And I want to note this was made possible through our CHIPS and
Science Act here at home.

Second, we launched unprecedented cooperation on cybersecurity.

And third, we stood united building a more open and secure Indian Ocean
committed to freedom of navigation and the rule of law.

And finally, we continue our pathbreaking work to heal the wounds of
war.  I’m proud that we, the United States, have committed $215 million
to complete the detox — the tox- — the detox remediation, as well as —
as we have many more things to do as well.

Secretary General, as I — or General Secretary, I should say — I
suggested at the U.N. address, there’s nothing beyond our capacity when
we work together.  So, we welcome you all and looking forward to our
conversation.

The floor is yours.

GENERAL SECRETARY LÂM:  (As interpreted.)  It’s a great pleasure to meet
with you again, Mr. President.  Well, this is the third time we met.  As
the Vietnamese proverb says, “It feels like a destined encounter.”

First, on behalf of the party, the state, and people of Vietnam and the
family of the late General Secretary Nguyễn Phú Trọng, I wish to convey
our heartfelt gratitude to you, Mr. President, for your sincere
condolences on his passing and thank you for dispatching State Secretary
Antony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan to pay their
respects.

We deeply value the warm regards from the United States and from you
personally, President Biden, towards late General Secretary Nguyễn Phú
Trọng.  And even during his lifetime, the late general secretary often
spoke of you with fond memories and sincere appreciation.

His historic visit to the U.S. in 2015 followed by your visit to Vietnam
in September last year were historic milestones and have significantly
advanced the growth of the Vietnam-U.S. relations, resulting in a higher
level of the relations that we enjoy today.

We appreciate very much your liking towards Vietnam, and your historic
contributions have been pivotal in elevating our bilateral relations to
the comprehensive strategic partnership as we enjoy today. 

Thank you very much, once again, Mr. President.

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you.  And, again, welcome.  And welcome to all
of you. 

Thank you.
