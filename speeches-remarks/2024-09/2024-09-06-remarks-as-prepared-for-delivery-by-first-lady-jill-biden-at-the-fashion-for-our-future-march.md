The clothing we wear gives us the power to make a statement without
saying a word.

But this year, we must wear it, say it, march for it—and then do it:
Vote!

The first time I ever voted, I almost didn’t vote for my future husband.

It was the 70s, and I was a student at the University of Delaware.

And there was a genuine buzz on campus for this young candidate. His
name was Joe Biden. Everyone was voting for him.

But I wasn’t so sure.

You see, my parents were Republicans. Politics wasn’t any part of my
life.

But we were told that every vote mattered. We believed in making a
difference.

Joe won that election by only about 3,000 votes.

It could have easily gone the other way.

Years later, on a Saturday afternoon, I was asked on a date from out of
the blue.

At the time, I wore my hair down to the middle of my waist, and so did
most of the men I dated!

But that evening, a handsome young Senator showed up at my door.

I took one look at his perfect suit and his leather loafers and thought:
“Thank God it’s only one date.”

But then over dinner, I said to myself, “Thank God I voted for him!”

Now, your day might not start or stop with politics.

But elections are about much more.

They’re about the freedom for our children to learn without fear,
without hate, without gun violence.

This week, we saw yet another tragic school shooting. We all stand with
Georgia in sorrow and in prayer. But we also have to act. We cannot
accept these school shootings as a fact of life. We must ban assault
rifles.

And I know you care about the freedom to make your own choices. Be who
you are. Love who you love.

The freedom—your freedom—of creative expression.

These freedoms are at risk. Because of court decisions, book bans,
shrugs of apathy, when people forget the power in their vote.

So, let’s remember: Your next president will likely appoint new Supreme
Court Justices.

Your next senators will confirm them.

And our children and grandchildren will have to live with the
consequences.

But first, you get to decide.

Elections matter.

And I know this crowd is ready for the next one!

Thom, it’s always a good day when I get to share a stage with a fellow
Pennsylvanian. Time and time again, you bring new life into the styles
we take for granted. And now, you’re bringing new life into civic
engagement.

Aurora, when we met earlier this year, one word stayed with me long
after that night had faded: future. Because that’s what you help us see
with your unstoppable spirit—the same one you’re sharing with us today.
You have a way of calling on all of us to secure lasting change.

And Anna, no one has shaped this industry more than you. But you haven’t
stopped there. Now you’re shaping the world. The President and I value
your counsel and friendship. With all my heart, thank you for being such
a powerful force for good.

The fashion community always comes together when it matters most. 

When AIDS engulfed the industry, you raised awareness and money for
research. You did the same for breast cancer. As Thom reminded us just
now, fashion has always been for our future.

This much is clear: You walk the walk. And you’ve always done it
together.

That’s what we have to do again this Fall.

Vote!

Vote early.

Then help others do the same.

Post on social media. Call your friends across the country. And remind
everyone that we can vote our way toward a future where freedom really
does ring.

Thank you, and God bless you. Let’s get out the vote!
