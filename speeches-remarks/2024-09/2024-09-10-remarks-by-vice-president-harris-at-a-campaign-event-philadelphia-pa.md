VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Hey, Philly!  (Laughs.)  (Applause.)

All right, so you guys know how I am.  Okay.  Today was a good day.  We
got to work tomorrow.  (Laughs.)  (Applause.)

 We got 56 days to go.  We got a lot of work to do.  And let me just say
that I think we all know that tonight was a night that highlights
something that you all have been working so hard on.  We have folks here
who have been knocking on doors.  Well, you know.  (Applause.)

We — but we have a lot of work to do.  Okay?  And tonight, I think,
highlighted for the American people what’s at stake.  I started the
debate by talking about it and it became apparent, I think, throughout
those — that about an hour and a half that — (laughter) — look, this is
very much two different vision for our country: ours, which is a vision
for the future, and his, which is about the past and taking us
backward.  And as I said on the debate stage, we are not going back. 
(Applause.)

 We are not going back.  And so, we know what we’re fighting for.  We
know what we stand for.  And that’s why we know what we’re fighting
for.  We’re fighting for the dignity of all people.  We’re fighting for
the dignity of work.  We are fighting for middle-class families.  We are
fighting to uplift people, understanding the true measure of the
strength of a leader is not based on who you beat down, it’s based on
who you lift up.  (Applause.)

That’s what we stand for.

 And so, we’ve got some work to do because — listen, I — I think that we
think today was a good day, and it kind of was.  (Applause.)  But we
have 56 days to go.  And, guys, we’re still the underdogs in this race. 
It’s tight.

 We have got to win Pennsylvania.  (Applause.)  And we are going to
Pennsylvania.  (Applause.) 

 And it is because of you.  It is because of you, who have signed up,
who have volunteered.  You are organizing.  You’re helping us to email
and text and knock on doors and talk to your neighbors and your friends.

 And here’s the thing about the spirit of our campaign.  It is people
driven.  It is about the people.  It is about uplifting our country.

 This is a campaign born out of love of country.  We love our country. 
(Applause.)  We believe in who we are.  We believe in the American
people.

This is a campaign about bringing folks together, knowing the vast
majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. 
(Applause.)

 It is about inclusion, and it is not about division.  And it is not
about demeaning and name-calling.  It is about lifting folks up —
working folks, families, children, people who are just — not just trying
to get by but trying to get ahead.  That’s what we stand for. 
(Applause.)

So, let’s get out here for these next 56 days.  Hard work is good work. 
(Applause.)  And we will win.  We will win.  (Applause.)

     See you later.  (Applause.)
