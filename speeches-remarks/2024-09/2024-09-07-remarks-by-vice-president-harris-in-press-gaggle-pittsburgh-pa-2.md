Penzeys Spices  
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

Q    Madam Vice President, what do you think of the Cheneys’
endorsement, ma’am?  Liz Cheney and Dick Cheney have endorsed you.  What
do you think about that?

 THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I’m — I’m — actually, I’m honored to have their
endorsement.  And I think that what — they both, as leaders who are
well-respected, are making an important statement that it’s okay and —
if not important to put country above party.  And I’m honored to have
their support, and I think it’s an important statement right now. 

A lot of what I think is happening — and I was just talking with some
folks here in Pittsburgh about it — is that people are exhausted about
the division and — and the attempts to kind of divide us as Americans.

And them stepping up to make this public statement, I think, is
courageous, but also, for people like the folks I was just talking with,
it really reenforces for them that we love our country, and we have more
in common than what separates us.  So —

 Q    Are you — are you ready to debate Donald Trump?

 AIDE:  All right.  Thank you, press.

(Cross-talk.)

 Q    Are you ready to face Donald Trump this week?

  THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yes, I am.  Yes.

 Q    Best part of debate prep for you?  What’s your favorite part?

  THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Being at this spice store.  I finally got out of
the debate prep to look at these spices.  Best part of debate prep so
far.  (Laughs.)

 Q    But your main message to Trump in the debate.  What’s the one
thing you want to really get — get across to him?

 THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, there is a lot.  But look, it’s time to turn
the page on the divisiveness.  It’s time to bring our country together
to chart a new way forward.
