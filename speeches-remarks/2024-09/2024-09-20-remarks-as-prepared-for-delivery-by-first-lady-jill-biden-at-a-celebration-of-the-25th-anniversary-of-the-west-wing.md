The Rose Garden

“Tell her where you are.”

That was President Bartlet’s suggestion to Donna.

For the entire episode, Donna had been trying to find a way to recognize
her high school English teacher, Mrs. Morello—who went above and beyond
for her school in Wisconsin.

In the end, President Bartlet calls Donna into the Oval Office. Charlie
has Mrs. Morello on the phone. And Donna doesn’t know what to say.

“Tell her where you are.”

And Donna says: “Mrs. Morello, I’m in the Oval Office with the President
of the United States, and it’s because of you.”

Now, I teach writing at a community college not too far from here—so I
might be a little biased in bringing up this moment. And I want to thank
Aaron and everyone who contributed to that episode for that beautiful
tribute to educators everywhere.

We just came from the Oval.

Because even though Joe is away hosting the leaders of Australia, India,
and Japan in Delaware, he wanted to make sure President Bartlet and his
staff had a chance to see the Oval Office again.

I often talk to my students about the power of good storytelling—because
it can inspire and shape our world.

When *The West Wing* lights up our screens, every swell of the opening
theme, every fast talking, fast walking journey through seemingly
endless halls—every performance—changes how we see the public servants
behind these white walls, striving for a better tomorrow.

Thank you to Warner Brothers for making today possible.

And I’m glad to have so many wonderful members of Joe’s Cabinet joining
us.

I’m grateful to everyone on stage for taking the time to be here,
because your work inspired so many to step forward and serve our
country—maybe even some of the people here today: working in Congress,
at non-profits and on political campaigns, or at the White House.

That’s the power of storytelling—to inspire the Donnas and Charlies of
the world who know they have something to give to this country—and the
Mrs. Morellos, who may not serve in Washington, but change us for the
better all the same.

So anytime we begin to slip into cynicism or apathy—we just have to
remember Jed Bartlet’s White House. A place where there are big blocks
of cheese and everyone belongs.

Where you do good.

That’s the story *The West Wing* showed the nation: this family we
create here, dedicated to a purpose greater than any one of us.

I see it every day.

It’s something that’s close to my heart, because, with every new hire,
the Biden family grows too.

Yes, the work is hard and the days are long. Yes, there are times when
the weight of all we have before us can feel too heavy to carry. But
that’s where the heart lies, where the future is created, side by side
with our family of true believers—hope pushing us forward each step,
each day, until the world is as it ought to be.

Now, it’s my pleasure to introduce, President Bartlet—or as he’s
sometimes known, Martin Sheen.
