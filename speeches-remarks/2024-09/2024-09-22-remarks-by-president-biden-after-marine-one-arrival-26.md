South Lawn

THE PRESIDENT:  We had very successful meetings with the Quad in
Delaware.  Total unity.  We were all working together.  I feel good
about what we’re doing, and I think the other leaders do as well.

So, thank you for being here.

Q    Mr. President, are you worried about rising tensions in the Middle
East?

THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, I am.  But we’re going to do everything we can to
keep a wider war from breaking out.  And we’re still pushing hard. 

Thank you.

(Cross-talk.)

Q    Mr. President, how concerned are you about a shutdown?

THE PRESIDENT:  I’m not.

Q    Have you made a decision to allow Ukraine to use long-range
weapons?

THE PRESIDENT:  No. 

Q    Mr. President, any reaction to the Birmingham mass shooting?

THE PRESIDENT:  I just heard about it on the way down from the plane.  I
don’t have anything to report. 

Thank you.
