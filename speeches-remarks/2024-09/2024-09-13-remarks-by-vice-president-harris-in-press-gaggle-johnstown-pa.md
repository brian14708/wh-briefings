Q    Madam Vice President, how are you feeling about Pennsylvania?  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I am feeling very good about Pennsylvania because
there are a lot of people in Pennsylvania who deserve to be seen and
heard.  That’s why I’m here in Johnstown.  And I will be continuing to
travel around the state to make sure that I’m listening as much as we
are talking.  
  
And ultimately, I feel very strongly that — got to earn every vote, and
that means spending time with folks in the communities where they live. 
And — and so, that’s why I’m here.  And we’re going to be spending a lot
more time in Pennsylvania.  
  
Thank you.
