Q    Mr. President, what did you learn from your briefing today?  
  
Q    Mr. President, (inaudible) about whether you propose a final offer
to Israel and Hamas this week?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  It’s still being negotiated.  
  
Q    What parts are being negotiated?  
  
Q    What would you like to see Netanyahu do?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re in the middle of negotiations.  
  
Q    Can you explain why Netanyahu is not doing enough?  Can you explain
why you think Prime Minister Netanyahu is not doing enough to help the
hostages?  
  
Q    Netanyahu just gave a speech.  He was very defiant.  And he said
that he will stay in Philadelphi.  Will this halt the agreement?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  We’re still in negotiations — not with him — with my
colleagues from Qatar and from Egypt.
