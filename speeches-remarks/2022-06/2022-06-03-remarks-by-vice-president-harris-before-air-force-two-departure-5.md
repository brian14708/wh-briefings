title: "Remarks by Vice President Harris Before Air Force Two\_Departure"
---
 
*Reno-Tahoe International Airport  
*Reno, Nevada**

Q    Do you have any confidence Congress can get something real done on
guns?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I really hope and pray that they do.  And I have a
great deal of confidence in people like Chris Murphy.  And I know that —
that he is sincerely working at this in a bipartisan way, which is
really the only way we’re going to be able to get anything done.  
  
You know, I temper my optimism with, you know, knowing that when Sandy
Hook happened, nothing happened.  But, you know, I — I do believe that
people can learn, and I do believe that people can revisit an issue like
this and perhaps have a change of heart and mind.  So, I remain
optimistic.   
   
So, thank you.
