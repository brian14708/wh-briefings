THE PRESIDENT:  Those who know me and know my family — the story of my
granddaughter — hearing that was worth the trip.  (Laughter.)     
   
Look, you know, one of the things that I’ve found is that you never
quite know exactly what’s going to happen, but — in public life.  But,
folks, we really are — I’m tired — you’re probably tired of hearing me
say it because I’ve said it all during the campaign — and, Jeffrey,
you’ve heard me say it — we’re at a real inflection point in our
history, and we’re at an inflection point in world history.   
   
So much is changing regardless of what we do and regardless of what
anybody says.  The change is going to be amazing.  You’re going to see
more change — good and bad — in the next 10 years than you saw in the
last 35 years.  It’s a different world.  It really is a different
world.   
   
And one of the things that I have tried to do from the outset is what
the — the world is looking for reassurance.  I mean, the world was
looking for reassurance that America is back, and America is not what it
was the previous four years.  And that’s not a joke.  That’s not a
joke.   
   
I’ve been all over the world now.  And I’ve probably spent more time
abroad than I’ve wanted to, but I’ve had no choice.  I spent an
incredible amount of time in the — in the Indian-Pacific region — the
Indian Ocean and the — and the — I’ve spent a lot of time in the western
— in the — out west, in the Pacific.  I spent a lot of time in — I spent
probably — I spent well over 150 hours just dealing with nothing but —
just nothing but NATO and Ukraine.  Just because one of the things that
people around the world are worried about is can every- — can we hold us
all together with things changing so rapidly that they’re going to —
that we can’t hold it together.   
   
And so one of the things that Putin was counting on, and I was — I had
just been in Geneva with him.  We were setting up a conference on
security that we were going to allegedly get underway, dealing with
nuclear weapons and space and another — when he went into — when he went
into Ukraine.  
   
And, folks, nothing like this has happened since World War Two.  I know
a lot of people thought I was maybe exaggerating, but I knew — and we
had data to sustain — he was going to go in, off the border.  There was
no doubt.  And Zelenskyy didn’t want to hear it, nor did a lot of
people.  Understanding why they didn’t want to hear it.  But he went
in.   
   
And what he’s trying to do — he’s trying to obliterate the culture, not
just the — not just take the nation, but of the culture — the Ukrainian
culture — because he doesn’t there’s such an independent thing as
“Ukrainian culture.”  He thinks that Kyiv is the mother — is a seed of
Mother Russia and all is going to change.   
   
But, you know, what we’re doing is — the hardest thing to do has been —
initially, is to keep the West together.  Keep everybody on the same
page.   
   
I went to the first G7 — the largest economies in the world — meeting in
England right after we were elected.  And I sat down, and I said,
“America is back.”  And —  
   
Is the press here?  
   
PARTICIPANT:  Yes.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, well, I’m not going to say what I’m going to say
in front of the press here — (laughter) — because I never quite know
what they’re going to say.   
   
But I said, “America is back.”  And two of the leaders said — looked at
me and said, “For how long?”  “For how long?”   
   
I just spent — and not by — the press will probably not say it, but I
wish they’d go back and interview all the heads of state in the Latin
American conference we — the American conference we just had.  And there
was overwhelming — overwhelming support for what we were trying to do by
holding all the hemisphere together.   
   
There’s no reason why this hemisphere can’t be the most democratic, the
most middle class, and the most secure hemisphere in the world.  Not a
joke.  No reason for it.   
   
And so, the point I’m making is: The first part of all this is to make
sure we’re in a position that we were able to sustain, in the minds of
the rest of the world, that America is back with the basic values we’ve
always shared.   
   
But the point of the matter is that that’s not what the world is — the
world is not so sure about that.   
   
And we have a lot to — a lot to discuss.  So, are we going to get into
questions and answers and — why don’t I just do that?   
   
Is the press staying for that?  
   
PARTICIPANT:  No.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, good.  Nice seeing you all.  (Laughter.)  Great
being with you.  Been great being with you.  (Laughter.)
