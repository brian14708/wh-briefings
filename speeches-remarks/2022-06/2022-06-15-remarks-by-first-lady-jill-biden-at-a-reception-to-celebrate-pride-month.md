East Room | The White House 

4:21 P.M. EDT

              THE FIRST LADY:  Thank you, everyone.  Finally!  Finally,
we’re all back at the White House together, and doesn’t this feel
great?  (Applause.)  
  
Kamala, Doug, Joe, and I are honored to welcome you to this year’s White
House Pride celebration.  And, truly, it’s so wonderful — wonderful to
be with so many friends.  
  
You know, early in the campaign, Doug, Chasten, and I had the chance to
come together for a Pride event.  Do you remember that?

     THE SECOND GENTLEMAN:  I do.  (Laughter.)

     THE FIRST LADY:  Yes!

     THE SECOND GENTLEMAN:  It was in Las Vegas.  I remember. 
(Laughter.)  
  
     THE FIRST LADY:  So, it was late on a warm October night in Las
Vegas.  And we were all candidates’ spouses at the time, but there was
an energy in the air that brought us all together, and we had the chance
to get to know one another.  And we made a promise then that our next
Pride celebration would be on the South Lawn of the White House. 
(Applause.)  
  
And now, here we are once again, but it was just a little too hot and
humid out there — (laughter) — to be on the lawn.   
  
So, every year that we gather here in our nation’s capital is a reminder
of just how far we’ve come.  That we have LGBTQ leaders at some of the
highest levels of our government.  (Applause.)  That we can gather to
celebrate all of you.  That your President and I are proud to stand with
you and fight beside you.  
  
But we know that this progress hasn’t reached everyone in the same
way.  
  
We know that in places across the country — like Florida, Texas, or
Alabama — rights are under attack.  And we know that in small towns and
big cities, prejudice and discrimination still lurk.  
  
It shouldn’t take courage to be yourself.  It shouldn’t take courage to
go to school and walk down the halls as the person you know you are.  
  
It shouldn’t take courage to hold the hand of the person you love on a
bus, to kiss them goodbye on the sidewalk, to share one of the most
fundamental and beautiful connections that any one of us can have in
this life.  
  
It shouldn’t but, too often and in too many places, it still does.  
  
And in some way, all of you here today have called on that courage.  And
you’ve used your voice to say: We will not go back.  (Applause.)  We
will not let the progress that we’ve fought for slip away.  
  
Pride is a celebration of the courage it takes to stand up for what’s
right, to become the leaders we need, to live an authentic life.

     We recognize it as an act of bravery and beauty, of daring and
defiance.  And we look forward to a time when that courage is no longer
needed, when all people in all places can feel the freedom and the joy
that we feel here today.  
  
What Joe said 10 years ago was right: Love is love.  (Applause.)  
  
Joe — Joe and I are grateful for all of you, and we will never stop
working for that future.  
  
So, now, I’m so proud to introduce our next speaker.  
  
I’m always impressed when young people are brave enough to come to the
White House and speak in front of so many leaders.  (Laughter.)  But
after organizing a walk-out at his high school to protest the “Don’t Say
Gay” bill; leading a rally of his peers — (applause); and publicly
sharing his own story, I’m pretty sure that speaking at today’s
celebration is nothing he can’t handle.  (Laughter.)  
  
Please welcome Javier Gomez!
