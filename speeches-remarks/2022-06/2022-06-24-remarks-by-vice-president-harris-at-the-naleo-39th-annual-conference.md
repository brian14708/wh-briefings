*Swissotel  
*Chicago, Illinois**

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, NALEO!  Good afternoon. 
(Applause.)   Have a seat.  Have a seat.  Good afternoon.  
   
Oh, it’s so good to — look at this wonderful, big crowd.  It’s so good
to be back together under the same roof, isn’t it?  Yeah, it’s good to
see everyone.   
   
And I hope we all walk away from days like this and moments like this
when we go back to the places where we work every day, often being one
of the only like us in a room or who has had the life experience we’ve
had — I think these are moments that are very important to remember that
we are not alone.  There are all of us who are in these rooms together,
even if we don’t see each other at a particular moment.  So, it’s a good
time to be together.  So, thank you all.  (Applause.)   
   
And I want to thank Ricardo and Mara for that kind introduction and for
your leadership of this organization during an unprecedented time during
these years of the pandemic and so many crises that we have been facing
as a country.  
   
And, of course, I am honored to be here with the board of directors of
NALEO and so many of our nation’s leaders.  
   
Before I start speaking as I planned to speak, I do want to speak
briefly about the decision from today’s United States Supreme Court
decision in the Dobbs case.    
   
Here is what I believe that decision means: For nearly 50 years, we have
talked about what Roe v. Wade protects.  Today, as of right now, as of
this very minute, we can only talk about what Roe v. Wade protected. 
Past tense.   
   
The great aspiration of our nation has been to expand freedom.  It is
something so many of us has spent our careers fighting for.  But the
expansion of freedom clearly is not inevitable, and it certainly is not
something that just happens — not unless we defend our most fundamental
principles.   
   
The strength of our nation has always been that, despite the odds and
the obstacles, we push to move forward; that we are guided by what we
see that can be, unburdened by what has been.  And I know everyone in
this room understands this and has, in many ways, lived a life that
illustrates this.   
   
And so, because, of course, NALEO has been fighting to move our nation
forward for nearly 50 years on other critical issues and the issues that
fundamentally are about the ideals and aspirations of our nation, I am
honored to be with you here today.   
   
And I also want you to know that I bring you greetings from President
Joe Biden — because we are grateful, yes.  (Applause.)  We are grateful
for the work of this organization and its members to galvanize policy
members and leaders, to mobilize, to organize, and to do that work on
behalf of the Latino community and, by extension, the entire nation —
all of that work being in pursuit of progress and our collective ability
for our nation to achieve its ideals.  So, I thank you all.  
   
I have always felt a special connection to this organization, as Ricardo
said.  And, yes, as a proud daughter of California — (laughs) —
(applause) — many of us the daughters and sons of California — I am
proud that NALEO, of course, was founded by a great Californian, Edward
Roybal.  And we must always remember him.  (Applause.)   
   
And throughout my career, I have worked alongside many of the leaders of
this organization, including, of course, our collective friend and my
dear friend, now-Senator Alex Padilla, who served — (applause) — yes, he
and I served together many years.  I was mostly based in the Bay Area. 
He was in Los Angeles.  But then, as we were coming up, we both ended up
as state constitutional officers when he was Secretary of State and I
was Attorney General of California.   
   
And I partnered with so many of NALEO members on so many issues that
range from supporting small businesses, to immigration reform, to voting
rights, education, and so many more issues.  
   
And over the years, as Ricardo said, I have spoken with this
organization many times.  But I am honored that this is the first time
that I, in person, am speaking with you as Vice President of the United
States.  (Applause.)   
   
So, I believe — in fact, I know — there is a common characteristic among
us all: We all serve because we believe in the magnificence of our
nation and its potential.  We all believe in fighting to achieve our
nation’s highest ideals, knowing, as I said earlier, they don’t just
happen.  We don’t just achieve them by being, we achieve them by being
committed to reaching those ideals.  
   
We all believe in a future where the promise of liberty and justice is
made real for all Americans.  We believe in a future where hard work
pays off, where families can get ahead and stay ahead.  We believe in a
future where every child can reach their God-given potential.  
   
We believe that all communities have a right to be safe and healthy.   
   
And we believe that anyone should be able to have a dream and achieve
that dream — a future where immigrants have the opportunity to have what
they deserve in terms of a pathway towards citizenship.   
   
We believe in a nation and in a future where protecting the freedom to
vote is not a partisan issue.   
   
We believe that women should be able to make decisions about their own
bodies without government interference.  (Applause.)  
   
And so, you know, when the President and I took office, our country, as
we all remember, was headed in the wrong direction.  Just think: We were
facing a pandemic that was out of control.  We had a situation that, in
that pandemic, it’s important to note, it was particularly devastating
in terms of its impact on the Latino community, especially among those
who were frontline workers and essential workers and farmworkers, so
many of whom were, in terms of the essential workers, DREAMers.  We
remember how folks risked their own health and the health of their
families to keep safe communities and to keep our country running.  
   
Remember, our nation also faced — and we can talk about current day as
well — but then, in particular, we faced a historic economic challenge
as a result of the pandemic.  
   
But together with you, the President and I were not deterred.  With your
partnership — remember — it was a difficult road but we got folks
vaccinated.  We reopened our schools and kept people in their homes.   
   
Together, because of our collective work, we achieved record job
creation, record labor participation, and the largest single-year drop
in Latino unemployment in recorded history.  (Applause.)  
   
In addition, we have assembled the most diverse administration in the
history of our country.  And I should note, we have appointed the most
Latino leaders ever to Cabinet-level position.  (Applause.)  
   
In addition, we expanded the Child Tax Credit, such that so many
children — and in particular, the Latino child poverty rate hit a new
record low last year.   
   
Because of the once-in-a-generation Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we
lowered the cost of high-speed Internet for nearly 40 percent of
households in America.   
   
Because we invested in small businesses, business owners across the
country kept their doors open and Latino entrepreneurs started new
companies at a higher rate last year than at any other point in the last
decade.  
   
In fact, just recently I was in Monrovia, California — many of the
Californians know where that is.  (Applause.)  California.  (Laughter.) 
Just joking.  I got jokes, okay.  (Laughter.)  
   
So, I was there in Monrovia, and I was visiting this incredible small
business — it’s a woman small-business owner, and it was — the business
is called Dream Big Children’s Center.  And its owner, her name is
Cristina Cordeiro.  We talked for quite some time.  Her mother was
there.  And we talked about her inspiration, which is her mother was a
great caregiver.  Right?  She grew in a community where we care about
the children.  
   
And so, she created this business that parents would rely on to provide
daily therapy to children with special needs.  And if you can imagine,
this — especially during the pandemic, for all of us who have children
in our lives — it was incredibly critical, especially during those many,
many months of the pandemic, that we would have access to the needs of
services for our children.  So, it was very critical that she stayed
open during the pandemic.  
   
Fortunately, because of funding she received through our
administration’s American Rescue Plan, she was not only able to continue
providing services in her community, but she was able to grow her
business.  And since the start of the pandemic, she has opened 50 — or
two new locations with 50 new employees.   
   
And I mention that because, during the course of the last couple of
years — and in particular in the last year and half after we passed,
together with your help, the ARP — I’ve met so many small-business
owners who have seen success — and the kind of success that I know NALEO
and this organization and its members have been fighting for,
understanding that so much of the economic health and vitality of our
communities has been centered in the small businesses, in men and women
who are invested in their community; who understand the community — the
language of the community, the culture of the community, the needs of
the community — and are, therefore, best suited to actually uplift the
community economically and in every other way.  
   
And together, because of the work that we have done, in particular with
the ARP, we’ve been able to do that and we’re seeing results.  
   
And so, whether it is my work in the United States Senate or the work
that we did, in terms of in the Senate, helping small businesses access
capital, or the partnership, together, that we had to get the Restaurant
Revitalization Fund included in the ARP, we are seeing that small
businesses are starting to thrive in our country, and with a particular
emphasis on women- and minority-owned small businesses.  
   
So, I want to thank you all for the work you’ve done in that regard as
well.  (Applause.)  
   
So with that being said, we also know that people are still hurting. 
There is no question that we still face a number of serious challenges. 
And today then, I’d like to talk about three of the issues which I
believe are among the priorities of us in this room: one, lowering costs
for families, building a fair and humane immigration system, and
protecting people from gun violence.    
   
So, first, I think we all agree and know inflation is still too high. 
We are seeing higher prices at the store because supply chains slowed
down dramatically during the pandemic and higher prices at the gas pump,
in large part because of Putin’s unprovoked war in Ukraine.  And
families across our nation, in particular working families, are feeling
the effect.    
   
I know you know the President and I are using every tool at our disposal
to lower costs, including the cost of gas, childcare, eldercare, and
prescription drugs like insulin — which we should be capping, by the
way, at $35 a month.  (Applause.)  
   
And as leaders of the communities that you represent, you know that
these are some of the costs that most matter to the families of our
communities.  And we know that making essential needs more affordable
will keep our country on a path to stable and steady growth.  
   
So, there is work that we still have to do.  But as we are looking at
these issues, as we discuss the issue of inflation, let us agree that we
cannot abandon our commitment to supporting families on the issue of
childcare, on the issue of eldercare, on the issue of the cost of
prescription drugs.  Because these are costs that are, without any
question, also weighing down the ability of families to succeed and
thrive.  And in large part, a lot of these issues are incumbent on
elected leaders to solve, and they have the ability to solve.  
   
Speaking of, let’s talk about the second issue: immigration.  There’s
still so much work to be done on that.  We have partnered, so many of
us, over the years to fight to fix our country’s broken immigration
system and, in particular, to fight for our Dreamers.   
   
When I was Attorney General of California, you probably remember that
we, together, fought in the courts and spoke out when they ruled against
DACA and DAPA.  When I was in the United States Senate, we worked
together on legislation that would create a pathway to citizenship.   
   
And today, our administration continues to urge Congress to create a
pathway not only for DREAMers, but also for individuals with temporary
protected status and for farmworkers.  In fact, when I was in the
Senate, I was proud to sponsor the Farm Worker Bill of Rights.  We —
(applause) — thank you.  
   
And so we issued a proposed rule that would preserve and fortify DACA. 
Our administration and the Department of Justice continues to defend
DACA in the courts.  In fact, just last week, on the 10th anniversary of
DACA, I was again reminded of why we have to continue the fight.  I
invited a group of DREAMers to come in and — and they came into the
White House, to my West Wing office, and each of them was so committed
to paying forward the opportunity that they received and the opportunity
that they know that folks who are entitled to receive.  One of the
DREAMers became a kindergarten teacher after college.  And today he is
organizing a diverse coalition in support of a pathway towards
citizenship.  
   
And I don’t need to tell anybody here: DREAMers are serving in our
military, they are attending college, they are working in Fortune 100
companies.  I mentioned the number who were frontline workers who were
sacrificing so much of their own lives and service to their community
and perfect strangers.  
   
And it is a tragedy that we can’t pull this together as a nation and
pass legislation, creating a legal pathway for them, for farmworkers,
for TPS, and understanding what this means to families every day.   
   
We — you know, it’s not on the front page of the newspaper, necessarily,
but it’s real; I don’t have to tell anybody here.  
   
These kids, their parents, so many blended families, mixed families,
still every day are in fear about a knock at a door and what that might
mean, whether a parent might come home at night.  
   
And I don’t need to tell anybody here this, because most of us are in
the same situation: We are a nation of immigrants. Raise your hand if
you have a parent that was not born in the United States — this room of
leaders.  (Applause.)  
   
So, as do we, these young people represent the promise of who we are as
a country.  You know, I said to one of them — I said to one of the young
leaders that were there that day, and I said, “You know, my mother came
to the United States…” — and we’re in my West Wing office in the White
House, and I looked at — I looked at him and I said, “You know, my
mother came to the United States from India when she was 19 years old. 
And I’m Vice President of the United States.”  (Applause.)  And he broke
out in a big smile.  He said, “Okay, I got it.  I understand.”  
   
So, all of that to say that we have to keep fighting on this issue.  
   
The third issue that I know is our nation’s highest priority — one of
them — is our responsibility to create safe communities and protect
people from gun violence.   
   
What happened in Uvalde broke the hearts of our entire country.  We were
all shaken to our core by the massacre of those 19 children — those
babies — and their two teachers.  And we, of course, still remember and
mourn the 23 lives senselessly taken by a white nationalist in El Paso
three years ago.   
   
And our hearts are heavy when news breaks about similar vicious, hateful
attacks at a grocery store in Buffalo, a synagogue in Pittsburgh, or a
nightclub in Orlando.  
   
And, of course, there’s a through-line between these tragedies: an
epidemic of hate that touches us all.  And, I believe, to combat hate we
must speak truth about what fuels these attacks, and we must have the
courage to take action that will save lives.  
   
I think many of us agree that our country needs sensible gun safety
laws; that yesterday’s Supreme Court decision, which struck down one of
those laws, defies common sense and defies the Constitution.  And we
must protect people from the gun violence that claims countless lives
every day in America, which is why the bipartisan gun safety bill that
is on the way to the President’s desk is an important and necessary
step.  
   
But we cannot stop.  We cannot stop here, and we must continue to do
more.  Because, I mean, let’s be — let’s be real: No 9-year-old should
be scared to go to school.  No 15-year-old should fear shopping for
school supplies.  No 25-year-old should be scared to go with friends to
a nightclub.  And no 86-year-old should be afraid to shop for
groceries.  And no 18-year-old should be able to buy a weapon of war. 
(Applause.)  
   
So, I’ll end with this point: If there is one belief that I know
everyone in this room shares it is our belief in the potential, in the
promise, and the strength of our nation.   
   
We all choose to serve because we know our country is strong enough to
overcome the challenges we face, because we believe it is our duty as
public officials to work together in pursuit of progress.  
   
So let us always remember and let us remind others that we all have so
much more in common than what separates us.  And let us renew then our
commitment to fight for unity, especially in these days.   
   
Let us continue — and NALEO has done this so well over so many years —
to understand the power and the beauty of building and reinforcing
coalitions based on knowing how much we all have in common.  Because I
believe that the only way to tackle the biggest problems, the biggest
challenges that we as a nation face is to tackle them together.  
   
And NALEO, of course, knows this more than most — because, again, you
have been bringing folks together for nearly 50 years.  And in those 50
years, you have used your collective voice to advocate for more equity,
more opportunity, and more possibility for all communities.  
   
So with that, I am here to say the President and I are with you.  We
stand with you every step of the way.  God bless you, and God bless the
United States of America.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  
   
END
