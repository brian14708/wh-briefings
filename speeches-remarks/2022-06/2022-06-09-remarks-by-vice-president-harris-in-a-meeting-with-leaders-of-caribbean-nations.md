THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, everyone.  I — it is good to see
all of you again.  We met virtually just a few weeks ago, and I’m
looking forward to the conversation that we will have — a continuing
conversation about the work we will do together, our partnership, and
the commitments that we are prepared to make with each other around the
issues that challenge us, but also the opportunities that are
presented.  
   
As neighbors in the Western Hemisphere, the United States shares common
bonds and interests with Caribbean nations.  As I said when we convened
six weeks ago, our partnership is key to our shared prosperity and
security.  
   
Today, our main focus will be the climate crisis, which, of course, is
an existential crisis for our entire planet, and the Caribbean is on the
front line of this crisis.  
   
In our last meeting, we discussed your priorities as it relates to this
issue and many others.  And I indicated that the United States would
look into these issues and work with you as we seek to resolve the
challenges that each of our nations are presented with.  And I committed
that we would develop a plan.  
   
Today, I’m pleased to announce the launch of the United States-Caribbean
Partnership to Address the Climate Crisis, also known as PACC — P-A-C-C
— 2030.  PACC 2030 is the United States government’s primary mechanism
for addressing energy security and the climate crisis in this region.  
   
Through this partnership, we will support energy infrastructure and
climate resilience projects at every stage of development, from
beginning to end, in four particular ways.  
   
First, we will work with you to identify new clean energy projects.  
   
Second, we will provide technical assistance to make sure these projects
are viable and appealing not only to you, but to investors.  We will
bring them — investors — to the Caribbean on, essentially, roadshows to
showcase the projects.  
   
And fourth and finally, we will improve access — and importantly — we
will improve access to development financing, which will make these
projects a reality.  We will engage with the private sector at every
stage of this work because, of course, their involvement is essential to
making this productive and meaningful.  
   
When we accelerate the transition to clean energy, I think we all
believe that we unlock great economic opportunities for the entire
region.  
   
When we work together to address this urgent threat, it benefits the
people of the United States and the people of the Caribbean.  And all of
us, of course, benefit by reducing emissions.  
   
In conclusion, strengthening the U.S.-Caribbean relationship is a
priority for me.  
   
And regarding the climate crisis, it is one of our highest priorities. 
But there are other issues that are also very important that we can and
must address together.  
   
I want to thank all of the leaders for being here.  Again, welcome to
Los Angeles, to California.  And I look forward to a meaningful
conversation and a productive conversation — meaning that out of our
conversations thus far, we have actually taken action.  And I look
forward to continuing to do just that.  
   
And with that, I now invite Dr. Carla Barnett, the Secretary General of
the Caribbean Community, also known as CARICOM, to share a few words.
