*Community Empowerment Association  
*Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania**

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, let me just start by saying thank you all for
the — for this meeting and for this conversation.   
   
Secretary Fudge and I have been — together with Administrator Regan from
the EPA — have been working on this issue for quite some time, thinking
about it deeply in terms of the significance and the seriousness of it
and the impact in terms of what we’re doing to fix it.   
   
In fact, the Administrator and I have been on what we call a roadshow —
(laughter) — going around the country, talking about lead pipes.   
   
And so, it’s good to be back in Pittsburgh.  And it’s good to be back
with you, as leaders, to think about how we can continue to get the word
out about the rights that people in the community have to expect this is
going to be handled with a sense of urgency, with a sense of speed, and
also to talk about why it is important in terms of —  
   
You know, there are, I think, three principles at play, really.  You
know, there’s the piece that is about equity — right? — which is
literally different communities are — are dealing with this differently
based on what resources they have.  And that shouldn’t be the case.   
   
It’s an issue that is obviously about public health, in terms of the
harm.   
   
And then there’s the issue, because of the harm that is — that makes it
an issue, that’s also about education, meaning: Can our babies learn if
they’re drinking toxic water?  Right?  
   
So that’s why they’re here: to have this conversation with you and — and
to highlight the work that that the Secretary and the Administrator are
doing through the agencies and on behalf of our administration to
finally deal with this issue in a substantial way and see it through in
terms of what we know can be done when we prioritize it.  
   
So, with that, I thank you all.  And we’ll begin our discussion now.
