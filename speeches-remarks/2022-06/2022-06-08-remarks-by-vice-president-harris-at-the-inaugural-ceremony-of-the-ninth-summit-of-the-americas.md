5:36 P.M. PDT  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good evening.  Good evening.  Good evening. 
(Applause.)  Well, I know our future is bright when I look at these
young leaders.  
   
Governor Gavin Newsom, thank you for that introduction.   
   
It is, of course, so good to be back in my home state of California. 
(Applause.)  
   
And to everyone here, on behalf of our administration, it is my honor to
officially welcome you to the ninth Summit of the Americas. 
(Applause.)  
   
And, of course, we are here together with world leaders; local elected
officials, including our host city Mayor Garcetti; business and civil
society leaders; and, of course, the President of the United States, Joe
Biden.  (Applause.)  
      
As many of you may know, I am a proud daughter of California.  I
represented this state as Attorney General and as a United States
Senator.  And I am proud to call Los Angeles my home.   
   
As Vice President, I am pleased to acknowledge, as the Governor
mentioned, California is a place where ambitions and dreams become
reality.  
    
And so, we all gather in Los Angeles this week for the Summit of the
Americas with big ambitions — ambitions that began 28 years ago in Miami
at the first-ever Summit of the Americas, when our nations, together,
set the Western Hemisphere on a new path — a path to grow our economies
and improve the lives of our people.    
   
And together, we have made progress on this path — a path that I believe
is critically important for so many of us and, I will speak, important
for the American people, because the Western Hemisphere directly affects
the security and prosperity of the United States.  
   
And so, this week, we gather once more to build a more prosperous and
inclusive future.     
   
I look out at this room, and I see representatives of so many different
countries and communities.   
   
We are joined, of course, by heads of state, and we are joined by youth
leaders.  We are joined by CEOs, and we are joined labor organizers,
women entrepreneurs, activists, and advocates.  
   
So here’s how I see it: To realize a more prosperous future for our
hemisphere, partnerships between those assembled here are essential.  
   
It is in this spirit that I have focused on bringing companies and
organizations together to collaborate and coordinate and share lessons
learned, and to galvanize billions of dollars in new investments.  
   
The challenges facing our hemisphere in the months and years ahead are
significant: the climate crisis, food insecurity, economic inequality,
corruption, and gender-based violence.   
   
When I think about these challenges, I know and I am certain they will
require new and innovative coalitions to solve, which is why President
Joe Biden and I see this week as an opportunity for all of us — an
opportunity to launch new initiatives, to begin new conversations, and
to build new partnerships.  
   
So let us enjoy this evening and to also commit ourselves to taking
advantage of this time that we spend together under the same roof.  At
this convening, let us build a more prosperous and inclusive future for
the entire Western Hemisphere.  
   
Thank you and welcome.  (Applause.)
