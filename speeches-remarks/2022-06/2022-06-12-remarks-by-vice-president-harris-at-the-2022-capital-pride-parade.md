THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Happy Pride, everyone!  (Applause.)  Oh, what a
glorious day. 

Listen, we have so much to celebrate, and we celebrate each other every
day.  We celebrate the progress we have made.  And we celebrate the fact
that we are in this to stand for what we stand for and fight for what we
stand for.  (Applause.)  Because no one should fear going to a nightclub
for fear that a terrorist might try to take them down.  (Applause.)  No
one should fear going to a Pride celebration because of a white
supremacist.  (Applause.)  No one should fear loving who they love. 
(Applause.) 

Our children in Texas and Florida should not fear who they are. 
(Applause.)  Black and brown and women of color, transgender women
should not fear for their lives.  (Applause.) We should not have to be
dealing with 300 laws in states around our country that are attacking
our LGBTQ+ brothers and sisters.  (Applause.)

So we know what we stand for and, therefore, we know what we will fight
for.  (Applause.)  And we will do what we have always done in this
movement, in this community, which is, collectively, we will continue to
build unity.  We will continue to build coalition.  We will always be
fueled by knowing we have so much more in common than what separates
us.  We will be fueled by saying, “No one should be made to fight
alone.”  We will be fueled by knowing we are all in this together. 
(Applause.)  And we will fight with pride.  (Applause.)

Happy Pride, everyone.  Happy Pride.
