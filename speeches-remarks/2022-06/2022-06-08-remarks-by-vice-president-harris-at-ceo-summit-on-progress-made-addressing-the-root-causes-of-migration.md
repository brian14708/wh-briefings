THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  Well, first, I want to thank the
Chamber of Commerce for organizing this CEO Summit and for bringing
together so many leaders from business across the hemisphere.   
   
We gather today in pursuit of a shared goal: to build a prosperous and
inclusive future for the people of the Western Hemisphere.  This is a
priority for President Joe Biden and me — a priority, I know, that
everyone here shares.  
   
The economies of the Western Hemisphere are deeply intertwined.  And the
work we do to strengthen these ties directly impacts the American
people.   
   
Our neighbors in the Western Hemisphere comprise the largest market for
American goods.  The region accounts for nearly 50 percent of all
American exports.  And when we have resilient and secure supply chains
that are close to us, disruptions will be less frequent, more goods will
be available, and prices will come down.   
   
From Canada to Chile, a prosperous region benefits all our economies and
creates more opportunities for our people.   
   
Here’s how I see it: To realize a more prosperous future for our
hemisphere, public-private partnerships are essential — partnerships
that combine the private sector and its experience and expertise with
the reach and capacity that only governments can provide.   
   
By working together, we can unleash growth and opportunity that far
exceeds what either the public or the private sector would achieve on
its own.   
   
I want to offer a scenario.  Imagine what could happen when governments
and companies collaborate.   
   
So, picture this.  Imagine a woman in Honduras who lives in a small
rural town.  She’s a single mother.  She has two children.  She does not
have a formal education and has never had steady work.  Instead, she
takes on an odd job here or there.  She often lays awake at night,
worried about whether she can put enough food on the table, wondering if
her children can break the cycle of poverty that is all too common where
she lives.   
   
Then, let’s imagine a beverage company announces new investments
sourcing coffee from her hometown in western Honduras.  Imagine that the
company then offers her a job cultivating that coffee.  Imagine an
international aid program provides lunch for her children at school,
improving their nutrition and their health; that a financial company
helps her open a bank account in the form of a digital wallet.  Imagine
that she now has some disposable income, and she saves, and she starts
moving up the economic ladder.   
   
And then, a telecommunications company makes an investment and connects
her town to the Internet, and she gains access to new information and
online tools that will help her really reach into her imagination about
what she can achieve.  And so, she then starts to think about an
entrepreneurship based on her vision for herself and her community.   
   
Imagine that USAID provides her with a grant to establish her own
eco-tourism business and that she accesses credit for the first time,
and she hires employees, and her business grows, and she thrives.   
   
This story illustrates what I believe is possible when governments and
business truly integrate our approach.  This scenario is, then, our
vision for millions of people as part of our strategy to address the
root causes of migration from Central America.   
   
Last year, I began work to lead this effort.  And I approached this task
with three basic principles.  First, I do believe most people don’t want
to leave home.  They don’t want to leave their grandmother.  They don’t
want to leave the place where they worship and the community that
they’ve always known.   
   
And so, when they do, it is usually for one of two reasons: They are
fleeing harm, or to stay means they simply cannot satisfy their basic
needs or the needs of their family.   
   
The second principle that is informing our call to action and this
approach is my and our belief that governments alone cannot address this
issue.  We must partner with the private sector if we are to have
lasting impact and if we are to maximize our capacity.  
   
Third, I believe that to attract meaningful investment, part of our
agenda and strategy must include a priority that is to combat
corruption, promote the rule of law, reduce violence, and empower
women.  
   
So, these are the guiding principles that inform our Root Causes
Strategy.  And this Strategy is aligned with the importance that many of
the of the leaders here know and live — the importance of paying
attention to a good return on investment, consistency and
predictability, a skilled workforce, and a reliable infrastructure.  
   
As part of this strategy, last year I launched the Call to Action
focused on northern Central America and encouraged companies and civil
society to deepen their commitment in the region and to expand
collaboration, to invest, and to contribute to long-term development.  
   
In particular, I’d like to change — or thank the Chamber of Commerce,
the Partnership for Central America, and the 40 companies and
organizations that have made commitments thus far.  These are long-terms
efforts, and we are making progress.  
   
Yesterday, I announced we have now generated more than $3.2 billion. 
This investment is on track to generate tens of thousands of jobs.  It
will help more than 10 million people access banking services and
credit.  And 2 million people already have been connected to the
Internet, with millions more to follow.  
   
In parallel, we are taking the steps that only government can.  Our
administration has made tackling corruption a top policy priority.  This
work incorporates an understanding that rule of law, consistency, and
stability are necessary for economies to thrive.  
   
Another pillar of our Strategy is to train, protect, and empower women
and to address gender-based violence.  I think we all know protecting
the safety and security of women is the right thing to do and empowering
women drives economic growth.  
   
Experts and top universities are now in the midst of studying our Call
to Action as an innovative model of public-private partnership — a model
for development efforts in other regions.   
   
It is apparent to me that the best approach entails the full involvement
of the private sector, governments, and civil society.  And, of course,
the idea of a public-private partnership is not new.  
   
But what I believe distinguishes the Call to Action is the integration
of so many efforts in one ecosystem.  This ecosystem includes some
companies that are even competitors with one another.  This ecosystem
also includes civil society organizations and the convening power of the
United States government and our ability to scale.  
   
The Call to Action brings all of these sectors together to collaborate,
coordinate, and share lessons learned.  
   
Yesterday, in fact, I met with several business executives who made new
commitments as part of this initiative.  We discussed how powerful it is
to see how each investment — each investment fits into the larger
picture.  In corporate speak: We identified many synergies.  
   
And this coordination allows us to address the full spectrum of needs in
a given region under one integrated plan.  Together, we are creating an
ecosystem of opportunity.  
   
And any good public policy, of course, must then be designed with an eye
for replication.  I believe truly that our approach can indeed be
applied elsewhere on other issues, in other parts of our hemisphere, and
even by other governments.  
   
When I think about all the challenges we face in the Western Hemisphere,
I know that they will require new and innovative coalitions between the
public and private sectors.  One size does not fit all, of course.  
   
But think about it: Economic inequality in our hemisphere is among the
worst in the world.  Women and girls in our hemisphere face far too many
barriers and far too few opportunities.   
   
Many countries in the region are still struggling to recover from the
pandemic.  Health systems are strained.  The climate crisis is
mounting.  And we continue to see corruption, migration flows, and
democratic backsliding, and violence.  
   
These issues affect all of us.  And the solutions then must involve all
of us.   
   
I believe there is untapped potential for us to partner in these areas
and so many more — in the area of clean energy, food security, health,
supply chains, infrastructure, and more.  
   
Later today, President Joe Biden will officially open the Summit of the
Americas to lay out his ambitious vision for shared prosperity in our
hemisphere, now and into the future.  
   
Our ongoing partnership with the private sector will play a crucial role
in realizing this vision.  
   
And I urge all of the leaders here to consider what you can continue to
do to partner within the context of the vision I know we share.   
   
Needless to say, each of you here has the power to act to help solve
some of the most pressing challenges of our time.  
   
Our partnership can create new opportunities for individuals to not only
succeed but to thrive.  
   
For companies, it can create new opportunities to grow and to
innovate.  
   
And for our hemisphere as a whole, it can create new opportunities to
connect and to prosper.   
   
I look forward to partnering with all of you in the months and the years
ahead.  I thank you for your leadership.  And I look forward to the work
we will do.   
   
Thank you.  (Applause.)
