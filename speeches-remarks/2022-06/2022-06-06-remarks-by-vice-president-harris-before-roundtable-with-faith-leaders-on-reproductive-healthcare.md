  Healthcare"

Los Angeles County Federation of Labor  
Los Angeles, California

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, good afternoon, everyone.  I want to thank
these extraordinary leaders for being here today for a very important
conversation that we will have about the challenges facing our nation,
but our collective commitment to address these challenges in a way that
inspires hope and optimism and grace and dignity and love.  And so, I’m
looking forward to our conversation.  
   
I want to recognize and thank Senator Padilla for being here.  I watched
your work in the halls of the United States Senate and you represent
California in such an extraordinary way.  
   
Congressman Jimmy Gomez — just always fighting.  Fighting for your
district and fighting for our state and for our country.  Thank you for
that.  
   
Of course, Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis, thank you for your
extraordinary leadership of our state and the work you do every day.  
   
And, of course, our mayor, Eric Garcetti.  Thank you.  Thank you.  
   
So, I think we all would agree that, in particular, these last few years
have, in many ways, tested our faith — tested our ability to believe
that everything will be okay, should be okay, can be okay.  
   
Over the last few years, we’ve experienced — as a community, as a
society, as a country, as a world — so much loss, unpredictability.   
   
And, of course, one of the discussions that we will have today is about
also what we’ve seen in terms of a rise in hate and misinformation.  
   
And so, I do believe — and I, my entire life, believed this — but I
think we, collectively, know, in particular now: We need faith.  We need
faith.   
   
I know that no matter the differences among us in a society, there’s so
much more in common than what separates us.  And I think most people,
regardless of who they are, would agree.  
   
We need faith in each other, in our nation, and in our future.  And so,
that’s why we are coming together today with a goal of instilling in
folks a belief that gives them a sense of hope and optimism in
themselves, in their community and our future.   
   
So, the faith leaders who are gathered here today are representative of
many different faiths, many different communities, but share a common
purpose, which is to bring healing and hope and a sense of community to
all people.  
   
So, our discussion today will focus on, I’m sure, a number of issues. 
But in particular, there are two — which is, one, what I believe is
something that requires all of the leaders at this table, which is what
we have been experiencing in terms of what I call an “epidemic of hate,”
where we have seen so many communities who are being targeted —
individuals who are being targeted simply because of who they are.   
   
And we combine that then with what we have seen in terms of
misinformation that now, because of this age that we are in and how
quickly it can spread unchecked, how ubiquitous it is, what it does to
fan the flames of hate, which, of course, has always and recently
vividly manifested itself in violent acts targeting innocent people and
their families and their community and our nation as a result of those
acts.  So, we will talk about that.   
   
And also, I would like to talk with these faith leaders about the
impending decision from the United States Supreme Court that we believe
will undo the very principles and premise of the importance of the
privacy, the right that Roe v. Wade stands for.  And so, we will talk a
bit about that.  
   
And I will say that, on the first issue, a subset — but a very, very
specific subset — that we must address is how hate manifests itself in
violent acts, most of which are committed with the use of guns, and
what, therefore, that requires in terms of sensible laws for any society
that should be rules-based with a goal of being a civil society.  And
so, we can talk a bit about that.  
   
And then, on the issue of Roe, it, of course — basically, the premise of
Roe and the power of Roe is it is about saying that people should have
the right to make decisions about their own bodies — that women should
have that right and have unfettered access to reproductive healthcare.  
   
So, that conversation, of course, in my mind, is a conversation that
requires us to also discuss whether we value the concept of
self-determination — the ability of an individual to make decisions
about their own life and the future of their life and the choices that
will directly impact so many other choices.  The issue of
self-determination.  
   
I do believe that when we look at the challenge that we will face when
that decision comes down, a part of it will be that it will directly, if
not indirectly, impact other privacy rights, including the right to have
access to contraception and the right to marry the person you love.   
   
And how will we then — as those who are guided by our faith, who believe
in the best of what we are and who we can be — how will we speak with
and talk about the people who are going to be directly impacted by that
decision and how we uplift them in a way that they do not feel alone and
without options.  
   
And I think it is very important to say — and I’m going to close my
comments in a moment — it’s very important, I think, for us to agree and
it’s an important point to make that to support Roe v. Wade and all it
stands for does not mean giving up core beliefs.  It is simply about
agreeing that a woman should be able to make that decision with her
faith leader, with her family, with her physician — and that the
government should not be making that decision for her.  
   
And I can’t end my comments without mentioning that, today, Louisiana is
on the path to pass a law — or passed a law that will take away this
right with no exception for rape or incest.  
   
So, the threat to all of these principles and priorities is very clear
and imminent.   
   
And with that, I will close by again saying that — that you all, as our
faith leaders, have done extraordinary work, in particular of these last
few years, to remind folks that they are not alone, that we are in this
together, that there is a higher purpose, and that we should be guided
by all that we know — that that gives us a chance of shining a light in
the midst of dark moments and dark days.  
   
So, I look forward to our conversation and talking about how we’re going
to build the coalition based on these shared principles and beliefs.  
   
And with that, I thank you all.  And I thank you.  We’re now going to
thank the press for your attention, and we’re going to have a
conversation.  
   
So, thank you, all.  
   
END
