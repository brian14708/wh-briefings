THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Please have a seat. 
Good afternoon.  
   
Laurene, thank you for that introduction and all of the work that you
and Emerson have been doing over so many years that is about addressing
root causes and doing it in a way that is informed by a sense of
humanity and a collective sense of purpose.  Thank you for that.  
   
And I also want to thank Christy Turlington Burns. And I am grateful to
you both and to the Partnership for Central America, the Chamber of
Commerce, and everyone here today for all of your efforts.  And I see
the Ambassador who is here.  I want to thank him as well.  
   
When I began work on the root causes of migration from northern Central
America, I approached the task with a few basic principles: one, my
belief — I think our shared belief — that people don’t want to leave
home.  And when they do, it is usually for one of two reasons: They are
fleeing harm, or they cannot address the basic needs of themselves or
their family.  
  
Two, I know, as a devout public servant, that to address this issue,
government cannot do it alone.  We must partner with the private sector
and civil society to address what we know can be addressed through
collaboration and coordination.  So, that is the spirit and the
foundation of the work that we are doing in the Call to Action.   
   
Together, our collective expertise, resources, and vision can and
already has begun to create an echo system of opportunity.   
   
Three, in terms of our approach, we believe that to have a meaningful
impact, we must also, in addition to addressing the economic status and
condition of the region, we must also address corruption, we must
promote the rule of law, we must focus with a priority on reducing
violence, and we must empower women.   
   
These are the guiding principles that inform our administration’s Root
Causes Strategy and our engagement with our neighbors — with our
neighbors — in the Western Hemisphere — a hemisphere, a region which is
more interconnected and more independent than ever before.  
   
So, a year ago, I issued the Call to Action and encouraged companies and
civil society to work with us to deepen a commitment in Northern Central
America and to expand collaboration.   
   
This Call to Action is creating new jobs and opportunities for the
people within those countries.  These investments are also a good
example of what our policies beyond our shore can do to benefit the
people within the United States.  Because we know the American people
will benefit from stable and prosperous neighbors.  And when we provide
economic opportunity for people in Central America, we address an
important driver of migration.   
   
Which brings me to today: I am pleased to announce that since the launch
of our Call to Action last year, we, together, have generated more than
$3.2 billion dollars of investment in the region.  (Applause.)   
   
And you applaud because we all know that is a substantial sum as the
beginning of this approach.  This investment is on track to generate, as
a result of what we have done so far,  tens of thousands of jobs,
investments in sectors such as agriculture and textiles.   
   
This investment also means that more than 10 million people will have
access to banking services and credit within that region, which is
important if we are to fuel the capacity, the entrepreneurial vision,
and desires of the people in that region.   
   
In addition to all of this work, 2 million people so far have already
been connected to the Internet, with millions more to follow — all part
of a holistic approach to what are the needs and the needs that can be
met in that region.  
   
In context, when we put that $3.2 billion dollars in context, consider
that El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras have a total population size
of about 30 million people.    
   
 A $3.2 billion investment will then have a direct impact on the quality
of life for people throughout that region.   
   
In fact, earlier today — and I see them here — I met with a group of
women leaders and women entrepreneurs who have been leading in some of
this work and some of whom have already benefitted from our Call to
Action initiatives.   
   
And their stories — I wish you all could’ve been in the room —
incredible stories.  Incredible stories of self-determination, of
vision, of passion and commitment and courage.  
   
So, today, to build on that success, we are announcing the next phase of
the Call to Action, which includes prioritizing women — a
forward-looking vision for the region requires understanding that women
are drivers of economic growth, wherever they are.   
   
So, today, with that spirit, we are announcing an initiative that has
been named “In Her Hands” — an initiative within our Call to Action that
will empower, protect, and train women in Northern Central America.  
   
I think we all agree and I strongly believe: When women succeed, all of
society benefits.  And that is the work that we have done, guided by
that principle, with our Root Causes Strategy.  
   
As part of this, the companies and organizations who are present today
have made new commitments to digitize women-owned businesses in the
region, to connect women to the banking system, to help more women
participate in the agriculture industry, to train women for coding and
cybersecurity, and to elevate women within companies.  
   
In addition, our administration’s strategy includes partnering with
civil society to reduce gender-based violence in the region.   
   
These two priorities must go hand in hand.  Because we know empowering
women economically is not only about giving them a job; it’s about
improving their quality of life.   
   
In fact — and a lot of folks here know: When women don’t have financial
stability — if they don’t have financial stability, the data shows us
that they are more likely to stay in abusive relationships.  A lack of
opportunity continues a cycle of violence.  However, when women have
economic opportunity, we see a reduction in domestic violence, a
reduction in sexual violence, a reduction in gender-based violence.  
   
So, today, in addition to announcing the next phase of the Call to
Action, we will bring together <u>the private sector, the non-profit
community, and the public sector to coordinate our strategy to reinforce
one another’s work and to ensure that collectively we are creating an
ecosystem of opportunity for women in the region.</u>  
   
In discussions over the course of this afternoon, you will hear from
panelists who will speak to all of these topics.  And what it all comes
down to is this: When you lift up the economic status of women, you lift
up the economic status of families, of her community, and of our entire
hemisphere.   
   
So, thank you all again for being here and for contributing to this
effort.  We have achieved a lot, but it is only the beginning.  And we
are committed to seeing this through with all of you.   
   
Thank you very much.  (Applause.)
