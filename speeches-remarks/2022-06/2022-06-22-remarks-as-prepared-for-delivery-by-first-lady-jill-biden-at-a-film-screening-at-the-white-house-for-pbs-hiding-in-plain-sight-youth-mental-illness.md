East Room | White House  

\*\*\*

I’m proud to welcome you to the White House for this special screening
of “Hiding in Plain Sight.”   
  
You know, a lot of the stories that we’re going to see today are hard to
watch.   
  
It’s impossible not to be moved by the pain that these young people and
their families share.  
  
As a parent, the only thing we want to do is protect our children. We do
everything we can to help them grow up safely.   
  
If they break a leg, we put them in a cast.   
  
If they have strep throat, we get them antibiotics.   
  
Mental health is health. But the solutions to address these challenges
aren’t always clear cut.   
  
The journey to treatment is rarely a straight line and it can be hard to
find the resources that you need. Far too often, struggles are cloaked
in secrecy and shame.   
  
About a month ago, we invited a group of incredible young mental health
leaders here to the White House.   
  
Like everyone in this documentary, they shared their struggles—often
through tears.   
  
They talked about being afraid, about hiding who they are. It broke my
heart.   
  
But there was so much hope there, too. Because they had all found a way
from that darkness towards the light.   
  
They found it through treatment. Through community. Through storytelling
and other creative new ways to build resilience.     
  
One young man said, “It was beautiful when I realized, wow, I’m not so
alone anymore.”  
  
For many years, an alarming number of young people have struggled with
mental health challenges—and the pandemic has made it exponentially
worse.   
  
The isolation. The anxiety. The grief.   
  
We have so much work to do to help our children heal.   
  
We have so much work to do to make sure that no one feels like their
pain has to be hidden.   
  
We want young people everywhere to know: We see you. We hear you. And we
will work to make this better.   
  
That’s why Joe made this a key part of his Unity Agenda.   
  
He’s working to expand the mental health workforce and invest in
counselors and other mental health resources in our schools.   
  
In October, the Department of Education released new resources and
evidence-based recommendations for educators.   
  
They’ve also committed to collaborating with the Department of Health
and Human Services to address the mental health needs of youth across
the country.   
  
And starting in July, all Americans experiencing a mental health crisis,
including thoughts of self-harm, can dial “9-8-8” to be connected with
trained crisis responders who can connect them to resources.  
  
This isn’t a red or a blue issue. It’s an American issue—a global
issue. And we must come together to find better solutions.   
  
Because it’s not going to be easy. But I know that it starts with
this: bringing the problem into the light.   
  
Having the conversation. Helping our children—and everyone who suffers
from this disease—understand that they aren’t alone. None of us are.    
  
So, I want to thank Ken Burns, and directors Erik You-ers and
Christopher Loren You-ers for creating a documentary that can help us do
just that.  
  
Ken has such a gift for breaking open the stories we don’t always
see.   
  
And I especially want to thank the brave young people who took part in
this.   
  
Would all of you stand?  
  
It takes incredible courage to tell your story. To be honest about the
struggles you’ve faced and say, “I’m not OK.”  
  
And it’s on us to meet that courage with action. To do everything in our
power to give you what you need to heal.   
  
So, thank you. You are a light to so many lives and I want you to know
that your President and I are grateful for your courage. Today is about
you.  
  
Thank you to everyone for coming out this afternoon.   
  
And now, Ken Burns.
