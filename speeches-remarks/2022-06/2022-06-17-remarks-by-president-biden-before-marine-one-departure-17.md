Q    Mr. President, have you made a decision about how you will handle
the Khashoggi killing when you go to Saudi Arabia?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  The same way I’ve been handling it.  I’m not going to
meet with — I’m not going to meet with MBS; I’m going to an
international meeting.  And he’s going to be a part of it, just like
there were people part of the discussion today.  
  
Q    Mr. President, how concerned are you about the three Americans who
are reportedly missing in Ukraine?  Have you been briefed?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  I have been briefed.  We don’t know where they are.

But I want to reiterate: Americans should not be going to Ukraine now. 
I’ll say it again: Americans should not be going to Ukraine now.  They
should not be going to Ukraine.  
  
Q    What will the consequences be for oil companies if they don’t boost
supplies?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, look, one of the things that has happened is that
the price of gasoline exceeds the price based on the barrel of oil costs
right now.  So if you get — based on what a barrel of oil costs on
average, it should not be this high.  They’re making exorbitant profits
— number one.

Number two, I’ve contacted them — my team has — to ask what their plans
are and to give any suggestions they have.  They have over 9,000 leases
— 9,000.  They can drill until they’re — until (inaudible) won’t have
it.  But they’re not doing it — number two.

Number three, I think we’re going to be in a position where we’re going
to –

Oh.  (The First Lady approaches the President.)

THE FIRST LADY:  (Laughs.)  We got to go!

(Cross-talk by reporters.)

Q    (Inaudible) two billion people in India are waiting for you to
visit India.

THE PRESIDENT:  I’ve been to India twice, and I’ll be back to India. 
And my relations are very good.  Thank you.
