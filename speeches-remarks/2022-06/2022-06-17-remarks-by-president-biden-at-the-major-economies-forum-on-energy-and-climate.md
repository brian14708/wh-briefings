THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, John.  Hello, everyone.  And thank you for,
whatever time zone you’re in, making the time to be here.  I appreciate
it very much.  
   
You know, we’re meeting today at a moment when — where there’s urgent
global issues impacting all of our nations, demand our immed- — and they
all demand our immediate action and our close cooperation.  
   
Russia’s brutal and unprovoked assault on its neighbor, Ukraine, has
fueled a global energy crisis and has sharpened the need to achieve
long-term, reliable energy security and stability.  
   
And with Russia’s war driving up inflation worldwide, threatening
vulnerable countries with severe food shortages, we have to work
together to mitigate the immediate fallout of this crisis.  
   
In the United States, I’m using every lever available to me to bring
down prices for the American people.  And our nations are working
together to stabilize global energy markets, including coordinating the
largest release from the global reserve — from global oil reserves in
history.  
   
But the critical point is that these actions are part of our transition
to a clean and secure long-term energy future. And the good news is
climate security and energy security go hand in hand.  
   
For example, back in March, the European Commission — with President von
der Leyen leading the effort — and I announced the U.S.-EU Task Force on
Energy Security to help the EU rapidly reduce its dependence on Russian
gas and reduce the EU’s overall demand for gas by ramping up clean
energy technologies.  
   
We’ll bolster our energy security and improve the affordability and
reliability of energy around the world and reduce our greenhouse gas
emissions.  
   
Because we cannot — we cannot afford to let the critical goal of
limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius slip out of our reach.  
   
And the science tells us that the window for action is rapidly narrowing
— rapidly.  
   
Glasgow was just the kickoff for a decade of ambition, action, and
innovation.  And we look toward COP27.  We have to — we have to dedicate
ourselves, as we look forward to it, to delivering on existing goals and
undertaking additional efforts to boost our progress.  
   
So I urge these countries that — those countries that have not yet gone
to set a 2030 emissions target to align with the Paris temperature goal,
to strengthen their targets for COP27.   
   
At the same time, we need new initiatives to accelerate our progress
toward our goals and bolster our resilience.    
   
Here’s what the United States is proposing to maximize efficiency and
reduce emissions across the energy, transportation, and agricultural
sectors.  I hope that many of you will — will join us in these
efforts.   
   
First, we should build upon the success of the Global Methane Pledge —
now more than 115 countries strong.  To do that, we’re announcing the
Global Methane Pledge Emer- — excuse me — Energy Pathway to ramp up the
speed at which we reduce methane leaks from the oil and gas sector, and
also helping bridge our energy needs.  
   
Each year, our existing energy system leaks enough methane to meet the
needs for the entire European power sector.  We flare enough gas to
offset nearly all of the EU’s gas imports from Russia.  And so, by
stopping the leaking and flaring of this super-potent greenhouse gas,
and capturing this resource for countries that need it, we’re addressing
two problems at once.   
   
Second, we’re investing in innovation and hastening the scale-up of new
technologies like carbon capture and advanced nuclear and clean
hydrogen.  The International Energy Agency says we need 90 billion
dollars’ worth of demonstration projects for this decade.  And thanks to
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that was passed here in the United
States, we’re stepping up with a $21.5 billion contribution toward this
goal.  
   
For example, we’ve launched a multibillion-dollar effort to create
hydrogen hubs all around the country.  And using the Defense Production
Act, in our system, to boost the manufacturing of electrolyzers, which
are used to produce clean hydrogen.  We’ve done — we’re doing both these
things.   
   
Our Department of Energy also just issued a loan guarantee to construct
one of the world’s largest clean hydrogen storage facilities.   
   
And I challenge us, together, to hit the full $90 billion target by the
Global Clean Energy Action Forum that the U.S. is hosting in September
in Pittsburgh.  
   
Third, Russia’s war is driving up prices of gas — everybody knows that —
hurting people in all our countries.  It’s an immediate problem that I
suspect all of you and I know I’m working every day.  
   
Over the long run, we can remove the pain of volatile gas prices and
reduce transportation emissions by putting more zero-emission cars on
the road.   
   
In the United States, we’re building a nationwide network of 500,000
electric vehicle charging stations.  We’re strengthening our supply
chains for the critical materials that go into those batteries.  And
we’ve set a goal of ensuring that half of all passenger cars sold in the
United States in 2020 will be zero — 2030, I should say — will be zero
emission.  I urge all of you to join us in a similar goal.  
   
Fourth, if ocean-based shipping were a country, it would be the
eighth-largest emitter in the world.  It’s critical we do more to
promote zero-emission fuels and green shipping corridors in this
sector.  And it seems to me we ought to be able to do that.  That’s why
the United States and Norway are launching the Green Shipping Challenge
to fully decarbonize shipping by 2050.  
   
And finally, Russia’s war in Ukraine is worsening food insecurity, in
part due to the skyrocketing price of fertilizer. Fertilizer production
relies on natural gas, but more than 50 percent of nitrogen fertilizers
are lost globally every year due to waste.   
   
So today, the United States is launching a new Global Fertilizer
Challenge.  Let’s aim to raise at least $100 million toward increasing
fertilizer efficiency and developing alternatives by COP27.   
   
And to keep strengthening our adaptation efforts, this year, the United
States is going to partner with Egypt on the Adaptation in Africa event
to deliver concrete initiatives that are going to improve people’s lives
and build resilience in — to a changing climate.   
   
These are all achievable goals, in my view.  And if we all commit to
doing our part, we’ll get it done.  And if we do, we’ll unlock an
incredible opportunities for all our people around the world: more
growth, more innovation, more good-paying jobs that support working
families, greater food security for communities around the world, and
we’ll finally break our dependence on the volatile energy markets and
high gas prices.  
   
So thank you all again for taking the time to — this morning, today,
tonight — whatever the timeframe it is — for what — and joining us.  So
let’s keep this challenge — let’s keep doing what we — what we’ve been
doing.  Challenge ourselves to do more, because we can.  
   
Thank you all so very much for listening.  I’m anxious to hear what you
all have to say.  Thank you.  Thank you, John.
