THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Please have a seat.  Hi, everyone.  Well, let me
start by saying it is so good to be with our Attorney General, Merrick
Garland; our Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy; and on Gender Policy Council
— where she? — Dr. Jennifer Klein; and all the members of the task
force.  Thank you all for the work you do, for the extraordinary work
that you do.  
   
Sloane, thank you for your courage.  It takes a lot to put yourself out
there as a public figure, period, but then to speak out about something
so many people, regardless of gender, are experiencing.  So thank you
for your leadership.  Thank you.  
   
And to all the other survivors who are here today: You motivate us.  You
inspire us.  And you are the voice of so many people who are in this
room because of the voice that you express around these issues.  And so
I thank you for that and your strength and your sense of purpose.  
   
And in particular, I also want to acknowledge Matthew and Francesca.   
   
So I know it is not easy to talk about what you’ve experienced.  And as
all of you know, most of my career, I spent it as a prosecutor.  And the
majority of that time, I was focused on crimes affecting women and
children, crimes that involved sexual abuse.  And — and in many of the
cases, in particular when they were going to trial, and we were prepared
to go to trial, I’d sit down for extensive periods of time to talk with
the survivors about their case and talk with them about what it would be
like when they were going to walk out of my office and walk down the
hall and walk into a courtroom.  
   
And for some, as you all know, it was impossible to imagine what it
would mean to speak publicly about what they’d been through, when, you
know, most don’t want to even speak about it in private.  
   
But every time, I have to tell you, I was inspired by their bravery for
so many reasons, both because of the courage it takes to tell a story
that is a story that is informed by some of the most horrible
experiences but also informed by such pain.  But I was also inspired
because, again, the courage that it takes to be that voice.  
   
You know, when I would prosecute a case, and the prosecutors here know
that, it was — the — I would stand in front of the jury, and I would
say, “Kamala Harris for the people.”  And the charging document would
not be the name of the victim or survivor versus the defendant, it was
the “The People versus.”  
   
Because, you see, in our form of justice, we have rightly said that
individual should not be made to fight alone.  A harm against her,
against him, against them is a harm against all of us as a society.   
   
And so, it is with that spirit that we are doing the work we are doing
today to convene and to inaugurate this task force, understanding this
affects all of us if it affects any one of us.   
   
And we therefore, all of us, have a responsibility to stand together to
support those who have gone through this, but to also recognize they
shouldn’t have to be alone fighting on this issue.   
   
So that’s the spirit with which we convene today and the spirit with
which we are doing this work.   
   
And I will tell you, as Attorney General, many of you know, when I was
in California, I prosecuted the first case in the country of an operator
of a cyber exploitation website.   
   
And I’ll never forget — you know, my office was mostly in Sacramento,
and we were dealing with a case — if you know California — in another
part of the state.  And I flew down to meet with the person who was
actually handling the case, to go o- — went through the files to see:
Where were we?  What was going on?  What were we going to do about this
case?  
   
Because it was, in many ways, a case of first impression — although it
wasn’t when we thought about the pathology of what was at play.  When we
thought about the — you know, we call it the “MO” — modus operandi. 
Right?  When we talked about and thought about how it was being done,
what was motivating it, and how it was making that victim and that
survivor feel.   
   
So, yes, it was the first in the nation, but we’d seen that kind of
stuff before.  The point was that we needed to update and upgrade
ourselves as law enforcement and as the criminal justice system, as a
justice system, to recognize where it is now occurring and update our
approach to deal with it in all places where it exists in a way that
causes harm and pain and injury.   
   
And so, that website in particular, it — what it did is it let people
upload sexually explicit photographs of their former partners — the
photographs that were taken and shared with consent in a consensual
relationship.  But, of course, what ended up happening is that one of
those partners usually in that relationship had — had a grudge or an
issue or a motivation to embarrass or to harm, and would allow the
photograph to be posted with the explicit intent — certainly with the
implicit effect — of trying to embarrass and degrade and hurt and cause
pain and attract judgment to that individual.   
  
Well, in that case, I’m happy to report that the person who ran that
website went to prison, because I do believe that there should be
consequence for behaviors that harm other human beings.  
  
But this kind of justice is still so rare, because many of our laws have
not caught up with the advances in technology.  So, as a United States
senator, I introduced legislation to make these acts a federal crime.  
   
And thanks to the recent — and our President, Joe Biden — and the recent
reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, for the first time,
cyber exploitation victims can sue their abusers in federal civil
court.  
   
And this is progress, yet we still have so much more work to do to
protect people from online harassment and abuse, which is why the work
of this task force is so important.  
   
Context.  Well, the Internet is an essential part of life in the 21st
century.  Can’t get around it.  Can’t get around without it.  And for
far too many people — and Sloane told her story — the Internet is a
place of fear.  
   
One in three women under the age of 35 report being sexually harassed
online.  Over half of the LGBTQ+ people in our country are survivors of
severe harassment.  
   
Nearly one in four Asian Americans report being called an offensive
name, usually motivated by racism — being called an offensive name
online.  And Black people who have been harassed online in our country
are three times more likely to be targeted, again, because of their
race.  
   
No one should have to endure abuse just because they are attempting to
participate in society.  
   
Of course, the impact of this abuse extends beyond the ability to use
Internet — the Internet system and the power of the Internet — without
fear.  It’s beyond that.  In many cases, cyberstalking have serious
mental health consequences for its victims, sometimes leading to
self-harm, sometimes leading to suicide.  
  
And we continue to see how some acts of mass violence — the most recent
included — have followed expressions of online hate and abuse.  
   
The white supremacist who murdered 10 Black people in Buffalo, New York,
was first radicalized, by all accounts, online.  
   
And after the massacre of 19 children — 19 babies — and 2 teachers in
Uvalde, it was revealed that the shooter had threatened to kidnap, rape,
and kill teenage girls on Instagram.  One of the girls he harassed
described the abuse, I quote, as “just how online is.”  Think about
that.  Hate has become so common on the Internet that, as a society,
it’s kind of becoming normalized, and for users, some might say
unavoidable.   
   
Recent events have also made it clear that we face new threats.  Earlier
this week, I met with a group of legal experts about how overturning Roe
v. Wade will impact the right to privacy.   
   
Now, just think about this: In states where abortion is criminalized, an
abuser could purchase a woman’s location history through a data broker. 
This is a realistic scenario.  If that history shows that she sought an
abortion out of state, he could then turn it over to law enforcement in
a jurisdiction that has deemed that a crime.  This is a horrifying
possibility for that woman.   
   
So let us be clear: No one should be afraid that an abuser will use
their private personal data — or that a person’s private personal data
will be used against them.  And all people deserve to use the Internet
free from fear.  
   
This task force, then, will tackle a threat that has been far too real
for far too many people for far too long.  And the recommendations of
this group and the extens- — extended group of experts and those who
have been advocates in this space for so long — the collective work —
will help modernize the federal government’s response to violence
against women and people of all genders.  It will lead to more
evidence-informed policies and interventions.  And it will support more
federal funding to address online harassment and abuse, including grants
to train law enforcement and prosecutors.   
   
It is incumbent on all of us — government, local law enforcement, and
the tech sector — to respond to the task at hand with a sense of
urgency.   
   
So I thank you all for your tireless fight and for your advocacy, for
your strength to prevent these harms from happening in the first place
and to hold perpetrators accountable.  And the President and I look
forward to hearing all of your recommendations.   
   
Thank you all so very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)
