THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  (Applause.)  Good afternoon.  Good
afternoon, everyone.  Please have a seat.  Good afternoon.  Good
afternoon.  
  
Well, first, I want to thank Senator Durbin.  I had the privilege of
serving with him, as he mentioned, on the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
And I can tell you, Illinois, you are very, very well represented by
Senator Dick Durbin.  He is an extraordinary leader, a great fighter for
all of American and — all of America, and in particular for the people
of Illinois.  
So, thank you, Dick Durbin, and congratulations to your grandchild, for
her honor today as well.   
  
And I want to thank all the leaders for joining us today, and a special
thank you, of course, to Lauren Underwood.  Where are you?  Lauren. 
(Applause.)  I have seen you when the cameras are on and when the
cameras are off.  She’s always fighting for the people of her district. 
And all that you have done for our government, for the people of our
country, and for Plainfield, I thank you for that.  I thank you for your
partnership and your leadership.  
  
So, as Senator Durbin mentioned, we traveled here today.  In fact, they
both joined me, along with the Secretary, on Air Force Two.  And we
traveled here from D.C. today to talk with you about maternal health,
which should be one of our highest priorities as a nation.  
  
And I had planned to speak about our strategy for improving care for
pregnant women and mothers across our country.  And as you know, on the
way here, however, we learned that the United States Supreme Court had
rendered its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.  
  
Here’s what that decision means: For nearly 50 years, we have talked
about what Roe v. Wade protects.  Today, as of right now, as of this
minute, we can only talk about what Roe v. Wade protected.  Past
tense.   
  
This is a healthcare crisis, because understand: Millions of women in
America will go to bed tonight without access to the healthcare and
reproductive care that they had this morning; without access to the same
healthcare or reproductive healthcare that their mothers and
grandmothers had for 50 years.  
   
This is the first time in the history of our nation that a
constitutional right has been taken from the people of America.  And
what is that right? — some might ask.  It’s the right to privacy.  
   
Think about it as the right for each person to make intimate decisions
about heart and home; decisions about the right to start a family,
including contraception, such as IUDs and the morning-after pill;
decisions about whether to have a child, including, as Senator Durbin
mentioned, through in-vitro fertilization; decisions to marry the person
you love — Obergefell v. Hodges, Loving vs. Virginia.  
   
This opinion also says, when your read it, that abortion is not deeply
rooted in our nation’s history.  They offer that in the opinion as a
foundation for the decision they rendered today.  
   
In holding that it is not deeply rooted in our history, today’s decision
on that theory, then, calls into question other rights that we thought
were settled, such as the right to use birth control, the right to
same-sex marriage, the right to interracial marriage.  
   
The great aspiration of our nation has been to expand freedom, but the
expansion of freedom clearly is not inevitable.  It is not something
that just happens — not unless we defend our most fundamental
principles; not unless we elect leaders who stand up for those
principles.  
   
The strength of our nation has always been that we move forward.   
  
Today, I invite all people to stand together in defense of one of the
most fundamental ideals and principles that for generations, for
centuries, I believe, we have held dear, which is that fundamental
principle about the importance of liberty — to stand for liberty, to
stand for freedom, to stand for self-determination, and for the right to
privacy.  
   
You have the power to elect leaders who will defend and protect your
rights.  And as the President said earlier today, with your vote, you
can act, and you have the final word.   
   
So this is not over.  God bless you.  And God bless America. 
(Applause.)
