*Dream Big Children’s Center  
*Monrovia, California**

Q    All right.  Madam Vice President, welcome home.  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Hi, Alex.  Good to be home.   
  
Q    Good to have you back in California.  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  It’s really great to be home.  
  
Q    What does it mean for you to be at a summit like this in your home
state, as one of the leaders of it?  And what are you most excited about
in terms of the summit?  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  So I’ll talk about the summit.  But let’s just
first talk about this business, because Dream Big — I’ve been hearing
about this business and this business owner.  It’s a small business
right here in the heart of California. She now has five.  And it’s a
business that serves the parents and the children of the community, in
particular special needs children.  
  
And the reason that I’ve been hearing about her work is not only because
of what she does in such a loving way to help parents parent, but she
did it through the pandemic when she, for just a short while, was, you
know, under the threat that so many small businesses were of closing.   
  
And the parents that she serves were desperate to know that she would be
able to stay open.  And she did.  And parents bring their children here
five days a week for four hours a day.  The parents of this community
rely on the support that she gives their children throughout these early
stages of their development.  And if she had to close down, it would
have had a profound if not lifelong impact on those children, much less
their families.  
  
So I’m here to highlight the importance of our small businesses, because
they do this out of love, out of concern, and being a member of the
community, and with a sense of responsibility to the community.  
  
And I’m also here to highlight then that it is small businesses like
this that have been supported through our Small Business Administration,
the administrators here, because we give loans that are able to help
these businesses grow and then expand the service they provide to the
community.  
  
So I’m here to talk about that and also the importance of the PPP
program, which allowed her to stay open through the height of the crisis
of the pandemic.  
  
On the summit: So one of the important components of the summit, from my
perspective, is the work that we’ve been doing with the Call to Action,
which is bringing CEOs together at historic numbers to invest in the
northern part of Central America.   
And we announced yesterday that as a result of the work that we only
started a year ago, we’ve already raised $3.2 billion, which is about
investing in these countries that are our neighbors, as the United
States — because we are also a member of the Western Hemisphere.  
  
And one of the things that is without question: When we are able to
improve the prosperity and stability of our neighbors, we as a nation
benefit.  So the work that we have been doing in the summit has been to
bring CEOs together, heads of state of a number of the organiz- — of the
countries in the Western Hemisphere are going to be here, to talk about
how we can continue to collaborate.  
But specifically on the issue of the economic investment that our CEOs
are making, specifically on this subject of the beauty and strength of
public-private partnerships, I’m very excited about the work that is
being done and that will continue to be done.  
  
Q    And especially great to be here (inaudible).  
  
(Cross-talk by reporters.)  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And it’s — in particular, yeah, it’s kind of nice
that it just happens to be in Los Angeles, where I live.  So it’s been
nice to be home for a change.
