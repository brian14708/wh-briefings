CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ:  So, it’s very good to have you here.  (Inaudible) we
can really do important things (inaudible) special time.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, there’s a lot to do.  And I want to compliment
you on stepping up as you did when you became chancellor and moving in
the way that you — had a great impact on the rest of Europe to move,
particularly as it related to Ukraine.   
   
And you’re — you’re one of our fastest and closest allies in the world,
and we got to make sure we have this — us all staying together.  You
know we’re going to continue working on the economic challenges we face,
but I think we can get through all this —  
   
CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ:  Yeah.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  — and come out stronger.  
   
CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ:  And the good message is that we all made it to stay
united, which obviously Putin never expected.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  And that was in no small part because of you — no
small part because of you.  Seriously.  Because there was a lot of
discussion of whether or not, in the transition — how it was going to
work.  But you’ve done an incredible job.  I want to thank you for it. 
Thank you, thank you.  
   
We have to stay together —  
   
CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ:  Yeah.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  — because Putin has been counting on, from the
beginning, that somehow NATO would — and the G7 would splinter.  And —
but we haven’t, and we’re not going to.   
   
So, we can’t let this aggression take the form it has and get away with
it.  
   
So, thank you.  
   
CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ:  Thank you.
