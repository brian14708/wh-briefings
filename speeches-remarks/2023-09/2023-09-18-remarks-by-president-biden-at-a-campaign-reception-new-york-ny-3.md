Lunt-Fontanne Theater  
New York, New York

7:47 P.M. EDT

THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, Broadway!  (Applause.)  
   
My name is Joe Biden.  I’m Jill Biden’s husband.  (Applause.)  And she’s
got to go to Washington.  Be safe, kid.  Love you.  
   
THE FIRST LADY:  Love you.  
   
AUDIENCE:  Awww.  (Applause.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I was doing an event with members of the Black caucus
earlier this evening, and I got this email, this note in the middle of
the — my speaking.  Jill said, “You’re missing the best show I’ve ever
seen.”  (Laughter.)  
   
Thank you, Jeffrey, for that introduction and for organizing this
special line-up of performers.   (Applause.)  Thank you, thank you,
thank you.  
   
Jill got here before me, so she was able to enjoy the show.  
   
Folks, looking out at all of you, I have just one thing to say: Broadway
is back.  (Applause.)  Broadway is back.  
   
And I can’t tell you how grateful I am to have your support.  I wouldn’t
be here today without you all.  I really mean that.  
   
When my two boys were young — and Jill loved Broadway — we’d come up at
least twice a year from — from Washington to make sure we saw a play. 
And we were — our boys were young, Beau and Hunter, and — and Jill — we
took them to see Bette Midler.  (Laughter and applause.)  Anyway, in the
middle of her show — it’s the God’s truth — Bette Midler looked down,
and she said, “Who would bring two kids to a show like this?” 
(Laughter.)  
  
Well, my boys used that as a badge of courage.  “Bette Midler picked us
out of the crowd,” they’d tell people.    
   
Well, families from all over the world have memories like that to
cherish.  They come to New York City, just like you did with your
families, because Broadway gives us something irreplaceable.  It gives
us the truth — the truth.  
   
Normally, at events like this, I talk about the record of my
administration, but even today, a lot of Americans don’t know about it. 
Things I’ve — how we’ve created 13 million jobs, how we rallied the
world to confront Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, or how we put the
first Black woman on the United States Supreme Court.  (Applause.)  Or
how we passed the biggest investment in the history of the world to
combat climate change.  
   
But, folks — (applause) — tonight, I want to talk about something else. 
I want to talk about what’s at stake in this country.  
   
You know, when I was vice president at the end of the Obama-Biden
administration, I had no intention of running for office again.  We just
lost our son Beau, a major in the United States Army, a decorated war
veteran, a guy who won the — anyway, he was a — I wish you could have
known him.   
   
He was going — and I was going to write a book and set up the institute
of foreign pol- — and I set up the institute of foreign policy at the
University of Pennsylvania,  
where I became a professor — (applause) — and domestic policy at the
University of Delaware.  And that’s what I did.  
   
But then Charlottesville happened in August of 2017.  Something I never,
never, never thought I’d see in America.  But you sure remember what
happened, along with me.  
   
We saw people crawling out of fields with lighted torches, carrying —
carrying swastikas, their veins bulging, and chanting the same
anti-Semitic bile and racist bile we heard in Germany in the ‘30s,
accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan.  And in the process, a young woman was
murdered.  
   
When the President was asked about — about what was — what comment did
he have, he said, and I quote, “There are very fine people on both
sides.”  
   
Very fine people on both sides?  
   
When I heard that, I knew I could no longer sit on the sidelines —
(applause) — because the President of the United States had just drawn a
moral equivalency between those who stood for hate and those who stood
against it.  
   
You see, I believe silence is complicity.  And I would not be silent any
more than you were.  So, I ran.  (Applause.)   
   
With the strong support of my remaining children — and God love them — I
ran because I thought everything — everything in this country,
everything it stood for, everything we believed in, everything that made
America “America,” even our very democracy, was at risk.  And I had no
choice, like many of you.  
   
I think people tonight — I was being hyperbolic at the time, thought
that.  “Joe, what do you mean our democracy is at risk?  What do you
mean we’re in a battle for the soul of America?”  
   
Well, people don’t say that anymore.  I don’t think anyone today doubts
our democracy was at stake in 2020.  And thank God,  
because of people like you, we won.  (Applause.)  
   
And I might add — I might add: We won convincingly, clearly, and without
question by 7 million votes — (applause) — a victory that not only
withstood not more than — not one, but 60 legal court challenges and an
insurrection on January the 6th.  
   
So, now I’m running again.  (Applause.)  And you may have noticed, a lot
of people seem focused on my age.  (Laughter.)  
   
Well, I get it, believe me.  I know better than anyone.  (Laughter.)  
   
But there’s something else I know.  When I came to office and this
nation was flat on its back, I knew what to do to vaccinate the nation,
to rebuild the economy.  (Applause.)  When Russia invaded Ukraine, I
knew what to do to rebuild NATO and the alliances and rebuild our
alliances and rally the world.  (Applause.)  
   
And, above all, when democ- — when democracy was at stake, I knew what
to do to redeem the soul of this nation.  
   
So, let me answer that as simply as I can.  
   
I’m running because we’ve made progress, but our democracy is still at
stake.  (Applause.)  
   
I’m running because our most important freedoms — the right to choose;
the right to vote — (applause); the right to be who you are; love who
you love — (applause) — these basic rights are being attacked.  They’re
being shredded.  
   
I’m running because our children should have the right to go to school
without fear of being gunned down by a weapon of war.  (Applause.)  
   
I’m running because there are people banning books in this — did you
ever think we’d be banning books like we do?  (Applause.)   
   
I’m running because, all across America, hate groups have been
emboldened.   
   
I’m running because far too often it’s still the case that you can get
killed or attacked walking the streets in America just because you’re
Black or because you’re wearing a symbol of your faith.  (Applause.)  
   
Look, folks, I’m running because, no, I will not side with dictators
like Putin.  Maybe Trump and his MAGA friends can bow down and praise
him, but I won’t.  (Applause.)   
   
I’ve known him for 25 years, and I’m going to stand up to him as I
always have and always will.  
   
I’m running because — hear — hear this -– I want the entire nation to
join me in sending the strongest, clearest, most powerful message
possible that political violence in America is never, never, never
acceptable.  (Applause.)  
   
And I’m running because democracy is at stake and because, 2024,
democracy is on the ballot once again.  
   
And let there be no question.  Donald Trump and his MAGA Republicans are
determined to destroy American democracy.  And I will always defend,
protect, and fight for our democracy.  That’s why I running. 
(Applause.)  
   
In my entire career, I never thought I’d ever have to say anything like
that.  
   
You know, this country we live in is so special.  We are the only
country in the world — we’re the most unique country in the world. 
We’re not built on our ethnicity or religion or geography.  We’re built
on an idea.  We’re the only country built on an idea that we hold these
truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal. 
Endowed by the creator, they deserve to be treated equally throughout
our lives.  
   
We’ve never fully lived up to that commitment, but God knows we have
never, in 240 years, walked away from it.  (Applause.)  Never walked
away from it.  And we’re not going to walk away now.   (Applause.)   
   
I don’t believe America is a dark, negative nation — a nation of carnage
driven by anger, fear, and revenge.  Donald Trump does.  
   
To his supporters, he says, “I am your retribution.”  I am your
retribution?  “We’re a failing nation,” he says.  “Either they win or we
win.  And if they win, we no longer have a country.”  
   
Did you ever hear, you think, a President of the United States speak
like that?  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBERS:  No!  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I believe we are a hopeful and optimistic nation,
driven by the simple proposition that everybody deserves a fair shot —
just a shot.  
      
You in this theater, in music, in the arts, you understand what freedom
means: to tell the truth, to have the courage to hold a mirror up to the
nation and say, “Is this who we are?  
Can we be better?”  
   
Folks, that’s what’s at stake.  And I need you — indeed, I need every
American who loves democracy to join us in 2024 to make sure we make it
stronger, not attack it.  (Applause.)  
   
And when you do that, we’ll have something few generations can say. 
We’ll be able to say, “We will have saved American democracy.” 
(Applause.)  
   
It sounds like hyperbole, but it’s a fact.  I’ve never been more
optimistic about our country’s future in the 800 years I’ve served. 
(Laughter.)  
   
We just have to — we have to remember who in the hell we are. 
(Laughter.)  
   
We are the United States of America.  And there is nothing — nothing
beyond our capacity if we work together.  There’s never been a problem
we’ve had where we did not come out stronger than when we went in.   
   
And, ladies and gentlemen, it’s time for us to stand up. There’s nothing
we can’t do when we work together — nothing.  
   
May God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops.  I love you. 
(Applause.)  
   
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)
