St. Edmond’s Catholic Church

Q    Mr. President, have — have you heard the Burning Man news?  Any
reaction to that?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  We’re in touch with the local people.  We’re
paying attention.  We ought to be getting everybody out of there.  There
was one death; I don’t know what the reason for the death was.  
   
Q    What — are you looking forward to your trip next week?  
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, I am.  I’m —   
   
Q    What are you hoping to achieve in India and Vietnam?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  (Referring to fellow churchgoers.)  I’m holding people
up here.  I’m holding people up.  
   
By the way, the reason I’m here today just for one day — I know you
(inaudible) I’m on vacation; I’m not.  I have no home to go to.  The
Secret Service has torn my house up, in a good way, to make it secure. 
So I have no place to go when I come to Delaware except here right now. 
I’m only here for one day.  
      
Q    Are you homeless?  Is that what you’re telling us?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, I’m not homeless.  I just have one home — I have a
beautiful home.  But I’m down here for the day because I can’t go “home”
home.  
   
Q    What do you want to achieve in Vietnam and India?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I want to — a little more coordination.  I think they
both want much closer relations with the United States, and that could
be very helpful.  
      
(Cross-talk.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Pardon me?  
   
Q    Have you heard that Zelenskyy has replaced his defense minister?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  
   
Q    Do you have any comment?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Not publicly.  
   
Q    Are you disappointed that President Xi is not going to the G20
(inaudible)?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I am disappointed, but I’m going to get to see him.  
   
Thank you
