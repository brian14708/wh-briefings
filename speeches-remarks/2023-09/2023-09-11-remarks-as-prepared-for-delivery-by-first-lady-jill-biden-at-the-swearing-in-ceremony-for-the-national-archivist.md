Washington, D.C. 

  
\*\*\*  
Thank you, Governor Blanchard. And thank you for your dedication to the
National Archives.  
   
Senator Capito, you were a champion for Dr. Shogan in the Senate. Thank
you for everything you did to make this moment possible.  
   
Twenty-two years ago today, the horror of 9/11 changed us all in some
way. We must always remember those lost that day and in the aftermath.
And we will keep their families always in our hearts. We stand with them
today, and every day.  
   
The history of a democracy belongs to its people, and we must preserve
it with care for future generations.  
   
As far back as the Constitutional Convention, our leaders recognized the
power of our founding documents and the importance of keeping them safe
and accessible.  
   
This experiment in democracy hinged on the people, and their ability to
claim their rights and hold their elected officials accountable. That
power could only be made real with access to history, unfiltered and
uncensored.  
   
So, in the 250 years since, we have collected these records, first in
the hands of George Washington, later at the Department of State, and
now in the National Archives.  
   
Each one is a snapshot in time tracing the history of a young republic –
our republic – from its nascent beginnings to who we are today – the
greatest, most powerful country on this planet.  
   
The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. The Louisiana
Purchase and Emancipation Proclamation. The 13<sup>th</sup> and
19<sup>th</sup> Amendments. Harriet Tubman’s Civil War pension claims.
Thomas Edison’s lightbulb patent.  
   
A letter Annie Oakley sent to President McKinley in 1898 volunteering
the services of 50 “lady sharpshooters” for the Spanish-American War.
The transfer of power between 46 presidents.  
   
Each of these pieces of paper tells a story – the story of a country and
its people, zigging and zagging through history, imperfectly marching
toward a more perfect union.  
   
Conversely, sometimes that story is a dark one. Manifests of slave
ships. President Roosevelt’s Executive Order on Japanese internment. The
Supreme Court’s Dred Scott decision.  
   
It’s these stories we must learn the most from. It’s these we must
study, for past is prologue, as one of the statues flanking this
building proclaims.  
   
As an educator I know this well, that our present and our future are
inextricably linked to our past – and that we must learn from that past
or be bound to repeat it.  
   
That’s why, as First Lady, I’ve been so committed to upholding these
sacred institutions, so they may continue to serve the American people
and teach the next generation about our shared heritage.  
   
These National Archives have captured our complicated story for nearly
100 years.  
And for that entire period, the Archives have been led by men.  
   
Today, however, I’m so honored to be part of the ceremony to swear-in
the first woman ever to be appointed Archivist of the United States.  
   
The history we preserve, the stories we elevate, the voices we amplify
are shaped by the person at the helm of this institution.  
   
These stories are all of our stories – men and women, of all
backgrounds, ages, and creeds, what we choose to preserve, and whose
voices we deem worthy of placing in our national memory.  
  
That’s why this milestone – the first woman head of the National
Archives and Records Administration – is so momentous.  
   
Dr. Shogan, congratulations on becoming the 11<sup>th</sup> Archivist of
the United States.  
   
You’re immensely qualified with a sterling record of service, a clear
commitment to preserving our nation’s unique history, and a deep respect
for this country’s founding principles.  
   
I can’t wait for the next generation of American stories that will be
housed within these walls, under your leadership.  
   
Thank you.
