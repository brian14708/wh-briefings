  \ in Tempe,\_AZ"

“I have made the defense, the protection, and the preservation of
American Democracy the central cause of my presidency.  
   
“From Gettysburg to my Inaugural Address, to the anniversary of the
January 6th insurrection, to Independence Hall in Philadelphia, and
Union Station in Washington, I’ve spoken about the danger of election
denialism and political violence and the battle for the soul of
America.  
   
“Now today in Phoenix, Arizona, at an institute devoted to the defense
of democracy named in honor of a true patriot, I’m here to speak about
another threat to our democracy that we too often ignore: the threat to
our institutions, to our Constitution itself, and the very character of
our nation.”  
   
—  
   
“As I’ve always been clear, democracy is not a partisan issue. It’s an
American issue.  
   
“I have come to honor the McCain Institute and Library because they are
home to a proud Republican who put country first. Our commitment should
be no less because democracy should unite all Americans – regardless of
political affiliation.  
   
“But there is something dangerous happening in America. There is an
extremist movement that does not share the basic beliefs of our
democracy. The MAGA Movement.  
   
“Not every Republican – not even the majority of Republicans – adhere to
the extremist MAGA ideology. I know because I’ve been able to work with
Republicans my whole career. But there is no question that today’s
Republican Party is driven and intimidated by MAGA extremists.  Their
extreme agenda, if carried out, would fundamentally alter the
institutions of American Democracy as we know it.”  
  
—  
   
“As I’ve said before, we’re at an inflection point in our history – one
of those moments that only happens once every few generations. Where the
decisions we make today will determine the course of this country – and
the world – for decades to come.   
   
“So, you, me, and every American who is committed to preserving our
democracy carry a special responsibility. We have to stand up for
America’s values embodied in our Declaration of Independence because we
know MAGA extremists have already proven they won’t. We have to stand up
for our Constitution and the institutions of democracy because MAGA
extremists have made clear they won’t. History is watching. The world is
watching. Most important, our children and grandchildren are watching.
