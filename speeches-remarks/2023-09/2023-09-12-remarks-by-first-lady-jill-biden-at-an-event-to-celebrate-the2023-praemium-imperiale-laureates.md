East Room, The White House

5:18 P.M. EDT

THE FIRST LADY:  Hello, everyone, and welcome to the White House. 
(Applause.)  
   
Too often, our world asks us to sprint from moment to moment, from
meeting to meeting.  We all know that feeling, right?  
   
You know, I just finished my classes and quickly rushed back to the
White House and changed my clothes for this event.  (Applause.)  
   
But art stops us in our tracks.  
   
It feeds our spirit when we’re hungry for something more.  It shows the
contours of our sorrows and our joys so that we know that we’re
not alone.  It brings us back to the beauty and humanity of every
moment.  
   
Art matters.  And that is why we’re here today.  
      
So, I want to congratulate all the amazing recipients of this prize. 
President Biden and I are honored to host you at the White House. 
(Applause.)  
      
In drawings of the night sky, in the lines of a sculpture, in the shade
of newly built structures, in the ringing notes of a trumpet — (laughs)
— in the staging of a play, the artists we honor today invite us to join
a conversation with the world, to step beyond the limits of our
imagination.  
      
It’s a conversation that speaks across borders, languages, and
centuries, as we tilt our heads to see just one more angle, bend our ear
to take in just one more note.  
      
Our hearts and hopes reach toward each other, and in that moment, we
feel the hum of generations that are past and future; the gravitational
pull of art as it changes us, creating something new and full of
promise.  
      
And when we step away, we shine a little bit brighter, seeing the world
around us in new, more beautiful colors.

Thank you all for joining us to celebrate these amazing artists.  It’s
wonderful to see members of the Cabinet — Secretary Haaland — where are
you?

SECRETARY HAALAND:  I’m right here.  
   
THE FIRST LADY:  Ah, that way.  (Laughs.)  That way.  I did see you.  
   
— Ambassador Tai and Representatives Pallone and Matsui — here
supporting this program.  
   
Secretary Clinton, Hillary, it’s an honor to welcome you back to the
White House.  (Applause.)   
   
Wow.  You are so loved.  (Laughter.)  
   
Your lifetime of work has left an indelible mark on this country.  Thank
you for always doing all the good you can, by all the means you can, in
all the ways you can.  (Applause.)  
   
And if you don’t know it, Hillary is a fellow educator now.  So, good
luck this semester.  I know you’re going to love it.  (Laughter.)  
   
And I also want to thank Mr. Hieda and Their Excellencies, the
Ambassadors from Japan to the United States and the United Nations. 
Thank you for joining us today.  
      
Every spring, cherry blossoms burst into bloom in our capital city,
reminders of our strong friendship with Japan.  And earlier this year,
Mrs. Kishida and I planted one more — a new cherry tree on the White
House Lawn.  (Applause.)  
   
But the ties that stretch between our nations are not just forged by
heads of state.  They are also created by people as we share the art and
the pieces of our culture that make our souls sing.  
      
Thank you.  (Applause.)
