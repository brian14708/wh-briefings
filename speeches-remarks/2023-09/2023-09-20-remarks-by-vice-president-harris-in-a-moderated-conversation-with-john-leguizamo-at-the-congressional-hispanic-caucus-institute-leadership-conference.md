*Walter E. Washington Convention Center  
Washington, D.C.*

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, everyone.  (Applause.)    
  
MR. LEGUIZAMO:  Look at all these great faces out there.  This diversity
is so heartwarming.  You didn’t see this four years ago, five years ago,
to see these leaders — future leaders, my Latin diaspora out there.  It
— it’s so heartwarming.  
  
Now, you see my Mets hat.  I’m also a Jets fan.  So, you know I always
have resting asshole face — (laughter) — because we’re always on the
losing end.  But it’s made me strong.   
  
And I’ve been in over 100 movies, not all of them good.  But I got Sid,
the sloth there, you know.  That’s — that’s a little moneymaker.  And
Encanto was great.  But it was — it’s more exciting, my work — not doing
my work, but being here with — with the — Madam Vice President.  This is
more — means more to be in the room where things really happen.  
  
So, I want to start with: You spent a lot of time engaging with the
Latino community, both in D.C. and on the road.  Over the last few
months alone, you visited Chicago for UnidosUS convention that —  
  
AUDIENCE MEMBERS:  Woo!  
   
MR. LEGUIZAMO:  Thank you for that, all three of you.  (Laughter.)   
   
And went to Miami to engage with young climate leaders, made multiple
stops at Latino-owned small businesses, hosted Latino leaders from
across the country at your residence.  And last week, you launched the
“Fight for Your Freedoms Tour” where you are traveling to college
campuses across the country to speak with young leaders about the most
urgent issues at this moment — in particular, the fight for our most
fundamental freedoms.   
  
And then, just yesterday, you were speaking with students at — at
Reading Area Community College, a Hispanic Serving Institution, HSI, in
Pennsylvania.  
  
It’s incredible what — what you’re doing and — and helping us to feel
seen, because this is an important moment. I mean, Latinos — we’re 20
percent of the population, 54 percent of registered voters.  We’re going
to decide the next presidential election, and you’re giving us the
self-worth that we deserve by being here.  Thank you.  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  (Applause.)  
  
MR. LEGUIZAMO:  What — what are you seeing and hearing from — from the
American people?  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, first, let me say it’s an honor to be with
you, John.  I was — we were talking backstage, but I know everyone has
applauded him, but what you have been doing, in particular, with your
most recent project around traveling the country to remind people of the
history of Latinos in the United States, the present, understanding how
we all stand on the shoulders of great Latino leaders, and how it is so
much a part of who we are as a nation.  
  
So, I just want to congratulate you —  
  
MR. LEGUIZAMO:  Thank you.  Thank you.  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — for the way you use your artistry and your
voice.  (Applause.)  
  
So, I’m — I’ve embarked on this college tour.  And I know that everyone
here knows the CHCI, with what you’re doing with the intern — the
interns here, with the fellowship program, which you’ve been doing for
years, bringing up and lifting up our young leaders, and — and I just
decided I wanted to get out of D.C. and get on the road and be with our
young leaders where they are.  And so, I decided to do a college tour,
which I started about two weeks now, and then yesterday, the most recent
one in Reading, Pennsylvania.  
And I just want to say, there are a lot of leaders who are in this room,
many of whom have been here working in Washington, D.C. — toiling in
Washington, D.C., to make sure that we propose and pass public policies
that are relevant to all people, that give dignity to all people, that
understand who the people of our country are and celebrate our diversity
in a way that hopefully is a step toward understanding what we should
celebrate in terms of unity.   
  
That being said, there are lots of challenges that we’re facing right
now as a country. And when I meet with our young leaders, and they’re
all over — and I’m going to give a particular shout out to the Gen Z. 
(Applause.)

  
And when I say freedom, that includes the freedom to just be — free of
hate, free of fear, free to thrive, to be, to have ambition.  And what
gives me optimism is that I think most people agree that it’s worth
fighting for these things because we love our country.  We love our
country.  And it’s worth fighting for.

  
And I think most people do believe that.  And although we might be
seeing some full-on and loud attacks on these freedoms and, by
extension, on our democracy, I do believe that people are prepared and
will always be prepared to stand up in defense of what is right and what
is good and what we believe ourselves to be as the United States of
America.  
  
MR. LEGUIZAMO:  Awesome.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  
  
Thank you for that.  Thank you.  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  
  
MR. LEGUIZAMO:  What a pleasure.  (Applause.)  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  That was fun.  
  
MR. LEGUIZANO:  Awesome.  Thank you.  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Take care, you guys.  (Applause.)
