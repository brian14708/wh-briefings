Oval Office

3:42 P.M. EDT  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Mr. President, it’s an honor to welcome you back to
the White House and to the Oval Office.   
   
And earlier this week at the U.N. General Assembly, I made it clear that
— that no nation can be truly secure in the world if, in fact, we don’t
stand up and defend the freedom of Ukraine from facing this Russian
brutality and aggression.  
   
That’s why we brought together a coalition of more than 50 countries —
more than 50 countries to help Ukraine defend itself, and it’s
critical.   
   
And that’s why, together with our partners in Ukraine, we have provided
humanitarian aid as well as tens of millions of people with food, clean
water, and so much more.  
   
And that’s why — that’s why we’ve begun the process of formalizing our
long-term commitment to Ukraine’s security, alongside the G7 and with
other partners.  
   
And that’s why we support a just and lasting peace, one that respects
Ukrainian sovereignty and its territorial integrity.  
   
Mr. President, the brave people of Ukraine — and that’s not hyperbole;
the people of Ukraine have shown enormous bravery —  enormous bravery —
have inspired the world — literally inspired the world with their
determination to defend these principles.  
   
And together with our partners and allies, the American people are
determined to see to it that we do all we can to ensure the world stands
with you, and that is our overwhelming objective right now.  
   
So, welcome, welcome.  
   
PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY:  Thank you so much.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  We have much to talk about.  
   
PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President — such warm and
strong words to all the Ukrainians from — from you.  Thank you. 
Appreciate it.  
   
I’m glad to meet you.  It’s already the third time this year.  Thank you
for the invitation.  Our regular dialogue has proved that our countries
are really, truly allies and strategic friends.  And we greatly
appreciate the vital assistance provided by the United States to Ukraine
to combat Russian terror — really, terror.  
   
Today, I’m in Washington to strengthen our coalition to defend Ukrainian
children, our families, our homes, freedom, and democracy in the
world.   
   
And I started my day in the U.S. Congress to thank its members and to
people of America for all the big, huge support.  
   
I’ve felt trust between us, and it’s allowed us to have a frank and
constructive dialogue, Mr. President.  And this trust and support I felt
from both chambers and both parties.  I’m grateful for this.  
   
Then, with the First Lady, I honored innocent victims of September 11
Memorial in Pentagon.  All those who — tragedy — death — who died on
American Airlines Flight 77.  It’s very important to all in the world to
remember the victims of terror and value everyone who fights with it.  
   
And now, I look forward, Mr. President, to our discussion for the
benefit of our nations and the world.   
   
When it comes to weapons, we will discuss everything, with a special
emphasis on air defense.  And just to say that — especially this day —
one year ago, we had — we made a big exchange of prisoners — war
prisoners and journalists.  
   
And it was on this day when we got and brought home defenders of
Azovstal.  And also citizens of the United States — not — that we — we
did it — Alexander Drueke and Andrew Tai Huynh, both from — both from
Alabama.   
   
Thank you, Mr. President.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you.   
   
Thank you all very much.  
   
(Cross-talk.)  
   
Q   Mr. Zelenskyy, are you — aren’t you concerned that you’re losing
Poland over the grain export dispute?  Are you concerned that you’re
losing a friend?  
   
PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY:  Our friends with Poland?  Our friends, we are very
thankful to Polish people, Polish society for all of — for their
support.   
   
That’s it.  Thank you.
