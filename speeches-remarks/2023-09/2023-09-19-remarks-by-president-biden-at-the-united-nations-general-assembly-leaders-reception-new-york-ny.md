THE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible.)  Hello, hello?  There you go.  (Applause.) 

Everybody, welcome.  (Laughs.)  My fellow leaders and friends, it’s an
honor to welcome you here tonight.  And I first want to thank Governor
Hochul.  I don’t know where — the governor is here somewhere. 
(Applause.) 

Gov, great to see you.  Kathy, thank you very much for everything this
great city has done to make this General Assembly a success.

And I’m also grateful to the Director of Met, Max Hollein.  Max, thank
you and — for allowing us to gather here in this beautiful hall.

Seventy-seven years ago, at the grand hall in London, our forebearers
gathered for the first United Nations General Assembly.  With honors —
World War Two and the horrors of it weighing on their hearts and the
hopes of humanity resting on their shoulders, they opened the Assembly
by declaring, quote, “The whole world now waits upon our
decisions…looking to us to show ourselves capable of mastering our
problems.”  End of quote.

Ladies and gentlemen, we gather once again in the halls of history, with
the whole world looking at us to lead, to prove ourselves worthy, to
show ourselves capable of coming together to master the challenges of
our time.

Like our predecessors, we face a moment of great upheaval.  A moment
where basic principles like sovereignty, territorial integrity,
universal human rights are being tested.    
   
You know, the mom- — a moment in historical challenges, from
accelerating climate crisis to a once-in-a-century pandemic, have
exposed inequity and exacerbated insecurities across the world.   
   
A moment where a member of the United Nations Security Council has
launched a brazen and brutal attack against the people of Ukraine —
attacks that go against the very character of the United Nations,
against the very principles that have been the cornerstone of peace and
prosperity since the first Assembly 77 years ago.

Earlier today, I stood before the General Assembly and asked my fellow
leaders a question: Will we do what we must be — must be done to address
these challenges?  Will we live up to the promise we made to ourselves
and to each other and to generations to come?

There can only be one answer to those questions: We must.  We must.  We
must. 

And because of all the leaders in this room, I know that we will.

Over the past two years, I’ve seen how all of you have worked to open
the immense opportunities in the face of such immense challenges.  How,
together, we bridged the public and private sector to pioneer new ways
forward on everything from technology to healthcare to human rights. 
How, day in and day out, you have worked to support the world’s most
vulnerable. 

So, tonight my message is simple: Thank you.  Thank you, thank you.  And
keep it up.  (Applause.)

Folks, our world stands at an inflection point, where the decisions we
make now are going to determine our future for decades to come. 

We need you to help us set the course on a more stable and secure path. 
We need to continue tackling the challenges that most affect people’s
lives, from conflict to climate change to corruption and beyond. 

We need you to partner with one another and with leaders around the
world to sustain and update the institutions that have supported decades
of progress since World War Two. 

We need you to help us unlock the trillions of private investment needed
to accelerate progress and meet our highest hopes for humanity: ending
hunger, eliminating poverty, expanding access to clean water and clean
energy, reducing gender inequality, and increasing the quality of
education and decent work, safe infrastructure. 

Reaching these hopes will take all of us.  So, let me close with this.

This museum — and if you haven’t had a chance to go through it, if
you’ve not tonight, come back — contains some of the world’s greatest
artifacts and artworks, including some of the copies of work of one my
favorite poets, an Irishman named Seamus Heaney. 

He wrote a poem called “The Cure at Troy.”  And it seems appropriate
tonight.  He said, “History says, don’t hope on this side of the grave. 
But then, once in a lifetime, that longed-for tidal wave of justice
rises up, and hope and history rhyme.”

Ladies and gentlemen, this is an age where we can once more make hope
and history rhyme if we stick together, where together and only together
can we can bend the arc of history in a better direction.

Like our forebearers all those years ago, the world is not only waiting
on us, it’s depending on us to master our challenges, to prove ourselves
capable of forging a better future for humankind — one of greater
dignity, opportunity, and security for all.

So, thank you all for being here.  And I look forward — I look forward
to working together with all of you in the years ahead.

May God bless you all.  May God protect our troops.  Thank you, thank
you, thank you.  (Applause.)
