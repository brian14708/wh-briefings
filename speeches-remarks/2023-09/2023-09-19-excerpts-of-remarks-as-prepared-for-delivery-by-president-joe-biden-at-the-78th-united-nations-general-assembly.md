“The United States seeks a more secure, more prosperous, more equitable
world for all people, because we know our future is bound up with yours.
And no nation can meet the challenges of today alone.”  
   
—  
   
“Record breaking heatwaves in the United States and China. Wildfires
ravaging North America and Southern Europe. A fifth year of drought in
the Horn of Africa. Tragic flooding in Libya  that has killed thousands
of people. Taken together these snapshots tell an urgent story of what
awaits us if we fail to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and begin
to climate-proof our world. From day one of my Administration the United
States has treated this crisis as the existential threat that it is, not
only to us, but to all of humanity.”  
   
—  
   
“Russia believes that the world will grow weary and allow it to
brutalize Ukraine without consequence.  But I ask you this: If we
abandon the core principles of the UN Charter to appease an aggressor,
can any member state feel confident that they are protected? If we allow
Ukraine to be carved up, is the independence of any nation secure?  
   
“The answer is no. We must stand up to this naked aggression today to
deter other would-be aggressors tomorrow.  
   
“That is why the United States together with our Allies and partners
around the world will continue to stand with the brave people of Ukraine
as they defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity – and their
freedom.”
