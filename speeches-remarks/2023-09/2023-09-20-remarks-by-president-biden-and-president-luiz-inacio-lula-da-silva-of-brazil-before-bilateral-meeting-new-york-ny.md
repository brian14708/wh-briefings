PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, Mr. President, it’s great to see you again. 
Welcome to New York.  
   
You know, when I hosted you at the White House in February, you said
that we have an obligation to leave the next generation a better world,
and I couldn’t agree with you more.   
   
And Brazil and the United States are meeting that obligation together —
at least that is our intention.  We’ve begun it, and we’re going to
continue.   
   
We’re working in lockstep to tackle the climate crisis, including
mobilizing hundreds of millions of dollars to conserve the Amazon and
the critical ecosystems in Latin America.  And we’ve advanced our work
together through the Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation to promote
inclusive economic growth.   
   
And the two largest democracies in the Western Hemisphere are standing
up for human rights around the world and in the hemisphere.  That
includes workers’ rights.  And I’m honored we’re going to launch a new
Partnership for Workers’ Rights in just a few moments.   
   
So, Mr. President, thank you for being here today.  And I look forward
to continuing to work together to build a better world, including during
your G20 presidency this year, which I’m anxious to work with you
throughout the year.   
   
Thank you.   
   
The floor is yours, sir.   
   
PRESIDENT LULA:  (As interpreted.)  President Biden, first of all, I
would like to say to you, sir, the satisfaction — great pleasure it is
for us to have a meeting on the part of the Brazilian government with
the American government.   
   
I believe that this is a historical moment that should serve as a role
model when we look to the geopolitics in the world and we perceive that
the opportunities are becoming narrower and narrower, and democracy is
becoming more and more — it’s more and more in danger, because the
denial of politics have made that far-right sectors try to occupy the
space due to the denial of politics around the world.   
   
This already happened already in Brazil, and now it’s starting in
Argentina, and it’s going on in many other countries.   
   
The fact that we’re getting closer, Brazil and the U.S., and this
initiative that was proposed by President Biden that we should build a
work plan so that we can offer to our youth, to our people, perspectives
of a decent job, of a more skilled and qualified work — trying to
benefit from the climate energy transition — the energy transition, try
to take advantage of the AI.  It is necessary that we should present a
concrete proposal to arouse hope in civil society that lives as working
families.  
   
I followed your speech at — during the inauguration.  And then
afterwards, I followed another of your speech.  And I’ve never seen
before a U.S. president talk so much and so well of the workers as you
talk as t- — referring to the workers.  And this was — the Italians —
the labor federations asked for me — asking me about your speech, and
the Italian labor movement and other in Europe was — the U.S. president
most advocated for the workers’ rights.   
   
And this is a perfect combination, because I come from the labor world,
and I think that labor has and work has become precarious work. 
Salaries are very low, and the workers work more and gain less.   
   
And this idea from you, Mr. President, to present a joint proposal that
we can start to discuss and go and take it to the G20, I believe this
initiative is very important for Brazil.  And I believe it’s also
important for the U.S., but it’s also important for the rest of the
world.   
   
So, I believe that there is one thing that is important that’s going on
in this political juncture in the world.  We had the return of democracy
in Brazil.  And we built all the political alliances, and we had to
really build them again.  And we will chair the BRICS me- — process in
2025.  And we will chair the G20 next year.  And we’ll have COP30 in
2026.  All that, we can do it sharing with the U.S. government.   
   
And so, I believe that is extremely important that we can work
together.  I believe that it’s important that the U.S., North America
should see what’s going on in Brazil in this historical moment of
ecological transition, changes in the energy matrix, and the potential
that our country has in terms of investment in wind power, solar power,
biomass, biodiesel, biofuels, ethanol, and green hydrogen.   
   
So, there is a prospective — a joint work that is an exceptional
situation for Brazil and the U.S.   
   
So, at this meeting here, Mr. President, I believe that it’s more than
just another bilateral.  It’s a — it’s a faith relationship that we’re
building here and a new era for the U.S.-Brazil relation, amongst equal
partners, a sovereign relationship, but of common interest in the
benefit of the working people in your country and in my country.   
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Mr. President, I couldn’t agree with you more.  
   
I know I’m not supposed to speak again, but my dad used to have an
expression.  When I was growing up, my father had an expression.  My
father was a — did not have a college degree, but he was a well-read
man, and he worked very hard his whole life.  He’d say, “Joe, a job is
about a lot more than a paycheck.  It’s about your dignity.  It’s about
self-respect.  It’s about being able to look your children in the eye
and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay,’ and mean it.”   
   
Everyone deserves an equal shot.  And that’s why we’ve tried to build an
economy — and from a different perspective, Mr. President, from the
middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.  Because when the middle
does well, everybody does well.  Working-class folks have a chance to
move up, and the wealthy still do fine, as long as they pay their
taxes.  
   
But at any rate — so, I’m really looking forward to working with you.  I
really am.  
   
PRESIDENT LULA:  (As interpreted.)  And, President, we are always trying
to convince the rich people that the less poor exists in humanity — the
fewer the poor, it will even be better for the rich.  So, poverty and
inequality is not of the interest of anybody.   
   
And so, I believe that this gesture that we are achieving here in the
heart of the U.S., trying to arouse expectations for high hopes.   
   
I worked 27 years inside a plant.  I’ve seen unemployment.  I’ve
experienced unemployment.  I experienced — I should say, yesterday, my
labor minister visited the trade unionists from the U.S. that are on
strike, and they had a very good meeting.  And I think that this is a
golden moment for us and the possibilities that we have ahead.  
   
And we’re arousing for a dream — for those kids that are 18, 19, 20
years of age — this youth that has no perspective.  I think that this
gesture of ours could be service for hope so that people can start to
believe that, yes, it is possible to build another world.  Another world
is possible with more fraternity, with more solidarity, more — with more
fairness — and that humanity goes back to humanism, that people should
demonstrate more solidarity.   
   
In Brazil, we always say the following: It is necessary to make that
hope will overcome fear.  This is the motto, and this gesture here is —
we are arousing hope for millions and millions of Brazilians and
Americans that need to have an opportunity to live their lives, to be a
winner, and to build their families with de- — through decent work.  
   
So, that’s why it’s extremely important.  
   
You know — you know that I’m a president that has not carried a
university degree.  The only thing that I have is a vocational training
degree.  And I believe that this gives me a different kind of vision of
the world, where a part of the Brazilian class in Brazil doesn’t manage
to see.  
   
And so, that’s why we decided to develop so many social-inclusion
policies and we’re trying to reach a bar that will take people to have
life with more dignity.  And in the eight months that we’re in office,
we already restoring democracy procedures in Brazil.  We have already
recovered 42 social pol- — social-inclusion policies.   
   
We have already drafted an investment plan.  For the first time and
under a democratic regime, we just passed a tax reform in the house of
representatives.  And I think that this will allow that Brazil can have
a quality leap forward.   
   
And I believe that the relationship between the U.S. and Brazil would be
improved and that we can behave as friends seeking a common objective:
development and improving the lives of our people.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  You know, the Secretary of — I know the staff is going
crazy.  They’re supposed to say — we were supposed to ask the press to
leave a long time ago.  But I want to say one more thing.  
   
Our Secretary of Treasury pointed out, they did — the Treasury
Department did a significant report and pointed out that — and this is a
fact — that when organized labor is engaged and involved, everyone does
better.  The wealthy do better.  Everyone does better.  When you
eradicate poverty, when you bring people up to a living standard that’s
real, everyone benefits.  The whole economy benefits.  
   
And that’s why I sent you the best ambassador in America to make sure
you’re all set.  
   
At any rate, we — we better get down to business, I guess, here.
