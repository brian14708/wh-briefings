Q    What do you make of these attacks between Iran and Pakistan?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  As you can see, Iran is not particularly well-liked in
the region. 

Q    Yeah.

THE PRESIDENT:  And where — where that goes, we’re working on now.  I
don’t know where that goes.  
   
Q    And how was your — how was your meeting yesterday?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I thought the meeting went well yesterday.  I thought
the meeting went well.  
   
Q    What are the sticking points on the border agreement?  Where are
the disagreements you’re working on?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t think we have any sticking points left.  
   
Q    Are the airstrikes in Yemen working?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, when you say “working,” are they stopping the
Houthis?  No.  Are they going to continue?  Yes.  
   
Q    Mr. President, how do you feel about aid for Ukraine after
yesterday’s meeting with members of Congress?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I think the vast majority of members of Congress support
aid to Ukraine.  The question is whether or not a small minority are
going to hold it up, which would be — which would be a disaster.  
   
Q    How concerned are you with the Arab American votes during this
election?  And what Iowa means to you, to your reelection race?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don’t think Iowa means anything.  The President
got 50-some-thousand votes — the lowest number of votes anybody who’s
won got.  You know, this idea that it’s been a runaway, I think he can
characterize it any way he wants.  I’ll let them make that judgment.  
   
What was the second part of the question?  
   
Q    The part was: Are you concerned with the Arab American votes voting
for you during this election because of Gaza?  Many say they will not
vote for you.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, look, the President wants to put a — the former
President wants to put a ban on Arabs coming into the country.  We’ll
make sure he — we understand who cares about the Arab population, number
one.  
   
Number two, we got a long way to go in terms of settling the situation
in Gaza.  
   
(Cross-talk.)

Q    The March for Life is tomorrow in Washington, D.C. — the March for
Life is tomorrow in Washington, D.C.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, I know that.  
   
Q    What’s your message to those attending?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  March.  
   
(Cross-talk.)  
   
Q    Sir — sir, can you talk about inflation?  When will prices come
down?

Q    Should anybody be held for — should anybody be held criminally
responsible for failures after the Uvalde shooting?  Should anybody be
held responsible with criminal charges?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I have not read the full report.  The report will be out
today —  
   
Q    Today.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  — number one.  We’re going to do what we can to
implement the recommendations of the Justice Department.  But I don’t
know if there is any criminal liability.  I — I have not read the
report.  
   
Q    Were you — were you briefed by the Attorney General on this?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I was briefed by my staff on it.  
   
(Cross-talk.)

THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
