South Lawn

Q    Mr. President, do you have a reaction to the Taiwan election?

THE PRESIDENT:  We do not support independence.  (Inaudible.)

Q    Mr. President, would you call the situation on the southern border
a “crisis”?

THE PRESIDENT:  No, but I wish they would react.  I’ve been pushing them
— my Republican colleagues — since I got into office.  I think we have
to make major changes at the border.  I’ve been pushing it.  I’m
prepared to make significant alterations at the border.  And there are
negotiations going on for the last five weeks, so I’m hopeful we’ll get
there. 

(Cross-talk.)

THE PRESIDENT:  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Q    Any comment — any comment —

Q    What’s your message to Iran —

THE PRESIDENT:  Pardon me?

Q    What’s next with support for Ukraine?    

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, if my Republican colleagues don’t fund Ukraine,
they’re going to have an awful lot of — to pay for, in terms of
(inaudible).

Q    Mr. President, any comment — any comment on the political change in
Poland as the new pro-European Union government is taking over?

THE PRESIDENT:  I think that’s very good — pro-European.

Q    Are you going to invite Polish — the new Polish Prime Minister to
the White House?

Q    Do you have a message to Iran in the face of all these attacks from
the Houthis? 

THE PRESIDENT:  I’ve delivered — we’ve delivered it privately, and we’re
confident we’re well prepared.   

Q    Are you (inaudible) executive action when it comes to the border to
address the border crisis if Republicans don’t pass more funding?

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, Republicans have to pass funding.  They have to —
I’ve read one Republican said, “We don’t want our border (inaudible)
it’ll only help Biden.”

I’ve been pushing for fundamental change on the border for a long time —
a long time.  And so, I’m hopeful.  I’m going to let those negotiations
play out.  But other than that, I’m going to take action myself.

Thank you.
