  \ | Allentown,\_PA"

4:55 P.M. EST  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, folks, end of a good day.  We came up here to the
Allentown area and the greater area to make sure what we’re — Bobby and
I — the Senator and I were doing — along with the Governor — was making
some sense and affecting people’s attitudes.  
   
I’ve said before that, you know, starting a new business is an act of
hope.  And a lot of people came out of the last several years — the
previous several years kind of down.  
   
You know, I was talking with the — the owners of the coffee shop, and
you — you saw me taking them around.  And I said, “You know, I think we
underestimate the impact that the failure to respond to the COVID crisis
quickly enough had on the psyche of the American people.”  And they were
— and they surprised me.  They said, “Well, I know it did with us.”  
   
You had over a million people dying — a million people dying, and we had
trouble at the front end of realizing there wasn’t much done to deal
with it.  And we ramped up rapidly vaccinations and the like.   
   
And that generated a comment from our host and hostess telling us that
they — they had real troubles.  One, the young woman who went to the —
college graduate, very impressive young woman, owns the coffee shop —
she was talking about how she had suffered from post-traumatic stress
and all the things that were happening around her and the loss of hope
and faith she had.  
   
And then he, the husband, started talking about how he suffered from
depression.  But when they started to see what was happening, that we
were actually investing in the community — you guys know people who’ve
had post-traumatic stress — in the military and firefighters and the
like — and how they began to gain some hope.  
   
And they talked about how the increase in the Obamacare being available
to them and the 800 dol- — extra dollars — how it made a difference in
their lives in getting the help they needed from the hospitals that they
were dealing with.   
   
And they just went on and on about how what happened is, once they were
able to fund the business — and they got help to do that —  
   
SENATOR CASEY:  Mm-hmm.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  — as well, through you and others — that they — they
started to gain faith in what was going on.  
   
And then talking to a lot of the business owners here.  You’ve heard me
say it before, and I apologize for repeating it because you hear it all
the time, but I got tired of — so did Bobby — the trickle-down
economics.  You know, if everybody — if the big guys do well, everybody
does well.   
   
Well, you know, that may have been — occurred, but I’m not a big fan,
never had been, of that.  I’ve always believed if the middle class does
well, everybody does well, the wealthy do very well, and the poor have a
ladder up.  
   
And — and so, they — all of them talked about how the number of people
coming into their coffee shop, the number of people come into the bike
shop, the number of people coming into the running store, how the — the
demography started changing, people started to be more engaged.  And
there is a real, genuine sense of optimism. 

And I — and they talked about childcare and how — and how, originally,
when we had passed the legislation that — for the Child Care Tax Credit,
how that altered their life and ability to deal with their medical
problems at the time because they had help being able to take care of
their — of their kids.  
   
And so, what we’ve talked about is we’re going to make sure that we’re
going to follow on.  This is not the end of what we’re doing.  We’re
going to make sure that there is childcare available.  It helps
everybody.  It’s not only — not a — a impact on the — on the taxpayer;
it generates economic growth.  Because when you can continue to work, if
you have a child that needs help or needs to be taken care of, it
generates economic growth.  Everybody does better.  
   
And then they talked about — I was talking to the guys here and in other
places about the money we got here from the SAFER act — able to hire
more cop- — more cops — more firefighters and the way you built this
training center.  The idea that now you have a first-rate training
center that goes all the way — I guess you got — you got Binghamton, you
got — not Binghamton, excuse me — you got — from Scranton.  You’ve got
what’s happening all across, up and down this state and this area where
you — we have the best-trained firefighters in the world.  
   
And, by the way, it matters.  These guys risk their lives.  Not a joke. 
And it matters to know they know — they know what they’re doing.  It
matters to know when they — so, anyway.  
   
I just came away from this really reassured that what we’ve done has had
an impact not just here in Eastern Pennsylvania and — but — in the
Northeast, but throughout the country.  And we’re going to do more.  We
— the job is not finished.  
   
Bobby, you want to say anything?  
   
SENATOR CASEY:  Mr. President, we’re glad you’re here today, and we’re —
we welcome the President back to Pennsylvania here in the Lehigh Valley
to be in — in the Allentown area, to be in Emmaus today to meet with
small-business owners and to talk about their real lives and their
challenges.   
   
A lot of those challenges that they had during the early time — early
period of his first couple of years as President would have — would have
been much more challenging without the American Rescue Plan.   
   
Just think about it this way.  We’re in Lehigh County.  This county
alone had 70,000 families benefited by the — the Child Tax Credit.  And
throughout our state, more than 80 percent of the families who —
families with children benefited from the Child Tax Credit.  
   
So, that helped for families.  They helped us for small businesses that
came from the American Rescue Plan.  The investments here from
infrastructure, whether it’s — whether it’s roads, or bridges, or
high-speed Internet.  
   
So, what we’ve got to continue to do together is to focus on those real
challenges that families face, those small businesses face, get those
costs down for families.  And a lot of those — a lot of those costs in
grocery stores are — are high because of one reason: corporate greed. 
That’s what drove up those costs.  
   
The President has been trying to get those costs down.  I have as well. 
One of the best ways to do that is to help those families directly and —
and to go after companies that are jacking up their food prices — these
big conglomerates — and then you go to your local grocery store, and the
costs are high.  
   
So, the President has been working to get those costs down, as I have,
and we’ll continue that fight.  I hope Republicans will join us in that
effort to lower costs for families.   
   
But we’re honored to be here with the firefighters and to once again
affirm the — the valor that they demonstrate every day to protect this
community.  We’re just so grateful for your service and the commitment
you make to this — this community.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  And, by the way, all this is connected.  You know, we’ve
invested, because of the Infrastructure Act — I want to get the number
right — I think it’s roughly — how many billion dollars?  $145 billion
so far.   
   
For example, you know, when you — when you increase the number of jobs,
that increases the number of customers.  When you increase the number of
customers, it increases the sense of stability.  When you increase that
— I mean, it just goes across the board.  
   
And so, we’re talking about 26,000 manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania
just since we became President.  Twenty-four thousand — it was down
twenty-four thousand jobs under my predecessor.  Because we invested —
we invested in the infrastructure bill.  We invested in the people who,
in fact, need the opportunity to have a good job.  
   
And I’ll end by saying — you’ve heard me say it a thousand times, but
it’s worth saying because it’s the kind of language we understood in the
neighborhoods I grew up in.  My dad said, “Joey, a job is about a lot
more than your paycheck.  It’s about your dignity.  It’s about
opportunity.  It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say,
‘Honey, everything is going to be okay.’”  
   
It’s interesting.  One of the owners in one of the shops — I don’t have
permission to say the name, so I won’t, but if you — but I can check, if
you want me to — saying that, “I can look at my kid now and say, ‘It’s
going to be okay.  We’re going to make it.  We’re going to make it.’”  
   
A lot more to do.  We’re not finished.  But it’s just — this has a
self-fulfilling prophecy when — and, again — I’ll give you one last
example.  We talked about prescription drugs with — with the folks.  The
idea that prescription drugs — and we — us being able to pass a
requirement that Medicare has to negotiate drug prices was — you know,
people say, “Well, that costs money.”  Guess what?  It saves the
taxpayers billions of dollars — billions of dollars — billions of
dollars.  
   
It not only takes the burden — for example, insulin.  It costs 10 bucks
to make, total of around 12 bucks when you package it all.  They can now
only charge $35, and Medicare will only pay out 35 bucks.  It was
costing $400 or more.  Who was paying that?  In addition to saving the
taxpayer, you’re not — your taxes aren’t having to pay 400 bucks.  
   
And so, we’re going to make — by the way, we’re going to go back and
we’re going to get — make sure it applies to everybody, not just seniors
—  
   
SENATOR CASEY:  Yeah.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  — before it’s all over.  Anyway.  
   
Thank you.  I’ll take a few questions.  I got —  
   
Q    Mr. President, polling still shows that more Americans than not
still disapprove of your handling of the economy.  So, what specifically
will you do this year to turn that around and make Americans feel better
about how the economy is doing?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  If you notice, they’re feeling much better about how the
economy is doing.  What we haven’t done is letting them know exactly who
got it changed.  That’s the part.  That’s what’s happening.  
   
If you look at the consumer confidence measures, they’re way up. 
Looking across the board, everybody is doing better.  And they believe
it; they know it.  And they’re just beginning to sink in.   
   
One of the things that people don’t know — I mean, the idea that the
people — the firefighters know — but the idea that I — because of what I
did in terms of the funding for fire departments.  Guess what?  They got
a fire school now here.  Guess who’s paying for it?  Not local.  The
federal government is paying for it.  
   
And guess what?  It’s changing the dynamic, and people — find somebody
here who thinks there shouldn’t be a fire school here.  Find somebody
who thinks that doesn’t make sense.  And it’s going to save money over
time because you’re going to save property, you’re going to save lives,
you’re going to save a lot of things.  
   
And so, it’s a matter of this — none of what we passed was able — and I
knew it when I — when I proposed it.  Remember when I would — proposed
the — the infrastructure bill, and I said it’s going to be over $350
billion?  And you all looked at me like I’ve taken leave of my senses. 
Well, I never thought — it’s going to take time.  It’s starting to sink
in to people what’s happening.  
   
Same way with the healthcare piece.  All of a sudden, people are
realizing, “My God, not only insulin going down.”  We’re going to have
15 more drugs where now they’re going to be able to negotiate the
price.  Prices are going to come down dramatically.  
   
Any of you have a prescription drug from an American company?  You give
me that drug, I’ll go have it — I’ll — you give you that prescription,
I’ll have it filled in — in Toronto or London or Brazil.  Guess what? 
It costs a hell of a lot less.  Same company, same outfit.   
   
And the last thing is — one of the things that’s going to have an impact
is, and I know it doesn’t matter to you guys –I’m being facetious; I
shouldn’t kid like that — but when you want to call and check the
balance on your account, you get charged 30 bucks.  Is that fair?  Is
that fair, these junk fees?   
   
You’re going to go home for — for Easter or you’re going to go home for
Christmas, you’re going to go home for the holidays with your kid, and
you find out to get your kid sitting next to you is going to cost you
another 200 bucks.  These are junk fees.  And guess what?  We’re getting
rid of them.   
   
So, people are beginning to figure out what it is that — the reason why
they got these opportunities, why it occurred.  And that’s my job and
our job to make sure people know.  
   
Q    Mr. President —  
   
Q    Mr. President, you said — just to follow up on what you said a — a
few minutes ago at the coffee shop.  You said you think the Houthis are
a terrorist group.  I’m wondering how soon are you willing to designate
them as such.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  It’s irrelevant whether they’re designated.  We’ve put
together a group of nations that are going to say that if they continue
to act and behave as they do, we’ll respond.  
   
Q    You said —  
   
Q    And — and a quick one on oil prices, sir.  Oil hit $80 a barrel
this morning after the strikes.  How concerned are you about the impact
the strikes will have on oil supply and prices?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m very concerned.  That’s why we’ve got to stop it.  
   
AIDE:  Last question.   
   
Q    Sir, how was your conversa- —  
   
Q    What do you say to members of your own party that believe you
needed congressional authorit- — authorization for last night’s
strike?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m sorry?  
   
Q    What do you say to members of your own party who are saying you
needed congressional authorization for last night’s strike?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  They’re wrong.  And I sent up the — I sent up this
morning, when the strikes occurred, exactly what happened.  
   
(Cross-talk.)  
   
Q    Sir, how was your conversation with Speaker Johnson?  
   
Q    Mr. President, are you — are you concerned —  
   
Q    How was your conversation with Speaker Johnson?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I — I was pleased with my conversation with Speaker
Johnson.  And apparently, today, he said he’s sticking by the deal.  
   
AIDE:  Thanks, everybody.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  That matters.  Thanks.
