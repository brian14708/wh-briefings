Council on Foreign Relations  
Washington, D.C.

MR. SULLIVAN:  At least I had the bravery to give that speech at
Brookings rather than at CFR.  So — (laughter) —

Mike, I want to say thank you for having me back at CFR.  And to Susan
and Kurt and Charlene and Steve, thank you for having me back at the
UCSD China Forum, which I’ve had the privilege of actually attending
since its inauguration.  I would say San Diego in January is a little
nicer than D.C. in January, but we’ll make do here.  
   
My aim today is not to try to unveil a new China strategy, but something
more straightforward: to share with you behind the curtain how we’ve
tried to implement our strategy over the last three years and then what
we might expect here in 2024.  And in the course of that, without
directly answering the questions Mike has posed, perhaps provide a
little grist for the mill that can help over the next couple of days as
you grapple with these very difficult questions.  
   
I want to start by taking a step back.  
   
Before serving in the Biden administration, many of us who are now in
government — including myself and Kurt and others — were revisiting the
assumptions behind our longstanding China policy in writing and in
conferences like this one.  And once in government, we immersed
ourselves in the latest intelligence, expertise, and analysis.  
   
We determined that the PRC was the only state with both the intent to
reshape the international order and the economic, diplomatic, military,
and technological power to do it.  We saw that the PRC sought to “catch
up and surpass” the United States in high technology; that it was
pursuing the largest peacetime military buildup in history; and that it
was more repressive at home and more assertive abroad, including in the
South and East China Seas as well as the Taiwan Strait.  We saw the PRC
working to make the world more dependent on China while reducing its own
dependence on the world.  And we saw it taking steps to adapt the
international system to accommodate its own system and preferences.  
   
We also saw something that really stood out, which is that the PRC
believed the United States was in terminal decline — that our industrial
base had been hollowed out, that our commitment to our allies and
partners had been undercut, that the United States was struggling to
manage a once-in-a-century pandemic, and that many in Beijing were
openly proclaiming that “the East was rising and the West was
falling.”  
   
When we came into office, we inherited an approach from the previous
administration that had updated the diagnosis of the scope and nature of
the China challenge but had not adequately developed the strategy and
tools to address it.  That approach was at times more confrontational
than competitive, and too often undervalued the allies and partners
critical to sustaining an effective China strategy.  
   
But we did not want to return to an earlier approach with the PRC, one
based on more optimistic assumptions about its trajectory and that
sometimes prioritized avoiding friction over pursuing the American
national interest.  So we developed our own approach, which Secretary
Blinken laid out in a speech a couple of years ago — invest, align,
compete — that sought to strengthen our competitive position and secure
our interests and values while carefully managing this vital
relationship.  
   
And over the past three years, we’ve implemented that approach.  We’ve
made far-reaching investments in the foundation of American strength at
home with historic legislation on infrastructure, chips and science, and
clean energy, all while addressing the PRC’s non-market practices and
taking steps to ensure that the United States would lead in the sources
of technological and economic growth.   
   
We believe our approach has generated results.  Large-scale investments
in semiconductor and clean-energy production in the United States are up
20-fold since 2019.  Construction spending on new manufacturing projects
has already doubled.  And looking out over the next decade, we’re
estimating $3.5 trillion in new public and private investment, unlocked
by the investments made in the historic legislation I just
referenced.   
   
Abroad, we’ve tried to strengthen our ties with Indo-Pacific allies and
partners in ways that would have been unlikely, even inconceivable, a
few years ago.  We launched AUKUS.  We elevated the Quad.  We upgraded
our relationship with Vietnam, the Philippines, India, Indonesia, and
others.  
   
We launched a historic trilateral with Japan and the Republic of Korea
that culminated in a historic summit that President Biden hosted at Camp
David.   
   
We held summits — multiple summits — with the leaders of the Pacific
Islands as well as with ASEAN.  
   
Our regional allies and partners, for their part, are betting on
American economic vitality.  They’ve announced almost $200 billion of
investments into the United States since the start of the
administration.  
   
We’ve also worked to connect our European and Indo-Pacific alliances. 
And together with our G7 partners, we’ve aligned on collective steps to
de-risk our economies and diversify away from strategic dependencies
rather than decoupling.  And alongside our allies and partners, we’ve
stressed the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the
Taiwan Strait.  
   
We’ve also worked hard to ensure that advanced and sensitive
technologies our companies are developing do not become a source of
vulnerability.  We implemented carefully tailored export restrictions on
key technologies; focused on advanced semiconductor manufacturing tools
— a topic, by the way, that was central to one of the earlier UCSD
forums when I first really got immersed in this question of
semiconductor manufacturing equipment; supercomputing capabilities; and
the most advanced chips critical to military modernization.  
   
We also took steps to regulate outbound investments of concern in
technology and to strengthen CFIUS’s focus on critical technologies to
make sure inbound investment actually addresses evolving national
security challenges — the screening regime for inbound investment.  
   
These steps are not about protectionism, and they’re not about holding
anybody back.  They’re critical for our national security over the long
run.  
   
Now, the backdrop to these actions was the strongest post-pandemic
recovery and among the lowest inflation of any leading economy in the
world.  For years, economists were predicting that the PRC would
overtake the United States in GDP either in this decade or the next. 
Now those projections are moving further and further out.  And with the
PRC facing its own set of challenges, some say that moment may never
come.  
   
And this brings me to a critical point: America, in this moment, is once
more showing its capacity for resilience and reinvention.  
   
But this is not the whole story.  And that’s what’s really critical
about the remarks I want to give today.  
   
As we took these steps to improve our competitive position, we aimed to
do so in a way that built stability into one of the world’s most
consequential relationships — perhaps the world’s most consequential
relationship.  And, in fact, we believe our investments at home and our
work to deepen ties with allies and partners abroad actually created the
conditions for more effective diplomacy with the PRC.  
   
A sustainable China policy is about holding in one’s head multiple
truths at the same time and working iteratively to reconcile them.  We
are clear-eyed about the competitive structural dynamics in our
relationship with the PRC.  But we’re also keenly aware that the United
States and the PRC are economically interdependent and share interests
in addressing transnational problems and reducing the risk of
conflict.  
   
We realize that efforts, implied or explicit, to shape or change the PRC
over several decades did not succeed.  We expect that the PRC will be a
major player on the world stage for the foreseeable future.  That means
that even as we compete, we have to find ways to live alongside one
another.  
   
Competition with the PRC does not have to lead to conflict,
confrontation, or a new Cold War.  The United States can take steps to
advance its interests and values and those of its allies and partners on
the one hand, while responsibly managing competition on the other. 
Being able to do both of those things is at the heart of our approach. 
And in fact, the United States has decades of experience talking to and
even working with our competitors when our interests call for it.   
   
Over the last year, we’ve called on that experience.  And while
“managing competition” can feel like an abstract slogan, the best way to
understand how it translates into action is to “zoom in” on 2023.  
   
The year began with the relationship at a historic low point.  A year
ago this week, a Chinese spy balloon traveled across the United States. 
We were, and remain, deeply concerned about the PRC providing Russia
with lethal aid in its invasion of Ukraine.  And after historic and
unprecedented — and not historic in a positive sense — PRC military
exercises in August of 2022, it seemed a series of cross-Strait crises
loomed over the horizon.  
   
All of this set back the progress from the Bali summit between President
Biden and President Xi.  High-level communication halted, to say nothing
of military-to-military ties or cooperation on counternarcotics or
climate — all of which the PRC had frozen.  
   
We set out to stabilize the relationship without sacrificing our
capacity to strengthen our alliances, compete vigorously, and defend our
interests.  
   
Beginning in May of last year, we launched a period of intensive
diplomacy.  It was an all-hands-on-deck effort across the Cabinet
spanning the full range of our relationship with the PRC.  The goal was
not to paper over our differences.  Our aim instead was to address
misperceptions and miscommunication, to avoid major surprises, to reopen
defunct channels, and to more clearly signal to each other about our
respective positions and interests.  And we sought to increase not just
the quantity but the quality of our communication.  
   
In May, I spent two days with Director Wang Yi in Vienna to help restore
some normalcy to the relationship.  In Vienna, we reached consensus on a
rough roadmap for high-level engagement to carry out the agenda that
President Biden and President Xi had set forward in Bali — one both
sides hoped at that time would ultimately culminate in a leader-level
meeting in San Francisco at APEC later in the year.   
   
In the months that followed, we held a series of critical meetings.  
   
In June, Secretary Blinken traveled to Beijing and met with President Xi
and senior foreign policy officials, working to stabilize after a period
of tension.  
   
In July, Secretary Yellen traveled to Beijing to build relationships
with the PRC’s new economic leadership.  In that same month, Special
Envoy for Climate John Kerry traveled to reopen climate channels that
had stalled for months.  
   
Then, in August, Secretary Raimondo visited the PRC to advance our
commercial ties and underscore our commitment to protect critical
technologies with national security implications without severing the
economic relationship between the U.S. and China.  
   
Critics said at the time that this travel was one-sided, but our
strategy was to use those meetings to open up a two-way flow of
exchanges, and that’s exactly what happened.  
   
This intensive diplomacy was about managing tough issues rather than
patching up the relationship.  We were direct about our differences,
including PRC support for Russia’s war against Ukraine and cross-Strait
issues.    
   
We did not pull back from national security-focused measures, like
restrictions on outbound investment and updates to our export controls. 
Instead, we used these meetings as opportunities to explain what these
measures were, but almost as importantly, what they were not, which was
an attempt to undermine the PRC’s prosperity and development.  That is
not what those measures were, and we explained that clearly to our
counterparts in these sessions.   
   
We also used these meetings to find space to coordinate on issues where
our interests overlapped.  
   
In September, Director Wang Yi and I met in Malta for another round of
meetings.  We charted the course for a leader meeting in San Francisco
and laid out what we hoped to accomplish on issues like counternarcotics
and mil-mil channels.   
   
Over the following weeks, Majority Leader Schumer led a bipartisan
delegation to the PRC, and the PRC sent a stream of officials to the
United States, including the Vice President, the Vice Premier, and
Director Wang Yi, who came for two days of meetings with Secretary
Blinken and myself.  
   
And all of this culminated, as you heard from Mike, in the meeting — the
summit — between President Biden and President Xi in Woodside,
California, which saw progress on three major issues.  
   
First, President Biden and President Xi restarted counternarcotics
cooperation.  Since then, we’ve seen Beijing take initial steps to stem
the flow of precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl, progress that we
hope and need to see continue.  The first interagency counternarcotics
working group between the U.S. and the PRC met today in Beijing, and our
aim is to open up law enforcement cooperation on fighting this terrible
drug.  
   
Second, President Biden and President Xi announced the resumption of
military-to-military communication that had been frozen for more than a
year.  The Chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff has now spoken with his
counterpart, and we’ve restored a number of critical operator-level
mechanisms.  The question now is whether that will continue even in the
face of future turbulence.  We, for our part, will continue to make the
case that military-to-military communication is critical at all times
but especially in times of tension.   
   
And third, the Woodside summit saw our leaders announce a new dialogue
aimed at managing the risks of artificial intelligence, which will start
in the spring.  
   
As Mike mentioned, this past weekend I met with Director Wang Yi in
Bangkok to follow up on the Woodside summit and to advance efforts in
each of these three areas.   
   
Detailed, dogged diplomacy is necessary to manage the friction that is
endemic to a strategic competition between two major powers.  Some risks
to that effort may be unforeseeable, may be surprises.  Other risks are
more recognizable, including friction in the South and East China Sea
and economic and technology moves and countermoves.  
   
The most significant risk would be a crisis in the Taiwan Strait,
especially given Beijing’s increased military activity in and around its
air and waters.  Here, too, intensive diplomacy matters.  
   
Just a few weeks ago, Taiwan held historic elections without any major
cross-Strait incident, in part because all sides — Washington, Beijing,
and Taipei — worked to reduce miscommunication and misperception about
their respective intentions.  That is an outcome few may have foreseen
in August of 2022, when most expected the cross-Strait situation to grow
more tense, not less.  But it’s no guarantee of future trends, and the
risk remains real.  So we have to keep working at this by intensifying
both diplomacy and deterrence.   
   
Over the next year, as we have for the last three, we’ll continue to
take action on human rights abuses, forced labor, and nonproliferation. 
We’ll be vigilant about the PRC’s support for Russia’s war against
Ukraine and its efforts to help Russia reconstitute its defense
industrial base, and we’ll take necessary measures to respond.  
   
If PRC provocations continue in the South and East China Seas and the
Taiwan Strait, we’ll work closely with allies and partners to push back
and speak out about the risks to peace and stability in the world’s most
important waterways.  We’ll continue to uphold freedom of navigation in
the region by flying, sailing, and operating wherever international law
allows.  And we’ll continue to pursue tailored national security
measures designed to protect our national security.  
   
And even as we do so, we’ll aim to continue the pace of intensive
interaction with the PRC that has helped both sides manage areas of
difference and unlock cooperation on areas where our interests align.  
   
We’re not planning to recreate the now outdated structures and
mechanisms from an earlier period in the bilateral relationship.  And
we’re definitely not interested in dialogue just for dialogue’s sake. 
But we do see value in launching and shepherding a select number of
working-level consultations in discrete, carefully chosen areas to
advance our interests and achieve results.  That’s the approach we use
today on counternarcotics — an approach rooted in the here and now
rather than in the nostalgia of the past.  
   
In the period ahead, we hope we can work with the PRC to deepen crisis
communication mechanisms to reduce the risk of conflict.  We’re ready to
coordinate on climate, health security, global macroeconomic stability,
and new challenges like the risks posed by artificial intelligence. 
We’ll also talk to Beijing about challenging regional and global issues,
from the Red Sea to the Korean Peninsula.  And we’ll work to advance
progress on a range of bilateral issues too, including people-to-people
ties.  
   
Let me conclude by noting that none of this will be easy, and there will
be times of tension.  That’s inevitable in a competition like this that
is simply not going to resolve in a neat and decisive end state.  And as
I noted, one thing is certain: There will be surprises along the way.  
   
We’ll keep working to manage the competition as we have over the last
year.  We’ll continue to invest in our strength at home and to deepen
our global networks of alliances and partnerships abroad.  
   
The approach I’m describing to you is not some big strategic shift. 
It’s an effort we began building from the day we came into office.  It’s
also not something new to American statecraft.  Far from it.  It’s an
approach that is itself uniquely American and rooted in decades of
history, diplomacy, and hard-won experience.  It’s also rooted in
bipartisanship, because when the United States deals in a strategic
competition from a position of strong bipartisan support, of all pulling
together in service of the country, we always come out stronger for
it.   
   
So we intend to stick with this strategy.  We intend to do what we need
to do to protect our interests and defend our allies, while at the same
time effectively managing competition with China to the good not just of
the United States, but to the good of global stability as well.  That is
our commitment.  That’s what we’ve tried to do.   
   
And today my goal was simply to walk you through how we’ve tried to
execute that in practice so we can get beyond the kind of broad slogans
and down to the actual day-to-day hard work that an incredible team of
people across the entire U.S. government, both career and appointed,
have been working.  And we’ve done so, I must say, looking around this
room, with the support and advice of a huge number of people here from
both parties, from the private sector and the public sector, and across
a range of walks of life.  And that is the only way we’re going to
continue to succeed in this effort as we go forward.   
   
So thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak today, and I look
forward to the conversation.  (Applause.)  
   
MR. HADLEY:  Jake, thank you for being with us.  Thank you for your
remarks.  I think we’re all much better informed about what you’ve been
building in terms of China policy and the successes that you’ve had.   
   
What we’re going to do is I’m going to ask three or four questions to
Jake, up here.  And then we’re going to turn to the audience to take
questions from you.  This is all on the record.  And we will try to end
promptly at 7:45.  And I will proceed with the rest of the activities of
the evening.   
   
Let me begin by asking you if — what, if anything, you would feel
comfortable telling us about your recent meeting with Chinese Foreign
Minister Wang Yi in Thailand.  Any great breakthroughs to report here
tonight?  (Laughter.)  Any news you want to make before the assembled
multitude?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, first, we had a very nice meal.  So that was good. 
(Laughter.)   
   
You know, this is my third extended round of conversations with Wang Yi
— the first in Vienna, the second in Malta, and then this one in
Bangkok.  And with each successive round, I think we have increasingly
gotten to the point of setting aside the talking points and really
having strategic conversations.   
   
In terms of next steps, the main things coming out of the meeting were
actually to, you know, kind of fix the launch of this AI dialogue, where
the U.S. and China will work together to manage risk.  And that will get
going this spring.  So we talked through what the elements of that would
look like.   
   
Second, we had the opportunity to go deep on cross-Strait issues and to
share our respective positions.  And I’ll be cautious.  As you know very
well, this is littered with landmines to speak about publicly.  And
also, I want to respect the discretion of the channel.  But I think it
was a very useful, direct, and candid set of conversations on that
topic.   
   
And then, we obviously also had the opportunity to talk about current
events — current events in the Red Sea, current events on the Korean
Peninsula, concerns that we have about instability in both places.  And
I would say the quality and character of those conversations and a
rather direct and, in some ways, intensive conversation about the war in
Ukraine, I think helped both of us leave feeling that we didn’t agree or
see eye-to-eye on everything but that there was a lot of work to carry
forward.   
   
Last point I would make: We agreed that President Biden and President Xi
should speak and should speak by telephone relatively soon.  And I think
the acknowledgment coming out of Woodside that there really is no
substitute for leader-to-leader conversation — I mean, it became so
apparent over the course of that meeting at Woodside how central that
ingredient has to be to an effective stewardship of U.S.-China policy. 
And so, both of us agreed that we would report back to our leaders and
we would get them on the phone sooner rather than later.  
   
MR. HADLEY:  Great.  Let me ask you on the Taiwan question.  They
recently, of course, had elections in Taiwan.  A lot of commentary by
some of the people in this room about the significance of those
elections.  How do you see them?  And what impact do you think the
results might have on our ability to manage the cross-Strait
relationship?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, you know, we were explicit and direct, publicly and
privately, with all stakeholders that we were not taking a position in
those elections; we remained studiously neutral throughout.  We
congratulated the winner.  We congratulated the — Tsai Ing-wen on, you
know, an effective democratic election.  And now, you know, we’ve made
clear we would like to see a smooth transition.   
   
And otherwise, from the United States’ perspective, Taiwan exhibiting
this vibrant, democratic character is a positive thing.  And our policy
remains constant through it.  As it was before, it will be going forward
— the One China policy, the Taiwan Relations Act, the Six Assurances,
and all of the issues that people in this room know so well.   
   
And President Biden has been clear that, you know, we remain committed
to the One China policy.  And I was clear on that with Wang Yi as
well.   
   
I was also clear that we continue to have concerns about elevated levels
of aggressive military activity around the Strait.  We don’t regard that
as conducive to peace and stability.  And we generally want to see, as I
think the rest of the world does, peace and stability across the Taiwan
Strait.  And we are committed to doing everything we can to support
that.  
   
MR. HADLEY:  Thank you.  I want to ask a little bit about the Chinese
economy.  There’s a lot that has been written about the structural
problems of the economy, a lot of speculation that the administration in
Beijing has neither the ability nor the willingness to address those
underlying structural problems.  A fairly gloomy view about the
prospects for the Chinese economy.   
   
And I wonder whether that negative — whether that narrative is too
negative.  And I’d ask you how you see the prospects of the economy and
the ability and willingness of Xi and his team to address some of the
structural problems that we all know about in terms of the real estate
sector, indebtedness, and all the rest.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  You know, in the last couple of times I went to the UCSD
China Forum — it was before I came into government — I made a habit of
going up to the smartest people I know on China and on economics, and
buttonholing them and saying, “Tell me about the economy in China.”  And
I would hear a, kind of, general answer from one and I would think,
“Okay, that’s the answer.”  And then I would talk to someone else, and
they would have quite a different answer.   
   
And the spectrum of opinion on whither China’s economy among incredibly
informed, like, right-thinking people is quite broad.  And so, I’m
humble enough to not really be able to characterize the likely future
trajectory of that economy because I think if you would have asked
people that question two years ago, they might have a different answer
than they have today.  Frankly, if you asked people about the U.S.
economy one year ago versus where they are today, people would have a
different answer.   
   
So what we’re focused on fundamentally is thinking about what we can do
to invest in the sources of our own strength here in the United States. 
And I talked about that some in my speech.  And we kind of reject what I
believe was a kind of common view that somehow, you know, it was a story
of inexorable rise on the one side and inexorable decline on the other
side.  Choices matter in both Beijing and Washington.  We’re trying to
make the right choices.  And of course, it’s up to Beijing how they
choose to make choices on their side.   
   
How’s that for not really answering your question?  (Laughter.)  
   
MR. HADLEY:  It’s good.  It’s good.  You know —  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I’m learning from Tony Blinken how to be a diplomat. 
(Laughter.)  
   
MR. HADLEY:  I’m going to go off script for a minute and ask one
question about how you frame the policy, because you made clear that our
goal is not to hold back or undermine the Chinese economy.  That’s not
the objective of what we’re doing.  We’re doing things to protect our
own national security interests.   
   
But don’t we have to be candid with China that some of the things we are
doing to protect our own national security interests are actually having
an adverse and will have an adverse effect on the Chinese economy? 
It’ll have an adverse effect on our economy in terms of economic growth
and the like.  
   
Have we been candid enough with the Chinese about what it is we’re
doing, why we’re doing it, and what impact it’s going to have on
China?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I mean, one thing that we really tried to embark on — and
I alluded to this in my speech a year ago — was to be much more direct
and transparent about what the nature of the measures we were
undertaking both were and would be, because we were telegraphing to
them, as well, “This is where we are going on outbound investment or on
updates to semiconductor export controls.  This is why we’re doing it. 
This is how we’ve tailored it.  This is the rigorous process we put in
place.  And this is the rationale.”  And then heard their response to
that.  
   
And Wang Yi and I had an opportunity in Bangkok to talk about how each
of us, China and the United States, see the boundary between economics
and national security.  And obviously, we don’t have completely
converging perspectives on that question.  But I think it’s really
important to recognize that, for a very long time, the PRC has taken
measures on explicit grounds of national security that have had an
adverse impact on American workers, American businesses, the American
economy.  And so, this cannot be a one-way street of a conversation.   
   
You know, China will come to the table with its concerns about what the
United States is doing.  And the United States has an obligation on
behalf of its citizens to come to the table with our concerns about what
China has been doing for quite a long time.  And I certainly came to the
table prepared to do that when we were in Bangkok.  
   
MR. HADLEY:  Good for you.  
   
I’m going to give you one more chance to make some news.  (Laughter.)  
   
Should we — on this issue of technology in particular, should we expect
further steps by the Biden administration to de-risk the U.S. economy
from its overdependence on China?  And in what areas are we likely to
see further action?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So first, to answer your question, I probably won’t make
news.   
   
I just want to take a minute on what we mean by de-risking.  And, in
fact, I’ve said this directly to my Chinese counterparts.  It basically
has three elements.   
   
First, investing in America’s industrial and innovation capacity.  A big
way to de-risk is to have more capacity ourselves to be able to, you
know, operate at the technological innovation edge.   
   
The second is to diversify supply chains so that we’re not dependent on
any single point of failure.  And that’s not all about China.  That’s a
lesson we learned from COVID.  But the PRC is a part of that.   
   
And the third is to have a series of tailored measures so that American
technology cannot be used to undermine the security of the United States
and our allies.  And in this category, we have been transparent that
we’ve taken a series of steps already, and we will take further steps as
we go forward, all according to the basic principle that we are going to
tailor them and target them in a way that they really are aimed at our
national security concerns and not at a broader effort to decouple our
technological ecosystems or our economies.  But I will leave for a later
day what exactly the nature and timetable of additional measures will
be.   
   
One more thing I will say is: In October of 2022, we did a first round
of export controls on advanced semiconductors and semiconductor
manufacturing equipment.  In October of 2023, we updated them.  I think
the world can expect that will be part of the process going forward,
because as the technology evolves, our controls have to evolve.  It
doesn’t mean the standards underlying our controls evolve — those remain
constant — but they have to be applied to technology as it advances. 
And that will require updates to existing controls, even as we add, you
know, targeted, tailored controls in other areas as well.   
   
MR. HADLEY:  If I were a man from Mars coming down, I would say,
listening to you and observing the relationship, that these two
countries are trying to maintain some stability in the relationship and
have made some tactical shifts, but strategically, China is continuing
with a series of policies they’ve been pursuing for some time.  And the
Biden administration is going to continue, as you just suggested, with
the policies done.  There seem to be a lot of centripetal forces pulling
at this relationship — and that’s before you get to the United States
Congress.  Can you really keep it kludged together?  What’s the way to
keep it (inaudible)?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Look, it’s a fair question.  And obviously, we’ve gone
through periods of considerable tension, even during President Biden’s
tenure.  But he is determined to hold these two things in his head at
the same time.  As I said before, that, yes, there are structural,
competitive dynamics in the relationship, and we should be clear-eyed
about that, and we should look at that — stare at that square in the
face.  And on the other hand, we have an obligation for our own national
interest to ensure that that competition does not veer into conflict,
that we manage it to a point of stability, and that we also find areas
where we can work together where our interests align.   
   
Now, that recipe is, I think, relatively easily distilled in words.  It
is harder to put into action.  And it requires a level of intense
diplomacy of the kind I really tried to walk through in my speech and
care — you know, basically constant gardening.  And even then, whether
foreseen or unforeseen, risks and tensions could boil over.  We cannot —
you cannot deny that.  But it is — you know, we don’t have to be
fatalistic about it, either.   
   
Our job is to try to understand, in a clear-eyed way, what those risks
and inherent tensions are, and do our very best to manage them without
compromising on our fundamental values and without walking away from the
defense of the American national interest and the interest of our allies
and partners.   
   
And part of the reason that I tried to give these remarks in more of a
way of, like, “let’s actually just talk about 2023 and what we did
through the year” is it’s there’s a lot of aphorisms in the U.S.-China
relationship — “manage competition,” and, you know, “invest, align,
compete.”  At the end of the day, it really comes down to a set of
actions that we take here domestically, a set of investments we make in
our allies and partners, and then just direct, dogged diplomacy with
China built on the proposition that, yes, we’re going to compete but we
also are going to inhabit the same planet, and we have to work together
to ensure that we don’t end up tipping over into conflict.   
   
That’s what this is about.  It doesn’t really reduce to a bumper
sticker.  But I think it’s a kind of common-sense strategy that can
secure bipartisan support and that people — if you kind of look at
American attitudes on the PRC, I think that’s basically where the
American people are.  They want us to be tough and stand up for our
interests and push back against aggression or actions that harm
Americans, but they also are not looking for war.  And so that’s what
we’re trying to work towards.  
   
MR. HADLEY:  Last quick question from me.  We have a session tomorrow on
the China forum about the internal political situation in China, both
its resilience and its fragility in its political system.  Anything you
want to say about that —  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  No.  (Laughter.)  
   
MR. HADLEY:  — in terms of how you —  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  I’ll refer you to Beijing to comment on it.   
   
MR. HADLEY:  So we’ll all have to tune into the session tomorrow.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Exactly.  
   
MR. HADLEY:  I guess Jake is deferring to that.  
   
Let’s go to the audience if we can.  I want to remind everybody this is
an on-the-record session, and I’d like to invite folks from the audience
to engage in this conversation.  So please raise your hand and I will
call on you.   
   
Let’s start with this gentleman here.  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Thank you very much.  My name is Marc Rotenberg.  I’m
with the Center for AI and Digital Policy.   
   
And you talked about artificial intelligence in your remarks.  I wanted
to begin by saying I think it was very good that China participated in
the UK AI Summit.  That was not originally anticipated.  But clearly, as
you’ve said, it’s important to maintain discussion about the risk of AI
in warfare.   
   
But at the same time, there are also clearly two different forms of
government.  And AI can support an open and pluralist government or AI
can support a more closed, constrained form of government.   
   
And it seems to me that there is a policy debate playing out right now
regarding the governance of AI and, frankly, some concerns about the
U.S. position.  So, presently, at the Council of Europe, a treaty on AI
is being negotiated.  The mandate of the Council of Europe is to promote
fundamental rights, democratic institutions, and the rule of law.  And
many of our democratic allies are looking for a robust treaty that
safeguards fundamental rights in this era of AI.   
   
Concerns have been expressed about the U.S. position.  And my question
is: Will the U.S. government support a robust treaty on AI that
safeguards fundamental rights?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, we have been very actively engaged in the
negotiations over the treaty at the Council of Europe because our basic
vision for the governance of AI is rooted in the idea of the protection
of fundamental rights and the empowerment of people lifting them up
rather than holding them down.   
   
And we do have a very different vision of AI governance than the PRC
does, which is why our dialogue with them will really vector in on our,
kind of, responsibility as significant countries and major AI players to
manage the risks of AI as we go forward.   
   
And we’ve put forward voluntary standards that we’ve gotten some of the
biggest AI players in the world to sign up to.  We’ve issued an
executive order that reflects many of the core values and principles
that are at the heart of your question.   
   
Where things ultimately land on the treaty in the Council of Europe is
not going to be whether the U.S. is for or against the treaty that is
strong on fundamental rights.  It’ll be on more specific provisions that
may cut across particular interests we have.   
   
So I can’t predict how that treaty negotiation will turn out, but I can
tell you that however it turns out, it will — the United States’ basic
commitment to this broader vision, which we have articulated ourselves
and have now begun infusing in international institutions including an
effort at the U.N. General Assembly to have a resolution on AI, that
work will be active and the United States will play a leadership role in
it.  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Thank you.  
   
MR. HADLEY:  Yes, ma’am.  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Hi.  Thank you so much for being with us today.  I’m
Wafa Ben-Hassine.  I’m at the Omidyar Network.  I’m also a UC-San Diego
alum, political science.  So thank you to the CFR for bringing San Diego
to us, even if you couldn’t be there.   
   
My question actually takes us to a different geography.  In Africa, we
see China moving beyond the Belt and Road Initiative and the Digital
Silk Road.  We see them have relatively nuanced interventions in how
they attempt to influence policy, such as, by way of example, supplying
Huawei phones to all sorts of nonprofits and independent media groups
and outlets.   
   
I’m curious if you could illuminate a little bit about the U.S.’s
positioning in Africa and how we would potentially like to secure our
national security and also promote human rights in Africa in response to
these types of interventions.  Thank you.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, first, my sister is actually a UCSD alum as well; she
went to UCSD medical school.  So I got to hang out there with her.  It’s
a beautiful campus, a wonderful place to go to school.   
   
One thing that Kurt and I wrote in our Foreign Affairs piece in 2019
that I have felt, like, really important to keep us disciplined in this
is that we cannot treat the rest of the world as proxy battlegrounds the
way that I think the U.S. and the Soviet Union too often did during the
Cold War.   
   
So, looking at Africa, our question should not be how do we gain
relative advantage over China in this country, because that becomes a
warping and distorting factor that, frankly, in a way, can also
undermine our overall position.  So the question we pose instead is: How
do we offer a better value proposition?   
   
And I would say one of the areas that, frankly, is a gap that we are
trying to fill now quite actively is mobilization of capital for
investment in the things that African countries are looking for for
their development — in infrastructure, in clean energy, in digital.  And
that’s about money.  And it’s about public-sector money leveraging
private-sector dollars by buying down political risk, currency risk.   
   
And we have worked very closely with the new head of the World Bank, who
President Biden, you know, played an active role in helping get into the
job, Ajay Banga.  We’re trying to expand the World Bank’s capacity to do
this.  We’ve worked with the G7 through PGI, the Project \[sic\] on
Global Infrastructure and Investment, to do this.   
   
And we’re increasingly looking to work on a bipartisan basis with the
Congress to try to have the resources necessary to unlock these kinds of
investments.  Because you can’t beat something with nothing.  China is
coming with a substantial amount of capital and also, as you said, other
tools to be able to bring to bear.  
   
And for the United States, our view should not be, you know, in any
given country, you know, what’s just the way we get a one-up.  It should
be: how do we actually show up and offer something that will respond to
the legitimate development needs of that country.   
   
And I think I would grade us as incomplete on this.  It’s work that we
have begun to do quite actively in this administration, and we have a
lot more work to do.  That’s going to require Congress working with us
to unlock some of these resources that in turn can unlock a much larger
share of resources from the private sector to deliver the value
proposition we want to deliver.  
   
MR. HADLEY:  Dan Rosen.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Dan can talk about the Chinese economy.  (Laughter.)  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  But people have heard enough of me talking about it,
Jake.  So that’s where I want to circle back to you.  
   
So you come to the conference, and one economist thinks one thing. 
Another, another.  But isn’t that true of political scientists and
security experts out here too, that you’re going to have a whole
spectrum?  
   
And to fight a — to wage a systemic competition, don’t you have to come
down to a sort of point of view about how their economic system is doing
in order to figure out how well we’re performing in that competition?   
   
And while there’s probably diversity here in the audience, I hope within
USG you guys managed to come to a net assessment about how that Chinese
economic system is performing.   
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, first, you’ve just completely exploded my artful
dodge of Steve’s question.  (Laughter.)  So, I appreciate that.   
   
Second, in fact, Dan — as Dan knows, we brought in a group of experts,
who have immersed themselves in the Chinese economy, to the White
House.  Maybe it was a year ago or so.  And there was a diversity of
opinions among that group, you know, with quite — quite sharp
disagreements.   
   
First, I would say there is a bit of a difference.  I don’t find the
diversity of opinion on just basic underlying strategic diagnosis. 
There’s a lot of debate about what we should do about it on the
political and security side.  Less spectrum on kind of what are we
dealing with, what are we looking at, though there are some.   
   
Secondly, yes, we do need to have an operating assumption.  But I think
the point I’d like to make is that operating assumption has to be
humble, because — and it has to be adaptable to the reality of what we
see as new economic data comes out or as various trends that we’ve all
been watching manifest themselves.   
   
So we are operating according to a certain set of assumptions.  I will
now for the second time try and dodge laying out exactly what they are
because I just don’t see a huge amount of upside in the U.S. National
Security Advisor kind of holding forth as an armchair analyst on China’s
economy.  (Laughter.)   
   
But I would say that we also need a multidirectional strategy that can
apply if our assumptions turn out to be wrong.  And I would also say
that this has been a uniquely difficult time, to be quite precise on
this, because of COVID-19, the pandemic, how all the pieces fit into
place.   
   
But broadly speaking, what I said in my remarks and what I said in
answer to Steve’s question I would just reinforce, which is we came into
office not accepting what I think was a kind of broad-based conventional
wisdom about relative trajectories of the U.S. and the PRC.  The
President didn’t accept that.  I didn’t accept that.  Our team did not. 
And we continue to push back against this idea about inexorable rise,
terminal decline as being central — a central characteristic of the
relationship.   
   
And I guess I should stop talking now because otherwise I’ll get myself
into trouble.  (Laughter.)  So that’s what I’ll do.  
   
MR. HADLEY:  Yes, ma’am.  Please.  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Hey, Jake.  Kim Dozier, CNN analyst and CFR member.  
   
I wanted to ask what your message was regarding China’s continuing
support for U.S. adversaries, specifically Russia, including Beijing
helping Moscow avoid some of the technology sanctions and providing,
while not weapons, but basic equipment like heavy-duty trucks for
Russia’s war on Ukraine, and China’s support for Iran with rising
petroleum purchases, whereas you’ve recently blamed Iran for supporting
the deadly attacks that cost the lives of U.S. troops this past
weekend.  Thanks.  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, as I referred to in my speech, the war in Ukraine has
been a through-line of my conversations with my Chinese counterparts
going back to before Wang Yi, with Yang Jiechi, in the early months, you
know, where we sent a clear message about our concern that China might
provide lethal aid for use against civilians in Ukraine.  We have not
seen the provision of lethal aid.   
   
But as I said in my remarks, and as you noted in your question, we have
seen support from Chinese companies to help Russia reconstitute its
defense industrial base.  And we have been clear and direct about our
concerns.  And I noted in my remarks that as we watch this happen, we’re
prepared to take steps to respond to that kind of activity, because we
believe that Russia’s defense industrial base is basically building up
to continue to support an imperial war of conquest in Europe.  And
that’s a fundamental national security interest of the United States. 
And I made no bones about that in my conversations with my
counterpart.   
   
And the President has recently signed an executive order that gives him
additional tools and authorities to deal with this challenge.  It’s not
directed at the PRC.  It is general to countries that are supporting
Russia’s defense industrial base, but it gives us tools in this
regard.   
   
With respect to Iran, one of the areas of substantial focus in the
discussion was about the continuing Houthi attacks in the Red Sea and
the disruption of a vital artery of maritime commerce, undermining of
supply chain security in the global economy, and frankly, disruption to
China-Europe trade, which the Red Sea is obviously, you know, critical
to.  And made the case that, you know, China is a responsible player; as
a U.N. Security Council member, has an obligation to use the influence
it has in Tehran to get those in Tehran to use the influence they have
with the Houthis to push back against this kind of behavior.   
   
And I won’t, you know, characterize the response because I’ll leave that
to Wang Yi to do for himself, but I will just say that was a detailed
and substantive conversation, because it is a matter where we believe
that countries, particularly permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council, have unique responsibilities and should step up to those
responsibilities.  
   
MR. HADLEY:  I’ll take one or two more questions.  This gentleman here
and then this woman back there.  
   
Sir.  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Thank you, Jake.  Art Collins with theGROUP.   
   
Talk to us a little bit about the trilateral relationship with South
Korea and Japan.  As we know, you mentioned it earlier, the Prime
Minister of Japan will be here in the spring for a state visit.  Japan
is obviously increasing — in fact, maybe doubling — its military
budget.  But what else do we expect from our partners in that regard, in
both South Korea and Japan?  And what are we prepared to do, beyond what
we’ve already done, with that critical relationship?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, you know, first, I think it’s important to
recognize that the security dimension of that trilateral relationship is
critical.  It has been a source of propulsion for pulling the three
countries together.  And it manifests in closer intelligence
coordination, closer defense cooperation, exercises, joint deterrence,
particularly when it comes to the Korean Peninsula.  And we’d like to
see that continue to evolve.   
   
But I would also point out that the trilateral partnership expands well
beyond that.  First, it expands beyond the region.  If you look at
support for Ukraine, Japan and Korea have both stepped up in significant
ways to stand with a fellow democracy in Europe.  And the Japanese prime
minister has been particularly articulate in explaining that what
happens in Ukraine matters in the Indo-Pacific.  And President Yoon has
reinforced that.   
   
And then finally, the relationship extends to economic coercion, the
intersection of technology and national security, innovation, economic
investment and vitality — all areas where the three countries have a
huge amount of complementary capacity to support and lift one another
up.  
   
When you put all that together, that is a formidable partnership of
three countries with shared values; huge capacities across economics,
technology, national security; and global reach.   
   
And so, you know, we’re very proud of the work that we’ve done so far,
but it is very much a work in progress and has to be built on from
strength to strength as we go forward.   
   
I was just recently in Seoul for a trilateral meeting of national
security advisors to convert this into the details of how we work
together on things like early warning for missile defense and also to
think about areas where we can work together — for example, to answer
the question that was posed earlier: How do we collectively have a value
proposition in the developing world with three large ODA budgets from
our three countries?  
   
So, you know, that is not — that trilateral partnership is not about any
country.  It’s not about China.  It’s not about North Korea.  It’s about
being for something — a vision for the world, for the region, but for
the world writ large.  And we feel that it has helped create a huge
amount of momentum behind shared priorities, and we want to continue to
develop that.  
   
MR. HADLEY:  Last question.  And I apologize to those who I did not get
to.  
   
Ma’am, back here.  Right here.  Yes.  Can you pass her the mic?  Thank
you so much.   
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Hi.  Maggie Dougherty with the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.   
   
You briefly mentioned human rights, so I would like to hear your
strategy towards Chinese abuse of human rights — Uyghurs, Tibetans,
Christian minorities.  How are we going to face that challenge?  
   
MR. SULLIVAN:  So, first, the President, as he has said publicly, has
been very clear and direct in his conversations, in the two summits that
he’s had, about the kind of fundamental responsibility and obligation of
an American president to speak out on these issues, because it’s core to
who we are.  That’s not about trying to weaponize the issue; it’s about
living out our values.  And that’s the ethos that he has tried to
inculcate across the U.S. government as we deal with this issue.   
   
And so that means not just that we speak out on these issues but that we
take actions.  And we have taken a series of actions over the course of
the past three years in each of the areas you mentioned.  And to a
considerable extent, we have done that in partnership with the Congress
on a bipartisan basis, including laws that have been passed under our
administration that we are now implementing, on issues like forced
labor, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.   
   
So this is something that will remain a critical priority and feature of
the U.S.-China relationship, as it has through multiple
administrations.  And from our perspective, having direct diplomacy and
intensive management of the relationship is not inconsistent with
standing up for speaking out on and taking material action on issues
related to the protection of human rights.  
   
MR. HADLEY:  So we’re here at the end of our time.  Let me tell you
where we’re going to proceed from here, if I can.  
   
I want to thank you all for joining this hybrid meeting.  Jake, thank
you for being with us.   
   
END
