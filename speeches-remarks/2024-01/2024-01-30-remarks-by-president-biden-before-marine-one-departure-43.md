Q Mr. President, what — do you hold Iran responsible for the death of
the three Americans?

Q Have you made a decision how you’ll respond to the attacks?

THE PRESIDENT: Yes.

Q And —

Q Mr. President, do you hold Iran responsible for the death of those
three Americans?

THE PRESIDENT: I do hold respon- — them responsible in the sense that
they’re supplying the weapons to the people who did it.

Q But directly responsible?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, we’ll have that discussion.

Q (Inaudible) have not deterred these attacks in the past. What will be
different this time?

THE PRESIDENT: We’ll see.

Q Mr. President, (inaudible) are you worried about a regional war in the
Mi- — a wider war in the Middle East? How worried are you?

THE PRESIDENT: I don’t think we need a wider war in the Middle East.
That’s not what I’m looking for.

Q Should Donald Trump be allowed on the ballot? Should Donald Trump be
allowed on the ballot?

THE PRESIDENT: As far as I’m concerned, that’s fine.

Q Why is he leading in the polls if he is a threat to democracy, as you
say?

THE PRESIDENT: Because guys like you. (Laughs.)

Q What am I doing? Come on.

Q Mr. President —

THE PRESIDENT: I’m teasing, man. I’m teasing. It’s early.

(Cross-talk.)

Q Mr. President, on the border. Have you done everything you can do with
executive authority? Or is there more you could do absent (inaudible)?

THE PRESIDENT: I’ve done all I can do. Just give me the power. I’ve
asked from the very day I got into office. Give me the Border Patrol.
Give me the people — give me the people, the judges. Give me the people
who can stop this and make it work right.

(Cross-talk.)

Q Are you worried about the possible escalation in the military
involvement in the Middle East? What do you say to those in your party?

THE PRESIDENT: (Inaudible.) We’ll see.
