The White House

Brian and Sandra, it’s an honor for Joe and me to host you tonight. We
are proud to welcome you back to your White House home.

Most of you in this room know Brian and Sandra’s love story. They met
working on the Obama-Biden campaign in 2008, then they both came to work
at the White House. And apparently, we didn’t keep them busy enough,
because along came marriage and a couple of beautiful children – Naomi
and Ella, who are here with us.

Life was perfect, until Brian received a devastating diagnosis from his
doctor shortly after their second daughter was born. In an instant,
their world was turned upside down. Brian was diagnosed with ALS, and
given six months to live. Against all odds, here they are six years
later.

Brian, Sandra – you’ve channeled your pain into purpose, your energy
into a nationwide movement.

You’ve both turned your experience and expertise in politics into I AM
ALS, which has been an incredible force for change.

And now, you’ve expanded that work to link arms with leaders in
Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s to drive progress for all of these
neuro-degenerative diseases. And you’re also pushing for better access
to care and more support for caregivers.

Thank you for all of your advocacy, and pouring every piece of your
heart into this work.

Sandra, Brian, would you like to say a few words?

Thank you again Sandra and Brian – and thank you to everyone for being
here in support of them and their fight. The film will begin shortly.
