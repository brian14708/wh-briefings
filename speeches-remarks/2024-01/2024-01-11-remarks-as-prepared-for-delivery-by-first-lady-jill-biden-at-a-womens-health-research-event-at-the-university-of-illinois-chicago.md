If you ask any woman in America about her health care, she likely has a
story to tell. Yes, you know her.

She’s the woman who gets debilitating migraines, but doesn’t know why,
and can’t find treatment options that work for her.

She’s the woman going through menopause, who visits with her doctor and
leaves with more questions than answers, even though half the country
will go through menopause at some point in their lives.

She’s the woman who dies because her heart disease isn’t recognized
since her symptoms don’t look like a man’s heart attack. Women are more
likely to die after a heart attack, even though men and women have them
at similar rates.

This has to stop. And my husband, President Biden, is doing something
about it.

Women in this country live longer than men. But what are those years
like?

Can you pick up your grandchildren without pain? Can you walk around the
block without feeling tired? These women live with chronic diseases that
we don’t know enough about and that don’t have effective treatment
options.

Last year, Maria Shriver came to me about this issue and it resonated.
And when I talked to Joe about it, he took action. That’s what he does –
he learns about a problem and then he gets to work tackling it. He
doesn’t waste any time.

So, in November, we launched the White House Initiative on Women’s
Health Research.

Halle and I are here today because the University of Illinois Chicago is
doing groundbreaking research on menopause.

Every woman will be affected by menopause, yet there’s a stunning lack
of information about how to manage and treat its symptoms. UIC is
working to change that, and I’m grateful to Pauline for hosting us.

The White House Initiative on Women’s Health Research will make sure
that women are not just an after-thought, but a first thought. We will
build a future where women leave doctors’ offices with more answers than
questions. Where medicine meets the needs of everyone. Where no woman or
girl has to hear that “it’s all in your head” or “it’s just stress!”

Together, we will make that future a reality.

And now, it’s my pleasure to introduce someone I’m grateful to have
joining us today. She’s a powerful advocate for women’s health. She’s
been a leading voice in raising awareness about menopause. And she’s
helping us build a brighter, healthier future for women. Please help me
welcome, Halle Berry.
