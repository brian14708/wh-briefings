Q    Do you have a message for Iran, sir?

THE PRESIDENT:  I’ve already delivered the message to Iran.  They know
not to do anything.

Q    Are we in a de facto proxy war with Iran?

Q    Will you continue bombing the Houthis if the attacks don’t stop,
sir?

THE PRESIDENT:  Say that again.

Q    Will you continue bombing the Houthis if the attacks don’t stop? 
Will you continue with the strikes, sir?

THE PRESIDENT:  We will make sure that we respond to the Houthis if they
continue this outrageous behavior, along with our allies.

Q    Do you have confidence in Secretary Austin?

THE PRESIDENT:  I do.

Q    Was it a lapse in judgment for him not to tell you earlier?

THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.

Q    Are we in a de facto proxy war with Iran?

THE PRESIDENT:  Say again.

Q    Are we in a de facto proxy war with Iran?

THE PRESIDENT:  No.

By the way, anybody want a coffee?  It’s on me.  (Laughter.)  All right?

Q    I’ll take a smoothie.

THE PRESIDENT:  You’ll take a smoothie?  Well, they’re six bucks, but
I’ll do it anyway.  (Laughter.)

Seriously, if anybody here wants anything, I’ll pay for it.  Okay?

MR. VARGAS:  That’s very generous of you.

(The tour of Nowhere Coffee Co. continues.)

THE PRESIDENT:  But I’ll be doing — talking with you all after the
firefighters.  Okay?

Q    Thank you.

THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.

By the way, we’re almost in heaven.  We’re almost in Scranton.
