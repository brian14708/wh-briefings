Indian Treaty Room  
Eisenhower Executive Office Building

3:41 P.M. EST  
     

THE FIRST LADY:  Thank you.  Thank you, Greg.    
  
And, Stef, you’ve built an amazing team for the first-ever Office of Gun
Violence Prevention.  (Applause.)  I know that working on this issue is
not easy, but this team’s commitment never wavers, and we all are so
grateful for everything that you do.  
  
 Ava Olsen, from Townville, South Carolina, is 13.  But her friend Jacob
will always be six.    
  
Ava will try out different clothing trends and learn how to drive.
 She’ll have crushes and graduate from high school.  But Jacob, now
forever dressed in his favorite Batman costume, will always be six.    

Ava is a survivor.  After years of debilitating PTSD, unable to leave
her home, you know, for fear of reliving those moments on the playground
when she ran for her life, she then returned to school.  But the
heaviness of that small coffin will always weigh on her heart, because
Jacob will always be six.  

Ethan Song of Guilford, Connecticut, will always be 15.    

Alejandro Guerrero Jr. of Grand Rapids, Michigan, will always be 14.  

I know that we have some of their friends and family with us today.   

The number of children we’ve lost to gun violence, to shooting is
unfathomable.  But those numbers don’t tell the whole story.   

They don’t tell us of the parents who steel themselves as they put their
child on the school bus every morning, the students who watch the door
instead of the whiteboard, the educators who go over their emergency
plans in their heads before the first bell.   

Like many of all of you, I know that feeling.  I teach at a community
college not far from here.  I was there this morning.  And at the start
of each semester, I explain to my students what they should do if the
worst happens.   
  
 But we can help prevent that violence.  You can help prevent that
violence.  

The parents in your schools trust you.  They look to you to steer their
children toward the bright futures ahead of them.  You can show parents
that they can be part of preventing the next shooting, the next suicide,
the next accident.  
  
A secured gun could have saved Jacob and Ale- — Alejandro and Ethan.  It
could mean they would be starting high school or college or their first
job.

They could have grown up beside their friends, like it — like it really
should have been.   

I know we ask a lot of our educators.  And I know that these shootings
affect you too.  So, I want to thank you for all that you’ve already
done, for coming here to be willing to push a little harder and to do
this one more thing.   
  
This issue matters to the President.  It weighs on his heart every day.
 And he’s not going to stop fighting until we’ve solved it.  

How can we accept a world where the leading cause of death for our
children is gun violence?  Where active shooter drills are part of
growing up in America?  Where our children hear loud noises and duck for
cover?  

Enough is enough — enough pain, enough death.  No more funerals. 

I don’t want to have to put my hand on another cross with an
eight-year-old’s name.   

We must change this.  We must protect our kids from gun violence.   

Thank you for all that you do.   
  
And now, please help me welcome someone who is fighting for our students
and our educators every single day, my favorite, Secretary Miguel
Cardona.  (Laughs.)  (Applause.)
