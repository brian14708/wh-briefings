Filoli Historic House & Garden  
Woodside, California

5:20 P.M. PST  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I didn’t know there were this many people in town. 
Please have a seat.  As you know, I just concluded several hours of
meetings with President Xi, and I believe they were some of the most
constructive and productive discussions we’ve had.   
   
I’ve been meeting with President Xi since both of us were vice president
over 10 years ago.  Our meetings have always been candid and
straightforward.  We haven’t always agreed, but they’ve been
straightforward.  And today, built on the groundwork we laid over the
past several months of high-level diplomacy between our teams, we’ve
made some important progress, I believe.  
   
First, I am pleased to announce that after many years of being on hold,
we are restarting cooperation between the United States and the PRC on
counternarcotics.  
   
In 2019, you may remember, China took action to greatly reduce the
amount of fentanyl shipped directly from China to the United States. 
But in the years since that time, the challenge has evolved from
finished fentanyl to fentanyl chemical ingredients and — and pill
presses, which are being shipped without controls.  And, by the way,
some of these pills are being inserted in other drugs, like cocaine, and
a lot of people are dying.  
   
More people in the United States between the ages of 18 to 49 die from
fentanyl than from guns, car accidents, or any other cause.  Period.  
   
So, today, with this new understanding, we’re taking action to
significantly reduce the flow of precursor chemicals and pill presses
from China to the Western Hemisphere.  It’s going to save lives, and I
appreciate President Xi’s commitment on this issue.  
   
President Xi and I tasked our teams to maintain a policy and law
enforcement coordination going forward to make sure it works.  
   
I also want to thank the bipartisan congressional delegation to China,
led by Leader Schumer, in October for supporting efforts — this effort
so strongly.   
   
Secondly, and this is critically important, we are reassuming
military-to-military contact — direct contacts.  As a lot of you press
know who follow this, that’s been cut off, and it’s been worri- —
worrisome.  That’s how accidents happen: misunderstandings.  So, we’re
back to direct, open, clear, direct communications on a — on a ba- — on
a direct basis.   
   
Vital miscalculations on either side can — are — can cause real, real
trouble with a — with a country like China or any other major country. 
And so, I think we made real progress there as well.  
   
And thirdly, we’re going to get our experts together to discuss risk and
safety issues associated with artificial intelligence.  As many of you
who travel with me around the world almost everywhere I go — every major
leader wants to talk about the impact of artificial intelligence.  
   
These are tangible steps in the right direction to determine what’s
useful and what’s not useful, what’s dangerous and what’s acceptable.   
   
Moreover, there are evidence of cases that — that I’ve made all along:
The United States will continue to compete vigorously with the PRC.  But
we’ll manage that competition responsibly so it doesn’t veer into
conflict or accidental conflict.   
   
And where it’s possible, where it is in our interests are — coincide,
we’re going to work together, like we did on fentanyl.  
   
That’s what the world expects of us — the rest of the world expects, not
just in — people in China and the United States, but the rest of the
world expects that of us.  And that’s what the United States is going to
be doing.   
   
Today, President Xi and I also exchanged views on a range of regional
and global issues, including Russia’s refusal and brutal war to stop the
war — and brutal war of aggression against Ukraine and — and the
conflict in Gaza.  
   
And as I always do, I raised areas where the United States has concerns
about the PRC’s actions, including detained and ex- — and exit-banned
U.S. citizens, human rights, and corrective — coercive activities in the
South China Sea.  We discussed all three of those things.  I gave them
names of individuals that we think are being held, and hopefully we can
get them released as well.  No agreement on that.  No agreement on
that.   
   
I also stressed the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan
Straits.   
   
It’s clear that we object to Beiji- — to Beijing’s non-market economic
practices and disadvantage — that disadvantage American businesses and
workers and that we’ll continue to address them.  And I named what I
thought a number of those were.  
   
I welcome the positive steps we’ve taken today, and it’s important for
the world to see that we are implementing the approach in the best
traditions of American diplomacy.  We’re talking to our competitors. 
And the key el- — and just talking, just being blunt with one another so
there’s no misunderstanding is a key element to maintaining global
stability and delivering for the American people.   
   
And in the months ahead, we’re going to continue to preserve and pursue
high-level diplomacy with the PRC in both directions to keep the lines
of communication open, including between President Xi and me.  He and I
agreed that either one of us could pick up the phone, call directly, and
we’d be heard immediately.  
   
And that’s — now I’d like to be able to take some questions, if I may. 
And I’m told that Demetri of the Financial Times has the first
question.  
   
Q    Thank you.  And as an Irishman, I apologize for bringing the
rain.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, holy God, I wouldn’t have called on you if I had
known that.  (Laughter.)  No, I’m teasing.  Go ahead.  Fire away,
Demetri.  
   
Q    President Biden, given that America is playing a key role in two
major global crises — Ukraine and in Gaza — does that alter your
previous commitment to defend Taiwan from any Chinese military action? 
And did Xi Jinping outline the conditions under which China would attack
Taiwan?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Look, I reiterate what I’ve said since I’ve become
president and what every previous president of late has said — that we —
we maintain an agreement that there is a One China policy and that — and
I’m not going to change that.  That’s not going to change.  
   
And so, that’s about the extent to which we discussed it.  
   
Next question, sorry, was Bloomberg.  
   
Q    Good evening, Mr. President.  It appears, among other issues, that
your agreement with President Xi over fentanyl would require — will
require a lot of trust and verification to ensure success in curbing
those drug flows.  I’m wondering: After today and considering all that
you’ve been through in the past year, would you say, Mr. President, that
you trust President Xi?  
   
And secondly, if I could, on Taiwan.  You’ve — you and your
administration officials have warned President Xi and Chi- — China about
interference in the upcoming election.  I’m wondering what would the
consequences be if they do, in fact, interfere in the election.  Thank
you.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I may have had that discussion with him, too.  I
made it clear: I didn’t expect any interference, any at all.  And we had
that discussion as — as he was leaving.  
   
Look, do I trust?  You know, I — “trust but verify,” as the old saying
goes.  That’s where I am.  
   
And, you know, we’re in a competitive relationship, China and the United
States.  But my responsibility is to — to make it — make this rational
and manageable so it — so it doesn’t result in conflict.   
   
That’s what I’m all about, and that’s what this is about: to find a
place where we can come together and where we find mutual interests that
— but, most importantly, from my perspective, that are in the interests
of the American people.  That’s what this is about, and that’s exactly
what we’ll do.  
   
You know, we’re in a situation where we agreed that fentanyl and its
precur- — its precursors will be curbed substantially and the pill
presses.  That’s a big — that’s a big movement.  They’re doing —   
   
And, by the way, you know, I won’t — I guess I shouldn’t identify where
it occurred.  But, John, I know two people near where I live.  Their
kids, literally, as I said — stra- — they woke up dead.   Someone had
inserted in — whether the young man did or not — inserted, in a drug he
was taking, fentanyl.  
   
Again, I — I don’t — I hope you don’t have any experience with knowing
anyone, but this is the largest killer of people in that age category.  
   
And, you know, I guess the other thing I think is most important is that
since I — I’ve spent more time with President Xi than any world leader
has, just because we were vice presidents.  His president was President
Hu; I’m not making a joke.  President Hu and — and President Obama
thought we should get to know one another.  It wasn’t appropriate for
the president of United States to be walking — dealing with the vice
president.  
   
So, we met — if I’m not mistaken, I think it was 68 hours of just face
to face — just us and a simultaneous interpreter.  
   
So, I — I think I know the man.  I know his modus operandi.  He’s been —
we have disagreements.  He has a different view than I have on a lot of
things.  But he’s been straight.  I don’t mean that he’s good, bad, or
indifferent.  He’s just been straight.  
   
And so, you know, we — as I said, the thing that I — I find most
assuring is he raised and I fully agreed that if either one of us have
any concern, Mr. Ambassador — any concern about anything between our
nations or happening in our region, we should pick up the phone and then
call one another, and we’ll take the call.  That’s an important
progress.  
   
I’m embarrassed — I think it’s CBS, but I can’t remember who with CBS. 
I’m sorry.  
   
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  Weijia Jiang with CBS.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Sorry.  (Laughs.)  I apologize.  
   
Q    You continue to stress the need to ensure competition with China
does not veer into conflict or confrontation.  In the past two years,
there have been more than 180 incidents of Chinese aggression against
U.S aircraft in the Indo-Pacific and, of course, the ramped up military
activity in the South China Sea.  If that does not count as veering into
confrontation, then what does?  And did you issue any warnings Xi
against continuing that behavior?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, none of it did end up in a con- —
conflict.  Number one.  
   
Number two, you may recall: I did a few little things like get the Quad
together, allow Australia to have access to new submarines, moving in
the direction of working with the Philippines.  So, our actions speak
louder than our words.  He fully understands.  
   
Q    And because of the news of the day, sir, I do have a question about
the IDF raid on the Al-Shifa Hospital, as it tries to contain and take
out the Hamas operative that is there.  
   
This week, you also said that we must protect hospitals.  So, when you
weigh the target against the number of civilians inside the hospital, is
the operation underway justified?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, look, we did discuss this, by the way.  We can’t
let it get out of control.   
   
Here’s the situation: You have a circumstance where the first war crime
is being committed by Hamas by having their headquarters, their military
hidden under a hospital.  And that’s a fact.  That’s what’s happened.  
   
Israel did not go in with a large number of troops, did not raid, did
not rush everything down.  They’ve gone in and they’ve gone in with
their soldiers carrying weapons or guns.  They were told — told — let me
be precise.  
   
We’ve discussed the need for them to be incredibly careful.  You have a
circumstance where you know there is a fair number of Hamas terrorists. 
Hamas has already said publicly that they plan on attacking Israel again
like they did before, to where they were cutting babies’ heads off to
burn — burning women and children alive.  
   
And so, the idea that they’re going to just stop and not do anything is
not realistic.  This is not the carpet bombing.  This is a different
thing.  They’re going through these tunnels; they’re going in the
hospital.   
   
And if you notice, I — I was mildly preoccupied today.  I apologize, I
didn’t see everything.  But what I did see, whether — I haven’t had it
confirmed yet — I have asked my team to answer the question.  But what
happened is they’re also bringing in incubators.  They’re bringing in
other — other means to help the people in the hospital, and they’ve
given the doctors and — I’m told — the doctors and nurses and personnel
an opportunity to get out of harm’s way.  
   
So, this is a different story than I believe was occurring before, an
indiscriminate bombing.  
   
What do you got?  Washington Post.  I think that’s right.  
   
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, there you are.  Sorry.  I couldn’t see you in the
light.  
   
Q    That’s okay.  Mr. President, Israel’s war in Gaza has killed more
than 11,000 Palestinians in just over a month and created —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m sorry, you’re breaking up.  I didn’t — would you —  
   
Q    Israel’s war in Gaza has killed more than 11,000 Palestinians in
just over a month and created a humanitarian disaster.  Israeli
officials have said this war could take months or even years.  Have you
communicated to Prime Minister Netanyahu any sort of deadline or
timeframe for how long you are willing to support Israel in this
operation?  Are you comfortable with the operation going on
indefinitely?  And is there any deal underway to free hostages?  Thank
you.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, no — working backwards forward.  Look, I have been
deeply involved in moving on the hostage negotiation, and I don’t want
to get ahead of myself here because I don’t know what’s happened in the
last four hours.  
   
But they’re — I have — we’ve gotten great cooperation from the Qataris. 
I’ve spoken with them as well a number of times.  I think the pause and
that Israeli — that the Israelis have agreed to is down to — I’m getting
into too much detail.  I know, Mr. Secretary.  I’m going to stop.  
   
The — but I am — I am mildly hopeful.  I’m mildly hopeful.   
   
With regard to when is this going to stop, I think it’s going to stop
when the — when Hamas no longer maintains the capacity to murder and
abuse and — and just do horrific things to the Israelis.  And they are
in — and they still think they — at least as of this morning, they still
thought they could.  
   
I — I guess the best way for me to say it is that I take a look.  The
IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces, acknowledges they have an obligation to
use as much caution as they can in going after their targets.  It’s not
like they’re rushing in the hospital, knocking down doors, and, you
know, pulling people aside and shooting people indiscriminately.   
   
But Hamas, as I said, said they plan on attacking the Israelis again. 
And this is a terrible dilemma.  So, what do you do?   
   
I think that Israel is also taking risks themselves about their folks
being killed one-to-one going through these hospital rooms, hospital
halls.  But one thing has been established is that Hamas does have
headquarters, weapons, materiel below this hospital and, I suspect,
others.  But how long it’s going to last, I don’t know.   
   
Look, I made it clear to the Israelis that — and to Bibi and to his War
Cabinet that I think the only ultimate answer here is a two-state
solution that’s real.  We got to get to the point where there is an
ability to be able to even talk without worrying about whether or not
we’re just dealing with — they’re dealing with Hamas — that’s going to
engage in the same activities they did over the past — on — on the
7th.   
   
So, it’s — but I can’t tell — I’m not a fortuneteller.  I can’t tell you
how long it’s going to last.  But I can tell you I don’t think it
ultimately ends until there’s a two-state solution.  I made it clear to
the Israelis I think it’s a big mistake to — for them to think they’re
going to occupy Gaza and maintain Gaza.  I don’t think that works.   
   
And so, we’re going to — I think you’re going to see efforts to bring
along — well, I shouldn’t go into it anymore, because that’s — that’s
things I’ve been negotiating with Arab countries and others about what
the next steps are.   
   
But anyway, thank you all very much.  Appreciate it very much.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you.  This ends the press conference.  
   
(Cross-talk.)  
   
Q    Sir, on the hostages, you said, “We’re coming for you.”  What did
you mean when you said, “We’re coming for you”?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  When — when Hama- — well, Hamas said they plan on doing
the same thing again — what — what they did — what they did on the 7th. 
They’re going to go in — they want to slaughter Israelis.  They want to
do it again.  And they’ve said it out loud.  They’re not even kidding
about it.  They’re not backing off.  
   
And so, I just asked the rhetorical question, “I wonder what we would do
if that were the case?”  
   
Q    On the hostages though, you said, “We’re coming for you.”  What did
you mean to the American hostages when you said —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Oh —  
   
Q    — “Hang tight.  We’re coming for you.”  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  What I meant was I’m doing everything in my power to get
you out — coming to help you to get you out.  I don’t mean sending
military in to get them.  Is — is that what you thought I might mean?  
   
Q    I — I defer to you.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, no, no it’s — it — I was not talking about a
military.  I was talking about we — you’re on our mind every single
day.  Five to six times a day, I’m working on how I can be helpful in
getting the hostages released and have a period of time where there’s a
pause long enough to let that happen.   
   
And there is somewhere between 50 and 100 hostages there, we think.  
   
Q    And, sir, one is a three-year-old American child.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  You’re darn right it is.  That’s why I’m not going to
stop till we get her.  
   
Thank you.  Thank you.  
   
(Cross-talk.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Who can holler the loudest?   
   
Q    Can you just detail for us what kind of evidence the U.S. has seen
that Hamas has a command center under Al-Shifa Hospital?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, I can’t tell you.  I won’t tell you.  
   
Q    Do you feel absolutely confident based on what you know —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  
   
Q    — that that is the truth?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.   
   
Q    And, Mr. President, after today, would you still refer to President
Xi as a “dictator”?  This is a term that you used earlier this year.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, look, he is.  I mean, he’s a dictator in the sense
that he — he is a guy who runs a country that — it’s a communist country
that is based on a form of government totally different than ours.  
   
Anyway, we made progress.
