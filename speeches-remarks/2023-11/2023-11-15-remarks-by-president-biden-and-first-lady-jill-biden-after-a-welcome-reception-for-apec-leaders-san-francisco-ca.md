THE FIRST LADY:  Wow.  (Applause.)  What a beautiful way to end our
first night together.  And speaking of beautiful, how about Gwen
Stefani?  Wasn’t she amazing?  (Applause.)

You know, the bonds that wi- — that strengthen this week, the — the
relationships we nurture, the connections we create, those are the
things that help us build a resilient future that we all dream of.  And
it’s not possible without all of you.  So, thank you.

May we keep close to our hearts the hope, happiness, and sense of
possibility that we feel in this moment.

Joe?

THE PRESIDENT:  I’m Jill’s husband, Joe Biden.  (Applause.)  And I work
for the Vice President.  (Laughter.)  That was a hell of a show, wasn’t
it?  (Applause.)  And I was just talking about Gwen; I didn’t talk about
the fireworks.  (Laughter.)

Folks, thank you all for being here.  To all my colleagues, our
colleagues from heads of state from the Pacific Islands and the Pacific
region, it’s just great to have you here.  And this is a — we — we owe a
big debt of gratitude to the new mayor of the city of San Francisco. 
Where are you, Mayor?  You’re around here somewhere.  (Applause.)  And —
and re- — and Governor Newsom.  He’s done one hell of a job.

Folks, you know, wh- — I had some comments to make to you.  I’m not
going to make them.  I’m going to just summarize this way: You know,
tonight, as I met with some of my colleagues that I’ve worked with from
countries all across the region, including earlier today with Xi Jinping
of China, you know, there’s reason to be optimistic.  There’s reason to
be optimistic.

I look at all of you and I see the enthusiasm, I see the sense of
possibilities.

I was once asked by Xi Jinping in China — (inaudible) a lot of — spent a
lot of time with him, traveled 17,000 miles with him.  He said, “Can you
define America for me?”  I said, “I can in one word, and I mean it:
possibilities.”  (Applause.)

Anything is possible in this country if we do it together, and we’re
going to start that now.  And the Pacific is the place to start it.

Thank you all so, so, so much for being here.  (Applause.)  God bless
you all.  Thank you.

And, by the way, the First Gentleman is here too.  You’ve seen —  he was
trying to keep — (applause) — he was trying to keep up with the dancers
that Gwen had.  I wasn’t sure he’d (inaudible).  But thank you again. 
And thank the band.  Thank you.
