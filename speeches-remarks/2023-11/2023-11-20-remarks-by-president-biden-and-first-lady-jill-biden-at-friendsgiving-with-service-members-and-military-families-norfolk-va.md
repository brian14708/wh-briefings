THE FIRST LADY:  Well, Happy Thanksgiving.   
   
I’m sorry that I have to lead this off with a sad announcement.  Our
former First Lady Rosalynn Carter has just passed.  And she was well
known for her efforts on mental health and caregiving and women’s
rights.  So, I hope that during the holidays, you’ll consider saying
your — include the Carter family in your prayers.   
   
When our son Beau was deployed, we saw how much his children missed
their daddy.  And I know how many in this room are living with an empty
chair at your table right now.  Or maybe you’re stationed far from your
family, and your table is a little smaller this year.   
   
You and your families sacrifice so much in times of war and peace.  And
it’s our duty and honor to make sure that you feel supported.   
   
That’s what my Joining Forces initiative — my White House initiative
supports: military and veterans’ spouses, caregivers, and survivors. 
So, that’s what I started several years ago with Michelle Obama, and we
have continued that on.   
   
And it’s why we join military families for Friendsgiving year after
year.  Thank you to the Robert Irvine Foundation and the USO for making
this possible.  (Applause.)  
   
We hope you can wrap yourselves in the love and community that surrounds
you.  Because family is more than parents and partners.  It’s the people
in this room, the bonds we forge, and the families we create
together.   
   
Now I’ll turn it over to Navy veteran and Norfolk Navy spouse, Sibrina
Sears.  
   
Sibrina.  
   
MS. SEARS:  Thank you.  Thank you.   
   
Good afternoon.  I am Sibrina Sears.  I am one of the many people with a
spouse deployed on the Eisenhower.  I have been married to my wonderful
husband, ABEC Shannon Sears, for almost nine years now, and we have five
beautiful daughters.   
   
Before becoming a military spouse, I was active duty.  And before that,
I was a Navy brat.  I can say that I’ve experienced this life from every
perspective, and it is not hard.  Being away from family and just put in
a new place is not easy, but one thing I can say that makes it easier is
this military community and events like these that help us — help bring
us together and let us know that we are not forgotten and we are still
important.  
   
Now it’s my honor and privilege to introduce to you the president of the
United States of America, President Joe Biden.  (Applause.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  
   
Please, everybody, sit down.  You don’t have to be standing.   
   
Thank you all so very much.   
   
You know, I’ve been saying for a long, long time, we only — we have a
lot of obligations as a government.  We only have one truly sacred
obligation, and that’s to prepare those who we send into harm’s way,
care for them and their families when they come home, and make sure
they’re never forgotten.   
   
You literally are — it’s is not hyperbole — so, you literally are the
backbone, the spine, the sinew of this nation.  Only 1 percent of you —
and it’s important to keep mind — 1 percent of you — that’s all — that
protects the 99 percent of us.  One percent.  And the sacrifices you
make — not just those who are in uniform but those who are not in
uniform.   
   
You know, there’s that famous poet — an English poet who said, “They
also serve…” — Chaplain — “…who also only stand and wait.”  
   
I watched, for the year our son was in Iraq as a major in the United
States Army — if you excuse the reference to the Army — (laughter) — in
the Army.  And I watched every morning that — when I was home with
Jill.  She’d get up in the morning, and she’d be standing on the way to
teach school.  And she’d be standing there with a cup of coffee over the
sink, and you could see her mouthing a prayer that one of her — one of
the generals — na- — our generals had — wife had given her.  Every
day.   
   
And it’s hard looking at that empty tab- — that empty chair, especially
for holidays.  It’s hard watching it.  And many of you were right here
when you — not long ago when you sent your — your troops off, your
family off.   
   
But, you know, they’re incredible.   
   
Everywhere I go — and I’ve been to over 140 nations — everywhere I go in
my career, no one misunderstands that we have the finest military in the
world — not a joke.  We have the finest military in the world.  And
that’s not just because of their fighting ability, which is un- —
undisputed, but the way —  
   
(A child in the audience cries.)  
   
That’s okay.  You’re allowed — she’s allowed.  In my family, kids rule. 
(Laughter.)  So, she can holler, she can scream, do whatever she wants
to do.   
   
But, look, I — I mean it from the bottom of my heart.  You know, you
family members, you are the heart of this operation.  You really are. 
Not — not a joke.  So, thank you, thank you, thank you.   
   
And like I said, like Jill said, you know, for the — for the year after
our son came home from Kosovo and then headed off to Iraq for a year as
an Army Major, I watched his kids every day.  And, you know, anyway, I
don’t want to get to talking about that.   
   
But it’s just — it’s just not easy for you all.  So, thank you, thank
you, thank you, thank you.   
   
And as I said — you know, there’s a — John Milton, English poet — and
I’ll end with this — said, “They also serve who only stand and wait.” 
“They also serve who only stand and wait.”  And that’s what you do.  So,
thank you, thank you, thank you.   
   
And I love your ears.  I love them.  They’re really cool.  What’s your
name?  
   
MS. GARCIA:  Jasmin.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Catherine.  What a beautiful name.  That’s my mommy’s
name.  Well, nice to see — how old are you?  17?  
   
MR. GARCIA:  She’s six.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Six.  And how old are you?  Fifteen?   
   
MR. GARCIA:  Four.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Four?  You’re a pretty big guy.   
   
Well, I tell you what.  Be nice to your sister.  You’re going to need
her someday.  At least I did.   
   
Anyway, thank you all so very much.  And if I — I get to give you the
dressing.  And if you don’t like dressing, just come up and pretend to
do and say hi to me.  Okay?  (Laughter.)   
   
Thank you all very much.  And Happy — Happy Thanksgiving.  May God love
you all.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  
   
Now I’m going to introduce the Chaplain.  Chaplain, thank you. 
Appreciate it.
