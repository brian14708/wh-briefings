South Lawn, The White House

When I was growing up, during winter, my sisters and I would ice skate
on the frozen canals of the Delaware River.

We spent hours gliding across the glistening ice, our cheeks pink from
the cold. And in those hours, what was normally an ordinary town and
bridge, transformed into a bright, sparkling landscape, glittering as if
covered in magic.

That’s how children often see the world this time of year: with magic,
wonder, and joy. And that’s what inspired our White House holiday theme.

What’s more magical, wonderful, and joyful than an ice rink on the South
Lawn of the White House?

I hope each of you enjoy your time here at the White House and that the
memories you make will stay with you for all the holidays to come.

\*\*\*

Wasn’t that incredible?

Let’s give all of our performers another round of applause.

I want to thank the organizations who helped make this possible: the
National Park Service, the National Park Foundation, Comcast, the NHL,
the NHL Players Association, and Riedell.

Because of you, we get to bring a little more magic, wonder, and joy to
the White House.

Now, who’s ready to skate?
