Nantucket, Massachusetts

MR. ROKER:  Welcome back to the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. 

And on this most American of holidays, we have very special guests about
to join us by phone.  Right now, we have the President of the United
States, Joe Biden, and the First Lady, Dr. Jill Biden.

Happy Thanksgiving to both of you. 

THE PRESIDENT:  Happy Thanksgiving, Al.  It wouldn’t be Thanksgiving
without you.

THE FIRST LADY:  Happy Thanksgiving!

MR. ROKER:  Oh, thank you.  And, of course, a belated happy birthday,
Mr. President, as well.  And thank — thank you so much for taking the
time to be here. 

First of all, what is your — what’s your Thanksgiving message for all of
our viewers?

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think we have to remind ourselves how blessed we
are to live in the greatest nation on the face of the Earth.  And that’s
real.  We’re an extraordinary — made extraordinary progress.  There’s
nothing beyond our capacity when we work together.

So, today is about coming together, giving thanks to this country we
call home.

And thanks to all the firefighters, police officers, first responders,
and our troops — some of whom are stationed abroad. 

I’ve never been more optimistic, Al.  So, I — and we’re delighted to be
with you —

MR. ROKER:  And we’re —

THE PRESIDENT:  — even though it’s by telephone.

MR. ROKER:  Well — well, we’re thrilled to have you–

THE FIRST LADY:  And I think, Al —

MR. ROKER:  Go ahead.

THE FIRST LADY:  Thank you.  And I think it’s important that we all
commit to an act of kindness today.  So, call someone and wish them a
happy Thanksgiving or do something kind.

MR. ROKER:  Yeah.

Mr. President and First Lady, we’re at a time right now where there are
a lot of divisions.  A lot of folks — you know, a lot is going on right
now.  What’s — what’s the message on this Thanksgiving Day?

THE PRESIDENT:  On this Thanksgiving Day, Al, we have to come together. 
You know, we have — we can have different political views, but there’s —
we have one view.  The one view is: We are the finest, great- — greatest
nation in the world.  

We should focus on that.  We should focus on dealing with our problems
and being together, not — not —

And — and stop the — stop the — the rancor.  You know, we — we have to
bring the nation together.  And we have to treat each other with a
little bit of decency.

And so — and I think that’s who the vast majority of the American people
are.

MR. ROKER:  Thank you, and happy Thanksgiving to both of you.  I hope
you enjoy your time with your family, as we will with all of ours. 
Thank you so much, Dr. — Dr. Jill Biden and the President of the United
States, Joe Biden.  Thank you so much for joining us.  We appreciate it.

And now, giving us an —

THE FIRST LADY:  Thank you.  Thanks, Al.

MR. ROKER:  Thank you, thank you.

And giving us —

THE FIRST LADY:  God bless our troops.

MR. ROKER:  Absolutely.  Well said.
