THE PRESIDENT:  Welcome.  I’d like to make a brief toast to welcome you
all.  And I want to say that it’s been a pleasure so far.  We’ll make
sure tomorrow is even better.  All right?  
  
We had a great day and great meetings today.  And the — we broke some
important ground for APEC.  And — but tonight, it’s about breaking bread
together and we know one another a little better after tonight.

And I’ll — I assume you’ll forgive me for quoting an Irish poet instead
of a Pacific poet.  But I beg your pardon for doing that.  But they’re —
Eavan Boland wrote a — she was a daughter of Dublin, Ireland, and she
made a career as a poet in Palo Alto, California.  And she taught at
Stanford University.  
  
And this was one of her last poems.  And a line in the poem goes,
“Remind us again now that history changes…That it belongs to us.  It
belongs to all of us.”  
  
We gather this week in San Francisco at an inflection point in history. 
One of the full new challenges that’s — not only challenges but new
threats as well.  
  
But we have to never forget that we can change and bend the arc of
history for the better if we make up our mind to do it, that together we
can harness the power of the Pacific to grow our economies, to uplift
our workers, to protect our planet, and to connect our people to one
another and the future of greater prosperity and dignity for all.  
  
So much of history of the world will be written in the Asia-Pacific in
the coming years.  We must never forget that it’s a history that belongs
to all of us.

Hopes that have always brought us forward.  Hopes that, in fact, we
share — 3 billion people re- — that we represent share in common.  Hopes
and aspirations that have brought us together here today.  
  
So, please join me in raising your glass to our people, to our — to the
Pacific, and to the possibilities of all we can do together.

Hear, hear.  Welcome.

(A toast is offered.)

*Bon appétit.*
