Eisenhower Executive Office Building

Thank you, Caleb. We’re happy to have you with us today and thank you
for everything you and your family do for our nation.   
   
Kelly, General Hokanson, Joe and I are so grateful for your leadership
and everything you do to help National Guard families.   
   
Thank you all for joining us.  
   
You – members of the National Guard and your families – hold a special
place in my heart, because our son, Beau, served in the Delaware
National Guard.  
   
Our national guardsmen and women have to be ready to support missions at
a moment’s notice. And that means their kids – all of you – know what
it’s like to have your mom or dad missing at the dinner table every time
they’re called to duty. And you do it with humility and honor.  
   
I want you to know that my husband, President Biden, and I are grateful
and we’re so proud of you. We know it isn’t easy. When Beau was
deployed, we saw how much our grandchildren, Hunter and Natalie, missed
their daddy.   
   
But they, like all of you, were brave and strong. They understood that
they were sharing their dad with the nation, so that other kids could be
safe.   
   
A few months ago, we dedicated a special place in the White House to
showcase the artwork of military kids to give their stories, and the
countless other stories of military kids, a home in the People’s
House.   
   
One of the pieces we’ve displayed here is a drawing of a little boy
holding his father’s hand and looking up at him – beaming with so much
pride. His father, in his bright green uniform, smiles back down as an
American flag waves behind them.   
   
That was drawn by a boy named Patrick. He’s twelve years old, and his
dad is also in the Delaware National Guard.  
   
But some people may not know that Patrick’s dad serves in the military
because National Guard members don’t always wear their uniform – serving
our country and their community in other jobs until they’re called to
duty.   
   
That might be something you’ve experienced as well. Your friends at
school may not know that your mom or dad is in the military.   
   
So, one of the things I’ve tried to do as First Lady is make sure that
your stories are heard – that people understand what you’re going
through.   
   
That’s why I asked all of you to join me today. I want to hear about
what’s on your minds. I want to learn more about what being a military
kid means to you. And I want to know what more we can all do to serve
you.  
   
So, thank you for being here, and thank you for sharing your stories
with us.
