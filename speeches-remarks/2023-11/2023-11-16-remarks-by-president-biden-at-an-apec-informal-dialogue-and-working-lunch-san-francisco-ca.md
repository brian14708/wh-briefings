THE PRESIDENT:  Is this on?  Yes, it is.  Well, good afternoon,
everyone.  I was waiting out there for the tide to subside.  
   
Welcome.  Welcome to our first APEC leaders’ session.  I really
appreciate the fact that you’re all here.  And thank you.  And I hope
the city has been good to you.    
   
And earlier this morning, I spoke with the — at the CEO Summit.  And I
said that our world stands at an inflection point — a point where the
decisions we make now are going to determine the course of the world,
not just a few of our countries, for the next several decades — of
consequence.     
   
Nowhere is that more true than when it comes to climate.  Every economy
around this table faces this challenge — every one of us.  And as I’ve
said before, it’s the only existential threat to humanity.  We either
get this right or there’s not going to be a whole lot of people around
to talk about it.

Every economy has seen signs of what’s to come if we don’t act —
droughts, floods, seas rising, temperatures rising, and more and more
unpredictable weather patterns, and more un- — more and more
unpredictable markets.

As a region, were responsible for the largest share — the region we’re
talking about here around this circular table, we’re responsible for the
largest share of global emissions, so we must also bear responsibility
for the solutions while we still have time to change course.

Earlier this week, I released the Fifth U.S Climate Assessment, mapping
out what we’ve done and how far we have left to go.

But the fact is, it’s only together that we’re going to be able to make
any real progress.  Any one of us who gets to zero emissions, it’s not
going to change the world; we have to do it together.  Only together can
we keep the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius within our
reach.

Here at home, I’m proud to say the United States is doing our part.

One year ago, I signed what we called the Inflation Reduction Act — the
largest investment in the climate fight ever, anywhere in the world.   
   
Two years ago, I signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law — the biggest
investment in infrastructure in American history, including what we call
our “clean power” sector.   
   
And over the last three years, we’ve helped mobilize more than half a
trillion dollars in private sector investment, including to scale up
technologies like offshore wind, advanced nuclear, clean hydrogen,
direct air capture, and more.   
   
These investments not only put the United States on track to achieve our
1.5 degree alignment goal — aligned goal by cutting emissions by 50
percent by 2030, they’re creating jobs — good-paying jobs, jobs you can
raise a family on.  And they’re helping lower the cost of clean energy
and climate technologies for nations around the world by as much as 25
percent in some areas.   
   
But we can’t stop here.  We have so much more work to do.  
   
You all know as well as I do the impacts of climate change are being
felt most by those who have contributed the least to the problem.  Let
me say that again: You know the impacts of climate change are being felt
the most by those countries that contribute the least to the problem,
including developing countries.   
   
We contributed a lot here in the United States over the year — the last
300 years.  That’s why I’m working with our Congress to dramatically
increase international climate financing.   
   
And this year, the world is on track to meet the climate finance pledge
that we made under the Paris Agreement of $100 billion collectively.   
   
I’ve also asked Congress for another $25 billion to strengthen the role
of the multilateral development banks in fighting the climate crisis as
well as — as well as starting with the World Bank.  Because climate
security, energy security, and food security — they’re all related, as
all of you know.  I’m not telling you anything you don’t already
know.   
   
On top of this, we focused on ending deforestation.  Forests are key to
our future.  
   
In the United States alone, they absorb 10 percent of our greenhouse gas
emissions as they stand today.   
   
We’re also working with partners around the table to mobilize $1 billion
to conserve the Amazon and other critical ecosystems in Latin America. 
You know, the Amazon is a great carbon sink; it absorbs more carbon from
the air on a daily basis than the United States emits on a daily basis. 
And it should be preserved, and they need help in doing it.  
   
The United States also ratified the — the Kigali Amendment, which will
drastically produc- — reduce the production of super potent hi- —
HFCs.  
   
And finally, the Global Methane Pledge we launched two years ago
together with just seven other countries and the European Union has
grown to include 150 countries.   
   
And here at home, the United States is turning this pledge into
progress.  We’re investing more than $20 billion in methane mitigation
to do things like plugging leaks throughout our oil and gas sectors. 
All told, in 2023, these steps, if finalized, will reduce methane
emissions from covered sources by 87 percent below the 2005 levels.  
   
I encourage everyone around this table to also take strong national
actions, because as that — as I said earlier, it will take all of us to
meet this moment.  
   
With the right commitments from every economy here, we can limit — we
can limit warming, we can build new energy futures and leave no one
behind, and we can turn — we can turn this moment into a great — from
great peril into a moment of great possibility.  
   
And the moment where we stood together to protect our people and
preserve our planet for future generations — that’s the moment we’re at
right now.  That’s the chance we have.  That’s what this session is all
about.  
   
I’m looking forward to hearing directly from each of you about your
climate needs and priorities, what help you may need as well.  And I’m
looking forward to finding new ways to maximize our impact.  
   
And now, I’d ask the press to depart, which will only take about two
minutes, I’m sure.  No, we’ll ask the press to depart.   
   
And I’m going to turn it over to Secretary Kerry, my Special Envoy on
Climate, so we can get that conversation going.  
   
And thank you.
