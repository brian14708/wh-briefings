2:16 P.M. EST  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Hey, folks.  We all set?  
   
AIDE:  Yes, sir.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  All right.  Yesterday, families all across America
gathered together with their loved ones and to — to give thanks.  
   
We have much to be thankful for in America: the food on our tables, the
family and loved ones in our homes, and the many blessings that come
from living in the greatest nation on Earth.  
   
And today, we can also be thankful of families being recruited and
reunited with loved ones who have been held hostage for nearly 50
days.  
   
Beginning this morning, under a deal reached by extensive U.S.
diplomacy, including numerous calls I’ve made from the Oval Office to
leaders across the region, fighting in Gaza will halt for four days.  
   
This deal also is structured to allow a pause to continue for more than
50 hostages to be released.  That’s our goal.  
   
This morning, I’ve been engaged with my team as we began the first
difficult days of implementing this deal.  
It is only a start, but, so far, it’s gone well.  Earlier this morning,
13 Israeli hostages were released, including an elderly woman — a
grandmother — and mothers with their young children, some under the age
of six years old.  
   
Separately, several Thai nationals and Filipino nationals who were also
kidnapped by Hamas on the 7th, they were released as well.  
   
All of these hostages have been through a terrible ordeal, and this is
the beginning of a long journey of healing for them.  
   
The teddy bears waiting to greet those children at the hospital are a
stark reminder of the trauma these children have been through and at
such a very young age.  
   
Jill and I — and Jill is with me here — are keeping them all in our
prayers today.  
   
Today — today has been the product of a lot of hard work and weeks of
personal engagement.  
   
From the moment Hamas kidnapped these people, I, along with my team,
have worked around the clock to secure their release.  
   
We saw the first results of this effort with the release of two American
hostages in late October followed by the release of two Israeli
hostages.  
   
I have consistently pressed for a pause in the fighting for two reasons:
to accelerate and expand the humanitarian assistance going into Gaza
and, two, to facilitate the release of hostages.  
   
And over the past several weeks, I’ve spoken repeatedly with the Emir of
Qatar, the President Sisi of Egypt, and Prime Minister Netanya- —
Netanyahu of Israel to help secure this deal — to nail it down.  And I
want to thank all three leaders for their personal partnership to get
this done.  
   
I spoke with the Emir and President El-Sisi and the Prime Minister
Netanyahu again on Wednesday to confirm the elements of the
engagement.  
   
As I said, today’s release are the start of a process.  We expect more
hostages to be released tomorrow and more the day after and more the day
after that.  Over the next few days, we expect that dozens of hostages
will be returned to their families.  
   
We also remember all those who are still being held and renew our
commitment to work for their release as well.  Two American women and
one four-year-old child, Abigail, who remains among those missing.  
   
We also will not stop until we get these hostages brought home and an
answer to their whereabouts.   
   
I remain in personal contact with the leaders of Qatar, Egypt, and
Israel to make sure this stays on track and every aspect of the deal is
implemented.  
   
You know, this extended pause in the fighting brings a critical
opportunity to deliver much-needed food, medicine, water, and fuel to
the civilians in Gaza, and we are not wasting one single minute.  
   
Since my trip to Israel last month, I’ve been focused on accelerating
the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Gaza in coordination with the
United Nations and the Red Cross.  
   
I just spoke with my Special Envoy for the Middle East Humanitarian
Issues, David Satterfield, for an update, and I’ve asked him to monitor
our progress hour by hour and keep me personally informed.   
   
From the beginning, we have put in place mechanisms to prevent Hamas
from diverting these supplies, and we are continuing that effort to make
sure aid gets to the people who need it.  
   
More than 200 trucks arrived at the crossing point in Egypt into Gaza
today.  These trucks carry food and medicine, as well as fue- — fuel and
cooking gas.  The fuel will be used not only to power the trucks
delivering these lifesaving supplies but for desalinization, for water
wells, for hospitals, and for bakeries.    
   
And hundreds more trucks are getting in position as well, ready to enter
Gaza over the coming days to support the innocent Palestinians who are
suffering greatly because of this war that Hamas has unleashed.  Hamas
doesn’t give a damn about them.  
   
We also look to the future.  As we look to the future, we have to end
this cycle of violence in the Middle East.  
   
We need to renew our resolve to pursue this two-state solution where
Israelis and Palestinians can one day live side by side in a two-state
solution with equal measure of freedom and dignity.  
   
Two states for two peoples.  And it’s more important now than ever.  
   
Hamas unleashed this terrorist attack because they fear nothing more
than Israelis and Palestinians living side by side in peace.  
   
You know, to continue down the path of terror and violence and killing
and war is to give Hamas what they seek.  And we can’t do that.  
   
So, today, let’s continue to be thankful for all the families who are
now and those who will soon be brought together again.   
   
And I want to one — once again thank the Emir of Qatar, President Sisi
of Egypt, and Prime Minister Netanyahu for their partnership to make
what we’ve done so far possible and for their continued leadership as we
all keep working to implement this deal.  
   
And over the coming days, I’ll remain engaged with leaders throughout
the Middle East as we all work together to build a better future for the
region — a future where this kind of violence is unthinkable; a future
where all children in the region — every child — Jewish, Muslim,
Christian, Israeli, Palestinian, Arab — grow up knowing only peace. 
That’s what we do.   
   
We’re waiting now — it’ll be just a matter of — I thought maybe even as
soon as by the time I got here.  But in the next hour or so, we’ll know
what the second wave of releases are.  And I’m hopeful that it’s — it’s
as — as we anticipate.  
   
So, thank you all for listening.  I’ll take a few questions.  
   
Q    Mr. President, when will the first American hostages be released,
since none were included today?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  We don’t know when that will occur, but we’re going to
be — expect it to occur.  And we don’t know what the list of all the
hostages are and when they’ll be released, but we know the numbers that
are going to be released.  So, it is my hope and expectation it will be
soon.  
   
Q    And of the 10 Americans that are unaccounted for, do you know all
of their conditions?  Are they all alive?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  We don’t know all their conditions.   
   
Q    Mr. President, how long do you expect this war is going to take?
 And have you encouraged Prime Minister Netanyahu to set a timeline —
say, by the end of this year?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’ve encouraged the Prime Minister to — to focus on
trying to reduce the number of casualties while he is attempting to
eliminate Hamas, which is a legitimate objective he has.  That’s a
difficult task, and I don’t know how long it will take.  
   
My expectation and hope is that, as we move forward, the rest of the
Arab world and the region is also putting pressure on all sides to slow
this down, to bring this to an end as quickly as we can.  
   
Q    Mr. President, do you trust Hamas to uphold their end of the
deal?  
   
Q    Mr. President, what are the chances of this truce could be extended
by a few days or more?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I think the chances are real.  
   
Q    Mr. President, there are members of your party who would like to
see conditions placed on aid to Israel.  What is your view on that? 
They would like to see, you know, a reduction in the bombing and that
sort of thing.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that’s a — a worthwhile thought, but I
don’t think if I started off with that we’d ever gotten to where we are
today.   
   
Q    Mr. President —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  We have to take this a piece at a time.  
   
Q    Mr. President, do you trust Hamas to uphold their end of the
deal?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t trust Hamas to do anything right.  I only trust
Hamas to respond to pressure.  
   
Q    Mr. President, you said you were hoping to get cooperation from
Arab leaders.  What are you hearing from them when you talk to them? 
What would you like to see them do?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m hearing a lot, but I’m not going to speak to it
right now.  There’s an overwhelming desire on the part of the region to
— let me back up.  I’m — I cannot prove what I’m about to say, but I
believe one of the reasons why Hamas struck when they did was they knew
that I was working very closely with the Saudis and others in the region
to bring peace to the region by having recognition of Israel and
Israel’s right to exist.  
   
You may recall when we did the G20 about — a little while ago, I was
able to get a resolution — I — a statement passed through there saying
we were going to build a railroad from Riyadh all the way through the
Middle East into — into Saudi Arabia, Israel, et cetera, and all the way
up to Europe.  Not the — not the railroad, but it would be an — an
underground pipeline and then railroad.   
   
The whole idea is: There’s overwhelming interest — and I think most Arab
nations know it — in coordinating with one another to change the dynamic
in their region for a longer-term peace.  And that is what I’m going to
continue to work on.  
   
Thank you all very, very much.  I appreciate it.  
   
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  
   
Q    Happy Thanksgiving.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Happy Thanksgiving to you all.  I hope you enjoyed it.
