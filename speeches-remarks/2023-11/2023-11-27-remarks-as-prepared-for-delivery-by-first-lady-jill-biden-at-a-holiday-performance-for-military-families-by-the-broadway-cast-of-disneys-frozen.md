East Room, The White House

Welcome to the White House!  
   
Thank you all for joining us today.  
   
It was wonderful talking to some of you earlier, and hearing about your
experiences as military kids.  
   
Today is a very special day at the White House – we’re unveiling our
holiday decorations! And we wanted to share this moment with you – our
military children.  
   
You answer the call of duty for your country, and the President and I
are so grateful.  
   
So, we wanted to say thank you, and share some of the magic, wonder, and
joy of this season with you.  
   
Now, how many of you have seen the Disney movie, “Frozen?” Do you know
Elsa? Do you know Anna? Do you know Olaf?  
   
Well, we have a very special performance to get all of you ready for the
magic of the holidays!  
   
Please help me welcome to the White House, the cast of Disney’s stage
musical, “Frozen!”
