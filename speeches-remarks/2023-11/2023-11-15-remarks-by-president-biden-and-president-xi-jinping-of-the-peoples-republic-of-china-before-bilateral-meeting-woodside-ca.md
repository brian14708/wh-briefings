PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, Mr. President, it’s good to see you again.   
   
We’ve spent many hours together over the last 10 or 12 years.  And — and
to host you in the United States is a great honor and a pleasure,
particularly as it relates to our summit today and for the APEC Leaders’
Meeting this week.  
   
Look, this time of year — about a year and a day ago, we met in Bali on
the sidelines of the G20.  Since then, key members of our teams have had
important discussions on issues — matters to both our nations and to the
world.   
   
But as always, there is no substitute to face-to-face discussions.  I’ve
always found our discussions straightforward and frank, and I’ve always
appreciated them.   
   
Mr. President, we’ve known each other for a long time.  We haven’t
always agreed, which was not a surprise to anyone, but our meetings have
always been candid, straightforward, and useful.  I’ve never doubted
what you’ve told me in terms of your candid nature in which you
speak.   
   
I value our conversation because I think it’s paramount that you and I
understand each other clearly, leader to leader, with no misconceptions
or miscommunication.   
   
We have to ensure that competition does not veer into conflict.  And we
also have to manage it responsibly — that competition.   
   
That’s what the United States want and what we intend to do.  We also —
I also believe that’s what the world wants from both of us: candid
exchange.   
   
We also have a responsibility to our people and the work — and the world
to work together when we see it in our interest to do so.   
   
And the critical global challenges we face, from climate change to
counternarcotics to artificial intelligence, demand our joint
efforts.   
   
So, I look forward to beginning this discussion.  And I welcome you.   
   
And the floor is yours, Mr. President.  And, again, welcome back.  
   
PRESIDENT XI:  (As interpreted.)  Mr. President, good morning.  
   
Coming here, I thought of — I think of your trip to China when I was the
vice president of China.  We had a meeting.  It was 12 years ago.  I
still remember our interactions very vividly, and it always gives me a
lot of thoughts.   
   
Last time, we met in Bali.  You said it was a year and a day ago.  A lot
has happened since then.   
   
The world has emerged from the COVID pandemic, but it’s still under its
tremendous impacts.  The global economy is recovering, but its momentum
remains sluggish.  Industrial and supply chains are still under the
threat of interruption and protectionism is rising.  All these are grave
problems.   
   
The China-U.S. relationship, which is the most important bilateral
relationship in the world, should be perceived and envisioned in a broad
context of the — of the accelerating global transformations unseen in a
century.  It should develop in a way that benefits our two peoples and
fulfills our responsibility for human progress.  
   
China-U.S. relationship has never been smooth sailing over the past 50
years and more, and it always faces problems of one kind or another. 
Yet, it has kept moving forward amid twists and turns.   
   
For two large countries like China and the United States, turning their
back on each other is not an option.  It is unrealistic for one side to
remodel the other, and conflict and confrontation has unbearable
consequences for both sides.   
   
I am still of the view that major-country competition is not the
prevailing trend of current times and cannot solve the problems facing
China and the United States or the world at large.  Planet Earth is big
enough for the two countries to succeed, and one country’s success is an
opportunity for the other.  
   
It is an objective fact that China and the United States are different
in history, culture, social system, and development path.  However, as
long as they respect each other, coexist in peace, and pursue win-win
cooperation, they will be fully capable of rising above differences and
find the right way for the two major countries to get along with each
other.   
   
I firmly believe in the promising future of the bilateral
relationship.  
   
Mr. President, you and I, we are at the helm of China-U.S. relations. 
We shoulder heavy responsibilities for the two peoples, for the world,
and for history.  I look forward to having an in-depth exchange of views
and reach new — reach new understandings with you on strategic and
overarching issues critical to the direction of China-U.S. relations and
on major issues affecting world peace and development.  
   
I wish to thank you for your thoughtful arrangements for our meeting
today and for our participation at the APEC meeting.   
   
Thank you.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, thank you, Mr. President.
