Moscone Convention Center

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  It’s good to see you again.  We had dinner last
night.  I told you — you sat next to my wife — you were so captivating,
I was worried she liked you more than she likes me now.  I don’t know.  
   
But thank you very much for being so gracious.  
   
You heard me say it before: Nothing is beyond our reach, in my view — I
really mean it — when Mexico and the United States stand together and
work together as we’ve been doing.  
   
We see it in our security cooperation. We’re working side by side to
combat arms trafficking, to combat — tackle organized crime, and to
address the opioid epidemic and — including fentanyl, which, when we
talk privately, I want to tell you about my great conversation with Xi
Jinping on that issue.   
   
And we — in our economic cooperation, we’re growing our economies from
the bottom up and the middle out so that not just the wealthy benefit,
but all our citizens benefit from our economic growth.   
   
And we see it in our work to strengthen supply chains, including through
the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, and we’ve co- — been
cooperating there as well.  
   
And we see it in our cooperation to address historic levels of
migration.  And I want to thank you, Mr. President, and your team — I
really mean it — for the cooperation and your leadership in taking on
this challenge.  I know it’s not easy.   
   
Together, we’re taking a balanced approach that lies at the heart of the
Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection, and we and 19 other
nations have signed on to that agreement.  So, it includes enforcing our
borders, increasing reparations, and opening a historic number of legal
pathways for migrants.   
   
So, I want to thank you, again.  All the things that are of consequence
to us — I couldn’t have a better partner than you.  
   
Thank you.  
   
PRESIDENT LÓPEZ OBRADOR:  (As interpreted.)  We are highly satisfied of
joining you here in San Francisco and have the opportunity to meet
President Biden and you.   
   
The relation between our countries is excellent.  Our people are
friends.  This is a respectful and cooperative relationship for
development.  
   
In recent years, basically due to this great relationship we have with
our neighboring and brother country, we are commercial partners.  We are
the main trade partners in the world, which is outstanding.  
   
At the same time, there are around 40 million Mexicans working and
living with decency in the United States, which  
strengthens our bonds.   
   
And, of course, progress needs to be made — further progress needs to be
made to address the migratory phenomenon.  We’re working on that jointly
in coordination.  And we wish to thank President Biden because he is the
first president in recent times in opening legal pathways for
migration.  
   
In the past, there were no possibilities for people who needed to come
to the United States — there were no legal possibilities open.  And it
is President Biden who opened up this possibility upon a request placed
by Central America and the Caribbean countries.  They file the petition
and after an assessment is made, they’re allowed to enter the United
States, which means that they no longer have to cross our country with
all the suffering and risks such an endeavor poses.  It’s a humane way
to address the migratory phenomenon.  
   
And I would also like to express and to state that he is the first
President in the United States in recent times who has not built walls. 
It is true.  And we need to continue to support one another so migration
is an option and not enforced.  
   
We wish to assist the people in their countries of origin when they are
forced to migrate.  We are fully satisfied in holding this meeting.   
   
And as regards to drug control, Mexico’s undertaking is to continue to
support so we do not allow the introduction of chemical components and
chemical precursors to fentanyl because we’re fully aware of the damage
it poses to the United States’ youth.   
   
This is a matter of humanism.  It’s an act of solidarity.  We are
sincerely committed to continue to assist at our fullest capacity to
prevent drug trafficking, namely the entrance of fentanyl and other
chemical precursors.  
   
I’m pretty certain that we will continue to evolve a good relationship. 
And I would like to also take this opportunity to greet our paisanos,
the Mexican migrants who are living and making a life and working in the
United States.  Around 40 million people have made the United States
their second home, their second country.   
   
And I would also like to inform those who may not be aware of this that
in recent years, there are many American citizens who are moving to
Mexico to stay there to live in Mexico.  So, welcome, because we are
brotherly countries.  
   
Thank you.  This is what I wanted to say, as well as that we have a
great relationship and you have an extraordinary president in the United
States — a man with convictions.  A man — a good man.
