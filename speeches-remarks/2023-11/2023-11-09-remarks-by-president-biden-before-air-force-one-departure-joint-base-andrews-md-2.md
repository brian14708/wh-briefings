Joint Base Andrews

Q    Mr. President, why the delay in getting hostages out?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  We’re hopeful.  Things are moving along.  
   
Q    Did you ask for a three-day pause to Netanyahu?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  You know I’ve been asking for a pause for — for a lot
more than three days (inaudible).  
   
Q    Did you ask him to pause for three days to get the hostages out for
that length of time?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I’ve ask- — asked for even a longer pause for some
of them.  
   
Q    Mr. President, we’re eight days from a shutdown — the shutdown —
government shutdown.  Just eight days.  Can you give us an update on
what you’re thinking on how to — to move past that?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I wish the — the House would just get to work.  I’m not
being facetious.  I mean, this is not a political statement.  The idea
we’re playing games with a shutdown at this moment is just bizarre.  And
I think that we ought to be able to combine Ukraine and Israel.  We
ought to be able — and I’m open to discussions on the border, and I’ve
already made some proposals.  But there’s just no need for any of
this.  
   
Q    Will you be bringing up the issue of an endorsement, Mr. President,
with Shawn Fain?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Pardon me?  
   
Q    Will you be bringing up the issue of an endorsement with Shawn Fain
when you meet him?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Will I bring up the endorsement?  
   
Q    The issue of an endorsement.  He has a — the UAW hasn’t endorsed
you yet.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, no.  They’re going to be fine.  
   
Q    Mr. President, were you frustrated with Prime Minister Netanyahu
that he has not listened more to some of the things you have asked him
to do?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  It’s taking a little longer than I hoped.  
   
Q    They’re taking a little bit longer?  
   
Q    Do you support the UAW’s efforts to unionize Tesla and Toyota, Mr.
President?   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Absolutely.   
   
Thank you.
