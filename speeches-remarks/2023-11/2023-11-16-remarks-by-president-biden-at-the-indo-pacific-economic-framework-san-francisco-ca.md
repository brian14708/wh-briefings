THE PRESIDENT:  Sorry to keep you waiting.  It’s my fault.  It’s my
fault.  I was on the phone.   
   
Hello, everyone.  We just came from a — please have a seat — a
three-hour meeting with all 21 APEC economies discussing how to generate
more growth and more opportunity in the region, particularly to deal
with climate change.   
   
Today, we’re announcing progress on the important initiative that we
proposed with 13 of my colleagues here and of our — of 13 r- — APEC
partners — the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework — Australia, Brunei,
Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and the United States.  
   
In May of 2022, we came together in Tokyo to launch negotiations on this
so-called framework.  We still have more work to do, but we’ve made
substantial progress.  In record time, we’ve reached consensus on three
of the pillars of the IPEF.  I hate acronyms.  I apologize. 
(Laughter.)  
   
The first, we signed a first-of-its-kind supply chain agreement to help
identify supply chain bottlenecks before they become the kind of
disruptions we saw during the COVID-19 pandemic.  We saw what happened
then in the United States and elsewhere.  But the Unites States’
semiconductor supply chains dried up in Asia, and the United States — a
lot of it shut down.  
   
This is an agreement we’ve been in — we put back in place.  We could —
if we had this agreement in place we’re talking about today, we would
not have had to lay off so many auto workers because lack of
semiconductors and many other examples.  
   
Second, we’ve concluded an agreement to accelerate the clean energy
transition in the Indo-Pacific region, including by enabling greater
U.S. and private sector investment in clean energy, innovation, and
infrastructure in our partner countries. 

You heard discussions today about how there’s many opportunities and
ideas that have — but being able to attract private sector investment
and government investment is hard for many of these countries that have
great ideas and great opportunities.  
   
Well, the solar investments in the Philippines is an example, offshore
wind in Thailand and Indon- — Indonesia, joint investments between the
United States and India on energy storage, and so much more.  
   
Third, we’ve concluded an agreement to combat corruption and improve tax
administration to make sure that our trade and investment is clean and
transparent and private companies don’t have any worry about their
investments being used properly.  And that’s exactly what we’ve done.   
   
Every business leader I’ve talked to and my colleagues have, they’re
more likely to invest in a region if there’s less corruption, more
transparency.  And that’s exactly what this agreement does and would
show them.  
   
But as I’ve said, we have more work to do.  We made progress in
high-standard trade rules that include strong labor and environmental
standards. 

We’ve committed to extending our cooperation to challenges like
artificial intelligence, energy security, and semiconductors. 

We’re launching a critical minerals dialogue to further strengthen our
supply chains and create clean energy jobs.  
   
And today, I’m proud to announce that the United States is launching
what we’ll call the Investment Accelerator through our Partnership for
the Global Infrastructure and Investment. 

The Accelerator is going to bring private capital off the sidelines for
major investments in clean energy and high technology.  
   
You’ve heard every one of my colleagues say one time or another that
this can’t be done without trillions of dollars of private sector
investment — to get hold of this and get ahold of it quickly to give
them confidence to make those investments.  
That’s going to create a pipeline of projects in partner countries and
then match private sector financing with these projects.  And it’s going
to give those private sector investors confidence that their investment
will be made according to the highest standards.  
   
Government investment is not enough.  We need to mobilize private
investment.  And all the steps are going to help unlock this private
investment, and — which is a necessary ingredient for success and rapid
success in the area we’re talking about.  
   
Put simply, my colleagues and I are driving a race to the top among
nations in the Indo-Pacific, driving nations to the top on standards, on
transparency, on inclusivity and innovation.  And, together, we’re going
to be forging a better future — one where workers get a fair shot and a
fair share of the value they create, where high standards and
sustainable growth win out, where we harness the full power and
potential of our people.  
   
We welcome other nations who share this vision for the future to join
the 13 of us.  Our economies will all be stronger because of it.  
   
Now I’d like to turn it over to a leader who has made part- — this
partnership possible, Prime Minister Kishida of Japan.  
   
The floor is yours, Mr. Prime Minister.  (Applause.)
