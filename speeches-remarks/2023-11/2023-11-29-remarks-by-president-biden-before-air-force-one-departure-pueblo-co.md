THE PRESIDENT:  I’ve got some very good news to report: Liat Beinin is
safe in Egypt.  She’s crossed the border.   
   
I talked with her mother and father, and they’re very appreciative.  And
things are moving well.  She’ll soon be home with her three children.  
   
That’s all I have to say for right now.
