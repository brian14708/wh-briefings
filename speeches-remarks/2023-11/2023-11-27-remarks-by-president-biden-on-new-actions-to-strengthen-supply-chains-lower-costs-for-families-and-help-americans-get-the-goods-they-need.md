  \ Costs for Families, and Help Americans Get the Goods They\_Need"

2:29 P.M. EST  
   
THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much, Pete.  And it’s good to see
you all.   
   
I — you know, we always talk about the big issues, the big things, but
sometimes the big things work or don’t work based on whether or not the
little things are in place, the mechanics are in place.   
   
Secretary Buttigieg, thank you for being here today and to help us
launch this new Council — (clears throat) — excuse me — Council on
Supply Chain Resilience.  
   
I grew up in a family, like many of you, where when the groceries prices
went up, the price of a gallon of gas went up, it was a conversation at
the kitchen table.  I mean literally, not figuratively.  Those
conversations have been going on at kitchen tables all across America
for awhile now.  
   
The conversation — the conversation about whether we’d  
have enough left over at the end of the month for my dad to be able — he
used to say, “have a little bit of breathing room.”  
   
Well, this past week, as Americans gathered around their own kitchen
tables for Thanksgiving dinner, that was our goal: to give them a little
more breathing room.  And together, we made progress.  
   
You know, from turkey, to air travel, to a tank of gas, costs went
down.  They went down.   
   
Now, to people making a lot of money, that doesn’t matter a whole lot,
because the costs are relatively small compared to wealthy incomes.   
   
In fact, as a share of earnings, this Thanksgiving dinner was the
fourth-cheapest ever on record.  And I want you all to know that. 
(Applause.)   
   
I look at all the press looking out.  (Applause.)  The press is
particularly excited about that.  I can see.  (Laughter.)   
   
Well, look, all kidding aside, that’s not all.  On Thanksgiving two
years ago, 100 container ships were waiting in the docks — to dock on
the ports.  They were lined up 100 long out into the ocean.   
   
This year, there were less than 10.  
   
Meaning that today, as folks start their holiday shopping, shelves are
stocked.  Meaning that if major appliances, like a stove or a fridge,
broke down over Thanksgiving, you can replace it faster and 9 percent
cheaper than you did two years ago.  
   
These savings matter to so many families, especially at this time of the
year.   
   
And it’s no — they’re no accident.  When — it comes down to supply
chains.  
   
Did — did you ever think we’d be talking this much about supply chains? 
(Laughter.)  No, but I’m serious.  It’s critical.  Everybody is
beginning to figure it out.  The average person knows what we’re talking
— when we talk about supply chains.  But when the supply chains were
disrupted, we knew what — what trouble we had.  
   
Before the pandemic, supply chains weren’t something most Americans
thought about or talked about.  But today, after years of delay in parts
and products, everyone knows why supply chains are so important.   
   
That’s why, within my first month in office, I signed an executive order
bringing supply chains home — home to get goods moving again.  So, they
start it here.  We had the basic product here.   
   
Less than a year later, I signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to
make a generational investment in every part of our supply chain — from
our roads, to our bridges, to our ports, to our airports, to our
Internet.   
   
Less than a year after that, I signed the Inflation Reduction Act to
grow the industries of the future right here at home, including electric
vehicles and clean energy.  
   
And the CHIPS Act — and the CHIPS and Science Act — how in God’s name
can you lead the world when you don’t lead the world in science and
development? — to make sure we never experience another shortage of
semiconductors.  
   
You know America invented these chips.  I know my staff is tired of
hearing me say this, and my Cabinet: But these small computer chips the
size of a fingertip, they’re — they affect nearly everything in our
lives from cell phones, to automobiles, to refrigerators.  If you don’t
have them, you don’t have those things.  
   
But over time, we went down from producing 40 percent of the world’s
chips, to just doing 10 percent.  But not anymore.  All over the
country, semiconductor factory — companies are investing hundreds of
billions — let me say that — hundreds of billions of dollars to bring
chip production back home, here to the United States.  
   
Over the last three years, all the leaders around this table — these two
tables on my right and left — have also worked to lower costs for
American families: from cracking down on foreign-owned ocean shipping
companies that had raised their prices as much as 1,000 percent while
racking up enormous profits, teaming up with truckers to create
registered apprenticeship programs, and move a record level of cargo
around the country; to helping family farmers and family farms access
fertilizer they need to grow food, so many of us in — so many — that so
many of us enjoyed at Thanksgiving.  
   
Folks, the result: Today, our supply chains are stronger than ever, with
backlogs, bottlenecks, and shipping rates at a 25-year low.  We’ve
created 14 million new jobs, including 800,000 manufacturing jobs.   
   
And the unemployment rate has stayed below 4 percent — below 4 percent
for the longest period — the longest stretch in over 50 years.   
   
And wages for working families have gone up while inflation has come
down 65 percent — giving families a little more money in their pockets
and a little more breathing room this holiday season.  
   
But we know the prices are still too high for too many things, that
times are still too tough for too many families.  But we’ve made
progress, but we have more work to do.  
   
Let me be clear: To any corporation that has not brought their prices
back down — even as inflation has come down, even supply chains have
been rebuilt — it’s time to stop the price gouging — giving the American
consumer a break.  
   
Look, that’s why I’m tackling junk fees — these hidden charges that
companies sneak into your bill to make you pay more money just because
they can and you have no alternative.  Junk fees take real money out of
the pockets of average Americans.  They can add up to hundreds of
dollars, weighing down family budgets and making it harder for a family
to pay their bills.  And they feel like they’re being played for
suckers, which they are.  
   
Over the past two years, my administration has taken steps to crack down
on unfair and deceptive junk fees from banking, hotels, retail housing —
rental housing, cable networks, In- — the Internet, concerts, airlines,
healthcare.   
   
For example, some banks and credit unions were charging as much as $30
for basic services, like — want to check my balance.  Costs you 30
bucks.  Retrieving old bank records will cost you that much money. 
Looking into the balance on a loan, they charge you that money.  We took
action.  The action we’ve taken?  All that is now illegal — illegal.   
   
Overdraft fees were also down nearly 50 percent, which means savings of
a hundred — average of a $150 for 33 million families across the
country.   
   
And credit companies — credit companies have been charging an average of
$31 whenever you call — and you can’t — whenever you can’t pay your bill
on time — whenever you’re late.  You know, we’re taking action to cut
these fees as well to no more than $8 penalty.  
   
But, you know, MAGA Republicans in Congress are pushing back on our
efforts to end these junk fees.  Folks, these refunds may not matter to
the wealthy, but they matter to working folks in homes like the ones a
lot of us grew up in.  
   
That’s what this is all about: the American people.  
   
And today, we’re coming together to ask a simple question: What’s next? 
What can we do?  What must we do to keep making progress to keep our
supply chain stable and secure in the long term, to keep preserving that
breathing room — that little bit of breathing room for American families
for the season to come, no matter what challenges we face?  
   
And thanks to the folks who are assembled here around this table, we’re
making progress on two key fronts.   
   
First, we’re doubling down on our work at home — starting right here,
right now — with the launch of a new Council on Supply Chain
Resilience.  I’m charging this group to ensure that our supply chains
remain secure, diversified, resilient, and do all — and into the
future.   
   
I’ve also directed my Cabinet to create an early warning system that
uses data to spot subside\*\* — supply chains risks to our economic
security, our national security, our energy security, and our climate
security.  
   
And I’m proud to announce that I’ll be invoking what’s known as the
Defense Production Act to boost production of essential medicines in
America, by American workers.  Because you notice we’ve had — people had
to get certain kinds of shots.  It was not available.  You had to get it
overseas.  Well, that supply chain is going to start here in America —
here in America.  
   
We’re going to help ensure American families have reliable access to
medicines they need.  
   
Second, we’re doubling down on our work with global partners.  
   
Two weeks ago, I signed the first-of-its-kind supply chain agreement
with 13 countries in the Indo-Pacific.  This agreement is going to help
us identify supply chain bottlenecks before — before they become the
kind of full-scale disruptions we saw  
during the pandemic.  We all saw what happened then.  
   
     Semiconductor supply chains from Asia and Afri- — and — and to
America shut — from Asia to America shut down.  If this agreement had
been in place back then, we would have had to — we would be able to
avoid that.  
   
And auto companies could not have had to lay off so many workers because
they didn’t — couldn’t — couldn’t get the computer chips to could the
vehicles.  
   
On top of this, I also signed the first-ever presidential memorandum on
worker rights globally, a move that’s going to address forced labor;
promote worker health, worker wages, worker unions as we build out our
supply chains.  Because we know our progress depends on our workers,
including union workers.   
   
They — they keep our supply chains secure and our ec- — our economies
moving.  
   
So, we have to do more to empower them here at home and around the
world.  
   
Fortunately, we’ve been able to push back on Republican — MAGA
Republicans so far, but they haven’t given up.  They haven’t given up. 
They still want to undo this progress we’re making.   
   
They’re proposing cuts to investments in roads, in bridges, the Internet
— the high-speed Internet — the very things that provided from the —
anyway, they’re just — across the board.  And the cuts that could result
in loss of jobs, in infrastructure, and in manufacturing.  
   
And they want to go back to the “bad old days,” when corporations looked
around the world to find the cheapest labor they could find, to send the
jobs overseas, and then import the products back to the United States.  
   
Now we’re building the products here and exporting products overseas. 
We’re not importing jobs.  
   
Folks, we’re not importing anything other than what we make.  We’re
making it here, and we’re sending it overseas, rather than going to
cheapest place we can go to have it made.  
   
The bottom line: They want to make the whole supply chain  
more vulnerable.  Their plan would offshore jobs; raise costs for
seniors by repealing the insulin price reduction, the caps on
out-of-pocket drug expenses, and the ability to negotiate lower drug
prices that I secured in the Inflation Reduction Act.   
   
Their plan would cut Social Security benefits.  I thought we had this —
they agreed not to do this a couple times.  But they’re back at it. 
Benefits — average benefit cut would be 13 percent for people — for —
for — by 13 percent — those that we can cut.   
   
Their plan would also cut Medicare, while providing more tax giveaways
to the wealthy and the biggest corporations.  
   
And my predecessor has once again, God love him, called for cuts that
could rip away health insurance for tens of millions of Americans in
Medicaid.  They just don’t give up.  
   
But guess what?  We won’t let these things happen.  
   
Let me close with this.  You know, we’ve faced some pretty tough times
in recent years, but in America there’s no surrender.  There’s no giving
up.  There’s no stopping.  America never gives up.  
   
I’ve long said we’re the only nation in the world that comes out of
every crisis stronger than when we went into it — that crisis.   
   
I truly believe that 50 years from now, when historians are taking a
look at this — looking back at this moment — when they look back on the
work we’re doing to build the economy from the bottom up and middle out;
to strengthen the  
American supply chains and manufacturing workers all across the country,
they’re going to say that this was the beginning — when America won the
competition of the 21st century.  
   
I’ve never been more optimistic about our nation’s future.  We just have
to remember who we are.   
   
You’ve heard me say it before: We are the United States of America, and
there is nothing — nothing beyond our capacity when we do it
together.   
   
So, folks, I’ve got a lot of work ahead of us.  I’m confident we can
do.  We’ve done a lot already.  So, just keep at it.  We’re going to
lower prices for the average Americans all across this country.   
   
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)
