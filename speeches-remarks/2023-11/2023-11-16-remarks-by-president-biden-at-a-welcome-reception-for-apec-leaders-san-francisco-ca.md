The Exploratorium  
San Francisco, California

7:40 P.M. PST  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, hello, hello!  (Applause.)  
   
Good evening, everyone.  I think there’s folks back up behind that
barrier.  There are.  Holy mackerel.  Don’t jump.  Don’t jump. 
(Laughter.)  
   
Hello, APEC.  Coach, thanks for that introduction and thanks for the —
San Francisco’s MVP VIP that we just saw on the screen.  And it’s a real
honor to welcome all my fellow leaders to the United States.  
   
Two years ago, when the United States offered to host this summit, we
knew we’d need a location dynamic and diverse and — as APEC itself.  And
APEC in San Francisco, here we are.  
   
I want to talk about Governor Newsom.  Want to thank him.  He’s been one
hell of a governor, man.  (Applause.)  Matter of fact, he could be
anything he wants.  He could have the job I’m looking for. 
(Laughter.)  
   
And, Mayor Breed, congratulations.  Being a mayor — well, you’re crazy. 
(Laughter.)  I think it’s the hardest job in American politics.  
   
And everyone on the host committee, for all — all you’ve done to open
your beautiful, historic city to us.   
   
You know, I — to digress just a second, I was with Xi Jinping today. 
And — and I showed him a photograph that he’s extremely proud of.  When
he was a young man — I think he was 32 — maybe 28, 30 years old, in that
range.  And he was — hey, how you doing, man?  
   
He was actually standing on the Golden Gate Bridge.  He had come to
visit.  And he said — and I looked at the picture.  I said, “I wanted to
show you a picture.”  He said, “I like that picture.  I like the…” 
Well, he was translated to say, “I like that picture.”  
   
So, he’s been coming here.  And one of the things I pointed out to him
is that you have one of the largest Chinese populations in America
here.  And he was — he feels like he’s going home here.  (Laughter.)  
   
You know, we’ve got — is Nancy here tonight?  Nancy Pelosi? 
(Applause.)  Nancy, you are the finest Speaker of the House in American
history.  (Applause.)  No, you are.  You are, Nancy.  Thank God.  I tell
you what, you’re the very best, Nancy.  Thank you, thank you for all you
do.  (Applause.)  
   
Look — and I’m particularly grateful that — to the Bay Area for giving
our great Vice President a chance to become vice president. 
(Laughter.)  She’s the best.  She’s an outstanding leader and a great
partner.  (Applause.)  
   
This is a city by the Bay — a city where many have left their hearts.  A
city built for generations of dreamers, all — all chasing a hope and a
chance to build something new.  
   
From here in San Francisco, America reaches out all across the Pacific,
building bridges mightier than the Golden Gate, spanning more than —
more space and time than the great expanse that the water has.  Bridges
linking pride in our past.  The immigrants and workers who sunk their
sweat and founded — in the foundations of this nation.  And our hope for
the future and the untold heights to which we’re going to climb
together.  
   
Bridges connecting diverse communities.  All across the traditions,
cultures, and languages, we find the common dreams we share for
ourselves and for our children.  Bridges that carry the ideas of
entrepreneurs: “What if?  Why not?  What next?”  
   
Look, so, over the next few days, I hope we’ll all take full advantage
of this summit to make new connections and spark new partnerships,
because every step we take to deepen our cooperation, to launch a new
venture, to tackle the challenges that impact on all of us is a step
toward realization of the enormous potential of our Asian Pacific
future.  
   
Ladies and gentlemen, a future where our economics are strong, vibrant,
and sustainable because our workers are empowered and protected; women
and girls are full and equal participants in every aspect of our
society; young people — (applause) — young people can envision — well,
that’s a fact.  By the way, I’ve got more women in my Cabinet than men. 
(Applause.)  
   
I told Nancy, “I’m not stupid.  All the women in my family are a hell of
a lot smarter than all the men, including me.”  (Laughter.)  
   
But young people can envision for themselves the lives and hope for
unlimited possibilities.   
   
Look, ladies and gentlemen, we’ve got a few busy days ahead of us.  The
challenges before us today are unlike those faced by previous groups of
APEC leaders.  How we’re going to harness the potential of artificial
intelligence to lift up the world and lives of — while minimizing the
risk and safety concerns that it presents.  
   
Will we act with the speed and urgency necessary to dramatically curb
the carbon emissions and avert the climate catastrophe that threatens us
all?  
   
Can we build supply chains that are more resilient, more secure in the
face of threats like pandemics and natural disasters and that will form
a strong foundation for a clean economy for tomorrow?  
   
Folks, the challenges may be different, but our strongest tools that
meet them — those challenges remain the same as they were with our first
APEC Leaders’ Summit: connection, cooperation, collective action, and
common purpose.  That’s why we’re all here.  
   
I’m looking forward to seeing all the progress we’re going to make and
all the bridges between our people we’re going to continue to build in
the months and years ahead.   
   
So, thank you all again for being here and welcome to San Francisco. 
(Applause.)  
   
Thank you.
