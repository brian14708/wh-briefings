Oval Office

12:25 P.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT:  Folks, I wanted you to come in because these eight men
have done things that are changing not only their lives but lives of
families that were able to celebrate Christmas (inaudible) but they
did.  They saved children.  They saved people in serious distress.  They
jumped into freezing water.  They did it all.

And I think it’s — I think it’s very important that the public see them
and know who they are.  I know you have all their backgrounds, but what
they did — they allowed people to continue their lives in ways that they
never would have been able to.  There’s a lot fewer empty chairs around
the kitchen table and dining room table because of what these guys did. 

And what they did is — is amazing.  They literally put their lives at
risk — some of them at the point that you wonder how they could have had
the nerve to do it. 

In addition to that, I want to thank their families, because if you’re
the spouse of a firefighter or a police officer, you always worry about
that phone call — that one phone call you’re going to get when the —
know the alarm went off.  And — and so, I want to thank them, because
I’m confident they wouldn’t be able to do what they’re doing without
their s- — the support of their spouses and their families. 

So, thank you, guys.  I really mean it.  You’re the best America has to
offer.  I’m so damn proud to stand with you.

And I know you have a lot of questions for me, and I’m not going to
answer them unless they’re related to this.  I’m going to be talking
later today. 

So, anybody have any questions about these guys?  (Inaudible.)

AIDE:  Thank you, press.

Q    Mr. President, have you spoken to any of the families of the
victims in New Orleans?

THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, I have. 

Q    What have they told you?  What have their reflections been?

THE PRESIDENT:  How —

AIDE:  Thank you, press.

Q    Any thoughts, you know, on the suspects in those incidents?

(Cross-talk.)

THE PRESIDENT:  I’ll talk to that later.
