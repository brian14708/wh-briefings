  \ the 2024 Presidential\_Election"

*U.S. Capitol  
Washington, D.C.*  
 

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, today was a — obviously, a very important
day, and it was about what should be the norm and what the American
people should be able to take for granted, which is that one of the most
important pillars of our democracy is that there will be a peaceful
transfer of power.   
   
And today, I did what I have done my entire career, which is take
seriously the oath that I have taken many times to support and defend
the Constitution of the United States, which included, today, performing
my constitutional duties to ensure that the people of America, the
voters of America will have their votes counted, that those votes
matter, and that they will determine, then, the outcome of an
election.   
   
I do believe very strongly that America’s democracy is only as strong as
our willingness to fight for it — every single person, their willingness
to fight for and respect the importance of our democracy.  Otherwise, it
is very fragile and it will not be able to withstand moments of
crisis.   
   
And today, America’s democracy stood.  
   
Thank you.
