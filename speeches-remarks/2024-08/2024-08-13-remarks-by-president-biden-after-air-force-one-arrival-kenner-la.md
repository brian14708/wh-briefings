Louis Armstrong International Airport  
Kenner, Louisiana

2:09 P.M. CDT  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  I just promoted the general to a two-star major
general.   
  
Q    Congratulations.  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  She’s — she’s lucky to — she — she has a congressman
she’s got to take care of all the time.  (Laughter.)  But this is it. 
Th- — that’s why we were up- — upstairs.  I was pinning it on.  So, I
just want to let you know what we were doing.  
  
Q    Mr. President, how important is it to make this announcement that
will aid the cancer fight?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  It’s critically important.  I started this back in the
administration with President — at — at the time, when I was vice
president.   
  
And we found out that — I traveled to every major cancer research
facility in the world.  And we found out that there — a lot more we
could do if they shared more data and information.  It wasn’t being
shared.  That was the Cancer Moonshot.  
  
And then, when I got elected when I ran for president, I decided to set
up a cancer facility patterned on DARPA, which is the Defense
Intelligence Agency position that is separate and apart from everything
else.  They’re the ones that came up with everything from — anyway, they
— all of the major breakthroughs.

So, that’s what we’re doing with DARPA.  And we’re going to continue. 
We’ve — a billion five the last three years, and we’re going to continue
it. 

But we — I’ll let you get out of the sun. 

Q    Mr. President, are you very concerned about the situation in the
Middle East?

THE PRESIDENT:  Of course I’m concerned about it.  We —

Q    Speaking to Benjamin Netanyahu, there have been reports that you
told him to stop bullshitting.  Like, what exactly are you doing to put
pressure on him to get to the table? 

THE PRESIDENT:  If I told you what pressure I was putting on, it
wouldn’t be very much pressure, would it?

Anyway, so —

Q    Mr. President, what do you have to say about what’s happening in
Russia and Ukraine?  Have you spoken with anyone in the Ukrainian
government? 

THE PRESIDENT:  I’ve spoken with my staff on a regular basis probably
every four or five hours for the last six or eight days.  And it’s —
it’s creating a real dilemma for Putin.  And we’ve been in direct
contact — constant contact with — with the Ukrainians. 

That’s all I’m going to say about it while it’s active.  Okay?

Q    On the Middle East.  Do you think you can still get to a ceasefire
deal, or is that starting to be a distinct pos- — a distant possibility?

THE PRESIDENT:  It’s getting hard.  We’ll see what Ukrai- — we’ll see
what Iran does, and we’ll see what happens if there’s any attack.  But
I’m not giving up.

Q    Are those two things tied together?  Is — do you have the
understanding that Iran could cease or stop doing a — an action if a
ceasefire deal was possible?

THE PRESIDENT:  That’s my expectation, but we’ll see. 

Thank you.
