Q    Anything on the Middle East, Mr. President?

THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t have much to report.  My staff has been in
contact with the Israelis.  They’ve discovered bodies in Gaza.  They’re
not sure the exact number; they haven’t taken them out yet.  And in the
meantime —

(A nearby protestor can be heard.)

PROTESTOR:  Choose life, Mr. President!  Choose life while you still
have time to undo some of the terrible things you’ve done!

THE PRESIDENT:  And in the meantime, they want to identify the bodies. 
There’s a lot of speculation who they are — the names.  I’m not at
liberty to do that until the families are notified.

And it’s time this war ended.  We should end this war.  I think we’re on
the verge of having an agreement.  It’s just time to end it.  It’s time
to finish it.

Q    Why do you think you’re on the verge of an agreement?  How
optimistic are you?

THE PRESIDENT:  I’m still optimistic because the leaders of both have
led — have met in Ga- — in bo- — in Egypt.  Our people are continuing to
meet, and we think we can close the deal.  They’ve all said they agree
on the principles.  So, keep your fingers crossed.

Q    Sir, have you spoken to Netanyahu?

Q    (Inaudible) weekend?  Are they resuming next week?

THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  There — there are talks.

Q    Mr. President, what do you think of President Trump’s behavior in
Arlington Cemetery with the — the visit to the — to the fallen soldiers?

THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t want to answer because I may tell you what I
think.

Thank you.

Q    Did you watch your vice president’s interview on CNN?

Q    Anything on the ISIS operation, Mr. President?

Q    What are your campaign plans, Mr. President?

THE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible.)  We’re going to be — I’m doing
<s>Memorial</s> \[Labor\] Day in Pittsburgh, and I’m on the road from
there on.
