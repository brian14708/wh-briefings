Q How are the ceasefire talks?

THE PRESIDENT: So far, s- — as of an hour ago, they’re still in play.
I’m optimistic. Not t- — far from over. Just a couple more issues. I
think we’ve got a shot.

Q Are you more optimistic now than you have been in months past?

THE PRESIDENT: Yes.

Q Why?

THE PRESIDENT: If I told you that, I’d give away what’s going on.

Q When — when would the ceasefire begin if you can get a deal?

THE PRESIDENT: That remains to be seen.

Q Okay. Are — are you going to work on your speech this weekend?

THE PRESIDENT: Yes.

Q Okay.

Q What’s your message to Democrats on Monday night?

THE PRESIDENT: Win. (Laughs.)

All right. Thank you, guys.
