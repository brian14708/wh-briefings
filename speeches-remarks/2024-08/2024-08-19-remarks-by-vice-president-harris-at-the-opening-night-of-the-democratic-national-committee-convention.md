     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good evening, everyone.  (Applause.)  G- —
(laughs) — (applause).  Good evening, good evening.  It is so good to be
with everyone this evening in this hall and everyone at home.  
  
This is going to be a great week — (applause) — and I want to kick us
off by celebrating our incredible president, Joe Biden — (applause) —
who will be speaking later tonight.  
  
Joe, thank you for your historic leadership, for your lifetime of
service to our nation, and for all you will continue to do.  We are
forever grateful to you.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Joe.  
  
AUDIENCE:  Thank you, Joe!  Thank you, Joe!  Thank you, Joe!  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And looking out — looking out at everyone tonight,
I see the beauty of our great nation.  People from every corner of our
country and every walk of life are here, united by our shared vision for
the future of our country.   
  
And this November, we will come together and declare with one voice, as
one people: We are moving forward — (applause) — with optimism, hope,
and faith.  
  
So, guided by our love of country, knowing we all have so much more in
common than what separates us, let us fight for the ideals we hold
dear.  And let us always remember, when we fight —  
  
AUDIENCE:  We win!  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — we win.  (Applause.)  
  
God bless you.  God bless the United States of America.  Good night,
everyone.  (Applause.)
