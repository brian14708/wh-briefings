*Primanti Bros. Restaurant and Bar  
Moon Township, Pennsylvania*

6:26 P.M. EDT  
  
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Hi, guys.  
  
     Q    Madam Vice President.  
  
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Hi.  Hi.  What you got?  
  
     Q    Can you (inaudible) —  
  
     AIDE:  Go ahead.  Right here.  Go ahead.  
  
     Q    Hi.  Thank you.  Could you tell us how you’re preparing for
your speech on Thursday night?  
  
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, it’s almost done.  I mean, I’m — there’s
some little tweaks, and I’m going to, you know, work on it, probably
starting tomorrow, for the next couple of days.  But it’s coming along. 
I feel good about it.   
  
I mean, essentially, it’s much of what you’ve probably heard me talk
about before in terms of just what I believe to be the promise of
America and the fact that we’re all in this and  
there’s obviously a lot at stake, but there’s also a lot to feel good
about in terms of the future of our country.  
  
So, there will be a lot that is about what I believe is a way forward —
a new way forward and bringing everyone along in that.  
  
(Cross-talk.)  
  
AIDE:  Right here, ma’am.  
  
Q    Madam Vice President, you unveiled your — some economic policies
last week.  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  
  
Q    Can you explain how you’re going to pay for those?  And can you
give us a sense of what other policies you want to unveil going
forward?  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Sure.  Well, I mean, you just look at it in terms
of what we are talking about, for example, around children and the Child
Tax Credit and extending the EITC that — it’s — at $6,000 for the first
year of a — a child’s life.  The return on that investment in terms of
what that will do and what it will pay for will be tremendous.   
  
We’ve seen it when we did it in the first year of our administration:
reduced — we reduced child poverty by over 50 percent.  So, that’s a lot
of the work.   
  
And then what we’re doing in terms of the tax credits — we know that
there’s a great return on that investment.  When we increase
homeownership in America, what that means in terms of increasing the tax
base — not to mention property tax base — what that does to fund
schools.  Again, return on investment.   
  
I think it’s a mistake for any person who talks about public policy to
not critically evaluate how you measure the return on the investment. 
When you are strengthening neighborhoods, strengthening communities,
and, in particular, the economy of those communities and investing in a
broad-based economy, everybody benefits, and it pays for itself in that
way.  
  
Q    Madam Vice President —  
  
Q    Madam Vice President, CBS News has a new poll, shows that you’re
three points up nationally.  What’s your response to this?  Do you still
consider yourself the underdog here?  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I very much consider us the underdog.  We have a
lot of work to do to earn the vote of the American people.  That’s why
we’re on this bus tour today.  And we’re going to be traveling this
country, as we’ve been, and talking with folks, listening to folks, and
hopefully earning their votes over the next 79 days.  
  
Q    This is your second time in —

     AIDE:  Darlene, one more.  Last one, Darlene.  
  
Q    — Pennsylvania since you became the Democratic nominee.  Do you
feel like you have ground to make up here?  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I feel like we need to earn everyone’s vote.  And
that means being on the road; being in communities where people are,
where they live — whether it be a high school football team and being
there at their public school while they’re there at practice and talking
to their coaches; whether it means going to the local fire station and
talking with our incredible firefighters about what they need and what
they have a right to expect, such as that we are going to pay attention
to how they give up so much to keep communities safe, what they do to
preserve what we want in terms of a quality of life — and we need to
give it back to them in terms of better equipment — and the work they do
every day.   
  
So, I’m going to be out here with Tim, with the second gentleman, with
Mrs. Walz, and we’re going to be working on earning every vote between
now —

     Q    Do —

     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — and November.   
  
Q    Sorry.  Do you think —  
  
AIDE:  Darlene, last question.  
  
Q    Do you think Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is ready to — to
agree to a ceasefire deal?  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I will not speak for him, but I will tell you that
these conversations are ongoing and we are not giving up.  And we are
going to continue to work very hard on this.  We got to get a ceasefire,
and we got to get those hostages out.  
  
Okay.
