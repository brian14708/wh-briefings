     Q    Madam Vice President!  
   
     Q    Madam Vice President!  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I’m coming over there.  Calm down. 
(Laughs.)   
   
     Q    She’s like, “I’m coming.”  (Laughter.)  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  What you got?    
   
     Q    President Trump had a press conference today.  He talked about
a lot of things.  Wondering if you have a reaction to what he talked
about.  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’m glad that he’s finally agreed to a
debate on September 10th.  I’m looking forward to it and hope he shows
up.  
   
     Q    Are you open to more debates?  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I am happy to have that conversation about an
additional debate for after September 10th, for sure.  
   
     Q    He proposed two more — two more debates.  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Like I said, happy to have that
conversation.  
   
     Q    Why do you think he pulled out of the debate with you?  Why do
you think he’s —  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I am beyond trying to speculate about how he
thinks.   
   
     What else?  
   
     Q    Can you comment on some of his other criticisms?  He made a
whole litany of them today.   
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I was —  
   
     Q    Some of them are about your —  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I was too busy talking to voters.  I didn’t
hear them.  
   
     Q    Some of the criticism has been about your vice presidential
pick and his leaving the National Guard at 24 years.  Vance said that he
deserted his own troops or his own colleagues.  What’s your take on
that?  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Listen, I praise anyone who has presented
themselves to serve our country, and I think that we all should.  
   
     Q    Madam Vice President, there’s been a lot of questions about
when you’re going to sit down for your first interview since being the
nominee.  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I’ve —  
   
     Q    Do you have any update on that?  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I’ve talked to my team.  I want us to get an
interview scheduled before the end of the month.   
   
     AIDE:  Thank you.  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.   
   
     Okay.  Thank you.
