     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Sorry to keep you guys out in the heat.   
  
     Okay.  You ready?  
  
As President Biden announced earlier today, American citizens Paul,
Evan, Alsu, and green-card holder Vladimir, who were unjustly held in
Russia, will soon be re- — reunited with their loved ones.

     They and their families have shown incredible courage in the face
of atrocious and devastating circumstances.

     Russian authorities arrested, convicted them in sham trials, and
sentenced them to long prison terms.  This has been an appalling
perversion of justice.

     Over many years, President Biden and I and our team have engaged in
complex diplomatic negotiations to bring these wrongfully detained
Americans home.  We never stopped fighting for their release.  And
today, in spite of all of their suffering, it gives me great comfort to
know that their horrible ordeal is finally over.

     This exchange also includes the release of Russian political
prisoners, including those who worked with Aleksey Navalny.

     Earlier today, I spoke with the Aleksey’s widow, Yulia, to discuss
the significance of their release.  And as I told her — this being an
additional time from previous conversations with her — the United States
stands with all of those who are fighting for freedom in Russia.

     As we celebrate today’s news, we must also keep front of mind that
there are other Americans that are unjustly being held in places around
the world, and we will never stop fighting for their release.

     As vice president, it has been my honor to work alongside our
president, Joe Biden, to bring home more than 70 Americans in the last
three and a half years.  And we will never waver in our commitment to
bring home every American who has been wrongfully detained or held
hostage.

     That is my solemn commitment to my fellow Americans, which I will
always honor.

     Thank you all.  Thank you.
