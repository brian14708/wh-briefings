Sheraton Phoenix Downtown Hotel

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Hi, guys.   
      
(Cross-talk.)  
   
Q    When can we expect you to roll out your policy platform?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Next week, and it’ll be focused on the economy and
what we need to do to bring down costs and also strengthen the economy
overall.   
   
Q    Can you give us a sense of —  
   
Q    Do you have any reaction to the —  
   
Q    Go ahead, Darlene.  
   
Q    — Israeli strike in Gaza today that killed at least 80 people? 
That’s the death toll right now.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  You know, yet again, there are far too many
civilians who have been killed.  I mean, Israel has a right to go after
the terrorists that are Hamas.  But as I have said many, many times,
they also have, I believe, an important responsibility to avoid civilian
casualties.  
   
Q    Madam Vice President, you’ve been saying that since October 7th,
and that has been the administration’s policy for many, many months now
—  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  
   
Q    — as tens of thousands of civilians have been killed.  
   
I mean, there are people who are asking for limitations on arms to
Israel, any kind of change.  What do you say to those folks who are
looking for more than “we should look out for civilians”?   
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, look, first and foremost — and the president
and I have been working on this around the clock — we need to get the
hostages out.  We need a hostage deal, and we need a ceasefire.  And I
can’t stress that strongly enough.  It needs to get done.  The deal
needs to get done, and it needs to get done now.  
   
Q    On economy.  I know you’re going to speak about that this coming
week.   
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  
   
Q    Can you give us a sense on how — what your view is on the Fed and
independence of the Fed?  President Trump weighed in on that this last
week and said he thought he should have some say in the Fed’s
decisions.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I couldn’t agree — disagree, excuse me, more
strongly.  The Fed is an independent entity and, as president, I would
never interfere in the decisions that the Fed makes.   
   
Q    And what’s your take on their policies right now?  Do you — there
was some concern last week as the market fell that there might be a
recession coming.  What’s your view on that?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, as we know, we — there was some turbulence
this week, but it seems to have settled itself.  And — and we’ll see
what the decisions they make next.  And I — I hear about them about the
same time you do.  (Laughs.)  
   
Q    Sure.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  
   
AIDE:  Thank you.  
   
Q    Do you what day —  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  
   
Q    — you will roll out your policy?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Hopefully, mid- — by midweek.  
   
(Cross-talk.)  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.
