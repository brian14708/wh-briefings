Eau Claire Event District  
Eau Claire, Wisconsin

2:12 P.M. CDT  
   
     GOVERNOR WALZ:  Wow.  (Applause.)  Wow.  Wow.  
   
Hello, Eau Claire.  (Applause.)  
   
Isn’t it good to have a candidate who can pronounce the name correctly,
so — (laughter and applause).  Wow.   
   
Les, thank you.  Thank you for the introduction.  More importantly,
thank you for articulating what we know it means to live out here in the
Midwest: Care for your neighbors, kindness.  (Applause.)  
   
I want to acknowledge a few people today.   
   
Somebody who I have to tell you might be the kindest human being I have
ever met: your governor, Tony Evers.  (Applause.)   
   
A dear friend of mine who I had a chance to serve with in the House of
Representatives, an incredible senator: Tammy Baldwin.  (Applause.)  
   
The people’s lawyer, your attorney general: Josh Kaul.  (Applause.)  
   
And someone who knows education is a foundation of everything: State
Superintendent Jill Underly.  (Applause.)  
   
All the state and local officials are here, but I want to say — a point
of personal privilege on this — I got a bunch of my family down here in
the front, so — (laughs).  (Applause.)  A coup- — (applause) — a couple
of them — a couple of them are Badgers too, by the way, so —
(applause).  
   
And a real special thank you to everybody here.  Looking out across
here, look, you’re busy people.  You got things to do.  It’s a summer
day.  You had to walk two miles.  I had nothing to do with that, by the
way — (laughter) — nothing, so —  
   
But you came here for one beautiful, simple reason: You love this
country and this democracy.  (Applause.)  
   
I couldn’t be prouder to be on this ticket to help make Kamala Harris
the next president of the United States.  (Applause.)  
   
You know it: Vice President Harris is on the side of the American
people.  She took on predators, fraudsters, transnational gang members. 
She stood up against powerful corporate interests.  And she never
hesitated, not once, to reach across the aisle if it improved people’s
lives.  (Applause.)  
   
Being a Midwesterner too, I know a little something about commitment to
people.  I was born in a small town in Nebraska, where community meant
everything.  My mom and dad taught me to show generosity to my neighbors
and work for a common good.   
   
At 17, I joined the Army National Guard.  (Applause.)  For 24 years, I
proudly wore the uniform of this nation.  (Applause.)  And — and that
service, just as it did for my dad, a Korean War-era veteran, and
millions of others, I got the G.I. Bill, and it gave me a shot at a
college education.  (Applause.)  
   
My dad was a teacher.  My siblings were all teachers.  (Applause.)  And
three of them married teachers.  (Applause.) It’s noble work.  I had the
privilege of teaching public school social studies and coaching football
for 20 years.  (Applause.)  
   
And for all you Packer and Badgers fan, yeah, we did win a state
championship, so — (laughter and applause).  It’s what we do.  
   
But it was my students who encouraged me to run for office.  I never
thought that much about it, but they saw in me what I was hoping to
instill in them: this idea of a commitment to a better world, a common
good, a belief that one single person can actually make a difference. 
(Applause.)  
   
I lived in a red district, but my neighbors were kind enough and graced
me with the opportunity to go to the United States House of
Representatives for 12 years to represent them.  (Applause.)  I learned
how to compromise without compromising my values.  (Applause.)  
   
And as governor of the great state of Minnesota, I brought all that
experience — (applause) —   
   
Okay, okay.  Are there Minnesotans in the house today?  (Applause.)  
   
AUDIENCE:  Tim!  Tim!  Tim!  
   
GOVERNOR WALZ:  — bringing that experience to tackling the challenges
that were facing our state.  We don’t shy away from challenges.  
   
But I’ll tell you what, Donald Trump — he sees the world differently
than we see it.   
   
AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
GOVERNOR WALZ:  He has no understanding of service because he’s too busy
servicing himself — (laughter) — again and again and again.  Again and
again and again, this guy weakens our country to strengthen his own
hand.  He mocks our laws, he sows chaos and division amongst the people,
and that’s to say nothing of the job he did as president.   
   
AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
GOVERNOR WALZ:  He froze in the face of COVID, and it cost people’s
lives.   
   
AUDIENCE:  Yes!  
   
GOVERNOR WALZ:  He drove the economy into the ground.   
   
AUDIENCE:  Yes!  
   
GOVERNOR WALZ:  And make no mistake about it, violent crime was up when
Donald Trump was president.  (Applause.)  
   
Those of you who are a little older know this.  Older Republicans used
to talk about freedom.  These guys today, it turns out that freedom to
them means government should be free to invade your exam room with your
doctor.   
   
AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
GOVERNOR WALZ:  Now, look, we’re pretty neighborly with Wisconsin.  We
get our friendly battles.  But in Minnesota, just like in Wisconsin, we
respect our neighbors and the personal choices they make — (applause) —
even if — even if we wouldn’t make the same choices for ourselves,
because we know there’s a golden rule: Mind your own damn business. 
Mind your own damn business.  (Applause.)  
   
I don’t need you telling me about our health care, I don’t need you
telling us who we love, and I sure the hell don’t need you telling us
what books we’re going to read.  (Applause.)  
   
And there’s a very personal one for me, and that includes IVF.  Some of
you might have heard this.  This is very personal for my wife and I. 
When Gwen and I decided to have children, we went through years of
fertility treatments.  And I remember each night praying that the call
was going to come, and it was going to be good news.  The phone would
ring, tenseness in my stomach, and then the agony when you heard the
treatments hadn’t worked.   
   
So, it wasn’t by chance that when we welcomed our first child, our
beautiful daughter, we named her Hope.  (Applause.)  
   
When Vice President Harris and I and everyone here talks about freedom,
we mean the freedom to make your own health care decisions — (applause)
— and for all of our little ones to be free to go to school without
worrying about being shot dead in their classroom.  (Applause.)  
   
And just like Wisconsin, over in Minnesota, we believe in the Second
Amendment, but we also believe in commonsense gun violence laws. 
(Applause.)   
   
And just so you know, when I was in Congress, I was the top gun at the
trap shoot three years in a <s>ray</s> \[row\].  I can outshoot them
too.  (Applause.)  I can outshoot these guys.   
   
Look, freedom is when —  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Help!  
   
GOVERNOR WALZ:  Freedom is — oh.  Can we — can we get somebody to help? 
Somebody’s hot.   
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Somebody help her!  
   
GOVERNOR WALZ:  Somebody’s hot.  Can we get somebody to help?  
   
You okay?   
   
Drink some water, folks.  It is hot out.  Get somebody o- —  
   
GOVERNOR WALZ:  Thank you.  (Applause.)  
   
Can we get water?   
   
AUDIENCE:  They’re so weird!  They’re so weird!  They’re so weird!  
   
GOVERNOR WALZ:  (Laughs.)  
   
She’s okay?   
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Thank you for helping!  
   
GOVERNOR WALZ:  Yeah.  
   
Thank you all for helping.  I’m grateful.  Thank you.  (Applause.) 
Thank you all.   
   
Take care of one another on this.  This is — this is why we gather. 
Look, it’s hot.  It is hot.  I’ll come again.  They’ve got folks here. 
We’ll — we’ll make sure it — we’re okay.  
   
But I — I have to tell you all again, I — in all seriousness, to come
and gather like this to talk about our freedoms, the ability to talk
about what could be good — and I have to say, this idea of caring for
our neighbor in kindness and a hand up when somebody needs it or just
the sense of that people go through things and to be able to be there
when they need it, that’s who we are.  It’s not about mocking.  It’s not
name-callings and — you see it amongst them.  (Applause.)  
   
(Claps.)  Yay!  Thank you all.  (Applause.)   
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible) more water down there?  
   
GOVERNOR WALZ:  They do.  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Someone up here needs one.  
   
GOVERNOR WALZ:  Thank you all.  We’re e- — we’re okay.  He’s going to —
we have someone down.  They’re treating him, they’re getting him some
water, and it’s good.  He’s going to get up.   
   
You guys need some water too?  We’ll ask them.   
   
Teddy, can you see if they have some more water?  That’d be great.  Take
care of your neighbors.  
   
There we go.  (Applause.)  There we go.  There we go.  
   
All right.  All right, folks.  Hey, they’re getting him taken care of. 
I — we’ll stay — I don’t want to be too lighthearted.  I thought about
doing the Minnesota Rouser, but I thought that might be too much over
here on you.  (Applause.)  
   
Look, we’ll get — we’ll get him taken care of.  
   
You know what this is about.  This is about when they talk about the
freedoms that we heard, and freedom in education means that our teachers
aren’t saddled with crippling debt when they go into this — the student
loan debt.  (Applause.)  
   
And I’ll tell you what a big part of this is: We settle our political
differences not through violence but through our votes.  (Applause.)   
   
The question is pretty simple.  This election is all about asking that
question.  Which direction will this country go in?  
   
Donald Trump knows the direction he wants to take us.  He wants to take
it back.  He wants to do the things that you saw.  But be very clear. 
Don’t believe him when he plays dumb.  He knows exactly what he’s
talking about.  He knows exactly what Project 2025 will do in
restricting and taking our freedoms.  He knows that it rigs the economy
for the super rich.   
   
If he gets a chance to go back to the White House, it will be far worse
than it was four years ago — (applause) — raising costs for the middle
class; refeating — repealing the Affordable Care Act; gutting Social
Security and Medicare, the very safety nets that protect people when
they’re down; and, of course, banning abortions across this country with
or without Congress.  
   
AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
GOVERNOR WALZ:  This is where we talk to our neighbors.  Donald Trump is
not for you or your family.   
   
And Trump’s running mate shares those same dangerous and backward
beliefs.  You know, just like all of us in regular America, we — we go
to Yale and then we have our careers funded by Silicon Valley
billionaires, and then you write a book about the place you grew up and
you trash that place.  
   
AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
GOVERNOR WALZ:  Come on.  That’s not who Wisconsin is.  That’s not who
Minnesota is.  We’re better than that.  We’re better than that. 
(Applause.)  
   
One of the best parts of this job is going to be — I can’t wait until
the debate, so — (laughs).  (Applause.)   
   
Look, I — I’ve done this enough and I know bullies.  And I’m not a
name-caller, but what I am is a teacher; I observe things.  So, I want
to tell you: What I observed and you’ve deserved about — observed about
these guys when you see them, that it’s a very clear thing.  Yes, they
are creepy and — and weird as hell.  (Applause.)  You see it.  You see
it.   
   
This is not normal.  This is not normal behavior.  Nobody is asking for
this crazy stuff.  
   
So, I’ll tell you what.  You heard it from the vice president; you’ve
heard her talk about this.  We’re sure the hell not going back.  We’re
not going back.  (Applause.)  We are not going back.  
   
AUDIENCE:  We’re not going back!  We’re not going back!  We’re not going
back!  
   
GOVERNOR WALZ:  We are not going back.  
   
AUDIENCE:  We’re not going back!  We’re not going back!  We’re not going
back!  
   
GOVERNOR WALZ:  We damn sure aren’t, but it’s even more than that.  This
is a campaign about where we’re going, and that’s a future where
everyone matters and everyone is included.  (Applause.)   
   
Kamala Harris, she believes in the freedom to make your own choices. 
She believes in opportunity for every single person to join the middle
class.  And she believes in the promise of America.  (Applause.)  
   
Thank you, Madam Vice President, for the trust that you’ve placed in
me.  
   
Wisconsin, please help me in giving a warm Midwest welcome to the next
president of the United States, Kamala Harris.  (Applause.)  
 THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, Wisconsin!  (Laughs.) 
(Applause.)  Good afternoon.   
   
     Oh, it’s good to be back.  Good afternoon, everybody.  
   
     Can we hear it for Tim Walz?  (Laughs.)  (Applause.)  Oh, I’m so
happy to be running with him, let me tell you.  
   
     So, let me start by thanking Les.  Your words, your leadership,
your voice, it’s so important, Les.  Thank you for everything you are
and everything you do for our country.  (Applause.)  
   
     And it is good to be with so many incredible leaders, including the
most magnificent, wonderful governor, Tony Evers.  Every time I come to
Wisconsin, Tony meets me on the tarmac.  He’s such an incredible human
being.  (Applause.)   
   
     I want to thank Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski — (applause);
chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, Ben Wikler — (applause); and my
dear, dear friend, Senator Tammy Baldwin.  (Applause.)  I served with
Tammy when I was in the United States Senate, and I’m going to tell you,
she was always, always, always fighting for the people of this state. 
And in November, we are going to re-elect her to the United States
Senate.  (Applause.)  
   
     And please give it up one more time for Wisconsin’s own Bon Iver. 
(Applause.)   
   
     It’s a good afternoon.  It’s a good afternoon.   
   
     And let me say, I also want to just — I want to bring greetings
from our incredible president, Joe Biden.  (Applause.)  He loves
Wisconsin.  He loves Wisconsin.  And I know we are all deeply grateful
for his lifetime of service to our nation — (applause) — and for all he
continues to do.   
   
     AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Thank you, Joe!  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.  (Applause.)  
   
     AUDIENCE:  Thank you, Joe!  Thank you, Joe!  Thank you, Joe!  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  That’s great.  
   
     AUDIENCE:  Thank you, Joe!  Thank you, Joe!  Thank you, Joe!  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  There we go.  That’s right.  I’m going to tell
him what you said.  (Laughter.)   
   
     So, Wisconsin, this has been a big week.  (Applause.)  On Monday, I
officially became the Democratic nominee for president of the United
States.  (Applause.)  And yesterday, I announced my running mate in this
campaign, Governor Tim Walz.  (Applause.)  
   
     And as you just heard — and the Minnesotans here know — Tim has an
incredible record as governor of the great state of Minnesota. 
(Applause.)   
   
     And to those who know him best, Tim is more than a governor.  To
his wife, Gwen, he is a husband.  To his kids, Hope and Gus, he is Dad. 
To his fedel- — fellow veterans, he is Sergeant Major Walz. 
(Applause.)  To the people of Southern Minnesota, for 12 years, he was a
congressman.  (Applause.)  To his former high school students, he was
Mr. Walz.  (Applause.)  And to his former high school football players,
he was Coach.  (Applause.)  Coach.  
   
     AUDIENCE:  Coach!  Coach!  Coach!  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.  
   
     And in 90 days, the nation will know Coach Walz by a new title:
vice president of the United States of America.  (Applause.)  
   
     AUDIENCE:  VP Walz!  VP Walz!  VP Walz!  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.  Oh, it really is good to be
back in Wisconsin.  (Laughter and applause.)   
   
     So, listen, let me tell you.  I am clear: The path to the White
House runs right through this state.  (Applause.)  And with your help,
we will win in November.  We are going to win.  (Applause.)  We are
going to win.  
   
     And I’ve been here many times, as you all know, recently and even
before.  And many of you know, then, before I was elected vice
president, before I was elected United States senator, I was an elected
attorney general and, before that, an elected district attorney. 
(Applause.)  And before that — and before that, I was a courtroom
prosecutor.  (Applause.)  
   
     So, in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds: predators
who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, scammers who
broke the rules for personal gain.  So, hear me when I say: I know
Donald Trump’s type.  (Applause.)  (Laughs.)  I know his type.  
      
     In fact, I’ve been dealing with people like him my whole career. 
(Applause.)  For example, as attorney general of California —  
   
     AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible.)  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, hold on.  The cou- — you know what, the
courts are going to handle that part of it.  (Laughter.)  What we’re
going to do is beat him in November.  (Applause.)  (Laughs.)  
   
     So, I’ll tell you, as attorney general, I took on one of our
country’s largest for-profit colleges that scammed students.  Well,
Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students.   
   
     AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  As a prosecutor, I specialized in cases of
sexual abuse.  Well, Donald Trump was found liable for committing sexual
abuse.  
   
     AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  As attorney general, I held the big Wall
Street banks accountable for fraud.  (Applause.)  Well, Donald Trump was
just found guilty of fraud — 34 counts.  (Applause.)   
   
     So, in this campaign, I’ll tell you: I will proudly put my record
against his any day of the week — (applause) — any day of the week.   
   
     But let’s make no mistake, this campaign is not just about us
versus Donald Trump.  It’s about two very different visions for our
nation — two very different visions: one, for us, focused on the future;
the other focused on the past.   
   
     And, Wisconsin, we — we here — we fight for the future. 
(Applause.)  We fight for a future where every worker has the freedom to
join a union — (applause); where —  
   
     AUDIENCE:  Union strong!  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Union strong.  
   
     AUDIENCE:  Union strong! Union strong!  Union strong!  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  We fight for a future where every senior can
retire with dignity — (applause); a future where we build a broad-based
economy and one where every American has the opportunity to own a home,
to start a business, to build wealth.  (Applause.)   
   
     And understand, in this fight, as Tim Walz likes to point out, we
are joyful warriors — (applause) — joyful warriors.  Because we know
that while fighting for a brighter future may be hard work, hard work is
good work.  Hard work is good work.  (Applause.)  
   
     And so, we will continue to fight for affordable housing, for
affordable health care, affordable childcare, and paid leave. 
(Applause.)  We believe in a future where we lower the cost of living
for America’s families so that they have a chance not just to get by but
to get ahead — (applause) — because while our economy is doing well by
many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too
high.  You know it, and I know it.   
   
     You know, when I was attorney general, I went after price-fixing
schemes.  And when I am president, it will be a day-one priority to
fight to bring down prices.  (Applause.)  I will take on big
corporations that engage in illegal price gouging.  I will take on
corporate landlords that unfairly raise rents on working families.  I
will take on Big Pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all
Americans — (applause) — and continue to bring manufacturing jobs back
to America — (applause) — and back to communities like Eau Claire. 
(Applause.)  
   
     So, all this is to say: Strengthening our economy and building up
the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency.  (Applause.) 
Because, you see, Coach Walz and I know when America’s middle class is
strong, America is strong.  And as we work to move our nation forward,
Donald Trump intends to take our nation backward.   
   
     AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  There is so much evidence of that point. 
There really is.  But look at, most recently, Project 2025 and that
agenda.  
   
     AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Project 2025 — you know, if you have some time
to take a look at it, I’m telling you, it — it is a plan to weaken the
middle class.  It is a plan to weaken the middle class.   
   
     If he is elected, Donald Trump intends to give tax breaks to
billionaires and big corporations.   
   
     AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  He intends to cut Social Security and
Medicare.   
   
     AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  He intends to surrender our fight against the
climate crisis, and he intends to end the Affordable Care Act.   
   
     AUDIENCE:  Noo —  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And because we all remember what it was like
before the Affordable Care Act, we understand what that means.  That’s
about taking us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to
deny people with pre-existing conditions.  You remember that —  
   
     AUDIENCE MEMBER:  We’re not going back!  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — what that was like when — we’re not going
back.  We’re not going back.   
   
     AUDIENCE:  We’re not going back!  We’re not going back!  We’re not
going back!  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  We are not going back.   
   
     AUDIENCE:  We’re not going back!  We’re not going back!  We’re not
going back!  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  We are not going back.   
   
     But in order to know where we need to go, let’s remember the past
and what that was like, because we cannot forget.   
   
     On that point about the ACA, remember people with pre-existing
conditions being denied — children with asthma, breast cancer survivors,
grandparents with diabetes?  That was no joke.  And we cannot go back. 
Ours has to be a fight for the future and a fight for freedom —
(applause) — a fight for freedom.   
   
     Across our nation, we have been witnessing a full-on assault
against hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights: the freedom to vote;
the freedom to be safe from gun violence; the freedom to breathe clean
air and drink clean water — (applause); the freedom to love who you love
openly and with pride — (applause); and the freedom of a woman to make
decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her
what to do.  (Applause.)  
   
     And let’s remember — let’s remember the traditions of our great
country.  Generations of Americans before us led in the fight for
freedom.  And now, then, as they would expect, the baton is in our
hands.  The baton is in our hands, each and every one of us.   
   
     So, we, then, who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will
finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote
Act.  (Applause.)   
   
     We who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will
finally pass universal background checks, red flag laws, and an assault
weapons ban.  (Applause.)  
   
     We who believe in reproductive freedom will fight for a woman’s
right to choose.  (Applause.)  And we remember that when he was
president, Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States
Supreme Court — the court of Thurgood and RBG — because he intended for
them to overturn Roe v. Wade.  And as he intended, they did.  
   
     AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And now more than 20 states in our country
have a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and
incest.   
   
     AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And if he wins, we all know he will sign a
national abortion ban to outlaw abortion in every state, even in
Wisconsin.   
   
     AUDIENCE:  Noo —  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  But we are not going to let that happen.  
   
     AUDIENCE:  No!  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Because we trust women.  (Applause.)   
   
     And when I am president of the United States and when Congress
passes a bill to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade, I will sign it
into law.  (Applause.)   
   
     AUDIENCE:  Kamala!  Kamala!  Kamala!  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you all.   
   
     So, listen, everyone took time out of your busy lives and days and
all your obligations to come out here and to be together as one
community.  (Applause.)  And I know you did it also because we all know,
listen, so much is on the line in this election.  It can’t be said
seriously enough.  So much is on the line.  
   
     And compounded with everything else that we knew was on the line,
think about the fact that last month, the United States Supreme Court
basically told the former president, who has been convicted of fraud,
that, going forward, he will be immune no matter what he does in the
White House.   
   
     AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
      
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Think about what that means and the changed
circumstances since 16-6-20 when you think about what that court
decision means.  Donald Trump has openly vowed, if re-elected, he will
be a dictator on day one —  
   
     AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — that he would weaponize the Department of
Justice against his political enemies —  
   
     AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
      
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — that he would round up peaceful protesters
and throw them out of our country —  
   
     AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — and even, quote, terminate the United States
Constitution.   
   
     AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  So, let us be clear.  Let us be clear. 
Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United
States should never again have a chance to stand behind the seal of the
president of the United States.  (Applause.)   
   
     So, basically, I think it all comes down to this.  We’re all here
because we love our country.  We love our country.  (Applause.)  We love
our country.  And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to
fight for the ideals of our country.  
   
    And that’s how we preserve the promise of America, because, after
all, the promise of America is what makes it possible, by the way, for
Governor Walz and me to stand on this stage today.  Just think about it:
two middle-class kids, one a daughter of Oakland, California, who was
raised by a working mother — (applause) — and had a summer job at
McDonald’s — (applause); the other, a son of the Nebraska plains who
grew up working on a farm.  (Applause.)   
   
     Think about that.  Only in America is it possible for them together
to make it all the way, together, to the White House.  (Applause.)  Only
in America.  Only in America.  (Applause.)  
   
     So, this is a fight to make real the promise of America for every
person in our nation.  And, also, I’ll tell you — and I promise you, our
campaign is going to reach out to everyone — from red states, from blue
states, from the heartland to the coast.  We are running a campaign on
behalf of all Americans.  (Applause.)  And when elected, we will govern
on behalf of all Americans.  (Applause.)  
   
     Because Coach Walz and I know — and we’re clear about this, unlike
the other side — we work for you.  (Applause.)  We work for you, the
American people, and we will always fight for you — for your family, for
your freedoms, and for your future.   
   
     So, Wisconsin, ultimately, this election is about a question that
we each face.  We each face a question in this election, and that is:
What kind of country do we want to live in?  Do we want to live in a
country of freedom, of compassion, of rule of law —  
   
     AUDIENCE:  Yes!  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — or a country of chaos, fear, and hate?  
   
     AUDIENCE:  Noo —  
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And the beauty of our democracy is we each
have the power — individually and collectively, we each have the power
in a democracy to answer that question.  The power is with the people. 
The power is with the people.  (Applause.)  
   
     So, in the next 90 days, we need you to use your power. 
(Applause.)  We need you to knock on doors.  We need you to register
folks to vote.  We need you to energize and organize and mobilize and
make your voices heard.  (Applause.)  
   
     And I’ll tell you, about an hour ago, after I landed on Air Force
Two, I — I met a collection of young leaders from Girl Scout Troop
3307.  Oh, they were spectacular.  Oh, they were spectacular.  None of
them high- — taller than three feet.  They — (laughter) — I mean, just
they were spectacular.   
   
     And one of those young leaders had a shirt on that said, “You are
powerful, and your voice matters.”  (Applause.)  Right?  From the mouths
of babes, they’re telling us.  They’re telling us.  
   
     And so, let’s remember that.  Let’s remember our power.  Let’s
remember our voice matters.   
   
     And with that, then, I ask: Are you ready to make your voices
heard?  (Applause.)  
      
     Do we believe in freedom?  (Applause.)  
   
     Do we believe in opportunity?  (Applause.)  
   
     Do we believe in the promise of America?  (Applause.)  
   
     And are we ready to fight for it?  (Applause.)  
   
     And when we fight —  
   
     AUDIENCE:  We win!   
   
     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — we win!   
   
     God bless you.  And God bless the United States of America. 
(Applause.)
