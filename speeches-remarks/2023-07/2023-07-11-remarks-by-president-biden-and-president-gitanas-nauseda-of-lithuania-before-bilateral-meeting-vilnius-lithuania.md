Presidential Palace  
Vilnius, Lithuania

PRESIDENT NAUSĖDA:  (In progress.)  And, first of all, I would like to
remind you that we are celebrating one and — 100 years of our
establishment of our diplomatic relations.  Also, our cooperation
recently is improving all the time.  
   
But I would like also to thank for the non-recognition policy of the
United States regarding the occupation of Lithuania in the Soviet
Union.  It was very persistent policy.  It helped us — our spirit, moral
spirit high.  And I think this is very important to remember, too.  
   
The situation in our region is unfortunately deteriorating.  And you see
what is happening around us.  And we see Belarus just swallowed into the
Russian Federation, and we see that Belarus is becoming additional
threat, additional factor of insecurity in the region.  
   
So this is the reason why we ask the NATO — we ask our strongest Ally,
United States — to pay a consistent atten- — attention to the security
of our region.   
   
And I think the NATO Summit, which takes place in Vilnius, in absolutely
near proximity to adversary countries — this is symbolic event —
symbolic.  But also, at the same time, this is a great opportunity to
take the bold decisions, and we expect that they will be done.  
   
This is very important to mention that we already have this Vilnius
meeting as historical one, even before it started, because the
membership of Sweden is already the — on the table.  And I think we will
welcome the 32nd member of NATO very soon.  
   
We have regional defense plans approved, and now it’s important that
they become executable by the end of this year, with pre-positioning,
with assigned forces.  
   
We are probably — Lithuania is one of the most enthusiastic supporters
of transatlantic bond in Europe — in European Union because we think
that your participation, your attention is extremely important in this
field of geopolitical uncertainty.   
   
And at the same time, Lithuania is intending to buy — to acquire
military equipment from United States.  And I would like to mention
Black Hawks.  Also, we intend to buy HIMARS, JLTVs — Oshkosh.  And all
this military equipment helps us to modernize our military forces.  
   
At the same time, we are closely cooperating with Germany.  And
recently, the very good decision was announced by Defense Minister Boris
Pistorius to scale up the forward presence of eFP country Germany in
Lithuania up to brigade size on a permanent basis.  So, I think it would
be very positive to welcome this decision and welcome the engagement of
all eFP countries in the region to increase the forward presence in our
— in our region.  
   
So, Mr. President, thank you so much for your participation in our NATO
Summit.  I’m looking forward to closely cooperating with you and with
our colleagues during these two days.   
   
I’m looking forward to — to be able to listen to your speech tomorrow in
Vilnius University.  It will be another historical moment for
Lithuania.   
   
And all the Lithuanian people greet you so warmly.  Even Vilnius — you
see it’s a little bit empty right now, but this is because of security
restrictions and some people decided to leave the city just to — to
avoid some inconveniences.  But, you know, in our hearts — from bottom
of our hearts, we welcome your visit, we welcome your arrival, and we
are looking forward to cooperate with United States in the future.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, Mr. President, thank you for the welcome and
thank your team as well.   
   
You know, it’s great to be back in Vilnius.  I was here in 2014 as vice
president shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine the first time
and, at the time, talked about what I thought Russia was likely to
continue to do.  Some people were somewhat skeptical of my judgment at
the time and — but, unfortunately, it turned out to be accurate.  
   
And the United States is here today to reaffirm our commitment to NATO
but also to Vilnius.  Look, we — we go back a long way.  And the — when
— we — we’re committed to Lithuania and to the Baltics and to NATO.  
   
I remember — you may recall when we were having the debate in the United
States Senate about enlarging NATO, and I was arguing very strongly that
the Baltics should all be a part of NATO.  And you’ve been very, very
added value.  
   
And our pledge to be with you has not wavered.  It didn’t take us long
to get thousands of troops here when Russia invaded the second time. 
We’ll be able to — you can be assured that you’re going to have all that
you need.  
   
We have the Secretary of Defense with us today.  We can send him alone;
he’s enough.  (Laughter.)  But — but all kidding aside, we —  
   
And, look, as I’ve said before: We take, NATO takes, all of us take
Article 5 literally.  One inch of NATO territory means we’re all — we’re
all in a war together against whomever is violating that space, and
we’re going to defend every inch of it.  
   
And I want to thank you, Mr. President, for hosting this historic summit
at an important time: the first time that NATO leaders will meet with 31
together, and looking forward to meeting very soon with 32 members with
the addition of Sweden.  
   
The leader of Sweden was just in my Oval Office not long ago, and we
were hoping this would occur when it did.  And I’m confident we’ll get
that done today.  
   
And in the coming days, we’re also going to discuss a range of issues —
how to strengthen NATO’s eastern flank and modernize NATO’s deterrence
and defense capabilities.  And we’re going to be doing it in a place of
— where those — those efforts truly matter every single, solitary day. 
And we’re also going to discuss our support for the people of Ukraine. 
And I want to thank you and — for your partnership and leadership as we
take on this challenge together.   
   
So, I look forward to our conversation today and to continuing to stand
with you and all the people of Lithuania for a simple reason: shared
values.  We have the same value set.  It’s important.  That’s what NATO
is all about.  That’s what transatlantic alliance is about.  
   
And as you probably heard, I am a very strong supporter of the
transatlantic alliance.  I’ve learned that nothing happens here that
doesn’t affect us.  So, we’re all in.   
   
We’re looking forward to today.  Thank you.  
   
PRESIDENT NAUSĖDA:  Thank you.
