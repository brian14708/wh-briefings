Indian Treaty Room  
Eisenhower Executive office Building

12:22 P.M. EDT  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Please have seat.  Good
afternoon.  
   
To our President, Joe Biden; members of Congress; the members of the
Till family; and my fellow Americans: Today, we gather to remember our
history.  
   
We gather to remember an act of astonishing violence and hate and to
honor the courage of those who called upon on our nation to look with
open eyes at that horror and to act.  
   
The story of Emmett Till and the incredible bravery of Mamie Till-Mobley
helped fuel the movement for civil rights in America, and their stories
continue to inspire our collective fight for justice. 

When I served in the United States Senate, I was so profoundly honored
to sponsor the Emmett Till Antilynching Act alongside Congressman Bobby
Rush.  And it was an even greater honor to stand beside our President,
Joe Biden, as he signed the law that finally made lynching a federal
crime.  
   
So many leaders here today made that progress possible.

Our history as a nation is born of tragedy and triumph, of struggle and
success.  That is who we are.  And as people who love our country, as
patriots, we know that we must remember and teach our full history, even
when it is painful — especially when it is painful.  
   
Today, there are those in our nation who would prefer to erase or even
rewrite the ugly parts of our past; those who attempt to teach that
enslaved people benefitted from slavery; those who insult us in an
attempt to gaslight us, who try to divide our nation with unnecessary
debates.  
   
Let us not be seduced into believing that somehow we will be better if
we forget.  We will be better if we remember.  We will be stronger if we
remember.  
   
Because we all here know: It is only by understanding and learning from
our past that we can continue to work together to build a better
future.  
   
And so, now it is my great honor to introduce a leader who has dedicated
his life to preserving and protecting our history.  And Reverend Wheeler
Parker, Jr., just also shared with me that he and his wife will be
celebrating this weekend their fifty- —

REVEREND PARKER:  Sixth.

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — -sixth anniversary of marriage.  (Laughter and
applause.)

Reverend Wheeler Parker, Jr.  (Applause.)

REVEREND PARKER:  In fact, we were married 56 years on Sunday.  My wife
say, “When we get to heaven, I’m going to say, ‘Lord, not up here
too.’”  (Laughter.)  I see we have a whole lot of amens to that. 
(Laughter.)   
   
I’m truly humbled by this honor.  You see, I was born in Mississippi.  I
spent my early years as a sharecropper and was focused upon filling up a
nine-foot sack — focused upon my quota, not making history.  From the
outhouse to the White House; from a time when we lived in fear to a time
when President and Vice President gave us this great hope — kept their
promise by delivering — this is what America means to me: promises made,
promises kept.  
   
It has been quite a journey for me from the darkness to the light.  
   
When I sat with my family on the night of terror — when Emmett Till, our
beloved Bobo, was taken from us, taken to be tortured and brutally
murder — murdered — back then, when I was overwhelmed with terror and
fear of certain death in the darkness of a thousand midnights, in a
pitch-black house on what some have called Dark Fear Road.  Back then in
the darkness, I could never imagine a moment like this: standing in the
light of wisdom, grace, and deliverance.   
   
There is something amazing you feel when you meet President Biden, like
I did when he signed the Emmett Till Antilynching law — Antilynching
bill into law.  He welcomed me into this place of great power.  I felt
the power of his personal devotion — his devotion to justice, to
equality, his commitment to keeping the promise of America.  This came
from his heart, from his soul.   
   
God bless you, President Biden, for all you have done and will do to
preserve our history.  
   
Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in recognizing President Joe
Biden.  (Applause.)  
   
(Speaks off-mic to the President.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m not going to tell you what he whispered to me. 
Thank you, Reverend Parker.  And thank all of you for being here.   
   
I want to thank Kamala for her — not only capacity to do what she does,
but the fire with which she brings to the things she cares a lot
about.   
   
To all the members of Congress, including Representative Bennie
Thompson, Senator Tammy Duckworth, Representative Danny Davis, and
Senator Dick Durbin, who is — we wish a speedy recovery from COVID; he’s
just recovering from COVID right now — and who have long fought to honor
the Till family.  It’s not new to any of them.   
   
To the Till family, it’s an honor to be with you again.   
   
You know, when I was preparing these remarks, I — I quite frankly — and
my colleagues will understand this — I found myself trying to temper my
anger as I was writing it.  I’m not joking.  I can’t fathom — I can’t
fathom what it must have been like.  It’s hard to believe.  I was 12
years old, and I just — you know, I know no matter how much time has
passed — how many birthdays, how many events, how many anniversaries —
it’s hard to relive this.  It brings it all back.   
   
We were talking about, Rev, as if it happened yesterday –the images in
your head, and you re- — things you remember.  But it’s inspiring to see
how many of your family have continued as mother’s courage to find faith
in pain, purpose in pain.  That’s a — that’s a remarkable thing, it
seems to me.  
   
Insisting on an open caset \[sic\] — casket for her murdered and, I
might add, maimed and mutilated son.  Fourteen years old.  Fourteen
years old.  She said, “Let the people see what I’ve seen.”  “Let the
people see what I have seen.”   
   
My God, all of us who have lost children in other ways, how hard it is
even to close the casket or keep it open or to — what a debate it is.   
   
But to see the child that had been maimed, and the country and the world
saw — saw — not just heard the story of Emmett Till and his mother — as
a story of a family’s promise and loss in the nation’s reckoning with
hate, violence, racism, overwhelming abuse of power, and brutality. 
It’s hard to fathom.  Hard to fathom this even in war for me.  It’s hard
to fathom.  
   
But today, on what we’ve been — would have been Emm- — Emmett’s 82nd
birthday, we add another chapter to the story of remembrance and
healing.  
   
Just as we joined together when I signed the law in his name to make
lynching a federal crime — and think how long that took for that to
happen — I mean — and we screened the movie “Till” at the White House —
today, we join together as I sign a proclamation designating Emmett Till
and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument in both Illinois and in
Mississippi.  (Applause.)  
   
When we ended lynching as a matter of law, we talked about wanting to do
this.  But the support from the community has been so overwhelming.   
   
I thank the members of Congress for their support and, more than that,
their leadership.   
   
At a time when there are those who seek to ban books, bury history,
we’re making it clear — crystal, crystal clear –(applause) — while
darkness and denialism can hide much, they erase nothing.  They can
hide, but they erase nothing.  
   
We can’t just choose to learn what we want to know.  We have to learn
what we should know.  We should know about our country.  We should know
everything: the good, the bad, the truth of who we are as a nation. 
That’s what great nations do, and we are a great nation.  That’s what
they do.   
   
For only with truth comes healing, justice, repair, and another step
forward toward forming a more perfect union.  We got a hell of a long
way to go.   
   
That’s what’s happening.  That’s what’s going to happen with visitors of
all backgrounds to learn the history of Emmett Till and Mamie
Till-Mobley through our national monument.   
   
Look, telling the truth and the full history of our nation is
important.  It’s important to our children, our grandchildren, our
great-grandchildren, to our nation as a whole.   
   
I’ve said it before.  It was a lesson I learned coming out of the — not
like real leaders in the Civil Rights Movement — but when I came out of
the Civil Rights Movement as a kid, as a public defender.  And I used to
— you know, I used to say — think that if you pass something that was
good, ha- — you can make hate go away.   
   
Hate never goes away.  It just hides.  It hides under the rocks.  And
given a little bit of oxygen by bad people, it comes roaring out
again.   
   
And it’s up to all of us to deal with that, up to all of us to stop it. 
Up to all of us.  The best way to do that is with the truth.  It’s used
in a different context, but I think it’s apply — applies here.  Silence
is complicity.  I will not be silent, nor will you be silent about what
happened.  (Applause.)  
   
There’s really critical work ahead to continue the fight for racial
justice and equality for all Americans.  And my administration is
committed to leading a path forward.  And I know the members of Congress
here are even more committed than that.  
   
I’m going to close with this.  The reason the world saw what Mrs.
Till-Mobley saw was because of another hero in this story: the Black
press.  (Applause.)  No, I’m serious.   
   
Jet Magazine, the Chicago Defender, and other newspapers and radio
announcers who told the story were unflinching in the bravery with which
they told that story, making sure America saw — saw what they saw.   
   
Ida B. Wells once said, quote, “The way to right wrongs is to turn the
light of truth upon them.”  The way to right wrongs is to shine a light
of truth on them.   
   
Well, that’s our charge today.

By the way, parenthetically, did you ever think we’d be talking about
banning books in America?  Banning history?  I’m serious.  
   
To the Till family and to all of you here today, I thank you for your
courage and for never giving up — never, never giving up.  
   
And before I say even what more is on my mind, I’m now going to leave
this podium.  (Laughter.)

No, I mean, it’s just barbaric — barbaric what happened.  And,
seriously, all you moms out there, imagine the courage it took to say,
“Let them see.”  The courage.

It’s now my honor to sign this proclamation in memory of Emmett Till and
Mrs. Mamie Till-Mobley.

And I thank you all for being here.  And I am — I know I’m considered
too much of an optimist, but I believe if we keep pushing, we’re going
to continue to make progress.  We’re going to continue to make
progress.  And it’s already being made.

The idea that when that 14-year-old was buried, that in this Indian
Treaty Room there’d be this many people of color holding powerful
office, changing the direction of the country, it would have been beyond
our comprehension.  And we’re just getting started.  (Applause.)

The proclamation I’m signing establishes the Emmett Till and Mamie
Till-Mobley National Monument.

(The proclamation is signed.)  (Applause.)
