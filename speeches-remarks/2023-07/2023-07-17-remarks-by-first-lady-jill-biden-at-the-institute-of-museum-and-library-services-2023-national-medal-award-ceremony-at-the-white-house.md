East Room, The White House

3:11 P.M. EDT

THE FIRST LADY:  Thank you.  Thanks.  Thank you, Director Kemper.  And
I’m so grateful for your tireless commitment to making museums and
libraries accessible to all of us.    I also want to thank the Institute
of Museum and Library Sciences — Services, excuse me — staff for all the
work they’ve done to make these awards possible.  
  
So, hello, everyone.  And welcome to the White House!  (Applause.)  
  
When I was young, I’d walk to our local library every two weeks and take
home as many books as I could carry in my arms.  And I’ll never forget
the summer nights that my mom would let me stay up too late — well, one
or two in the morning — so I could finish just one more chapter.  The
characters felt so real to me: A humble spider writing out “Some Pig!”
on her barn door.  (Laughter.)  A magical nanny who held tea parties on
the ceiling.    
  
As I pored over page after page, without even realizing it, I was
learning.  And I never wanted to stop.  
  
When a child falls in love with learning, a world of possibilities opens
before her.  
  
And that is the gift that all of you give every day.   
  
In each book, each new exhibit, each reimagined way to connect with
science or math or history or art, we see ourselves.  
  
Museums and libraries are living parts of our communities — changing as
we do and teaching us new things with each visit. They weave together
the stories of our nation: its past, present, and future.  And they
safeguard our freedom to learn, to explore, and choose the ideas and
philosophies that shape us, without fear of being silenced or
censored.  
  
As you may know, the White House is a museum, and we have a library
downstairs.  And as we work to open the doors of this house wider and
wider, we have seen that it, too, can grow and evolve and begin
something new.  
  
And that’s why we’ve worked with the Library of Congress to install a
temporary exhibit of young adult and children’s books in our library. 
Because guess what?  They weren’t there.  (Laughter.)  I know, I was so
shocked.   
  
So, anyway, we want the children who visit to see themselves in this
place so we can spark that lifelong love of learning that I found in the
hallways of my hometown library.  And I hope to make these books a
permanent part of our living museum.  
  
We’re here today to say that this work matters.  It changes lives.   
  
Because of you, a student has discovered a lifelong love of science,
inspiring her to, you know, pursue a career that she loves.   
  
A young person who needs a job can find the support to search for one.  
  
A parent is able to borrow the tools she needs to fix that broken bed
frame or plant the garden where she can grow memories with her
children.  
  
An artist can show the world his heart and the heritage that shaped
him.  
  
In big cities and small towns, in suburbs and rural villages, you are a
lifeline, a connection to the endless possibilities that exist within
each of us.  A place not to just discover dreams, but to make those
dreams a reality.  
  
You show us what lies beyond the limits of our imaginations and how to
listen to others’ stories, to hear new perspectives and imagine new
futures.  
  
You show us how to fight for what we believe in and ask us to take a
moment to stop and appreciate the beauty in the world.   
  
You connect us to each other, teaching us understanding, kindness, and
compassion.  
  
I know that your communities are so proud of you, and the President and
I are so proud of you too.  Thank you for everything you do.  
  
And now, I will ask each pair of awardees to join me on this stage as
Director Kemper reads your citations.  (Applause.)
