South Lawn

8:04 P.M. EDT  
   
THE FIRST LADY:  Wow!  Weren’t they great?  (Applause.)  
   
Hello, everyone, and welcome to July Fourth at the White House! 
(Applause.) 

Joe and I — come on, Joe.  (Laughter.)

Joe and I are so grateful to be here with all of you.  And can we get
another round of applause for DJ D-Nice?  (Applause.)  And how about our
National Anthem singer, Becca Rae Greene?  (Applause.)  And, of course,
the Brothers Osborne.  (Applause.)  And then we have the amazing
“President’s Own” military band.  (Applause.)

THE PRESIDENT:  Heyyyy! (Applause.)

THE FIRST LADY:  To our wonderful military families joining us, each and
every day, your service and sacrifice ensures our nation’s freedom. 
Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  
   
Now, before we get to our final performer — (President Biden points to
himself) — I’d like to introduce — (laughter) — our Commander-in-Chief,
President Joe Biden.  (Applause.)

THE PRESIDENT:  Hey, everybody!  Welcome to your house, the White
House.  (Applause.)  We’re just renting.  (Laughter.)

Hey, thank you all so very, very much for being here.  You know, it’s
amazing — I’m going to be very short.  It’s amazing — amazing what a
difference music makes.

No, no, I really mean it.  Think about it.  Think how music can change
moods.  Music can make us feel better.  It’s just incredible.  And I
thought we had some great, great entertainment here tonight.

THE FIRST LADY:  Yeah.  (Applause.)

AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Biden 2024!  (Applause.)

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, now you’re making music to my ears.  (Laughter and
applause.)

Anyway, welcome to the South Lawn.

Now, look, the fireworks are going to start at 9:09.  (Applause.)  Now,
how the hell they come up with 9:09, I’m not sure.  But 9:09.

(Gestures at audience member.)  How are you, kiddo?

Anyway, so I hope you’ll all stay for the fireworks.  And, look, it
really matters.  It really matters, you showing your support for the
military on a day like today.  You know, it’s an incredible opportunity
we have.  (Applause.)  

And we are — we are — we are the leading nation in the world.  The rest
of the world looks to us.  (Applause.)  And they look at this.  So I
hope you enjoy the rest of the evening.

I’m going to spare you: I’m not even going to try to sing.  I’m not
going to try to dance.  I’m not going to try to even move.  (Laughter.)

But, folks, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.  You’re great
Americans.  (Applause.)

Today is America’s day!  America’s day!  (Applause.)

Go get ‘em!

THE FIRST LADY:  And here’s Ne-Yo!  (Applause.)

THE PRESIDENT:  Where is he?  (Laughter.)  I don’t know, man.  I want to
say hi to him.  (Laughter.)

You trying to get me off the stage?  You’re afraid I’m going to try to
sing, aren’t you?   (Laughter.)

Thanks a lot, guys.  Appreciate it.  (Applause.)
