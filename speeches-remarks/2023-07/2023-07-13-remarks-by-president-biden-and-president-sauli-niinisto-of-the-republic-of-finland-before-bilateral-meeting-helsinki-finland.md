Presidential Palace  
Helsinki, Finland

1:15 P.M. EEST  
   
PRESIDENT NIINISTÖ:  So, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, it’s a
great pleasure to wish you welcome to Finland.  And I continue by
thanking you for your strong support and your strong will to support us
during the time that Finland has entered to a new era in our security
policy.  
   
And I have to tell you that this week in Vilnius was very impressive to
experience the way you created unity amongst Allies.  That was great to
see.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you.  
   
PRESIDENT NIINISTÖ:  So, once again, I warmly welcome you, and I guess
you got the best welcomes already on the streets of Helsinki —
(laughter) — which are (inaudible).  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  By the way, they are.  They’re very –very gracious. 
Very gracious.  
   
Well, it’s a delight to be here.  It’s good to be back in Finland.  This
is my second visit.  And it’s — you know, I remember a conversation you
and I had when you called to come to the White House to talk about being
a member —  
   
PRESIDENT NIINISTÖ:  Yes.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  — of NATO.  And it took me about three seconds to say,
“Yes.”  Strong support.  
   
PRESIDENT NIINISTÖ:  Yes.  (Laughs.)  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  No, I mean it sincerely, because we had — we launched
your ratification process — the fastest it’s occurred in modern
history.  The fastest ratification period in modern history.  
   
You may remember my telling you — I said to our friend in the east that
he wants the Finlandization of NATO; well, you’re going to get the
NATO-ization of Finland.  
   
PRESIDENT NIINISTÖ:  (Laughs.)  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  But all kidding aside, you know, you’re — you’ve been
a great partner.  We’re great allies.  And, you know, Finland and the
United States — I think we’re stronger together.  And I really mean
that.  You’ve been an incredible asset to NATO and to the world.  
   
The — and the main reason is we have the same value set.  I really mean
that.  It really matters.  And, you know, we’re deepening our defense
cooperation to ensure that — the security of our people as we modernize
your air force with the F-35 aircraft, which you already had.  
   
And together, we’re standing for shared democratic values.  That’s what
it’s all about.  I really think — and you’re very gracious and kind to
give me credit for unity at — at NATO.  But I think it’s — I’ve been
doing this a long time; I don’t think NATO has ever been stronger.  
   
PRESIDENT NIINISTÖ:  You could sense a feeling of that.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  No, I — I believe that.  
   
PRESIDENT NIINISTÖ:  Yeah.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  And we had a — a very, very — I had a very good, long
meeting with Zelenskyy, who ended up being very happy, and met with his
military people.  
   
And I think there’s a — I — it’s a different era in the nature of our
relationship and bringing along Sweden as well.  It makes a gigantic
difference.  
   
So, I’m anxious to continue to work with you.  
   
PRESIDENT NIINISTÖ:  It seems that when things get serious also, people
understand that we have to stick together.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  And you putting together this U.S.-Nordic Summit means
a lot to me as well, so I’m looking forward to meeting our colleagues. 
But I want to thank you.  I mean, you’ve been an incredible, incredible
partner.
