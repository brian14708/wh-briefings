PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, Mr. President, welcome.  And I hope you all got
a sense today from all my colleagues that — how — how much that you have
— how much support you have.  It’s real.  And I hope we finally have put
to bed the notion about whether or not Ukraine is welcome in NATO.  It’s
going to happen.  We’re moving — you’re all moving in the right
direction.  I think it’s just a matter of getting by the next few months
here.   
   
So thank you, thank you, thank you.  
   
And, you know, it’s hard to believe: 500 days.  It’s easy for me just
mostly — I’ve been in and out of Ukraine a lot before the war, and some
since the war.  But I’m going to say again what I’ve said to you many
times, not only all of you, but your people — your sons, your daughters,
your husbands, your wives, your friends: You’re incredible.  
   
Ukraine — the whole world has seen the courage — I really — I mean this
from the bottom of my heart: The courage and commitment of the average
Ukrainian — when you see a 65-year-old woman on television after her
apartment has been bombed out, picking up the pieces, going to help the
next-door neighbor.  I mean, it’s — it’s just astounding.  You set an
example for the whole world of what constitutes genuine courage in my —
I mean — from the bottom of my heart, I mean that — what courage means. 
And, you know, I think it’s — your resilience and your resolve has been
a model for the whole world to see.   
   
And the frustration, I can only imagine.  I know you’re many times
frustrated about when things — what things get to you quickly enough and
what’s getting to you and how we’re getting there.  But I promise you,
the United States is doing everything we can to get you what you need as
rapidly as we can get it to you.   
   
And the Secretary of Defense has been a constant, constant  — how can I
say it? — the refrain — from the Defense Department and everywhere else
to — and calling other secretaries of defense around the — around the
world to say, “Let’s get some help.”   
   
So I just want you to know it’s real.  And, you know, if you’re — in
Vilnius, we held the first, as you well know, NATO-Ukraine Council.  But
you and I talked about this beforehand, about the commitments — the
security commitments we were going to make while it becomes official —
until it becomes official.  And I think that’s important.   
   
And I might — I want to tell you: When I got here, Mr. President, and I
started to sell that idea to other heads of state, there was no re- —
there was no reluctance.  There was no — no “Well, I don’t want to
ele-…”  It was — everybody just said, “Okay.  Let’s sign on.”  
   
So, it’s real.   
   
You’ve done an enormous job.  You have a lot more to do, I know.  And —
and I just think that, you know, we’re going to make sure that you get
what you need.   
   
And I look forward to the day when we’re having the meeting celebrating
your official — official membership in NATO.   
   
So, thank you for what you’re doing.   
   
And the bad news for you is: We’re not going anywhere.  (Laughter.) 
You’re stuck with us.  
   
Well, thank you.  
   
PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY:  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  And I will
start.  
   
You — you said about 500 days.  It’s really — really a difficult job for
our people — soldiers and civilians, mothers, fathers, and children —
really, to fight for — for their life — for their life and for these
values.   
   
And — and thank you very much that all these days you are with us.  I
mean, you and Americans, all of America — Americans and Congress.  I
mean, thank you, Mr. President, that you — like we say,
shoulder-to-shoulder with us from those days of full-scale war.  We
appreciate for this very much.  
   
And really — really, you know, we understand you’re leading support,
because when you give such messages and when you gave sometimes some
weapon — I’m — I’m sorry that I’m — but I want to say to journalists,
like I said during our meeting, our council, that it’s very simple, you
know, to criticize, for example, clusters ammunition, which you made
decision — difficult political decision.  But it’s — but you have to
know that Russia used such weapon from the first days, not only
full-scale war — from those days of occupation of Crimea, from 2014 and
‘15, in all our territories.  In Donbas, they used it.  And now they
continuing doing.  And that you gave us — this decision will help us to
save us.   
   
And that’s why my appreciation for the — and I didn’t hear from all the,
you know, parts of the world when — when Russia began to use it — I
didn’t hear that some of, you know, countries criticized Russia.  You
know?  But I think that it was very useful to put them.   
   
So, thank you so much for this help.  We really counted on it — not only
on this.  I mean this — totally.  And you gave us huge support.  
   
I want to thank to all Americans.  We understand that it’s more than
four- — 43 billions for today.  It’s big support.  And I understand that
it’s all your money, but — but you have to know that you spend this
money for — for — not — not just for fighting; you spend this money for
our lives.  And the — I think that we save the — the lives for — for
Europe and for all the world.   
   
So, thank you very much for this also summit.  At — at the — at the end
of the summit, we — we had — I think this council had great success and
security guarantees, as you said, that we began to speak it — about it
in Kyiv.   
   
So, now we see that we had — you had great idea, that G7 — and now I
know that last (inaudible) that also there are countries which joined to
G7 decisions, and I think it will help very much because it — it’s real
effect that — it’s very (inaudible) phase.  
   
So, thank you.   
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, thank you.  And thank you for acknowledging the
American people.  I think it’s correct that we are a large country, but
I think we’ve given more than every other nation combined in terms of
assistance and cost.   
   
And the American people are supportive — they’re supportive — because
they know it’s — it’s about you, but it’s about more than you.  It’s
about innocent people around the world and the absolute brutality with
which Putin is acting and the Russians are moving on.  It’s just — it’s
just some — like something out of the 14th century the way they’re
acting.   
   
And so — but — but I can’t emphasize enough.   
   
And, by the way, I know you thanked him, but I think we talked about it
before.  I went to Tokyo years — more — a couple years ago.  The idea
that Kishida is increasing their defense budget, having to lower their
domestic budget, to aid directly and get directly involved in what’s
happening in Ukraine is remarkable.   
   
The sad, sad news is you’re in this situation.  The incredible news is
it’s bringing the world together.  It’s bringing the world together in a
way that — it’s a hell of a price to pay, but it’s bringing the world
together.  And people are realizing that they just can’t stand by and
let this kind of aggression occur.   
   
Any rate, I thank you, and we got a lot to talk about.  So, somebody is
going to have to say, “The press has to leave.”  (Laughter.)  
   
Q    President Zelenskyy, are you satisfied with what you got from
NATO?  You were so frustrated yesterday.  Is this enough?  Are you
satisfied, sir?  
   
PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY:  I think, at the end of summit, we — we have great
unity from our leaders and security guarantees, that the success for
this summit.  I think so, but it’s my opinion.  Thank you.  
   
Q    Thank you, sir.  
   
Q    President Zelenskyy, how soon after the war would you like to be in
NATO?  How soon after the war would you like to join NATO?  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  An hour and 20 minutes.  You guys ask really
insightful questions.
