SECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:  President Biden, dear Joe, welcome to
the NATO Summit.  And many, many thanks for your strong leadership
making this alliance united and even stronger.  This summit is already
historic because the agreement we made yesterday will make Sweden a full
member of NATO.  And that will make our alliance even more capable of
defending all Allies.  
   
At this meeting, we will also send a clear message to Ukraine that we
stand by them as long as needed and also that we agree on a united and
positive message — message on the path forward for Ukraine and
membership for Ukraine.  
   
Another major message from this summit will be that we need to invest
more in our defense.  And we will agree on a new defense investment
pledge where we state clearly that 2 percent of GDP for defense is the
minimum.  
   
The good news is that European Allies and Canada are stepping up.  This
year, we have new numbers showing that they have added 8.3 percent in
real terms for the defense budget.  This is a record high, and that
demonstrates that Allies are delivering on their commitments.  
   
So, once again, Mr. President, it’s great to have you here at the NATO
Summit.  
   
MR. PRESIDENT:  It’s good to be here.  And thank you for continuing to
deliver.   
   
I — as I’ve made no mis- — the press is not at all surprised that I’ve
been touting the fact that I think it’s really important at this
critical moment in Ukrai- — in the whole NATO issue that you continue to
lead NATO.  You’re trusted.  No one knows the situation that we’re
facing better than you do.  
   
And this historic moment — the adding of Finland and Sweden to — to NATO
— it’s consequential.  And your leadership really matters.  And the —
and we agreed on the language that — that we proposed, that you
proposed, relative to the future of Ukraine being able to join NATO.   
   
And we’re looking forward to continuing a united NATO.  They’ve heard me
say — my American press have heard me say many times I still think that
President Putin thinks the way he succeeds is to break NATO.  Not going
to do that, especially with you as the lead of it.  
   
So, thank you for being willing to do it.   
   
SECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:  Thank you so much.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  
   
SECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:  Thank you.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you, all.
