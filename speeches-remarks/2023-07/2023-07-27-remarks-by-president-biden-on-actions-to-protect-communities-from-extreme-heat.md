South Court Auditorium  
Eisenhower Executive Office Building

12:06 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  We’re here today with the mayors of
Phoenix and San Antonio and senior members of my administration to talk
about the existential threat of climate change.  And it is a threat. 
We’re going to outline steps we’re taking to help communities who — who,
right this minute, as both the mayors can tell you, are facing a real
crisis in their cities.   
   
We’ll talk about steps we’re taking to help people get through this
tough time, and we’re also going to talk about steps we’re taking to
help communities prepare, plan, and recover, and make our nation more
resilient in future heat waves.  And there will be more.

I don’t think anybody can deny the impact of climate change anymore. 
There used to be a time when I first got here — a lot of people said,
“Oh, it’s not a problem.”  Well, I don’t know anybody — well, I
shouldn’t say that — I don’t know anybody who honestly believes climate
change is not a serious problem.  
   
Just take a look at the historic floods in Vermont and California
earlier this year.  Droughts and hurricanes that are growing more
frequent and intense.  Wildfires spreading a smoky haze for thousands of
miles, worsening air quality.  And record temperatures — and I mean
record — are now affecting more than 100 million Americans.  
   
Puerto Rico reached a 125-degree heat index last month.  San Antonio hit
an all-time heat index high of 117 last month.  Phoenix has been over
110 degrees for 27 straight days.  
   
And with El Niño and the short-term warming of the ocean that
exacerbates the effects of climate change, making forecasts even hotter
in the coming months.  
   
Ocean temperatures near Miami are like stepping in a hot tub.  They just
topped 100 degrees — 100 degrees — and they’re hitting record highs
around the world.  And that’s more like, as I said, jumping in a hot tub
than jumping in an ocean to ride a wave.

Most people don’t realize: For years, heat has been the — I have to
admit I didn’t know it either.  I thought it — I knew it was tough, but
the number one weather-related killer is heat.  The number one
weather-related killer is heat.  Six hundred people die annually from
its effects, more than from floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes in America
combined.  And even those places that are used to extreme heat have
never seen it as hot as it is now for as long as it’s been.  
   
Even those who deny that we’re in the midst of a climate crisis can’t
deny the impact that extreme heat is having on Americans.  Americans
like an elderly woman in Phoenix who fell out of her wheelchair and,
after five minutes on the ground, had third-degree burns.  Third-degree
burns.  
   
Or like firefighters who’s — already has to lug over 45 pounds of gear
through smoke and flame, which is incredibly hot.  The job is even
harder and more dangerous to do in record heat.

For the farmworkers who have to harvest crops in the dead of night to
avoid the high temperatures.  Or farmers who risk losing everything
they’ve planted for the year.  
   
Or the construction workers who literally risk their lives working all
day in blazing heat and, in some places, don’t even have the right to
take a water break.  That’s outrageous.  That is outrageous — anybody
who says that — does that.  
   
Folks, we really want to pretend these things are normal?  
   
Experts say extreme heat is already costing America $100 billion a
year.  And it hits our most vulnerable the hardest: seniors, people
experiencing homelessness who have nowhere to turn, disadvantaged
communities that are least able to recover from climate disasters.  
   
And it’s threatening farms, fisheries, forests that so many families
depend on to make a living.  
   
But none of this is inevitable.  From day one of my administration,
we’ve taken unprecedented action to combat the climate crisis that’s
causing this.  We’re using a law I got passed the first day in office —
first month in office — called the American Rescue Plan, to help states
and cities promote energy efficiency, reduce flooding, and open cooling
centers.

We’re delivering over $20 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
to upgrade the electric grid to withstra- — withstand stronger storms
and heatwaves so we don’t cause more fires.

Look, last year I signed the Inflation Reduction Act, the most
significant climate investment ever anywhere in the world.  Meanwhile,
FEMA has been on the ground responding to those unprecedented weather
emergencies in real time.  And I’ve traveled an awful lot in that
helicopter with you all across the country and — to see the devastation
that occurs, the kind of wildfires and other — and drought and the like.

We’ve launched a — a place you can go, Heat.gov — go online to Heat.gov
— to share lifesaving information that you may need to know about.

Last year, my Department of Labor created the first-ever national
program to protect workers from heat stress.  Since then, we’ve
conducted 2,600 heat-related inspections at workplaces nationwide to
protect the health and safety of the workers on the job so they’re being
taken care of.

Today I’m announcing additional steps to help states and cities deal
with the consequences of extreme heat.  
   
First, I’ve asked Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su to issue a Heat Hazard
Alert.  It clarifies that workers have a federal heat-related — have
federal heat-related protections.  We should be protecting workers from
hazardous conditions, and we will.  And those states where they do not,
I’m going to be calling them out, where they refuse to protect these
workers in this awful heat.

Second, the Acting Secretary of Labor will work with her team to
intensify enforcement, increasing inspections in high-risk industries
like construction and agriculture.

This work builds on the national standard that the Labor Department is
already developing for workforce and workplace heat-safety rules.  
   
Meanwhile, the U.S. Forest Service will award more than $1 billion in
grants to help cities and towns plant tree that in the long term will
help repel the heat and expand access to green spaces so families have a
place to go to cool off and to bring down the temperature in cities.  
   
The Department of Housing and Urban Development is providing billions to
communities to make buildings more efficient and to make more heat —
make them more heat-resistant, opening cooling centers in — for
residential areas and in the cities that the communities can go to to be
safe.  
   
The Department of the Interior is using infrastructure funding to expand
water storage capacity in the Western states to deal with the impacts of
future droughts that are made every — all this more extr- — this heat —
this extreme heat more consequential.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is launching a new
partnership with universities and impact communities to improve the
nation’s weather forecasts and its accuracy so Americans everywhere can
be better prepared when they — when — and they can better predict what
the heat is going to be in that community with the weather.

In all my Investing in America agenda, we provided a record $50 billion
for climate resiliency to restore wetlands, manage wildfires, help
Americans in every state withstand extreme heat.  
   
But our MAGA extremists in Congress are trying to undo all this
progress.  
   
Not a single one of them — not a single Republican voted — voted for the
Inflation Reduction Act, which had all this money for climate, which
provides funding to con- — to combat climate change.  
   
And now many of them are trying to repeal those provisions, but we’re
not going to let that happen.

Part of the reason we’re here today is to get the word out so state and
local governments know these resources are available and uses them.

I want the American people to know help is here and we’re going to make
it available to anyone who needs it.  
   
Follow guidance from the local leaders and public safety officials when
you hear it in your cities and towns and states.   
   
Stay indoors if you’re vulnerable.  Be careful on hot pavement.   
   
Know the signs of heat stroke, like headache, nausea, dizziness.   
   
And always have water with you.  That sounds silly, but always have a
bottle of water with you when you’re outside.

Check on loved ones and neighbors who may not have air conditioning, and
check on them on a regular basis.  Or go to the mall or community
centers or movie theaters or libraries where there is air conditioning
when you don’t have that air conditioning at home.

Take advantage of local cooling centers.  Hundreds are being built. 
They’re there for everyone, and they save lives.  It matters.

Now I’m going to turn it over to the mayor of Phoenix, who’s on the
frontlines of dealing with extreme heat.   
   
And fire away, Mayor.  We’re anxious to hear what you have to say.

MAYOR GALLEGO:  Thank you so much, President Biden.  Thank you for
convening us today to talk about something near and dear to my heart and
on so many of our minds: extreme heat.   
   
We really appreciate your leadership on climate change with legislation
such as the Inflation Reduction Act that’ll be the most important in a
generation.  
   
Phoenix is known for heat.  We are often called the Valley of the Sun. 
We have relentless summer heat followed by beautiful months of weather. 
But right now, this summer has really been unprecedented.  And you’ve
spoken about some of the challenges we have faced here in Phoenix.  It’s
taking a real toll on our community.  
   
We — we feel like we are very much on the frontlines of climate
change.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  You are.  
   
MAYOR GALLEGO:  I’ve tried to make — and it’s — man, you can feel it
outside today.  We are ma- — I’ve tried to make it my mission to adapt
to this trend, to stay ever innovative, and ensure we aren’t falling
behind on heat resilience.   
   
We’re working to out-innovate climate change, but we need to work
together to make sure all of us are on deck to address it.  We need a
whole-of-government approach.  
   
Phoenix is the first in the nation to have a permanent publicly funded
heat office.  They love the data that NOAA and your federal government
is putting out to help us.   
   
Our emergency personnel and heat ral- — ready volunteers are working
diligently to keep residents safe through targeted outreach on heat
safety, park trail closures, and timely responses to help our most
vulnerable.   
   
The heat is a challenge for folks who don’t have access to adequate AC
or who are outdoors most of the day, so a large part of our efforts is
getting residents inside as much as possible.  We do it in a variety of
ways through cooling centers located across the country — the county,
mobile cooling units, respite centers, and encouraging hydration at one
of our many water stations.   
   
We also recognize that many families need assistance to make their air
conditioners more effective or need federal aid with their energy
bills.  And federal dollars have just been crucial in supporting
families’ abilities to make their homes safer and more comfortable.  
   
The Department of Energy’s Weatherization Assistance Program makes homes
more energy efficient, lowering energy bills for the long haul, reducing
overload on the grid, and making homes more comfortable in intense
heat.  
   
Paired with the incredible incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act for
residential solar, this can make an enormous impact for families.  And —
and Mayor Nir- — Nirenberg, who’s joining us, has been a real leader and
a model for mayors in how to communicate all the good things that are in
the IRA to our residents.  
   
The HHS Low-Income Household Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, has been
crucial for low-income families to help with energy bills.  Even when
the heat is over, many of our families may see their largest-ever energy
bill in their mailboxes.  
   
And we’re among the many warm-weather communities asking for balanced
consideration of how these formulas are structured.  Expanding these
solutions would have immediate impact for families.   
   
We are also using ARPA dollars to address heat.  And we are looking
forward to applying for the funding for trees, which could really go a
long way in making our communities more comfortable, that you have
secured in the Inflation Reduction Act.   
   
We deal with this heat on an annual basis.  So we’ve been focused on
preparedness from day one, and really trying to prepare for what is, for
us, a long-term emergency.  
   
You mentioned how many lives are lost to heat, and that’s a real focus
for us.  We would love it if Congress would give you the ability to
declare heat a disaster.  We think that could really save additional
aid, and that would even more multiply the impact of FEMA Hazard
Mitigation Assistance and Building Resistant — Resilience Infrastructure
— the BRIC programs, which are a good start to building long-term
solutions, such as energy redundancy for cooling centers.   
   
So, we feel like there are a lot of great tools.  And I appreciate you
helping communities across the country just make sure they’re aware of
the great ways the federal government is partnering.  We’re looking
forward to working with you to become even more effective.  Thank you.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, Kate, thank you very much.   
   
Look, you’ve established the Office of Heat Response and Mitigation. 
And sometimes — I think those of us in government do this all the time:
We think everybody knows what all these titles and all these acronyms
mean.  But can you give me — share some examples of the work and the
outreach that you’re doing in the community to try to let people know
what’s available and how you can help?  I mean, what — what kinds of
thing — because I find that’s the difficult thing to do sometimes.  
   
MAYOR GALLEGO:  Absolutely.  We’re getting better every year, and we
learn every year.  We’re trying to get out and share maps of where all
the cooling centers are to deliver cooling kits.   
   
You mentioned checking on loved ones.  We have a formal program called
“Cool Callers” at the city of Phoenix —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Good for you.  
   
MAYOR GALLEGO:  — where we can — you can register your family members or
if you know you might need a — a check during the heat of the summer. 
And we would love for more people to sign up to be checked on.   
   
It’s — it’s a — the volunteers have been amazing.  We’ve had thousands
of engagement.  And just having that permanent office has given us a
place for people to go both with ideas and when they want to volunteer. 
And we’ve been able to use some of your federal programs, including
trying to find new ways to build housing indoors so that our
construction workers are safer.   
   
So, we appreciate the partnership.  It’s made our heat office more
effective.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, it’s not going to alleviate it right — the heat
problem right now, but we also have a number of programs to do
everything from allow people to have the ability to get help to
literally paint their roofs white, to change the — the — their win- —
their windows and doors, to get tax credits for doing it so heat doesn’t
— so air conditioning doesn’t escape, to be able —  
   
There’s a whole bunch of programs that are out there that, as we get
through the heat wave, that we’re — well, as we get by this worst part,
that we’re able to invest in the communities to keep it from happening
as badly next time it occurs.  
   
And so, I’m looking forward to working with you, and I thank you for
your leadership.  
   
Mr. Mayor, how are you doing, man?  
   
MAYOR NIRENBERG:  Doing great, Mr. President.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I hope the air con- — I hope the air conditioning is
working.  (Laughs.)  
   
MAYOR NIRENBERG:  So far, so good, Mr. President.  It’s great to be here
with you and your team and with Mayor Gallego.  
   
And I first want to start by thanking you, Mr. President, for the
invitation today and want to extend my sincerest gratitude for your
administration for the wealth of the support that San Antonio
communities garnered through extensive and substantive investments in
our housing stock — affordable housing stock, our workforce training
efforts, as well as sustainable physical infrastructure.  
   
But today we are here to talk about what has become a dangerous heat
wave across large swaths of the southern part of our country, including
here in Texas.   
   
To that end, San Antonio is certainly thankful for a president who’s
willing to tackle this urgent crisis in an equitable manner.   
   
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act’s
commitment to the Justice40 climate initiative is also reflected on our
local San Antonio Climate Ready Plan, as 75 percent of San Antonio’s
population are communities of color disproportionately impacted by
decades of local inaction.  
   
But times are changing, thankfully.  Sustainability and green energy are
no longer four-letter words in the state of Texas.  We will —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  At least among most of you Tex- — at least among most
Texans.  
   
MAYOR NIRENBERG:  Well, I’m happy to say that —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m —  
   
MAYOR NIRENBERG:  — here in San Antonio, we’ve taken leadership.  And
—  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  You have.  
   
MAYOR NIRENBERG:  — and in ‘28, we will end the use of coal in San
Antonio, which is nearly four years ahead of schedule.   
   
And in large part because of you, Mr. President, San Antonio will launch
its first-ever Advanced Rapid Transit line — bona fide mass transit for
the city of San Antonio, a service that will only include low- or
no-emission vehicles.  
   
And so, as San Antonio works towards greener development in transit,
we’re also doing our policy work.  Our — we changed our development code
last year to require 240-volt level 2 chargers in all new single-family
homes.  We’re also providing incentives for those chargers in
multifamily residences.   
   
And also having the nation’s largest municipally owned utilities, San
Antonio has now become the fifth-largest solar producer in the United
States and —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Congratulations on that, by the way.  Congratulations.  
   
MAYOR NIRENBERG:  Thank you very much.  We’re going to reach for number
one in the country.  We’re number one in Texas, but we’re not going to
stop.  
   
However, these initiatives are just — are not just happening in San
Antonio.  I’m pleased to report mayors are united in Texas as well. 
Communities across Texas have committed themselves to being greener,
more equitable, and literally cooler, as nearly every major Texas city
now has a long-term climate or emissions reduction strategy.  
   
So, working with our partners at the White House, with you and your
team, I’m confident that the state best known for oil and gas production
can help lead the way to a greener tomorrow.   
   
So, thank you again to your entire team, Mr. President, for your efforts
to help us realize a better tomorrow for us, for our children, and for
our grandchildren.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, Ron, thank you.  And I’m not being solicitous when
I say this: You know, most people don’t realize that Texas is one of the
states that has the most significant — its energy is most significantly
supplied by wind and solar, in Texas — in Texas.  
   
And I know there are some in your state who want to change — turn that
around.  But it’s working, and it’s moving in a big way.  And it’s
cheaper.  It’s cheaper.  
   
MAYOR NIRENBERG:  And it saved our necks in this heat wave too, by the
way.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think so.  For real.  I mean, look, most people
have — grew up in families like I did, where you just got to worry about
one day to the next and getting enough food on the table.  I mean, not
poor but, you know, just taking care of business, making sure your kids
are okay.  
   
But I — the change that’s taking place in Texas as it relates to dealing
with the generation of energy is really magnificent.  I mean, it’s
really incredible.  
   
And — and I’m sure that — anyway, I won’t — I shouldn’t get into all
that.  But — but the fact is — you know, while your long-term plans take
shape, what are you doing in the near term to protect your residents
from the heat wave?  
   
MAYOR NIRENBERG:  Well, I certainly appreciate that question and very
much appreciate the actions that you’re taking today, Mr. President,
through the Department of Labor.  
   
As you know, Texas cities are in a battle with the state for local
control.  But we’re going to do everything possible to protect our most
vulnerable workers, especially those outdoor workers, for basic things
like being able to access water breaks.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  
   
MAYOR NIRENBERG:  San Antonio also is the first — taking a page from
Mayor Gallego’s book, we’re the first major city in Texas to pilot a
citywide cool pavement initiative.  
   
I’m also pleased to report that, next week, city council will vote to
allocate an additional $4 million for tree planting, for mitigating our
urban heat island effect.  
   
And for the most immediate needs right now during this heat island — or
during this heat wave — we have 80 cooling centers located all around
the city — pools, splash pads, libraries, et cetera.  And we’re offering
free transportation to any resident who needs to get located into one of
those indoor cooling centers.   
   
And for our homeless population, we are conducting extensive outreach to
make sure that we can get them into cool places and nobody is out there
in the elements.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you.  And, look, don’t hesitate to call us
direct.  For real.  
   
MAYOR NIRENBERG:  (Inaudible.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I mean, there’s so much — no, I really mean it.  There’s
so much out there that we can do.  And we’ve funded an awful lot of
this.  
   
For example, the idea that you can’t have mandatory water breaks when
you’re working on a construction?  Hell, when I played football, if you
— if you had a coach who, during the spring — during summer practice,
didn’t provide water, you know, on a regular basis, he got in trouble,
got fired.  
   
I mean, what are we doing here?  What’s going on with some of this
stuff?  
   
Both of you are — totally different place.  But people just need to know
where to go and what to do.  And we’re going to provide a lot of help
across the board.  And I’m looking forward to working with both of
you.  
   
For example, we should — on the international effort, we’ve — we’ve got
a commitment to, you know, plant a billion trees over the next several
years worldwide.  I mean, there’s a reason why —  
   
Anyway, you guys get it.  And — but we got to get through this crisis in
the — in the near term, and we got to keep people safe.  
   
And I really appreciate it.  Because, look, I think talking to you both
— people make judgments about whether you have a heart or not, whether
you really are — whether it’s just rote, you’re telling them, or you
care.  
   
I mean this sincerely; you guys know this.  Well, you both care, and it
comes across.  And so, people are more inclined to say, “Okay, I’ll take
a chance on maybe going to that center, or maybe I’ll take a chance on
doing A, B, C, or D.”  
   
People are reluctant.  And what — what you’re both doing substantively,
what we’re going to be able to help you do more substantively, but what
you’re doing and the way you’re doing it, I really admire you for doing
it.  I really mean it.  
   
So, thank you, thank you, thank you.  Appreciate it.  
   
And I want to thank my team for the work they’re doing too to combat
extreme heat and other historic weather emergencies we’re seeing all
across the country.   
   
We are making progress.  But as we’ve heard today, we have a lot more
work to do.  
   
I look forward to working with not just — just this two — these two
wonderful mayors, but officials all across on the frontlines and local
officials.  Local officials are where the rubber meets the road, no pun
intended.  It really matters.  
   
We’re committed to getting you what you need to keep your community
safe, because no one knows what you need more for your communities than
you guys.  And so, thank you, thank you, thank you.   
   
And I mean it: Don’t hesitate to contact any of the departments standing
behind me.  We have some of the funds.  We’re mer- — we’re going to get
more.  And I think we can make a difference.  
   
So, thank you both.  And as my — my mother would say, “God love you.”  
   
Thanks.  See you all.  (Applause.)
