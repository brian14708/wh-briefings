  \ Access to Quality, Affordable Healthcare"

Oval Office

1:43 PM

THE PRESIDENT:  Since we are socially distanced, I think I can take my
mask off to make this very brief announcement.  I know that you’ve been
briefed by the healthcare team about what this is about.  And there is
an easy and quick way for us to describe this. 

It’s been a busy week, and I’ve signed executive orders tackling
COVID-19, the economic and climate crises, as well as advancing racial
equity.

But, today, I’m about to sign two executive orders that are — basically,
the best way to describe them, to undo the damage Trump has done. 
There’s nothing new that we’re doing here, other than restoring the
Affordable Care Act and restoring the Medicaid to the way it was before
Trump became President, which by fiat he changed — made more
inaccessible, more expensive, and more difficult for people to qualify
for either of those two items: the Affordable Care Act or Medicaid. 

And the second — the second order I’m going to be signing also changes
what the President has done — the President — the President — what the
former President has done.  And it — a memorandum reversed the — my
predecessor’s attack on women’s health — (coughs) — excuse me — health
access.  And as we continue to battle COVID-19, it’s even more critical
that Americans have meaningful access to healthcare.  

And so that’s what I’m about to do.  And again, I’m not initiating any
new law, any new aspect of the law.  This is going back to what the
situation was prior to the President’s executive orders. 

And the first one I’m going to be signing here is to strengthen Medicaid
and the Affordable Care Act.  And of all times that we need to reinstate
access to, affordability of, and the extent of access to Medicaid is
now, in the middle of this COVID crisis. 

*(The executive order is signed.)*

And the second order I’m singing relates to protecting women’s health at
home and abroad, and it reinstates the changes that were made to Title
10 and other things, making it harder for women to have access to
affordable healthcare as it relates to their reproductive rights. 

*(The executive order is signed.)*

I’m sorry you had to stand in the cold before you all came in.  Thank
you all very much.

Q    Mr. President, is healthcare working as is, or when are you going
to put out healthcare legislation? 

THE PRESIDENT:  We got a lot to do.  And the first thing I got to do is
get this COVID package passed.

Q    Do you think that COVID relief has to require you to break it up
into chunks, Mr. President?

THE PRESIDENT:  No one requires me to do anything.

Thank you.
