Q    Mr. President, how was your meeting with Senator Manchin
yesterday?  How did your meeting go, sir?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  It went well.  A few more things to work out, but it
went well.  
   
Q    Do you think you’ll have a plan before Wednesday?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  With the grace of God and the goodwill of the
neighbors.  
   
Q    Do you want a plan — a deal by the time you leave for COP?   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  
   
Q    Is that something you’ve expressed to Democrats?   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s my — that’s my hope.  
   
Thank you.  
   
Q    Do you expect a vote this week?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  What do you think?  I don’t know.   
      
Q    We’re asking you.  
   
Q    How critical is it to get this — how critical is it to get this
done before the trip?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  It would be very, very positive to get it done before
the trip.   
   
Thank you.
