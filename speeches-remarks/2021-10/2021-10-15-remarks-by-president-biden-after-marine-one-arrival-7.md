Q    Mr. President, what’s your message to people who defy Congressional
subpoenas on the January 6 committee?

THE PRESIDENT:  I hope that the committee goes after them and holds them
accountable criminally.

Q    Should they be prosecuted by the Justice Department?

THE PRESIDENT:  I do, yes.

Q    Sir, do you support term limits for the Supreme Court?

THE PRESIDENT:  No.

Q    Do you have a message to Sinema and Senator Manchin right now?

THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, I’m about to deliver it.

Q    Are you speaking to them tonight?

Q    Are you excited to see the Pope?

THE PRESIDENT:  I am looking to see the Pope, yeah.  He’s become a —
he’s — we’ve corresponded.  So I’m looking forward to seeing him.

Q    In recent days?  Or —

THE PRESIDENT:  No, no, no.  Over the last — since Beau died.

Q    Are supply chain bottlenecks threatening the overall economic
recovery, do you think?

THE PRESIDENT:  No problem.  You know that.  What a question.  (Laughs.)

Q    You don’t think the supply chain bottlenecks are threatening the
economy?

THE PRESIDENT:  Are they threatening the economy?

Q    Yeah, overall economic recovery.

THE PRESIDENT:  No, sure, they have an impact on it because of COVID. 
And we’ve got to catch up.

Q    Mr. President, can Senator Bernie Sanders and Senator Joe Manchin
ever reconcile their differences on your agenda?

THE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)

Q    Why not get them together and hash it out this weekend?

THE PRESIDENT:  No problem!  I can do that.  Not a problem.  (Laughs.)

Thank you.

Q    Do you think the talks will come to a conclusion next week?

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’m pushing hard to try to get it moving as
quickly as I can.

Q    Is there a deadline?

THE PRESIDENT:  No.  No.

Q    Mr. President, (inaudible) Mexico and the border.  Are you
concerned about the fact that some of the people who got the vaccine,
like Sputnik, which are not approved here in the U.S. or by the World
Health Organization, it’s going to affect the relationship between the
two countries?

THE PRESIDENT:  I have to talk to my medical experts.  I don’t know
enough to answer that question.  Thank you.
