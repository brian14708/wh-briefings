  \ Memorial Service"

U.S. Capitol  
Washington, D.C.

12:39 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Sergeant.  My name is Joe Biden.  I am Jill
Biden’s husband.  (Laughter.)  That’s how I’m better known.  
   
President Yoes, Auxiliary President Hennie, Auxiliary President Leamann
\[sic\] and — excuse me, Lehmann — and a guy I’ve known for a long, long
time, Jimmy Pasco, Executive Director: Thank you for this invitation to
be with you today.  
      
To Secretary of Homeland Security Mayorkas, thank you for being here and
for the great job you’re doing for us.  Thank you very, very much.  And
it’s a tough job.  
   
Most importantly, to the families here today, this is all about you —
about you.  You know, I’ve been coming to this memorial for 40 years.  I
missed a couple, but — and I’ve spoken at many — too many police
memorials all around the country.  And it always amazes me how the
public doesn’t fully understand what we expect of our law enforcement
officers.   
   
We expect you to be people ready to stand in the way and take a bullet
for us.  We expect you to be able to track down the bad guys.  We expect
you to be the psychologist who talks the couple that are having a
violent confrontation together to step back.  We expect you to be
everything.  We expect everything of you.  And it’s beyond the capacity
of anyone to meet the total expectations.  Being a cop today is one hell
of a lot harder than it’s ever been.   
   
And to the families of the fallen: You’ve suffered an enormous loss. 
But understand, your loss is also America’s loss.  America’s loss.  And
your pain is America’s pain.  
   
We’re waking up to the notion that unless we change the environment in
which the job can be done, we’re going to have trouble having enough
women and men come forward to want to do that job.  
   
I hope all the families — sons, daughters, husbands, wives, moms, dads —
I hope you’re able to take a measure of comfort and strength from the
extended family you have here and all around you.  
   
In remembrance and respect of this memorial and this day, I ordered our
flags to be flown at half-staff.  
   
We’ve met here, in front of this United States Capitol, many times
before to memorialize our fallen heroes.  And it’s particularly
appropriate today, because here, nine months ago, your brothers and
sisters thwarted an unconstitutional and fundamentally un-American
attack on our nation’s values and our votes.  
   
But because of you, democracy survived — but only because of the women
and men of the U.S. Capitol Police force, the Washington, D.C.
Metropolitan Police Department, and other law enforcement agencies who
once again, literally, put their bodies on the line to protect our
democracy.   
   
That’s why I have no hesitation — had none at all — in signing the law
awarding the Congressional Gold Medal of Congress — the highest
expression of nation’s appreciation — to the U.S. Capitol Police and
Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police and other responding law
enforcement agencies.  (Applause.)  
   
Because of these men and women, we averted a catastrophe.  
   
But their heroism came at a cost to you and your families: 150 officers
injured; 5 lost in the attack’s aftermath.  The toll on this profession
these past years has been heavy.  Too heavy.  2020 was the deadliest
year for law enforcement on record.  
   
And today, we’re here to remember nearly 500 of your brothers and
sisters, husbands and wives, sons and daughters.  
   
2019 and 2020 — we lost so much.  
   
I’ve attended this memorial many times, as I said, to pay my respects. 
Sometimes I’ve been the speaker; other times I’ve sat on this stage and
just thought about all of you sitting on the lawn.  Although this year,
I don’t know any personally who have fallen — any of the individuals. 
I’ve gone through all the names.  I feel I know that with- — them —
without having ever met them.  
   
You see, I grew up in a neighborhood — a neighborhood in Scranton,
Pennsylvania; and Claymont, Delaware; and Bellefonte, where I grew up
with the guys and women that we’re honoring today.  
   
One of my best friends in grade school, Eddie Hill (ph), became a
superintendent of the Delaware State Police — a great friend and
competitor in the other major high school.  We played ball against one
another.  Charlie Doughert- — Dougherty (ph) became the head of the —
chief of the Wilmington Police force.  And so many more.  
   
So although I didn’t know them personally, I know you.  I know you.   
   
I always joke that I grew up in places where you either became a cop, a
firefighter, or a priest.  I wasn’t qualified for them, so I had to
settle for this.  (Laughter.)  
   
But all kidding aside, over the years, as chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, I’ve gotten to know you.  Even as kids, we could see, in the
women and men around us, who are the ones who had the heart.  They’re
the ones who ran in to help you when everyone else was running away. 
They ran toward cries for help, even when they were in grade school,
knowing that they’d be able to help a little bit, even if they were
outnumbered.  
   
And I’m not making this up.  Think about it.  Think about your son, your
daughter, your husband, your wife — who they were and what was inside
them.  It was about service, to protect, defend.  
      
This isn’t just what law enforcement does.  It’s who you are.  It’s what
makes you who you are.  And when you put on that shield in the morning
and walk out the door each day, every family member dreads the
possibility of receiving that phone call.  
   
I was talking to Steny about this.  Just as our son, Beau, was in Kosovo
for about six months and in Iraq for a year, he was the chief law
enforcement officer for the state of Delaware — the attorney general. 
And I’d watch every morning — because she left for school before I got
on the train — Jill standing there mouthing a prayer while she drank a
cup of coffee over the sink, praying — praying for Beau.  We’d do it
every day.  We did it every day.    
   
You know, there’s a line from an English poet, John Milton. He said,
“They also serve who only stand and wait.”  How long have you had to
stand and wait and wonder when you heard something on the news or saw it
television?  Thousands and thousands of American families stand and wait
so their husbands, their wives, their fathers, their mothers, sons and
daughters, can serve the rest of us.

We not only owe them, we owe you.  And it’s not hyperbole. I mean this
from the bottom of my heart: We owe you, willing to support to them.  
   
And too many of you sitting out there have received that terrible call
that your loved one won’t be coming home at the end of his or her
shift.  
   
To the mothers and fathers here today: My heart aches for you.  Believe
it or not, Jill and I understand.  We got one of those calls in a
different circumstance.  
   
No parent should have to bury a child.  I lost a baby daughter in an
accident.  I lost a brave son to cancer after coming home from a year in
Iraq.  But you know what?  What you’ve gone through is hard.  The fact
that he was a chief law enforcement officer of Delaware, he wasn’t out
there — literally, he’d go on patrols, but he wasn’t out there walking
up those stairs to make that arrest or try to stop that fight.  He was
al- — it was always about family.   
   
It’s like losing a piece of your soul.  Some of you still have that
feeling like you’ve been sucked into a black hole in your chest,
wondering, “My God, will it ever change?”  
   
Sergeant McClain from Detroit decorated for exemplary service during his
16-year career.  He turned down promotions so he could continue to work
as a mentor to other officers in his district.  
   
Every two weeks, he’d send his wife flowers at work, like clockwork, to
brighten her day and her office.  He was killed responding to a domestic
violence call.  
   
Officer Tiffany-Victoria Enriquez from Honolulu.  She was one of two
officers killed while responding to a call and was the first female
officer to die in the line of duty in the Honolulu Police Department.   
   
Her boyfriend, also an officer, called her, quote, “the most
hardworking, amazing, fiercest officer I have ever known.  My heart is
shattered, and she was my love, my rock, my strength.”   
   
So many.  
   
Officer Charles Bra — Braz — excuse me, Brazydlo — excuse me, Barzyldo —
passed away in 2016, but he was recognized in his line of duty this
year.  He was part of an elite unit of the Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey — a unit trained to perform technical rescue
operations.  
   
After the terrorist attacks on September 11th, he was assigned to search
and recover — recovery efforts at the World Trade tower.  He, like so
many others, contracted cancer.  He died of cancer following that
assignment.  
   
He made friends wherever he went.  He loved the outdoors.  He was his
neighborhood go-to guy, organizing almost anything, including hunting
expeditions.  
   
As you call the roll today, we’re acutely aware that behind each name
are families.  As I said, we know from personal experience that every
time there’s a ceremony or memorial honoring your lost husband or wife,
son or daughter, it can summon that pride but also that terrible
feeling, as if you’re just hearing the news for the first time.  
   
So, I want you to know: I know although you looked forward to honoring
your family member, it’s hard.  It’s hard.  I mean this sincerely: Jill
and I admire your courage for just being here.   
   
And we hope you take some comfort in the knowledge that the men and
women here assembled today, they’ll always be with you.  Not a joke. 
They’ll always be with you, wherever you are — and even if you don’t
know them — in a city, a town, a place you’ve never been before.  
   
And as much as we hope not, there are going to be more names added to
this roll call of bravery and sorrow.  There already have been.  
   
As I was preparing these remarks, earlier this morning in Houston, the
deputy killed — one deputy killed and two wounded.  
   
Chief Finner from Houston is here today.  I don’t know where the Chief
is, but he’s here today, I’m told.  Known them — seven Houston Police
officers in his department were killed in the line of duty since 2019.  
   
Chief, I’m here for you, pal, and so is everybody else.  
   
We mourn the fallen.  We pray for the recovery of the wounded.   
   
As I’ve said, I’ve spoken many — too many times, too many funerals for
police officers; too many funerals for brave servants who kept us
safe.  
   
So, under the mournful sound of the bagpipes, we must also hear
something else: a call to do better, to do more, to keep you safe, to
keep our communities safer; for us to step up; to build trust and
respect, and heal the breach we now see in so many communities; to
recognize that the promise of equal  
and impartial justice remains a promise but not always a reality for you
or others, particularly in low-income communities, too many communities
— Black and brown.  
   
Too many families are grieving unnecessary losses of their sons, their
daughters, their fathers, their brothers.  
   
I want to acknowledge the FOP, as was mentioned earlier, for sincerely
trying to reach an agreement on meaningful reforms, congressional
reform, in the negotiations over the  
George Floyd \[Justice\] in Policing Act.  
   
But here’s the part: A lot of the help has to come to police
departments.  They need help to do better.   
   
I want thank you for being the constructive player in this process.  We
haven’t gotten there yet, but we must get there.   
   
Look, there’s too much pain.  There’s too much loss. There’s too much at
stake for the safety and for the safety of those you serve.   
   
It’s a hard time to be a police officer in America.  So I want to make
sure you have the tools to be the partners and the protectors your
communities need.   
   
That when you look at what your communities need and what you’re being
asked to do, there isn’t going to be — there are going to be more
resources, not fewer resources helping you do your job.   
   
That’s why I proposed we invest in — we invest again in community
policing we know works.  Wanting to protect cops is another cop.  In the
training you and the community have requested.  The community-based
programs and interventions that can stop violence before it starts. 
Provide specific guidance explaining that communities can and should use
funds from the American Rescue Plan — $350 billion in aid to cities,
states, counties, Tribes, to hire and retain officers.  Many cities,
from Albuquerque to St. Paul, are doing just that.  
   
And I proposed an additional $300 million in my budget to support
community policing across the country.  It’s hard when you don’t know
the community.  And the most important way to get to know them — it has
more police.   
   
We’re also investing in community violence intervention programs, which
are proven — have a proven track record of reducing violence by up to 60
percent in cities across our nation.   
   
At the same time, we have to stop asking law enforcement officers to do
every single job under the sun.   
   
I’m committed to investing in mental health services and mental health
professionals who can respond to a mental health crisis alongside you. 
You shouldn’t be the one having to talk someone off the edge of the
roof.  You should have professional help with you.  
   
To support our law enforcement officers it requires that we invest in
the systems that provide adequate healthcare, counseling, drug treatment
and prevention, housing, education, and other social services in the
community so there is not a discord.  
   
We need to work together to confront the ecidemic \[sic\] — the epidemic
of gun violence.  Your brothers and sisters have told me, over the
years, sometimes you feel like you’re “outgunned.”  
   
Right now, the Justice Department, under the leadership of Attorney
General Garland, is working with state and local law enforcement across
the country to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals.  
   
They now have zero tolerance for gun dealers who willfully violate the
law, putting firearms into the hands of people who are a danger to the
community and you.  
   
I also want to make it easier for states to adopt red-flag laws — laws
that allow family members or law enforcement to petition a court order
to temporarily remove firearms from people who are in crisis,
representing a danger to themselves and to others.  
   
By the way, more people die of gunshot wounds in America as a
consequence of suicide than any other reason.  
   
I’ve called on Congress to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act
and to close the domestic violence loophole to keep guns out of the
hands of abusers.  Forty percent of all calls that result in an
officer’s death were domestic violence related.  Forty percent.   
   
These steps will protect you, protect the people you serve.  
   
And finally, and tragically, in the past two years, COVID-19 has caused
more deaths in the line of duty than all the other causes combined.   
   
Many of those lost their lives keeping our society safe, serving on the
frontlines in those dark, early days of the pandemic.   
   
But now, let us prevent the preventable tragedies.  The last time I
stood here was to take the Oath of Office as your President.  I said
that day we have much to repair, much to restore, much to heal, much to
build, much to gain.  
   
It remains true.  I believe with all my heart there’s nothing you’re
unable to do if we equip you; that we can unite this nation to fight our
common foes: anger, resentment, hatred, extremism, racism, lawlessness,
violence, disease, joblessness, hopelessness.  
   
We have never, ever failed in America when we’ve acted together.  So
let’s act together to support you in the service of the nation we
love.  
   
In closing, let me say that I know there are no words,  no memorials
that can fill that void, that black hole in your chest so many of you
feel.  
   
But I promise you, the day will come when the memory of your loved one
will bring a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye. 
That’s when you know you’re going to make it.  That’s when you know. 
That will happen.  
   
But my prayer for you is that that day will come sooner than later.  
   
There is a headstone in a cemetery in Ireland that reads: “Death leaves
a heartache no one can heal.  Love leaves a memory that no one can
steal.”  
   
They’re with you.  They’re in your heart.  They’re a part of you.  
   
May the souls of those you love and those with whom you served rest in
peace and rise in glory.  
   
In the meantime, you’re in our prayers.  May God bless you, and may God
protect all those who serve us in uniform.  Thank you.  (Applause.)
