1:17 P.M. CET  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN: Good afternoon, everyone. As you know, I’ll be holding
a press conference later today, and I look forward to taking your
questions. But right now, I’m not going to take any questions. I’m going
to head back down to the meeting downstairs, but I will be able to take
your questions later today.  
   
Right now, I’m here with the European Commission President von der
Leyen, who’s been a great partner, because the United States and the
European Union have reached a major breakthrough that will address the
existential threat of climate change while also protecting American jobs
and American industry.  
   
Together, the United States and the European Union are ushering in a new
era of transatlantic cooperation that’s going to benefit all of our
people — both now and, I believe, in the years to come. It’s a testament
to the power of our strong partnership and to what the United States can
accomplish by working together with our friends.  
   
Here’s what this deal does: It immediately removes tariffs on European
Union — on the European Union on a range of U.S. products and lowers
cost to American consumers. It ensures a strong and competitive U.S.
steel industry for decades to come and creates good-paying union jobs at
home. And — and — it demonstrates how by harnessing our diplomatic and
economic power, we can reject the false idea that we can’t grow our
economy and support American workers while tackling the climate crisis;
we can do all three of those things. We can and we must do both.  
   
The American workers are a central part of the solution to the climate
crisis. And I would argue — I’ve said before, or — that when I think
climate, I think jobs; I think of good-paying jobs around the world. You
know, I think it’s possible for us to do both, as I said. And the
workers are a central part of this solution.  
   
Building on our close partnership on our shared values, the United
States and the European Union have committed to negotiate a carbon-based
arrangement on steel and aluminum trade. This — these arrangements will,
one, lift up U.S. aluminum and steel, which is among the greatest steel
in the world — that’s somewhat prejudiced on my behalf; incentivize
emission reductions in one of the most carbon-intensive sectors of the
global economy; restrict access to our markets for dirty steel from
countries like China; and counter countries that dump steel in our
markets, hammering our workers and harming them badly along with the
industry and our environment.  
   
Today is a testament of the power of American diplomacy and strong
partnerships to deliver tangible benefits for American workers and the
middle-class families in America.  
   
I thank Gina Raimondo and Ambass- — our Secretary — and Ambassador
Katherine Tai for their leadership to get this done. But they had a
really first-rate person to work with to get it done. And I want to
thank the European Commission President von der Leyen for her — her team
and her partnership. She’s been straightforward from the very beginning
as we worked to come up with a creative solution that benefits all of
our people.  
   
Over the past nine months, the United States and the European Union have
come together to take on major global challenges by looking to all that
unites us and the shared interests we have both in Europe and the United
States.  
   
We resolved the 17-year Boeing-Airbus dispute. And we’ve been close
partners to the — to address COVID-19 and combat climate change.  
   
As we move forward, we’re going to continue together to update the rules
of the road and the 21st century economy, and prove to the world that
democracies — democracies — are taking on hard problems and delivering
sound solutions. And the European Union and the United States will
continue to be the closest of friends and partners as we work together
to solve the 21st century challenges.  
   
So, I thank you again, President von der Leyen. And now I turn the
podium over to you. Thank you.  
   
PRESIDENT VON DER LEYEN: Thanks a lot.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN: I think I’m over there.  
   
PRESIDENT VON DER LEYEN: Thank you very much, Mr. President — dear Joe.
Thank you very much.  
   
And I’m also very pleased to announce that, Mr. President, you and I, we
have today agreed to suspend the tariffs on steel and aluminum and to
start the work on the new Global Sustainable Steel Arrangement.  
   
And this marks a milestone in the renewed EU-U.S. partnership. And it is
our global first in our efforts to achieve the decarbonization of the
global steel production and trade.  
   
It is a big step forward in fighting climate change. The arrangement is,
of course, open to all likeminded partners. Steel manufacturing is one
of the highest carbon emission sources globally.  
   
And for steel consumption and trade to be sustainable, we must address
the carbon intensity of the industry. We must also address problems of
overcapacity. And this is what the Global Sustainable Steel Arrangement
is all about.  
   
We will work together with the United States to ensure the long-term
viability of our industry and to encourage the production and trade of
low-carbon steel.  
   
This new global initiative will add a new powerful tool in our quest for
sustainability. It will be a major step forward in achieving climate
neutrality. And it will ensure a level playing field for our
industries.  
   
It is yet another key initiative for our renewed, forward-looking
transatlantic agenda with the United States.  
   
Since the beginning of the year — as you said, Mr. President, dear Joe —
we have restored trust and communication. We put to rest our disputes on
aircraft subsidies. We set up our Trade and Technology Council. We
created a vaccine partnership. We reached an agreement on global minimum
tax. And now we have found a solution on EU-U.S. steel and aluminum
trade.  
   
I thank you, Mr. President, dear Joe, for your announcement that the
United States will remove U.S. tariffs on EU steel and aluminum up to
previous trade levels. This will alleviate a major part of the existing
trade irritants. It will allow trade — transatlantic trade in steel and
aluminum between us to come back to the levels recorded before these
tariffs were put in place.  
   
And following this U.S. decision, I am pleased to announce that the
Commission will also propose to suspend the tariffs that we had
introduced.  
   
I’m also pleased to join President Biden in announcing the pausing of
our dispute on this issue in the World Trade Organization.  
   
And as you did, Mr. President, dear Joe, I would like to thank Secretary
of Commerce Gina Raimondo, U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador
Katherine Tai, and Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis for their
and their team’s tireless efforts in the last month. This is a major
step forward in our renewed relationship, and many thanks for that.
Looking forward to working more on this deal.  
   
Thanks a lot.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN: Thank you.  
   
PRESIDENT VON DER LEYEN: Thank you very much.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN: Thank you, folks.
