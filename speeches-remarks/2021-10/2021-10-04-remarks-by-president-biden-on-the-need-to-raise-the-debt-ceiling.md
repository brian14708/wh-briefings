State Dining Room

11:45 A.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  It will come as no surprise to you: I’d
like to talk about what we need today to — to raise the debt limit and
why the Republicans in Congress are — what they’re doing today is so
reckless and dangerous, in my view.  
   
Raising the debt limit comes down to paying what we already owe, what
has already been acquired — not anything new.  It starts with a simple
truth: The United States is a nation that pays its bills and always
has.  From its inception, we have never defaulted.  
   
What we pay for is what keeps us a great nation: Social Security
benefits for seniors, salaries for brave service members and benefits
for veterans, and other financial obligations for our people and our
nation.  
   
We’re able to meet those obligations based on the revenue we receive
from taxes and based on our ability to borrow what — when needed.  
   
And in that case, we’re able to borrow because we always pay our debt. 
We always pay what we owe.  We’ve never failed.  That’s America.  That’s
who we are.  That’s what’s called for.  It’s called “full faith and
credit of the United States.”  It’s rock solid.  It’s the best in the
world.  
   
But here’s the deal: There’s a cap on what we can borrow called the
“debt limit.”  And only Congress can raise or lower that debt limit. 
So, let me be really clear.  This is really important to know: Raising
the debt limit is about paying off our old debts.  It has nothing to do
with any new spending being considered.   
   
It has nothing to do with my plan for infrastructure or building back
better.  Zero.  Zero.  Both of which, I might add, are paid for.  
   
So, if we’re going to make good on what’s already been approved by
previous Congresses and previous presidents and parties, we have to pay
for it: Social Security benefits the American people were promised,
salaries for service men and women, benefits for veterans.  We’re going
to have to raise the debt limit if we’re going to meet those
obligations.  
   
And raising the debt limit is usually a bipartisan undertaking.  And it
should be.  That’s what is not happening today.  
   
The reason we have to raise the debt limit is, in part, because of the
reckless tax and spending policies under the previous Trump
administration.  
   
In four years, they incur- — they incurred nearly $8 trillion.  In four
years, $8 trillion in additional debt and bills we have to now pay off. 
That’s more than a quarter of the entire debt incurred now outstanding
after more than 200 years.  
   
And Republicans in Congress raised the debt three times when Donald
Trump was President, and each time with Democrat support.  But now they
won’t raise it even though they are responsible for more than $8
trillion in bills incurred in four years under the previous
administration.  That’s what we’d be paying off.  
   
They won’t raise it even though defaulting on the debt would lead to a
self-inflicted wound that takes our economy over a cliff and risks jobs
and retirement savings, Social Security benefits, salaries for service
members, benefits for veterans, and so much more.  
   
A failure to raise the debt limit will call into question Congress’s
willingness to meet our obligations that we’ve already incurred — not
new ones; we’ve already incurred.  This is going to undermine the safety
of U.S. Treasury securities.  And it will threaten the reserve status of
the dollar as the world’s currency that the world relies on.    
   
American credit rating will be downgraded.  Interest rates will rise for
mortgages, auto loans, credit cards borrowing.  
   
Folks watching at home, you should know this is the Republican
position.  Here’s — it is: They won’t vote to raise the debt limit to
cover their own spending.  Democrats voted with them to cover that
spending the last four years — the previous four years.  They say
Democrats should do it alone.   
   
But then they’re threatening to use a procedural power called the
filibuster, meaning that we’d have to get 60 votes — not 50 votes — to
increase the debt limit.   
   
This would block the Democrats from meeting our obligations and
responsibilities to prevent Congress from raising the debt limit.  
   
So, let’s be clear: Not only are Republicans refusing to do their job,
they’re threatening to use the power — their power to prevent us from
doing our job: saving the economy from a catastrophic event.  I think,
quite frankly, it’s hypocritical, dangerous, and disgraceful.  
   
Their obstruction and irresponsibility knows absolutely no bounds —
(coughs) — excuse me — especially as we’re clawing our way out of this
pandemic.  
   
Democrats will meet our responsibility and obligation to this country. 
We’re not expecting Republicans to do their part.  They’ve made that
clear from the beginning.    
   
We’ve tried asking to no avail.  We’re just asking them not to use
procedural tricks to block us from doing the job that they won’t do.  
   
A meteor is head to — is headed to crash into our economy.  Democrats
are willing to do all the work stopping it.  Republicans just have to
let us do our job; just get out of the way.   
   
If you don’t want to help save the country, get out of the way so you
don’t destroy it.  
   
We don’t have time to delay with elaborate procedural schemes — which
Republicans’ proposals require — scores of votes without any certainty
at all, many of which have nothing to do with the debt limit at all. 
And that’s when accidents happen.  
   
In the days ahead, even before the default date, people may see the
value of their retirement accounts shrink.  They may see interest rates
go up, which will ultimately raise their mortgage payments and car
payments.   
   
And the American people — look, I just say it this way: As soon as this
week, your savings and your pocket — your pocketbook could be directly
impacted by this Republican stunt.  It’s as simple as that.  
   
Republicans say they will not do their part to avoid this needless
calamity.  So be it.  But they need to stop playing Russian roulette
with the U.S. economy.   
   
It’s one thing to pay our debts already acquired.  It’s another to
require a supermajority to pay the debts already requ- — acquired.  It’s
not right.  
   
Let the Democrats vote to raise the debt ceiling this week without
obstruction or further delays.  Democrats in the House have already
passed a bill that would do that.  It’s sitting in the United States
Senate, where Democrats have the votes ready to pass it.  That’s the
only way to eliminate the uncertainty and risk that’s going to harm
American families and our economy.  
   
Let us vote and end the mess.   
   
You know, we’ve got to get this done.  We must get this done.  It is
like, as I said, playing Russian roulette to play these games.  We can
do it this week.  Just get out of the way and let us pass it.  
   
Thank you.  
   
Q    Mr. President, Senator Mitch McConnell says he has sent a letter to
you explaining his view.  Have you seen that letter?  Have you
communicated with him?  And how dire do you believe this is if action
doesn’t take place in the next few days?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  First of all, I did get a letter.  I got it 10 minutes
before I walked in here.  I’ve read it.  I plan on talking to Mitch
about it.  He and I have been down this road once before, back when I
was Vice President.  And I hope we can have some intelligent and honest
conversation about what he’s proposing.  
   
And I think the easiest way to do this — and if the Republicans would
not use the filibuster — would be to let us vote on what is already in
the Senate right now, passed by the House, to raise the debt limit.  And
we can do that in the next several days.  
   
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  You’ve often touted your experience in
the Senate — your 36 years in the Senate.  Your aides have talked about
your abilities to be a closer on deals involving legislation.  Why were
you unable, Mr. President, to close the deal with members of your own
party on key parts of your legislative agenda last week?  Thank you.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I was able to close the deal on 99 percent of my party. 
(Laughs.)  Two.  Two people.  That’s still underway.  I don’t think
there’s been a President who’s been able to close deals — has been in a
position where he has only 50 votes in the Senate and a bare majority in
the House.  This is a process.  This is a process.  We’ll get it done.  
   
Q    Mr. President, it sounds like you’re putting the blame squarely on
two U.S. senators for your inability to close that deal: Senator Sinema
and Senator Manchin.  Am I incorrect?  Is that who the blame lies
with?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Look, I need 50 votes in the Senate.  I have 48.  
   
Q    Mr. President, Leader Schumer has vowed not to raise the debt
ceiling through the reconciliation process.  So, ultimately, it —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Say that again.  I’m sorry.

Q    Leader Schumer has said he won’t raise the debt  
ceiling through the reconciliation process.  So, ultimately, if push
comes to shove, and Senator McConnell does not change his position, what
is more important: that position that Senator Schumer has, or raising
the debt ceiling?  
   
And then I also have a question for you on Ethiopia, if you would.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m going answer one — I’m not going to answer
Ethiopia.  Let’s stick on the debt so we don’t confuse the American
people.  
   
Number one, the issue of reconciliation, which is like code to the
American people — “What’s reconciliation?” — there is a process that I
understand the Republican leader is willing to initiate, go through,
that would require literally up to hundreds of votes.  It’s unlimited
number of votes having nothing directly to do with the debt limit; it
could be everything from Ethiopia to anything else that has nothing to
do with the debt limit.  And it’s fraught with all kinds of potential
danger for a miscalculation, and it would have to happen twice.   
   
So, you could literally have several hundred votes over the next number
of days.  Everything else would come to a standstill, but you still find
yourself in a situation where, at the end of the day, we may have passed
something that, in fact, then has to be undone again by either Democrats
or Republicans.  
   
It’s an incredibly complicated, cumbersome process, when there’s a very
simple process sitting out there.  Sitting at the desk in the United
States Senate is a bill passed by the House, saying, “We, Democrats,
will raise the debt limit, take responsibility for raising it, even
though we didn’t — some voted to acquire the debt as well.  We will go
ahead and do that.”  That’s the way to proceed.  
   
Q    But if it comes down to reconciliation or raising the debt ceiling,
which position would you take?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m not — I’m not going to cross that bridge until we
have to get there.  
   
Q    Can you address the allegations of genocide and why you haven’t yet
imposed those sanctions that you authorized two weeks ago, sir?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’ll speak to that later.

Q    Regarding your Build Back Better agenda, we know the  
topline figure from Senator Manchin is $1.5 trillion.  Senator Kyrsten
Sinema has yet to really give that number where she’s willing to go to
go or how high she’s willing to go.  But she says she’s negotiating in
good faith with the White House.  What is her figure?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’ll let her tell you that.  I don’t want to — we’re in
negotiations.  
   
     Q    Is it between 1.5 and 3.5?  Is it higher, at least, than the
1.5?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m not going to negotiate in public.  
   
Q    Sir — Mr. President, sir, how is what the Republicans are doing now
any different from when you opposed raising the debt limit as a senator
during the Bush years?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Because we weren’t calling for a filibuster.  We did —
not requiring 60 votes.  And it was a straight up-and-down vote.  
   
Q    Mr. President, just one — Mr. President, you’re talking about how
you have 48 Democratic votes right now.  The other two have been
pressured, over the weekend, by activists.  Joe Manchin had people on
kayaks show up to his boat to yell at him.  Senator Sinema, last night,
was chased into a restroom.  Do you think that those tactics are
crossing a line?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t think they’re appropriate tactics, but it
happens to everybody from the — the only people it doesn’t happen to are
people who have Secret Service standing around them.  So, it’s — it’s
part of the process.  
   
Yes, sir.  Go ahead.   
   
Q    And, Mr. President, just really quickly.  A lot of people have been
trying to attach immigration — immi- —  
   
Q    Mr. President, can you — I know you don’t want to comment on other
senators’ position in the negotiations, but what do you think the size
of the reconciliation package should be?  What specific dollar figure?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’ve laid out what I thought it should be.  It’s
not going to be that; it’s going to be less.  I mean, look, the
legislation — both the Build Back Better piece, as well as the
infrastructure piece — are things that I wrote.  These are — these
didn’t come from, God love them, Bernie Sanders or AOC or anybody else. 
I wrote them.  I disagreed with Medicare for All, for example.  I
disagreed — but I laid out what I thought would be important.  
   
For example, I think — from the Build Back Better program — it’s
required that we in fact have the best education available to us.  And
I’ll be speaking to this in detail tomorrow.   
   
But, look, here’s the situation: How can we, in an ever-competitive
world, increasingly competitive world — how can we not meet the
educational standards of — at least other countries are working toward? 
Nobody is reducing the number of years they want their children to go to
school or people to go school.   
   
You’ve heard me say it before, as my wife says: If we don’t — if any
country out-educates us, they’re going to outcompete us.  Look what
China is doing.  Look what the rest of the world is doing.  They’re
investing.   
   
They’re also investing in things that relate to ability for people to go
to work and stay at work.  We have several million women who can’t go
back to work because they don’t have any way to take care of their
children.   
   
So, to give a tax cut to a working mom to be able to afford daycare, is
that bad?  Is that a bad idea?  I think it’s a darn good idea.  It’ll
get people back to work.   
   
So, there’s a lot of things in the legislation I’m going to be talking
about across the country that I think the American people overwhelmingly
support.  But the idea that somehow this is somebody else’s legislation
— this is what I wrote.   
   
Q    But, sir, would you accept a $2 trillion — say, a $2 trillion
reconciliation bill?  Would that be acceptable to you?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Again, it — as you know, it’s not a smart thing to
negotiate with yourself in public.  Let’s see — we’re in the process of
continuing to talk to all the parties and see what we can get done.  
   
Q    Thank you so much, Mr. President.  Two questions.  First, you said
there was progress in the negotiation.  But today, you said you only
have 48 votes.  So, what is this progress?  
   
And another question on a foreign — an international news that was big
yesterday about the Pandora Papers.  Do you have any reaction?  You put
fight against corruption as the core —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  About what?  I’m sorry, I didn’t get the last part.  
   
Q    Pandora Papers.  The Pandora Papers.  You had said that you put
fight against corruption in the core of your national security policy. 
So, what is your reaction?  And do you plan to do anything about it?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  We’re looking at that right now.  And the first part of
your question was what?  
   
Q    Was about progress.  What does progress look like for you in the
negotiations?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Winning.  That’s the progress.  The last question, all
the way at the back.  
   
Q    Mr. President, you — I just want to be very clear: Can you
guarantee that the U.S. will not reach the debt ceiling, that that will
not happen?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, I can’t.  That’s up to Mitch McConnell.  
   
Q    So it is possible that the U.S. will not pay its debt?  That is po-
— that is a real possibility?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I can’t believe that that will be the end result because
the consequence is so dire.  I don’t believe that.  But can I guarantee
it?  If I could, I would, but I can’t.  
   
Thank you all very much.  Appreciate it.
