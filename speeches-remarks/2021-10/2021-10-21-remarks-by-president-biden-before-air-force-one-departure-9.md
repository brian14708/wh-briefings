Joint Base Andrews  
Prince George’s County, Maryland

(October 20, 2021)

Q    Will you reach a deal on the package before you leave for the
G20?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  You all never believed from the beginning I’d ever get
anything done.  I think we’ll get a deal.  
   
Q    Are you accepting losing — going from 12 years \[sic\] to 4 years
\[sic\] of paid family leave?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m not going to get into — like I wouldn’t be — if I
negotiated with you guys all along, I wouldn’t be as far along as I am. 
I’m hopeful.  I think we’ll get a good deal.  
   
Q    Are you concerned about Chinese hypersonic missiles?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  
   
END
