title: Remarks by President Biden on the Need to Raise the Debt Ceiling
---
 
South Court Auditorium  
Eisenhower Executive Office Building

1:05 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I want to thank — you can take these off while we’re
speaking.  I want to thank our participants that are here, as well as
those who are on Zoom.  And this is, to state the obvious, an important
get-together here.   
   
And I’m going to make some brief comments, maybe ask a few questions. 
And then we’ll yield and go down the road here and maybe we can — all of
us, both virtually as well as in person here — we can hopefully make
some progress.  
   
I want to thank the Secretary of Treasury, Secretary Yellen; Commerce
Secretary Raimondo — I see her on the screen there — it’s good to see
you; and the leaders of some of America’s most important businesses and
institutions, the American Association of Retired Persons — the AARP —
Bank of America, Citibank, Deloitte, Intel, JP Morgan, Nasdaq, the
National Association of Realtors, and Raytheon, and — for joining me
today to talk about the need to raise the debt limit.   
   
We haven’t failed to do that since our inception as a country.  We need
to act.  These leaders know the need to act.  
   
The United States pays its bill. It’s who we are. It’s who we’ve been.
It’s who we’re going to continue to be, God willing. That’s what’s
called the “full faith and credit of the United States.”  
   
Let’s be clear: Raising the debt limit is paying our old debts. It has
nothing to do with new spending or what may be coming this year or other
years. It has nothing to do with my plans on infrastructure or building
back better, both of which are paid for but they’re not even in — in the
queue right now.    
   
It’s about paying for what we owe and preventing a catastrophic event
occurring in our economy.  
   
I’m glad these leaders are here to talk about the real-world impact this
is going to have on people and on our position in the world.  
   
Today’s discussion won’t be partisan. It shouldn’t be. Raising the debt
limit is usually bipartisan.  
   
Let me speak for myself here: I want to be clear so the American people
understand what’s going on. There’s a Senate vote today to raise the
debt limit. Traditionally, it needs only 50 votes. I was — we were
informed by our Republican friends that they had to be all Democrat
votes; they weren’t going to help. I said, “Okay. We’ll provide 50
votes.”  
   
The definition — and the Democrats, we have the votes. The Democrats are
willing to step up and stop this economic catastrophe if Senate
Republicans will just get out of the way. But our Senate Republicans
friends are planning to block the vote to raise the dem- — the debt
limit by using a pro- — the procedural power called a “filibuster.”  
   
To say that in plain English, it means you have to have 60 votes when
there’s a filibuster. Sixty votes — a supermajority –- instead of fifty
to get anything done. It’s not right, and it’s dangerous.  
   
The reason we have to raise the debt limit is, in part, because of the
policies of the previous administration, which incurred nearly $8
trillion in bills in four years — some of which Democrats voted for —
more than a quarter of all the debt now outstanding.  
   
We had to raise the debt limit three times when Donald Trump was
President. And the Republicans moved to raise it each time, and each
time the Democrats supported the effort to raise the debt.  
   
But now Republicans won’t raise the debt limit despite being responsible
for what the debt limit — why it has to be raised for the bills that are
outstanding.  
   
They won’t raise it enough through — if they don’t, we’re going to be
defaulting on the debt that would lead to self-inflicted wounds that
risk the market tanking and wiping out retirement savings and costing
jobs.  
   
Defaulting on the debt, which Secretary Yellen said could happen at any
day after October the 18th — that’s when we run out of money — means
that Social Security benefits will stop, salaries to service members
will stop, benefits to veterans will stop, and much more.  
   
The failure to raise the debt limit will undermine the safety of the
United States Treasury securities; threaten the reserve status of the
dollar as the world currency and the — that the world relies on;
downgrade America’s credit rating; and result in a rise in interest
rates for families — talking about mortgages, auto loans, credit
cards.  
   
My friends — and they are — many are my friends — the Senate
Republicans’ position I find to be not only hypocritical, but dangerous
and a bit disgraceful, especially as we’re crawling our way out of a
pandemic that cost America 700,000 lives thus far, and we’re still
battling it. Our markets are rattled. America’s savings are on the line.
The American people — your savings, your pocketbook — are directly
impacted by this stunt. It doesn’t have to be this way.  
   
My Republican friends need to stop playing Russian roulette with the
U.S. economy. If they don’t want to do the job, just get out of the way.
We’ll take the heat. We’ll do it. We will do it. Let us do it. Let the
Democrats vote to raise the debt limit without obstruction or any
further delays.  
   
House Democrats have already passed the bill that would do that — raise
the debt limit and keep the government functioning. It’s sitting in the
United States Senate right now, where Democrats, with no help from
Republicans, have the votes today to pass the debt limit.  
   
The path Republicans offer would take us right to the brink and cause
irreparable economic damage, in my view. So, let’s vote and end this
mess today. That’s the only way to eliminate the uncertainty and risk
that will remain for American families and our economy if we don’t.  
   
Over more than 200 years, America has built this hard-earned reputation
of the strongest, safest, and most secure investment in the world. And
that’s why the United States is the financial rock the world looks to
and trusts.  
   
Now, in one cynical, destructive, partisan ploy — just for politics —
our Republican friends are teetering on the brink here. They’re
threatening to boot that all away. Now it’s a meteor headed to crash
into our economy. We should all want to stop it — stop it immediately.
This shouldn’t be partisan.  
   
And I’m thankful for the leaders who share the urgency on why — why we
need to act — and we act — need to act now. Many of them are here with
me. Not — not next week, now.    
   
I look forward to hearing from the — their perspectives and — and we’ll
now get the — get this meeting started, with my colleague’s
permission.  
   
I’d like to start off, if I may, with a question for Jane Fraser, the
CEO of Citi. And, by the way, congratulations on your award. You run one
of the largest banks in America. And what impacts are you seeing or do
you think you’ll see from this obstruction? What does it mean for the
small businesses and everyday people if we — if we renege on the debt
here?  
   
MS. FRASER: Thank you, Mr. President, for inviting us all to talk about
this critical issue. As the head of the bank, I don’t have insight on
what the right legislative solution is, but I can tell you that, from an
economic perspective, we need to resolve this issue very quickly.  
   
Every day of delay right now comes with an increase in price, as we’ve
begun to see in the markets already, starting last Friday.  
   
America certainly cannot default on the debt because the U.S. Treasury
market is the bedrock of our financial system domestically and globally,
and defaulting is going to cause lasting damage to the credibility of
the United States with investors and in financial markets around the
world.  
   
But as you say, the ramifications are not limited to the markets. It’s
already beginning to cause some damage in the economy. It will hurt
consumers. It will hurt small businesses.  
   
And it’s not an exaggeration to say that even small distortions in the
Treasury market can cost taxpayers tens of billions of dollars over many
years. Consumers can be burdened with higher borrowing costs very
quickly, whether they’re putting something on a credit card or they’re
getting a mortgage. And for the small businesses trying to recover from
the pandemic, this comes at a very critical time.  
   
So, we just can’t wait until the last minute to resolve this. We are
simply playing with fire right now, and our country has suffered so
greatly over the last two years. The human and economic cost of the
pandemic has been wrenching, and we don’t need a catastrophe of our own
making to undermine the progress that is underway.  
   
So, we really urge the administration and Congress to do what’s
necessary to resolve the situation for the good of our economy, for the
good of our country.  
   
Thank you, Mr. President.  
   
THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you. And you make a very good point that
we’re — God willing, I think we’re just about to begin to turn the
corner again on the pandemic. And an awful lot of small businesses —
tens of thousands of them — have acquired significant debt. We’ve
provided significant relief as well, but it’s just — it’s just an
incredibly complicated feature.  
   
I’d like now, with her permission — I’d like to ask Adena Friedman, the
CEO of NASDAQ, whether she’d be willing to give us her thoughts. And
thank you for taking the time, Ms. Friedman, to talk to us.  
   
MS. FRIEDMAN: Well, Mr. President, thank you very much for the
opportunity to address the current situation.  
   
We are starting to experience elevated volatility in the markets, which
can be partially attributed to the uncertainty that’s been introduced by
the delay in approving the extension of the debt limit. We would expect
that a continued delay in extending the debt limit would further
destabilize the markets.  
   
And when we consider the broader economic costs of the uncertainty and
certainly of possible default, we would, as Jane mentioned, see higher
borrowing costs for consumers and small businesses, as well as delays in
much-needed payments to major social programs, such as Social Security
and Medicare.  
   
So, when we look at this, these delays and certainly a default would
mean that hardworking Americans will ultimately bear the burden.  
   
So, as you mentioned, the — extending the debt limit simply allows the
payment of obligations that have already been made by the U.S.
government. Therefore, voting to extend the debt limit is an important
bipartisan action to reinforce the full faith and credit of the United
States. And we urge — we urge action as quickly as possible.  
   
So, thank you.  
   
THE PRESIDENT: Let me ask you the DEFCON 10 question: If we don’t — if
we default, even for a day or two, what do you think the impact on the
market will be?  
   
MS. FRIEDMAN: I think that we would expect that — and investors really
just don’t handle uncertainty well. And I think that investors and — and
certainly, as we know, there are hundreds of millions of investors that
are involved in the markets today that have put their hardworking —
their hard — their hard-earned savings into the markets, and we would
expect that the markets will react very, very negatively if we actually
get to a point of a DEFCON 10 type of situation with a default.  
   
THE PRESIDENT: What does that do to people’s retirement accounts?  
   
MS. FRIEDMAN: Yeah, I think we have to realize that well over half of
the adult Americans have money in the stock market, either directly or
indirectly. And so those savings accounts, those retirement accounts,
the pensions, they’ll all experience a significant, sharp drop in their
values, which of course makes them feel less certain about their ability
to manage their lives and their savings and plan for retirement.  
   
THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you. (Laughs.) I don’t mean to thank you for
the result, but thank you for explaining to people who are watching this
how consequential this is.  
   
You know, I see my old buddy Jamie Dimon up there at JP Morgan. Jamie —
excuse me for calling you Jaime — Mr. CEO, it’s good to see you.  
   
Why, from your perspective, do we need to raise the debt limit
immediately, before October 18th?  
   
MR. DIMON: Mr. President, thank you. You can call me Jamie. That’s
fine.  
   
THE PRESIDENT: You can call me Joe. It’s fine.  
   
MR. DIMON: And I appreciate you having us all here, Mr. President.  
   
Anyway, there are five quick points I want to make. Number one is really
a morality point: We all teach our children that we’re supposed to meet
our obligations. I don’t think the nation should be any different.  
   
Number two, we should never even get this close. There are huge economic
costs already being borne by companies and lawyers trying to figure out
what this means if something like this ever happens. It’s already
affecting the stock market, et cetera, as you’ve heard from some of the
folks here.  
   
Number three, we should get rid of the debt ceiling. We don’t need to
have this kind of brinkmanship every couple of years.  
   
Number four, an actual default — an actual default would be
unprecedented. We — the things we know that it would do are very bad.
And it could be potentially far worse. The effects would be cascading.
So, day one would be bad, but the cascading effects in the ensuing weeks
could go anywhere from a recession to a complete catastrophe for the
global economy. And I don’t know why anyone would take a chance like
that.  
   
And number five, America’s role in the world is essential. We are the
bedrock — the American Treasury is the bedrock. Our credibility, it —
we’re being watched right now by our allies and, unfortunately, our
enemies. Our credibility is absolutely essential. Trust in America and
the U.S. dollar and the financial system is critical to the world
economy and eventually, actually, world peace.  
   
So this is a time I think we should show American competence, not
American incompetence.  
   
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I’m glad you raised that last point, because when I
got back from the G7, and subsequently with a number of virtual meetings
with my colleagues and heads of state — I know Brian Moynihan knows
about this as well — we are not only being measured in terms of our
strength and our reliability, based upon the size of our military and/or
the physical strength that we possess, but it’s on whether or not we can
function.  
   
There’s a great debate going on — and I’m not exaggerating this; all of
you deal internationally. There’s a great debate going on on whether or
not, in the 21st century — in the second quarter of the 21st century —
can democracies function with things moving so rapidly.  
   
And I can tell you a couple of the folks I’ve had a lot of — spent a lot
of time with of late — Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi Jinping — they really
believe that autocracies are the only way forward, because they can act
quickly and decisively. It’s not a joke. And we’re seeing the effects of
this around the world.  
   
And I don’t know — it’s — it’s — I don’t know — it’s understandable why
the average American wouldn’t understand what the consequences of this
will be for American security and the willingness of other countries to
follow our lead.  
   
We have always led the world not just by the example of our power, but
the power of our example. And that’s going to be called into severe
question. I mean, for real. For real. And it has consequences that are
cons- — real.  
   
What does — you know, Jamie, what does “further delay” mean for a
company like yours and the family you serve, if we just — even if we
just go on right up to the brink?  
   
MR. DIMON: When we start on Monday, we’re going to start reviewing all
our contracts, repo, collateral requirements. There will be huge demands
of people selling treasuries, wanting financing to treasuries. Interest
rates will start going up. It will get worse as we get close to the
brink. And as you said, it’ll hurt not big companies — and we won’t —
don’t worry about that; we do worry about that it hurts the average
American, and we don’t want that.  
   
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I thank you. We’re going to get to everybody, but
I’m going to yield to the Director of the Office of Public Engagement,
former Chairman of the Black Caucus in Congress, Cedric Richmond.
Cedric.  
   
MR. RICHMOND: Thank you, Mr. President. I’ll just quickly yield to who —
your great Treasury Secretary, who is an expert on this, for comments on
what she thinks the ramifications are and where we’re headed.  
   
So, with that, Secretary Yellen.  
   
SECRETARY YELLEN: Thank you, Cedric. Thank you, Mr. President. And let
me thank the business and community leaders who have joined us here
today. I wish we could be meeting to discuss another topic: finding
solutions to climate change or how to better invest in the future of our
economy. But the urgency of the debt limit situation demands immediate
attention. And I want to be clear about my position.  
   
First, this is an urgent matter. It must be resolved immediately.
Treasury will exhaust its extraordinary measures if Congress has not
acted to raise or suspend the debt limit by October 18th.  
   
After that point, we expect Treasury would be left with very limited
cash that would be depleted quickly. And as we’ve seen in the past, and
as this group knows, even delaying action can cause harm to business and
consumer confidence, raise borrowing costs, disrupt financial markets,
and cause a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating.  
   
Second, let me be clear: This would be a catastrophic outcome. And this
catastrophe would occur on two dimensions. The first relates to the
financial system and macroeconomy.  
   
If Congress does not take action to raise the debt limit, Treasury’s
cash balance will reach an insufficient level to pay the nation’s bills
and American would default for the first time in history. And default
will call into question the full faith and credit of the United
States.  
   
Our country would likely face a financial crisis, causing interest rates
to rise quickly and restricting access to credit. Our fragile recovery
would be thrown into reverse. We would likely experience a recession,
millions of jobs would be lost, and the pain would endure well past the
resolution of the crisis.  
   
The second catastrophe would be borne by all the Americans who directly
receive any sort of payment from the federal government. Every Social
Security beneficiary, every family receiving a Child Tax Credit, every
military family waiting for a paycheck, or small-business owners
receiving a federal loan: They’re all at risk.  
   
Millions are without sufficient savings to forego an expected check. And
for these households and businesses, the impact would be devastating.  
   
To take one heartbreaking example, millions of seniors who depend on
Social Security for their support would have to make awful choices, such
as deciding whether to pay rent or buy groceries. And the same goes for
parents of young kids expecting a child tax payment.  
   
Hopefully it goes without saying: This is not only bad for people, it’s
equally devastating for American companies.  
   
For decades, our country has earned a reputation for being a welcoming
and a reliable place to do business. We respect the rule of law. We
honor our debts. And this reputation has benefitted us in many ways,
including the ability to keep interest rates low and for the dollar to
serve as the world’s reserve currency.  
   
Ultimately, these benefits have helped us lead in the world economy and
become a more prosperous nation. And yet, today, we are staring into a
catastrophe in which we surrender this hard-earned reputation and force
the American people and American industry to accept all the pain, the
turmoil, and the hardship that comes with default.  
   
It’s unnecessary, and it must be avoided at all costs. Congress must
address the debt limit immediately.  
   
Thanks. And I look forward to continued conversation.
