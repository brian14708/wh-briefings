THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you, Sultan, for bringing us together
today.  And I might say, it’s good to see you again.  We met when I was
a United States senator.  You would — we’ve established a relationship,
and it’s good to see you looking well and running this meeting.   
   
Brunei’s leadership has been vital to seeing ASEAN through a very
challenging year.  And it is my hope that in the future we’ll be able to
hold these meetings in person again, because the relationship between
the United States and ASEAN is vital — vital for the future of all one
billion of our people.   
   
Our partnership is essential in maintaining a free and open
Indo-Pacific, which has been the foundation of our shared security and
prosperity for many decades.  And the United States strongly supports
the ASEAN Outlook and the Indo-Pacific — on the Indo-Pacific and the
rules-based regional order.    
   
Our continued cooperation is only growing more important — not less —
more important as we strive together to meet the challenges that are
going to shape the 21st century moving forward: tackling the COVID-19
pandemic, taking on the climate crisis, strengthening our cyber
defenses, and producing new technologies, upholding freedom of the seas
and commerce, and so much more.  So much more.    
   
So I’m looking forward to hearing from each of you and to our discussion
today, but I want you all to hear directly from me the importance the
United States places on our relationship with ASEAN.  
   
You can expect to see us showing up as Vice President Harris did with
her recent trip to the region.  You can expect to see me personally
showing up and reaching out to you.  
   
You can expect to see the United States deepening our longstanding
cooperation, pursuing new avenues of ministerial dialogue, investing in
our countries, and driving inclusive prosperity in this critical
region.  
   
In fact, we intend to launch a new program and initiatives to enhance
our cooperation across the range of issues totaling more than $100
million.  
   
Our bottom line is that ASEAN is essential, I want to say — it is
essential to the regional architecture of the Indo-Pacific.  And the
United States is committed to ASEAN’s centrality.  You know, it’s a
linchpin.  It’s a linchpin for maintaining the resilience, the
prosperity, and security of our shared region.  
   
And I want you to know I’m looking forward to working with you to
advance not only our many shared interests, but our shared values and
shared vision for a region where every country can compete and succeed
on a level playing field and all nations, no matter how big or powerful,
abide by the law.  
   
So I want to thank you all for this opportunity.  And I look forward to
this being the first of many meetings.
