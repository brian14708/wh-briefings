THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. I’ve just been briefed by my COVID-19
team on the progress we’re making in our fight against the virus.  
   
Today, I want to provide a brief update on my plan that I announced in
early September to accelerate the path out of the pandemic.  
   
It’s working. We’re making progress.  
   
Nationally, daily cases are down 47 percent; hospitalizations are down
38 percent over the past six weeks.  
   
Over the past two weeks, most of the country has improved as well. Case
rates are declining in 39 states and hospital rates are declining in 38
states.  
   
We’re down to 66 million — it’s still an unacceptably high number — of
unvaccinated people from almost 100 million in July.  
   
That’s important. It’s important progress. But it’s not — now is not the
time to let up. We have a lot more to do. We’re in a very critical
period as we work to turn the corner  
on COVID-19.  
   
First, we have to do more to vaccinate the 66 million unvaccinated
people in America. It’s essential. The vaccine requirements that we
started rolling out in the summer are working. They’re working.  
   
The Labor Department is going to soon be issuing an emergency rule for
companies with 100 or more employees to implement vaccination
requirements in their — among their workforce.  
   
Every day, we see more businesses implementing vaccination requirements,
and the mounting data that shows they work.  
   
Businesses and organizations that are implementing requirements are
seeing their vaccination rates rise by an average of 20 percent or more
to well over 90 percent — the number of employees vaccinated.  
   
Let’s be clear: Vaccination requirements should not be another issue
that divides us. That’s why we continue to battle the misinformation
that’s out there, and companies and communities are setting up their —
stepping up as well to combat these — the misinformation.  
   
Southwest Airlines at — the head of the pilot — the head of the pilot’s
union and its CEO dismissed critics who claim vaccination mandates
contributed to flight disruptions. School board members, religious
leaders, and doctors across the country are fighting misinformation and
educating people about the importance of vaccines.  
   
All of these efforts are going to help us continue moving the dial to
eliminate this disease.  
   
Second, we’re going to continue protecting the vaccinated.  
   
This work — this week, the Food and Drug Administration and — the FDA is
reviewing the data on Moderna and Johnson & Johnson boosters. We expect
a final decision from the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention -– the CDC –- in the next couple of weeks.  
   
If they authorize the boosters, which will be strictly made based on the
science — that decision will be based on the science — this will mean
all three vaccines will be available for boosters.  
   
Already, more than 1 out of 3 eligible seniors have gotten their third
shot — the booster. And we’re going to continue to provide that
additional protection to seniors and others as we — as we head into the
holidays. 

These boosters are free. I’ll say it again: They’re free, available, and
convenient to get.  
   
Third point I’d like to make: We need to continue to keep our schools
and our students safe. Ninety-six percent of school districts are fully
open with children back in the classroom and — for in-person learning.  
   
We have been able to do this because we’ve provided our schools the
resources they need to protect children and the educators, as well as
the staff that works in the schools.  
   
We’ve been encouraging schools to implement important health measures
like masking, testing, and getting everyone vaccinated who is eligible
to be vaccinated.  
   
Now, I know parents out there are anxiously waiting for a vaccine for
children ages 5 to 11. The good news is the FDA and outside experts from
the CDC are set to make its determination as to whether the vaccine will
be authorized for that age range in the next few weeks.  
   
If authorized, we are ready. We have purchased enough vaccines for all
children between the ages of 5 and 11 in the United States. It will be —
it will be convenient for parents to get their children vaccinated at
trusted locations, and families will be able to sleep easier at night
knowing their kids are protected as well.  
   
Let me close with this: The plan I laid out in September is working.
We’re headed in the right direction. We have critical work to do, but we
can’t let up now.  
   
My team and I are doing everything we can. But I’m calling on more
businesses to step up. I’m calling on more parents to get their children
vaccinated when they are eligible. And I’m asking everyone — everyone
who hasn’t gotten vaccinated: Please get vaccinated.  
   
That’s how we put this pandemic behind us and accelerate our economic
recovery. We can do this.  
   
I’ve said many times: God bless you all, and may God protect our
troops.  
   
Thank you very much.
