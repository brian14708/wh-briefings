PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, Mr. President, it’s great to see you again. 
We’ve known each other for a long time.  You are painstakingly building
a Iraqi democracy, and it’s moving.   
   
And I just want the press to know and you to know: We want to be as
helpful as we can in doing that.  We have great resources and assets. 
And putting those together, it’ll make a big difference for the
region.    
   
PRIME MINISTER AL-KADHIMI:  (As interpreted.)  Thank you, Mr.
President.  We consider our ties with the United States as one of
friendship, a strategic relationship.   
   
We work to implement all the articles of the Strategic Framework
Agreement between Iraq and the United States regarding economic
cooperation, cultural cooperation, educational, and also security
cooperation and fighting terrorist organizations and ISIS.  
   
I’m thankful for the United States, for all of the support that it
provided to the — to Iraq throughout this war.  And we seek even better
relations.
