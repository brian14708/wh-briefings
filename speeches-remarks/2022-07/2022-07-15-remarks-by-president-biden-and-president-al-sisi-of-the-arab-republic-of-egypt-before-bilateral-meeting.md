PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, Mr. President, welcome.  It’s good to see you. 

PRESIDENT AL SISI:  Thank you.

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  I’d like to start by thanking you for the incredible
assistance you have provided in bringing the Gaza matter to a — to an
end.  I know there is a lot of work to be done, but you were — you were
extremely, extremely helpful. 

And I’m looking forward to working with you on a lot of other things.  I
think, at least from the U.S. perspective, there is a great deal of
merit in us working more closely together.  You’re a valuable, valuable
friend.  

So I’m looking forward to talking with you about a whole range of
issues.  Again, thank you for being here.

PRESIDENT AL SISI:  (As interpreted.)  Allow me, Mr. President, to thank
you very much for this opportunity and to stress the strategic
relationship.  And we’re standing ready to take it to a whole new level
on all fronts.  12:16 P.M. AST
