Richmond, VA

We’re here in Richmond because the President and I—and the entire
Administration—care about this community. We care about your families
and we want to make sure that everyone has the information they need to
stay safe. So, I want to speak to the moms and dads for just a moment. 

You know, when you become a parent, there’s a moment that we all go
through: You look at that baby, with eyes like saucers and the tiniest
fingers. And you feel an overwhelming sense of love, deep in your bones,
and absolute terror. 

Because you know that this fragile life is depending on you. And from
that moment on, you see dangers that you never even noticed before. 

So, we buy baby gates and cover our electrical outlets. We wrestle them
into car seats no matter how much they complain. We make them eat their
vegetables and slather them in sunscreen while they fight us with the
strength of a linebacker! And after bedtime, when we’re exhausted from
the day, we carefully close their bedroom door and feel a pang of
gratitude. 

Because in that rare quiet, we know that everything is OK. That they are
healthy and growing—that we are OK. 

Parents, we do absolutely everything to protect our kids. And in this
pandemic, you did. 

Many of you had to go through birth without your own parents there to
help you recover. You had to quarantine with your newborn and without
the friends and neighbors who could come over and give you a few hours
to yourself. You wrestled tiny masks onto children who couldn’t
understand them; you weighed the risk of going to crowded areas or
traveling to see loved ones.

And you waited. You waited to feel the same relief you saw in families
of older children.  

I know it’s been hard. But you’ve done an amazing job. You’ve protected
your baby and carried your family through this. 

And now, that relief is finally here: a vaccine for our youngest
children. 

It’s been thoroughly reviewed and rigorously tested. It’s safe and
effective. It’s free. And it’s available for every child in this
country, as young as six months old.  

Now, even though so many parents have been waiting for this day, I know
you may have questions. So talk to your pediatrician. Get the answers
that you need. 

And if you decide that this vaccine is right for your child, go to
vaccines.gov to find a vaccine site near you. 

Parents, this is your choice—and we want you to have all of the
information you need to make it.

Parenthood and worrying go hand-in-hand. And I can’t promise you that
the dangers of the world are going to become any less frightening—just
wait until your kids start driving! 

But with this vaccine, we can take away at least one of those worries. 

From the day your sweet, fragile, little baby was born, you have made
the choice, again and again, to keep your child safe. This is your
choice too. So, make the decision to protect your children with the same
vaccine that has already saved millions of lives. Because nothing is
more important than our children’s health. 

It’s up to us to keep them safe—and with this vaccine, we can. 

Thank you.
