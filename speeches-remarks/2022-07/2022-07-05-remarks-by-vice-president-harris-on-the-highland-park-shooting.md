*Highland Park, Illinois*

7:18 P.M. CDT  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, to the community of Highland Park: I bring
you condolences from President Joe Biden and from our country.  I’m so
sorry for what you all have experienced and the pain, the suffering. 
This should never have happened.  We talk about it being senseless; it
is senseless.  It is absolutely senseless.   
   
I want for you that you hold each other tight as a community, that you
know that you have a whole nation who cares deeply about you and stands
with you.  This is a — an incredibly tight community.  I know that.  And
this person will be brought to justice, but it’s not going to undo what
happened.  
   
And we — we’re here for you, and we stand with you.  And of course, as
we always say — because it is true — our prayers are with you.   
   
The President and I and our administration have put all of the resources
and will continue to put all of the resources that the Mayor and the
Chief and others need in terms of the federal assistance.  So the FBI
and the ATF are here.  
   
There’s a lot of healing that’s going to have to happen that is both
physical and emotional.  There is no question that this experience is
something that is going to linger in terms of the trauma.  And so, I’d
like to urge all the families and all the individuals to do seek the
support that you so rightly deserve.   
   
And — and we’ll deal with what we need to deal with in terms of also, as
we move forward, all agreeing that we’ve got to be smarter as a country
in terms of who has access to what and, in particular, assault weapons. 
And we got to take this stuff seriously, as seriously as you are —
because you have been forced to have to take it seriously.   
   
The whole nation should understand and have a level of empathy to
understand that this can happen anywhere, in any peace-loving
community.  And we should stand together and speak out about why it’s
got to stop.  
   
Thank you.
