*Private Residence  
Water Mill, New York*

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Hi, everyone.  Good evening.  Good
evening, everyone.  It is so good to see so many friends and new friends
and young leaders.   
   
So, Karen and Dennis, thank you both for doing this.  And where is
Dennis?  And —  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  He’s (inaudible).  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yeah?  I bring them greetings also from our
President, Joe Biden, who I was just talking with a little while ago. 
But thank you both for just —  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Don’t we look alike?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, there you go.  (Laughter.)   
   
But you all have been really extraordinary in terms of the way that you
continue to just put yourselves out there to keep giving, to support the
work that I think we all care about, which is why we’re all here
together.  So, thank you all very much.   
   
I spent today — I just arrived here from Brooklyn.  I was in Brooklyn
today, in Bed-Stuy, because there’s some work that we’ve been doing —
that our administration has been doing.  I’m building off of some work I
did during my years at the Senate that is about access to capital for
folks who have traditionally not had the relationships that allow them
to fuel their ambitions, to fuel their innovation, and to allow us then
as a nation to really take advantage of the incredible capacity that we
have in all communities.   
   
And so I was there talking about the work that we’ve done to put
billions of dollars as an administration into CDFIs, which are
essentially community banks, to spur the innovation that comes from our
small businesses.   
   
And when I think about today as an example of the work that we have been
doing — and some of us were talking about it earlier — it is the work
that recognizes with clear eyes the challenges that we face as a nation,
but also the work that is absolutely fueled by our optimism about the
incredible nation in which we live and the nation we love, and what we
all have an ability and a responsibility to do to contribute to the best
of who we are.   
   
And so that is some of the work that I’ve been doing recently and just
today.  But I will say as a — here as a — as a discussion about what and
who we are as Democrats that I think we have a lot to talk about.  So
let’s do that.  (Laughs.)  
   
I have a saying, which is that: I think when you know what you stand
for, then you know what to fight for.  And so when I think about who we
are as Democrats, I know that we stand for very noble and important
principles — the principles upon which our nation was founded.   
   
Recently, I find myself, after the Dobbs decision, talking a lot about
one of those important principles — that principle being freedom. 
Freedom.  And the freedom individuals should have and we should
guarantee for them to make decisions about their lives and their family
and their future.   
   
Liberty.  The importance of being able to enjoy the liberties that
should be guaranteed by our nation, by its laws, and that we should, as
a civil society, protect and defend for each other.   
   
These are some of the issues that I think are, right now, front and
center, in terms of also the challenges we face as a nation.  When we
look at attacks on a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body;
when we are looking increasingly at attacks against our LGBTQ community,
and the rights of individuals in that community to love who they love,
marry who they love; when we look at a tax on voting rights in America,
and the right all people who are entitled legally to vote — that they
should have then to actually have access to the polls and the ballot.   
   
This is the context in which we exist right now.  And so the challenges
are many.  But I know that we as Democrats stand for the idea that we
will fight for these principles always, understanding that when we think
about our democracy, we know that there is great strength in a
democracy.   
   
But the duality of it all is that while there is strength, it coexists
with a definite amount of fragility, meaning that if we don’t fight to
preserve and sustain it, it can perish.  And so therein lies the
coexistence between the strength of what we fight for, but also
understanding if we are not vigilant, if we take any of it for granted,
it may go away.   
   
So that’s how I think about this moment in terms of where we are in a
country — as a country, in terms of what we must do together,
collectively to stand for the principles on which we were founded and to
fight for the best of who we are.   
   
And so, our administration, as you know, has been doing a lot of work
based on those principles, based on what Democrats stand for in saying
that we should prioritize the children of our nation because if we are
to be strong, currently and in our future, we must focus as a priority
on the children, which is why our administration fought for an extension
of the Child Tax Credit, for example.  Where, in the first year of our
administration alone, we reduced child poverty in America by over 40
percent.  We fought for a tax cut for families raising children wherein
for the cost of clothing and food and medication and school supplies,
working families would get a tax cut of up to $8,000.  Because we know
that families need that support to do the work they naturally want to do
but often struggle to do: to take care of their children.   
   
We believe that all communities should be able to exist in a way that
they live without fear, including not only our children, but our seniors
and everyone in between.   
   
It was a tragedy when — we all witnessed what happened — for example, in
Buffalo, New York.  I attended with my husband, Doug, the funeral of an
86-year-old grandmother, who was simply going to buy groceries after a
day spent with her husband, who is in a nursing facility.  And a whole
community was terrorized.   
   
I was looking at what we are facing, in terms of our nation, where our
children are so afraid to go to school, and they are learning drills in
case there is a mass shooter.  And over and over again, this happens:
Uvalde being just the latest example.   
   
And so we stand for the principle that we need still reasonable gun
safety laws.  We support the Second Amendment.  But when it comes to an
issue like assault weapons on the streets of America, we must be
practical and understanding that if we value the freedom to live in a
safe community without fear, this is an issue we must confront and we
must resolve, and have the courage to do it.   
   
And so the President has signed an executive order that relates to what
we should do around smart gun safety law, but we stand also for the
principle that we need an assault weapons ban.  Because we understand
that the very design of an assault weapon is to kill a lot of human
beings quickly.   
   
We stand for the principle that all people should be able to live and
love without government interference, which is why we stand with members
of Congress who have been fighting to codify those rights out of fear
that Clarence Thomas — said the quiet part out loud in the Dobbs
decision — when he then wrote, as a concurrence, that all of these other
issues may be up for debate.  
   
There is so much at stake in our country right now.  You know, I’ve been
traveling the world.  I’ve met with and had conversations with — my team
tells me — at least 100 conversations with presidents, prime ministers,
and kings about who we are as a nation.  And when we have these
conversations — historically, we, as America, have been able to walk in
these rooms, chin up, shoulders back as a representative of what we have
rightly considered ourselves to be, which is the greatest democracy in
the world.  And within that authority, we engage and encourage
conversations about the importance of human rights, civil rights, rule
of law.   
   
Understand, when these issues are being attacked in our own country, it
not only affects individual rights, it affects our standing in the
world.   
   
I’ll tell you, the first bilateral meeting that I hosted at, now, my
residence — at the official residence of the Vice President — was early
in our administration when I invited then-Chancellor Angela Merkel to
have breakfast with me.  We had a wonderful conversation, extensive
conversation.  We talked about Russia.  We talked about China.  We
talked about a number of things.  
   
And then she looked at me from across the table, and she said, “What is
going on with voting in your country?  It seems there are attacks on
voting.”  Because you see, when you hold yourself out as a role model —
we all know this in our personal lives — it means people watch what you
do, often to assess whether it connects with what you say.   
   
So here we are in a situation where those things that we thought were
settled are increasingly unsettled.  And this has profound ramifications
for the stability of our own nation, much less our standing in the
world.   
   
So, I’ll now bring it back to what we’re doing this evening.  Elections
matter.  Elections matter.  Who is President matters.   
   
When we have a President of the United States, for example, who said,
“I’m going to work in a way that is fueled by a sense of bipartisanship
when it is possible,” and then is responsible for one of the most
significant infrastructure laws being passed in our nation.  Elections
matter.  Because he cared — we care about doing the heavy lifting of
paying attention to the detail of what makes a nation function.   
   
Elections matter when we have a President of the United States who says,
“Well, in 2013, the Court put a real harm in the Voting Rights Act with
a case called Shelby v. Holder, but yes, we need to pass the John Lewis
Voting Rights Act.  And, “Okay, if we don’t have enough Republicans
supporting it” — of which none did — “the Freedom to Vote Act, the John
Lewis Voting Rights Act,” then our President says, “I will not let the
filibuster stand in the way to see that through.”  Elections matter.  He
said the same thing about the Women’s Health Act.   
   
Elections matter in terms of who is in Congress.  We need two more
senators.  We need two more senators to see these things through. 
Elections matter.   
   
I’ve been traveling the country convening state legislators on this
issue of the Dobbs decision, which obviously overturned Roe v. Wade. 
Because now, since the Supreme Court said, “Oh, we’re going to send it
to the states.  The states now get to make decisions,” state legislators
matter.   
   
I’ve been traveling to states where the legislature are majority
Republican, but there’s a Democrat as governor.  My friend Roy Cooper,
the Governor of North Carolina, is an example of this.  Where he has the
courage to say, “No, I’m going to veto,” but he’s concerned about
whether he’ll have a veto-proof majority.   
   
Elections matter.  When I go to a place like Pennsylvania and there’s a
governor’s race happening right now.  Josh Shapiro, I think, is an
outstanding candidate and a friend, and he will stand.   
   
Elections matter.  You go to New Jersey.  Well, they’ve got Democrats in
the legislature and a governor, but New Jersey is thinking of itself,
rightly, as an oasis in that geographic region because of the challenges
and the attacks in neighboring states.  Elections matter.   
   
Many of you know I started my elected career as the elected District
Attorney of the City and County of San Francisco.  Well, across our
country, there are states that are criminalizing public health
professionals’ positions — doctors.  Who is the county prosecutor will
matter in terms of who’s going to take up those cases.   
   
So, we are here today, as Democrats, joined by, I know, a common belief
in the strength and beauty of our country, joined by an understanding
that we can take nothing in our country for granted.  We must always be
vigilant and stand in defense of the best of who we are.  And we are
joined with a sense of optimism, knowing we are fighting for something
and not against something.  
   
And so that’s how I think of this moment, in terms of just where we are
and what is at stake.   
   
But I will tell you, traveling our country, I am meeting some
extraordinary people that I’ve never met.  You know, it’s good to get
out of D.C.  (Laughs.)  Extraordinary people who you all are supporting
with the work you were doing this evening, not to mention the folks who
are fighting the good fight in D.C.  
   
So, let’s continue to do this work.  It matters.  We see the results. 
And we can take nothing for granted, we know.  But we’re up for it. 
We’re up for doing the hard work of defending all that we hold dear.   
   
So, with that, I thank everyone very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)
