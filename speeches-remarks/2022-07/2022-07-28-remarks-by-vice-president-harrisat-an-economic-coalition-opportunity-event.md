*Restoration Plaza  
*Brooklyn, New York**

3:15 P.M. EDT  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Hello.  Good afternoon.  Good afternoon, everyone. 
Good afternoon.  Please have a seat.  Have a seat.  Blondel, it has been
so wonderful to be with you this afternoon.  Where are you?  I think he
walked.  (Laughter.)   
   
So I’ve just so thoroughly enjoyed this visit, and it’s good to be back
in Brooklyn but to be with these extraordinary leaders.  And you’ve
heard from the Deputy Secretary, from the Administrator, from the
Lieutenant Governor.  
   
This really is a model.  What you are doing here, what this community is
doing is really a model of — of the capacity of our nation.  And I am
here to celebrate what has occurred here and what continues to happen
here, but to also lift it up, to show folks around our country what is
possible when you bring folks together from all sectors who understand
the capacity of communities, the talent of communities that is there and
just requires a little support.  It’s not that we’re creating it in the
community; it already exists.  
  
So this is about giving access to all the support that a lot of other
communities may otherwise take for granted in a way that we can actually
build the strength of our nation.  So I am thrilled to be here with
everyone.  
   
Before I begin my — my words, in terms of more detail about our visit
today, I do want to say something about the GDP report that came out
today.  
  
After a year of record growth, our economy is slowing down, but our
nation’s economic outlook remains strong.  
   
Today, we have near record-low unemployment, we have a strong job
market, and consumer spending is continuing to grow.  
   
That said, we know there is still more work to be done.  Inflation is
still too high, and lowering costs remain a top priority of our
administration.  
   
The agreement reached yesterday between Leader Schumer of New York and
Senator Manchin is a major step forward in our fight against
inflation.  
   
When passed, this landmark legislation, we believe and are convinced,
will lower health insurance costs by an average of $800 a year for 13
million Americans.  
   
It will also reduce the cost of prescription drugs, reduce the deficit,
address the climate crisis, and create jobs.  
   
In addition, yesterday, the Senate passed — and I just got word the
House just passed — (applause) — just happened — legislation to boost
the production of American-made, American-manufactured semiconductor
chips.  (Applause.)  It’s really important.  You know, until we — some
of us, until we experienced the pandemic, we didn’t realize how much we
rely on semiconductor chips and that supply chain of them for so many of
our basic needs.  
  
So this legislation and what it will produce will bring down the cost of
— of cell phones and computers and cars.  So it will have a profound
impact.  And we are excited that these pieces of legislation have now
been passed through both the Senate and the House.  
  
And in the meantime, of course, while that is going through its process,
our administration remains focused on additional efforts to build a
strong economy — an economy that works for all people.   
   
And that’s why we are here today, gathered with leaders from our
administration — as I mentioned, the Administrator of our Small Business
Administration, Isabel Guzman, who I’ve traveled the country with and I
think you for your work; our Deputy Secretary of the Department of
Commerce, Don Graves, who is just an extraordinary leader, so talented
and experienced.  We’re — we’re lucky that you have decided to come back
to private — I mean, to public service.  (Laughter.)  
   
And we are joined by leaders of this great city and state, including, of
course, the great mayor, Eric Adams, who is here and has been doing
extraordinary work.  There he is.  
   
I thank you, Mayor Adams.  We have met and convened and talked about
your leadership here in New York, in Washington D.C., and the White
House, and in many other places.  And so I send you best from the
President.  
  
And Lieutenant Governor Antonio Delgado, who is here, who I knew from
his work in Congress and now he is a leader of this state, and really is
one of the shining, bright stars of our nation.  So, Lieutenant
Governor, I’m glad to be with you this afternoon.  
  
And to all the community and corporate leaders who are here — because
this gets me to what we’re about to talk about, which is why we are here
and the occasion for this visit.  
  
America is a nation powered by the ambition and the aspiration of her
people.  The ambition and the aspiration to turn dreams into reality,
including the aspiration and dream to start a business, to own a home,
to get an education.  
   
That is the energy and the ambition that has always been a driver of
America moving forward.  It creates jobs, it sparks innovation, it
expands the economy, and it makes our nation more competitive.  
  
But achieving that success requires a number of very specific things. 
And in particular, it requires access to capital.  For what?  Well, for
example, to buy inventory, to make a down payment, to hire employees. 
And it requires access to financial services — services like checking
and savings accounts, home and auto loans, financial education and
advice.  
   
And what we know is not everyone in our nation has equal access to this
essential support.  
   
Consider, for example: In our nation, Black entrepreneurs are three
times more likely to report they did not apply for a loan for fear of
being turned away by a bank.  That fear being based on the stories and
the experiences of their family, friends, and neighbors.   
   
Black and Latino homeowners are rejected by tri- — traditional financial
institutions at a higher rate when applying for home loans.  And this is
the case even when they have credit profiles that are similar to other
applicants.  
   
For many Asian American business owners, in particular immigrant
business owners, language barriers limit their ability to access capital
and banking services.  
   
And people who live in rural communities, including many Native
Americans, often lack access to traditional financial services of any
kind.  
   
So, like many of you here today, I have worked for years to address
these disparities.  In fact, one of the last bits of work that I did
when I was in the United States Senate was to team up with Leader Chuck
Schumer, Senator Mark Warner, Senator Cory Booker, and Chairwoman Maxine
Waters to invest $12 billion in community lenders.  Community lenders:
financial institutions that predominantly serve overlooked and
underserved communities.  
   
These institutions provide loans for small businesses and start-ups;
investments in community facilities, like recreation centers and grocery
stores; and funds to preserve and create affordable housing.  
   
Community lenders are uniquely positioned to fill the gaps that
traditional banks either cannot or will not address.  
   
The folks who run these institutions — many of whom I’ve met and some of
who are here — often work and live in the very community that they
serve.  They see clearly their community’s needs and its challenges. 
They understand their community.   
   
And they also then see their community’s strengths and its
opportunities.  And when they make a loan, they then see firsthand the
positive impact of that loan.   
   
Over the years, I have consulted with some of the most active community
lenders in our nation, including Marla Bilonick, who serves Latino
communities in Washington, D.C., and Bill Bynum, who I visited earlier
this year in rural Mississippi — both of whom are here with us today.  
   
I have spoken with business owners these lenders fund, and so many
others, and have seen firsthand the life-changing impact of the
investments they make.  And I’ve also seen how much more work remains to
be done.   
   
There are still far too many people in our nation who do not have access
to the capital and to the financial services they need to thrive.  
   
And I believe, given the breadth of the financial disparities in our
nation, the public and the private sector must join forces to take on
these challenges.  
   
Just consider our capacity when we combine the expertise and the
experience of the private sector with the reach and the scale that only
the government can provide.  
   
So, today, we gather to do just that.  Today, over 20 private sector
organizations — from some of the largest consumer banks and investment
firms, to technology companies and philanthropy — are joining with our
administration to take action to increase opportunity and to build
wealth in historically underserved communities.  
   
Together, these organizations, with us, will invest tens of billions of
dollars to provide capital to community lenders; to support
entrepreneurship, in particular for women-owned and minority-owned
businesses; and to expand access to financial services; and create
affordable housing and protect affordable housing.  
   
In the coming months, our administration will work closely with all
members of this coalition to make sure that we are maximizing the impact
of every dollar that is spent.  Because we do recognize that when we
create opportunity in communities that have been left out and left
behind, our entire nation benefits.  
      
You know, these days, we talk a lot about the economy.  Well, let us
understand: We all do better as a nation when all our communities do
better.  It’s that old saying about “the rising tide lifts all ships.” 
And so that is the spirit with which we do this work.   
   
And today we have gathered in a neighborhood that is living proof of the
power of this approach.   
   
By the mid-1960s — I know most of you here know this story, but I’ll
share it with the folks who are new.  By the mid-1960s, Bed-Stuy was
facing tremendous challenges.  Decades of discriminatory lending
practices had drained the capital and the opportunity from this
neighborhood.  
   
And so, to address these challenges, leaders of Bed-Stuy –great leaders
like our dearly departed Al Vann, who passed away just two weeks ago; I
was speaking with the — General James about that — these leaders came
together with national leaders and decided to try something new.   
   
In 1967, they founded the Bed-Stuy Restoration Corporation.  It — now,
this is part of why I’m here: It was our nation’s first public-private
community development corporation.  (Applause.)  That’s right.  That’s
right.  And they’re — and because of its success, it remains not only
the first, but a model for all the rest.  
   
For 55 years, Restoration has helped to unlock the potential of this
beautiful community by providing job placement for over 24,000 young
people and adults; by investing $60 million in mortgage financing for
homeowners; and by attracting more than $500 million in investments for
this community.  
   
All across our nation, there are places like Bed-Stuy — reservoirs of
ambition and aspiration just waiting to be tapped.  
   
The mission of our coalition and the mission of our administration is to
match potential with opportunity in every community across our nation.  
   
So with that, I thank you all for all you have done and will continue to
do to continue to make us strong as a nation and help us realize our
promise and our potential.  
   
God bless you all, and God bless America.  Thank you.  (Applause.)
