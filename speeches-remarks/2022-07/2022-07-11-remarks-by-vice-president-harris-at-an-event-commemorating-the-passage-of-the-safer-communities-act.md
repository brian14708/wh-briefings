     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.   
   
Thank you, Dr. Guerrero, for the introduction and for your courage and
your compassion.  You have been such a source of strength to the
families of Uvalde, and I know that is not without personal sacrifice. 
Thank you for your leadership.  (Applause.)  
   
To our President, Joe Biden; members of Congress — (applause); members
of our administration; friends and fellow Americans: Today is indeed an
historic day.   
   
For 30 years, our nation has failed to pass meaningful gun violence
legislation.  Again and again, the American people have called for
commonsense action to protect our communities.   
   
 Last month, their call was finally answered when President Joe Biden
signed the bipartisan Safer Communities Act.  (Applause.)  
   
Because of our President’s leadership and because of so many of you, we
have passed a law that will make communities around our nation safer.  
   
For my whole career, addressing gun violence has been one of my top
priorities.  First, as a courtroom prosecutor.  Then as District
Attorney of San Francisco, where we created a gun specialist unit to go
after violent offenders.  Then, of course, as Attorney General, where
our office worked closely with the California Bureau of Firearms to
investigate and seize firearms from those who unlawfully possessed
them.  As a United States senator, together with my former colleagues in
the Senate, we supported various pieces of legislation to address this
crisis.   
   
So, I knew and I know now, as so many of you do, that we are overdue in
getting this work done.  And I know it will save lives.   
   
Together, we gather with many of the leaders who made this law a
reality.  To the friends and family members of the victims of gun
violence: In the face of so much pain, you have shown incredible
strength, and it is a profound honor to stand with you today.   
   
To the members of Congress who are here with us: In the face of so much
pessimism, you passed a bipartisan law.  You worked across the aisle,
and the product of that work will make our communities safer.  And that
deserves applause.  (Applause.)  
   
But as all of us know, gathered here today, we would not be here were it
not for the vision, the courage, the unwavering determination of one
particular individual: Joe Biden.  (Applause.)  
   
Our President, Joe Biden, has fought for decades to end the terror of
gun violence.  He has taken on the gun lobby and won.  As a senator, Joe
helped pass — then I would have called him “Joe”; now I call “Mr.
President” — (laughter) — the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act —
(applause) — which, as we know, is a background check system that has
prevented more than 3 million firearms from falling into dangerous
hands.  (Applause.)   
   
And he passed a 10-year ban on assault weapons and high-capacity
magazines.  (Applause.)  
   
As Vice President, Joe Biden led the Obama-Biden administration’s
efforts to reduce gun violence.   
   
President Joe Biden knows the tremendous pain of gun violence.  He has
seen it up close.  He has held hands with parents who lost children and
with children who lost parents.   
   
President Biden knows the urgency of this fight, and he will continue to
do all in his power to protect the people of our nation.   
   
And now, it is my honor to welcome Garnell Whitfield, Jr., who I spent
time with and his family mourning the loss of his beloved mother.  
   
     Mr. Whitfield.  (Applause.)
