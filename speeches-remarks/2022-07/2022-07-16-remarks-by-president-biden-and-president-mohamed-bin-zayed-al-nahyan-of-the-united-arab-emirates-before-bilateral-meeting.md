PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, folks, welcome.  And we’re here with the
President of the UAE.  It’s really good to see you again, Sheikh
Mohamed.  Thank you.  
   
And after our virtual I2U2 Summit earlier this week, let me congratulate
you again and — on your election as President of the UAE.  And I look
forward to another period of strong and growing cooperation between our
countries and under your leadership.  
   
Our relationship covers a wide array of things — everything from
security to economic development to advancing cooperation in science,
technology, and space.  And we both understand that the challenge we
face today will only make it a heck of a lot more important that we
spend more time together.   
   
And I want to formally invite you to the States before — to the Oval —
before this year is out.  But — because we’re not going to get a lot of
time, I know they tell me, to talk today.  But I want to talk to you a
lot — (laughs) — a lot of things I have to raise with you.  
   
But at any rate, thank you.  And welcome.   
   
PRESIDENT BIN ZAYED AL NAHYAN:  Thank you, Mr. President.  It’s really
my pleasure to meet you — to meet you today.  We are very proud of the
relationship we have.   
   
And before I forget, I just want to thank you and the delegation you
sent — the Vice President — during the ceremony we had.  And condolences
(inaudible).  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  I’m sorry.  
   
PRESIDENT BIN ZAYED AL NAHYAN:  I — I’m new in this job, but I’m working
very hard to see how we can bridge the relationship with you and build a
very strong bridge between our two countries.   
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, I’m new in this job too — (laughter) — so maybe
we can do it quickly.  (Laughs.)   
   
Thank you.
