1:16 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Hey, everyone.  Thank you for doing this.  Thanks.   
   
I’ll leave it to you.   
   
I open it up?  Okay.   
   
MS. KLEIN:  You open it up.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I know you’re all busy as I am.  Thank you for making
the time with us.  I need not tell any of you we’re in a really
important area here and we have to act.   
   
I’m joined by a group of Democratic governors as we work closely to
protect women’s rights after this tragic reversal of Roe v. Wade — a
terrible, extreme decision, in my view, upending the lives and impacting
on the health and safety of millions of women.   
   
And I share the public outrage at this extremist Court that’s committed
to moving America backwards with fewer rights, less autonomy, and
politicians invading the most personal of decisions of not only women
but we’ll find, if they expend — expand on this decision, men as well.  
   
But as I said last week, this is not over.  Last week, I announced two
specific actions.  First, if extremist governors try to block a woman
from traveling from her state that prohibits her from seeking the
medical help she needs to a state that provides that care, the federal
government will act to protect her bedrock right through the Attorneys
General’s Office.  
   
Second, if states try to block a woman from getting medication the FDA
has already approved and has been available for more than 20 years, my
administration will act and protect that woman’s right to that
medication.   
   
And there are many other unlawful actions, in my view, that states are
preparing to take that will have — we’ll have to address as well.   
   
But ultimately, Congress is going to have to act to codify Roe into
federal law.  And as I said yesterday, the filibuster should not stand
in the way of us being able to do that.  
   
But right now, we don’t have the votes in the Senate to change the
filibuster on — on — at the moment.  That means we need two more votes
now — not now — when we vote, probably after November — more senators
and House majority — and the House majority elected in November to get
this bill to my desk.  
   
So, the choice is clear: We either elect federal Senators and
Representatives who will codify Roe, or Republicans who will elect the
House and Senate will try to ban abortions nationwide.  Nationwide. 
This is going to go one way or the other after November.   
   
So let’s remember: The reasoning of this decision has an impact much
beyond Roe and to the right to privacy more generally.   
   
Justice Thomas himself said that, under the reasoning of this decision,
that the Court should reconsider marriage equality and contraception.   
   
And there’s a lot at stake.   
   
In the meantime, I want to hear what the governors are doing, talk about
my plans, and discuss what we can do as — until Congress acts.   
   
This is not over.  This is not over.   
   
Now I’m going to turn it over to Jen Klein, the head of the White House
Gender Policy Council.  And we’ll proceed with the discussions.  
   
Jen?  
   
MS. KLEIN:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President.  And I’d like to add
my thanks to each of you for joining and for your leadership.  
   
We’d, as the President just said, really like to hear from you about
both what you’ve done and further action that you’re planning to take. 
So we’re going to start with you, Governor Hochul, from New York.  Over
to you.  
   
GOVERNOR HOCHUL:  Thank you, Jen.  And thank you, Mr. President, for
convening us with the sense of urgency that I feel that you are
conveying, because this is a frightening time for women all across our
nation.  A lot of fear and anxiety out there.  And I hear it from women
all across the state, or they come up to me at subway stops in New York
City, at farmers’ markets.  Literally, young women who never even had to
think about this right are coming up and putting their arms around my
neck and sobbing.  
   
So there is such stress out there.  So we — in the state of New York,
this came the day after the Supreme Court also told us that we did not
have the right to protect our citizens from people carrying concealed
weapons in places like subways, in Times Square, et cetera.  So what I
had to do is convene an extraordinary session — because they weren’t due
back until January.   
   
I brought them back and, literally at 2:00 a.m. this morning, while
we’re still working on the gun legislation, I changed my proclamation to
say we’ll also include to give further protections for women in the
state — what we call the Equality Agenda.  This will prohibit
discrimination on the basis of pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes and
reproductive healthcare and autonomy.  
   
So we’re one step closer as of this afternoon — I think it’s going to be
passed by both houses — to enshrine abortion rights in our state
constitution.  So as long as I’m Governor, these rights will not be
rolled back.  
   
But we also are prepared to serve as a destination for women who will be
looking to a place like New York and other states — some of my
colleagues on the call — as a safe harbor.  
   
So even before the Supreme Court decision, I knew I had to beef up our
opportunities for women to come from other states.  We allocated $35
million right off the bat to go to providers so they could hire more
people, expand their space, and make sure that they can keep their staff
safe from violence as well.  
   
And we also decided to mandate: All insurance companies doing business
in the state of New York now have to cover abortion.  And I signed six
bills related to protecting our providers after the decision came down. 
We’ll stop the extradition of any — any search for — when our providers
or a woman who’s in our state who are wanted under criminal charges. 
That’s not happening in New York.  And we’re also defending our abortion
providers from malpractice and other lawsuits.  
   
We also launched a public awareness campaign, because there’s a lot of
misinformation.  Women in New York are seeing the national news; they
don’t know whether their rights are protected here in New York.   
   
So we’re going to continue to be leaders in this fight, protect our
providers — protect them from the vigilante justice, which has been
unleashed by the states that are going to allow these private rights of
action where they’re going to hunt down women and providers.   
   
This is, you know, chaos.  It’s frightening.  But also, we’re doing what
we can to make sure that, you know, we are protected.  
   
What’s happening now: The rights of millions of women across this
country are now falling on the shourder \[sic\] — shoulders of just a
handful of states.  Just a handful of states are now going to have to
take care of the healthcare of women from other states.  
   
So we believe as you do, Mr. President, that what’s available to New
Yorkers and the other enlightened states should be available to all
Americans.  And no one should have to travel.  
   
And that’s why, as you agree with us, Congress has to act.  And we sent
a letter way back, to Congress, saying, “Please pass the Women’s Health
Protection Act.  Let’s get it through the Senate.”  
   
So what we’re doing at the state level is key.  But I completely agree
with you and I commend you, Mr. President, for standing up and talking
about the fact that it is the filibuster that’s preventing the majority
of senators, and it is the majority of senators who want to speak on
behalf of the majority of Americans.  
   
But we understand our options are limited until next January, with a new
Senate.  And we’re all going to be focusing very hard on that outcome
because it is a matter of life and death for American women, because we
do not want to go back to the days, anywhere in this country, of the
back-alley abortions, which are real.  I talked to one of my neighbors
down the hall who use- — whose husband used to perform these abortions
before abortion was legal in New York State in 1970.   
   
And so this is not just hyperbole, it is real.  
   
So what we’re asking to help continue at the federal level: We believe
that more can be done to fund family planning services more broadly to
allow the providers and their clinics to have sta- — federal resources
for these services, and  
they can focus on private dollars for abortion services.  
   
And I’m really grateful that you’re putting an emphasis on what’s going
to happen for women to be able to continue to receive abortion services
by mail.  I mean, this is going to be a battle that when — that people
would not have foreseen.  We want to make sure that there’s no unlawful
interference.  And we have to do that to ease public concerns.  
   
And also, Mr. President, we’d ask that you consider your ability to use
federal facilities.  What am I talking about?  Veterans’ hospitals,
military bases, and other places where the federal government controls
the jurisdiction in some of the states that are hostile to women’s
rights, and make sure that those services can be available to other
women.   
   
So those are just a few of the ideas that we encourage you to look at —
an idea of what we’re doing at the New York State level.  But literally
before close of business today, we will have the first step toward a
process of changing our Constitution, which is the boldest step we can
take.  And we just started that today.  
   
So — so thank you for convening us.  We are there to stand with you to
do something that — protect a right that my mother’s generation had to
fight for, I fought for, my daughter who’s in her 30s had to fight for,
and now, Mr. President, I have a grand-new \[sic\] — brand-new
granddaughter, and thank you for your note acknowledging that.  
   
I didn’t think we’d have to fight this battle for her generation as
well, but apparently we do.  But we are ready to take on that fight.   
   
So, thank you.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I didn’t think we would either.  I was worried we
would.  But, you know, I think that a lot of the folks don’t understand
what this decision means.  It means if — if you got a 11-year-old child
who’s a victim of incest and finds herself pregnant, which occurs, that,
you know, she can’t get choice, she — she can’t — her health can’t be
protected.  You find, you know, if you’re raped, there’s no exception.  
   
I mean, there’s so many things that people really haven’t focused on
yet, beyond the fundamental right of a woman to be able to choose.   
   
And so I just think that, as you pointed out, Kathy, we’re going to —
it’s going to be a big deal that we get people out to vote, because
here’s what’s going to happen, I predict: If we don’t — if we don’t take
this — keep the Senate, increase it in the House, we’re going to be in a
situation where the Republicans are going to pass a nationwide
prohibition consistent with what the Supreme Court ruled.  
   
And so, there’s a lot at stake here.  But I’m sure glad you’re leading
New York.  For real.   
   
GOVERNOR HOCHUL:  Thank you, Mr. President.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  
   
MS. KLEIN:  Thank you, Governor Hochul.  I’m now going to turn to
Governor Cooper.  
   
GOVERNOR COOPER:  Thanks, Jen.  Thanks, Mr. President, for convening
this call and for your leadership, particularly on the filibuster.  
   
And unlike Governor Hochul in New York, our Republican legislature is
not going to amend the Constitution, but this Democratic governor is
going to hold the line to protect women’s reproductive freedom in our
state.  
   
It has really been devastating for so many, as reproductive care really
has been halted in its tracks in many places across the country.  That
constitutional right that women have relied on for five decades has been
ripped away.  And for now, at least, where you live will determine your
rights.   
   
So, for now, it’s up to the states to determine whether can — women can
get reproductive healthcare.  And in North Carolina, they still can. 
And I’m determined to keep it that way.   
   
Because of our location in the southeast, Mr. President, North Carolina
is already seeing an influx of patients coming to our state for safe
care.  According to Planned Parenthood of the South Atlantic, their
clinics in North Carolina have scheduled 192 patients from out of state
for the next week alone.  That means about 10,000 extra patients from
out of state coming to North Carolina in the next year, mostly from
states that have bans and tighter restrictions.   
   
And those, Mr. President, are just the numbers from Planned Parenthood. 
That doesn’t include our state’s other trusted providers, so we know
those numbers will be a lot higher.  
   
Your ZIP code should not determine your rights.  North Carolina has a
law that’s going to prevent obstructing access to these clinics.  And
we’re working with law enforcement to make sure that that law is
enforced.   
   
Women and doctors should not have these politicians in the exam room
with them looking over their shoulders.  And I’m going to continue to
trust women to make their own medical decisions.  
   
Now, a large part of that, at least for North Carolina, Mr. President,
is keeping enough Democratic state legislators in our state to sustain
my vetoes, as they have a time and again before.   
   
And it also means keeping and electing more Democratic governors across
the country this November.  And that is my mission as Chair of the
Democratic Governors Association this year.  Because, Mr. President,
governors — right now, governors really are the last line of defense. 
And they’re also the first chance at progress, which you’re going to
hear today, especially with this Supreme Court on such a destructive
path.  
   
Mr. President, the stakes are high, but they have never been clearer. 
We are not — we are not backing down.  We are ready to do what is needed
to protect women’s health.  And, Mr. President, I urge you to do
everything you can on the federal level while we work hard in the
states.   
   
Thanks.  Thanks for this opportunity.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, Gov — look, Roy, you’re doing a heck of a job, and
a lot of your colleagues on this call are as well.  I — I assure you
that — I got off the phone today with the Attorney General before I came
in.  Matter of fact, it was one of the reasons I was — excuse me — a few
minutes late.  And we’re going to do everything within the power of the
federal government to make sure that any attempt to obstruct — obstruct
anything from travel to access to — to medicine is just not — it does
not occur.   
   
We also, by the way — I think we’re going to have to see — and this
relates to Governor Hochul as well — that funding for family planning,
not — not — not for abortion, but for family planning.   
   
And there’s a lot we have to do, because a lot of women are — for
example, a lot of the family planning has to do with whether or not a
woman gets access — poor women get access to — to cancer care or things
unrelated to choice.   
   
And so there’s a lot we have to do.  I think we can get it done.  I
think the American people are with us.  And — and again, I thank you for
your — for your leadership.  And I’m not being solicitous.  But you’re
always there.  So, thanks, pal.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  
   
GOVERNOR COOPER:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Grateful for you.   
   
MS. KLEIN:  And now we’re going to turn to Governor Lujan Grisham.   
   
GOVERNOR LUJAN GRISHAM:  Thank you, Jen.  And thank you, Mr. President. 
And I’m delighted, frankly, to join the fight with my incredible
Democratic gubernatorial colleagues; that we are, in fact, that brick
wall against this horrific Supreme Court decision.   
   
And I also, Mr. President, really appreciate that you’ve continued to
lean in, that this privacy rights debate extends far beyond choice.  
   
And we — what we do today in the space for protecting reproductive
rights absolutely should move in the direction to prepare to protect
everyone’s additional privacy rights, including making sure that we
don’t roll backwards on same-sex marriage and other related issues.  
   
So, New Mexico certainly saw this coming as a potential.  We quickly — a
year ago, I signed into law repealing an antiquated, unconstitutional
law that criminalized — that could criminalize abortion care and
abortion providers.  That is now repealed.  We did that last year.   
   
And in doing that, we also increased resources for family planning,
contraceptives, reproductive care, abortion, abortion care services
through all of our network of providers and through state funds.  We’ll
continue to do that.  
   
Most recently, we signed an executive order following the same kinds of
efforts you’re seeing now across the country, joining Massachusetts, as
an example, but now New York: this is not a place where the draconian
efforts by neighboring states, such as Texas, who have stated that they
will, in fact, criminalize providers.  They’re looking for providers
that have multiple state operations and licenses.  And this whole notion
that you can criminalize the patient, including asking your neighbors
and churches to turn your — your loved ones, family members, and
neighbors in.  
   
We will not cooperate as a state in any of those efforts or
investigations.  We will not extradite.  We will provide coverage and
protection for all our providers and any individual seeking abortion
care and abortion services in the state of New Mexico.  
   
Like my colleagues, we are seeing an increase, and we are working
diligently to make sure that when we say and we mean that abortion is
“legal, safe, and accessible,” that, in fact, it is.  
   
So, as you talk about what we can do, given this Supreme Court decision
and given that my colleague, like Chairman Governor Roy Cooper, not
every state has a democratically led legislature.  
   
We are going to need the feds to think about ways — not just the FDA
protection — for making sure that telemedicine is available for
contraceptives and abortion care.  But, in fact, we’re going to need to
make sure that through a public health vehicle, that we are, in fact,
doing family planning.  We should educate people; that should be a
national campaign.  We should talk about access points.  We should be
using school-based health centers.  There’s a number of things that we
could use your assistance and your leadership.   
   
And you’re already leaning in that direction, not just on preventing the
criminalization, but making sure we’re talking about where resources
can, in fact, go that would protect women in states that have signaled
that they have no interest — in their wholesale bans — in protecting
women and other populations and keeping government out of their
personal, autonomous decision-making.  
   
Two, I agree wholeheartedly with Governor Hochul that there are more
federal opportunities, and she mentioned several.  I think that our
Indian Health Service Clinics could be another effective vehicle.  I
will tell you that there — I’ve been reached out by a number of
sovereign nations who I think would be very supportive and interested.  
   
I certainly can’t speak to that across the country, but they’re clear
that even a new recent Supreme Court decision limiting sovereignty has
the same draconian, absolute — right? — unfairness that is looking at
being applied through the Supreme Court to them.  
   
So I think that may be yet another vehicle that we could expand that
would protect women and particularly minority populations all across the
country.  
   
We stand ready to fight hard across the country and making sure that you
have what you need in Congress so that we can codify Roe v. Wade, so
that your states that stand as that safe haven and brick wall will
continue to do that, and support us as many women and their families all
across America who are going to need us as we fight to win this
battle.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, Michelle, you’re already standing up for folks on
your neighboring states.  It matters.  It matters a lot.   
   
And one of the things that I’m finding is that we are looking —
beginning the process — or in the process of looking at all the
alternatives, including the sovereign nation question.  And — but
there’s going to be a lot more that’s going to come through.  
   
I mean, I think people are going to be shocked when the first state —
the first state that tries to arrest a woman for crossing a state line
to get health services, and they’re — I don’t think people believe
that’s going to happen.  But it’s going to happen and it’s going to —
it’s going to telegraph to the whole country that this is — this is a
gigantic deal that goes beyond.  I mean, it affects all your basic
rights.   
   
And — so at any rate, I thank you for all you’re — all you’re already
doing.  And we’re going to take a quick little hesitation here.  The
press is about to leave so we can continue.  If you all have a few more
minutes, I want to talk to all of you, if you can.   
   
And while we’re waiting, think about what you think I should be doing,
if you were sitting in my seat, that I should be considering that we
haven’t already considered and could be useful.
