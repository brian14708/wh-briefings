  Legislators"

*Eastern Atlantic States Regional Council of Carpenters  
*Philadelphia, Pennsylvania**

  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Madam Leader, thank you for that introduction. 
That means a lot to me.  
I want to thank all of the leaders who are at this table.  Pennsylvania
has so much at stake on this issue, and you all have not only been local
and state leaders but national leaders in defending, fighting for, and
protecting the rights of the American people.  
  
And as Madam Leader said, we are looking at an extraordinary moment in
the history of our nation and our democracy.  
      
When the United States Supreme Court took a constitutional right, that
had been recognized, from the women of America, that alone is so deeply
harmful to our nation that prides itself on being a defender of freedoms
and liberty — the very principles upon which we were founded.  And I
don’t need to tell anybody in this city how it all started and what it
meant from the beginning.  
  
So I thank you for, on this Saturday morning, coming together so we can
discuss what is at stake and what we are collectively prepared to do to
fight for the rights of the American people when it comes to this issue
about a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body and her
life.  
  
And it must be understood that on this subject, we are not asking anyone
to compromise their beliefs or abandon their faith.  We are simply
saying the government should not be in the position nor should the
government have the power to replace its beliefs for those of the
woman.  That’s what we are saying.  
  
We are talking about a situation in our nation right now where states
and so-called leaders are passing laws that would criminalize medical
health professionals, healthcare providers.  We are talking about
several states in our nation who will not allow an exception for rape or
incest.   
   
And, Madam Leader, as you know and I know — as a former prosecutor who
specialized, for a great part of my career, in crimes against women and
children, including child sexual assault — we know what this means.  
  
We have heard the more public recent stories about what this means to
real people, real human beings, not to mention the stories that have not
been told and have yet to be told.  
  
So the impact of this moment and what so-called leaders are doing in
states around our country is having a direct impact on so many people
who should have a right to make the most intimate decision that one
could make, to be able to make that for themselves and, if they so
choose, in consultation with their loved ones, with their pastor, their
priest, with their rabbi, but not having their government tell them what
they’re supposed to do.  
  
So, at a national level, we are going to do everything we can to push
for — and we have some of the most esteemed members of the United States
Congress at this table — what we can do at a national level to codify,
which means put into law, the protections that Roe provided.  
  
I think we all know and applaud our President for saying he will not
allow the filibuster to get in the way of doing what is necessary in
that regard.  
  
And short of, then, what happens in terms of recognizing that the Court
has acted, now Congress needs to act; there is also what we can do at a
state and local level.  And so that’s why we are all convened today.  
  
Here in Pennsylvania, I want to again thank the leaders who are at this
table, because I know you are fighting against great odds and that you
are undeterred and that you are standing in defense of, again, these
most fundamental rights.  
  
I want to also thank the Governor Wolf for what he has done in his role
as a leader; the Attorney General, Josh Shapiro, for what he has done as
Attorney General to fight for the principles and the people that have so
much at stake right now.  
  
And so, with that, I thank the press for being here.  And I bid you a
good day.  And we are now going to begin our discussion.  Thank you
all.  
  
But we will find — start with a discussion with some of the leaders who
are here at the table.  
   
 END
