*Vice President’s Ceremonial Office  
*Eisenhower Executive Office Building**

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, good afternoon.  I want to welcome and thank
these extraordinary leaders, who are based in various states but who are
also national leaders, for coming together so we could have this
conversation about, I think, one of the most challenging and troubling
issues of the day.  
   
Last month, as we all know — actually, just weeks ago, the Supreme Court
of the United States did something that is — before then was unthinkable
and unprecedented, which is the United States Supreme Court took a
constitutional right that had previously been recognized — took it from
the women of America and with great consequence, as we know.   
   
This is not a law school debate.  This is not an intellectual discussion
and debate.  This is real in the way that it is currently and will
impact the women and the girls of America in a very direct way.   
   
It goes without saying that I think we share a belief that women should
be able to make decisions about their own bodies without interference
from their government; that she should be able to make a decision about
whether or not to have an abortion in the privacy of a safe place where
she will make that decision — be it with her pastor, her priest, her
rabbi, her family, a physician — but not requiring permission from her
government.  
   
So, this is about that.  This is also, for so many reasons that are
integral to what is at stake, a healthcare crisis in America, I would
offer.  
   
We have heard recent examples of what this means for a girl as young as
10 years old, who endured an act of violence — I say as a former
prosecutor who specialized in child sexual assault — and who then has to
endure a system that clearly is not in its current design with these
laws in place, designed in a way that is about keeping her in mind in
terms of what will give her a safe place in a way that she can address
and those around her who care about her can address her needs.  
   
When we look at this issue, we know that it affects our country at every
level, in each and every region.  We also know that the federal
government and we, our administration, recognizes the power and the
importance and the responsibility we have to partner with elected
leaders in local, state, and at the federal level.  And so that’s why
I’ve asked you all to come and join us today, so we can have a
conversation about what’s happening in your states.  
   
I do want to emphasize though, back to the point of the 10-year-old girl
that we’ve been hearing so much about: We have, I believe, 12 states in
our country that, right now, will not even allow an exception in their
ban on abortion — will not even allow an exception for rape or incest.  
   
We have in our country states that are criminalizing healthcare
professionals for doing what they believe is in the best interest, in
the public health interest of their community.  
   
And so, again, we take these issues quite seriously, understanding the
ramifications and the injustice that is playing out associated with this
issue.  
   
So, I also believe that this is just the beginning.  When we — most of
us have read the opinion and the concurring opinion.  As I’ve said
before, Justice Thomas said the quiet part out loud, which is that also
at risk is the right for individuals to make the most intimate decisions
that they can make about what I call “heart and home” when it comes to
issues like contraception, same-sex marriage.  
   
And so, there is a lot at stake.  We cannot wait for Congress to act. 
Congress must act.  But also, we cannot wait for Congress to act, which
is why the President, Joe Biden, this morning, earlier today issued
executive orders around what we will do at the federal level to ensure
that women are not impeded in terms of their right to interstate travel
and also that they will have access to the medication that they need,
which, by the way, the FDA approved, I believe, over 20 years ago.  
   
So, with that, there’s a lot at stake.  We are working together.  We
will continue to work together.  
   
And, with that, I’m going to invite a discussion for the leaders around
the table.  And I’ll start to my left with Representative GiaQuinta from
the great state of Indiana.
