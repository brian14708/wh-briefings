I look forward to hosting leaders from across the African continent in
Washington, DC on December 13-15, 2022, for the U.S.-Africa Leaders
Summit.  The Summit will demonstrate the United States’ enduring
commitment to Africa, and will underscore the importance of U.S.-Africa
relations and increased cooperation on shared global priorities.

The U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit will build on our shared values to better
foster new economic engagement; reinforce the U.S.-Africa commitment to
democracy and human rights; mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and of
future pandemics; work collaboratively to strengthen regional and global
health; promote food security; advance peace and security; respond to
the climate crisis; and amplify diaspora ties.

I look forward to working with African governments, civil society,
diaspora communities across the United States, and the private sector to
continue strengthening our shared vision for the future of U.S.-Africa
relations.
