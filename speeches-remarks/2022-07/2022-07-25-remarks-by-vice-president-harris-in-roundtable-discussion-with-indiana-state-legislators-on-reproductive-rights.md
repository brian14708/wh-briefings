THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you, Representative GiaQuinta. 
You — the Representative came to visit with me in Washington, D.C., to
talk about all of you and the people of this beautiful state.  And it
was from that conversation that he also made an invitation for me to
come and visit with you.    
   
And so I’m here today to thank you, because the people at this table are
not only local and state leaders, you are national leaders on the front
lines of one of — one of the most critical issues facing our
country.    
   
I want to thank Representative Carson for joining me and flying in with
me today, and for your leadership in Washington, D.C., representing the
people of the state of Indiana.  
   
As has been said, the United States Supreme Court in the Dobbs decision
took a constitutional right, that had been recognized, from the people
of America, the women of America.  Let’s contemplate what that means, in
and of itself, that in a land that was founded on the important
principles of freedom and liberty, that such a thing would happen and
not without grave consequence.  
   
So that is the context in which we meet and fight.  This has created a
healthcare crisis in America.  And as has been said, Indiana has already
been on the forefront of this very issue, as Representative Pryor
described one of the more publicized and well-known cases, in terms of
what this issue means to real people, including children.  
   
And I will tell you, around our country, we are seeing indeed many
states since the Dobbs decision, and attempting even before, to
criminalize health professionals, to punish women — states that are
creating no exception for rape or incest.    
   
And I am a former prosecutor.  I specialized in crimes against women and
children.  I specialized in — in child sexual assault cases.  The idea
that, in some states, after a child or a woman or a man — but in
particular, on this case of abortion, a woman or a child — would have
endured such an act of violence, and then to suggest that she would not
have the autonomy and authority to make a decision about what happens to
her body is outrageous.  
   
So these are the parameters of this issue, and, of course, there are
more.   
   
I would also say that on this issue, one does not have to abandon your
faith or your beliefs to agree that the government should not be making
this decision for her.  An individual should be able to choose based on
their personal beliefs and the dictates of their faith.  But the
government should not be telling an individual what to do, especially as
it relates to one of the most intimate and personal decisions a woman
could make.   
   
Here in Indiana, I am here to support these extraordinary and courageous
leaders and, in particular, on this day where Indiana is the first state
since the Dobbs decision to convene a special session to propose a law
that includes, based on what is being proposed, what essentially will be
a ban on abortion for women.   
   
Because, do be clear — and maybe some people need to actually learn how
a woman’s body works.  But when you understand how a woman’s body works,
you will understand that the parameters that are being proposed mean
that for the vast majority of women, by the time she realizes she is
pregnant, she will effectively be prohibited from having access to
reproductive healthcare that would allow her to choose what happens to
her body.   
   
So, these are the realities.  The President has signed an executive
order to protect women’s access to abortion medication and has taken
action to protect the constitutional right to interstate travel.  And we
will do everything in our power to follow through on those
commitments.   
   
But what we know is that this issue of access to reproductive care and a
woman’s right to make decisions about her body relate to other risks
that have been posed by the Dobbs decision.  We are looking at an
interpretation of the Constitution that suggests — Clarence Thomas said
the quiet part out loud — that this puts at risk an individual’s right
to make decisions about contraception, puts at risk the right to marry
the person you love.   
   
So when we discuss this issue and when we contemplate what it means,
understand that it could have a profound impact on just about everyone
in our country who has any association or interest or concern about
these various issues.   
   
So, for all of those reasons, what these leaders at this table are doing
right now to stand in defense of the women of this state is, by
extension, to stand for the rights of women throughout our country.  
   
The President and I take seriously our work that is about protecting the
health, the safety, and the wellbeing of the women of America, and that
includes the women of Indiana.  
   
And that is why I’m here.  And I look forward to our conversation, and I
thank you all again for your leadership.
