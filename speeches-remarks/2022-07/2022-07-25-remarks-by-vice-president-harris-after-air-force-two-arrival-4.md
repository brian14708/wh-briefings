*Indianapolis International Airport  
*Indianapolis, Indiana**

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Hi, everyone.  So I’m here today in Indiana, in
Indianapolis, to meet with state legislators who have been so courageous
in terms of their fight to stand up for a woman’s right to make
decisions about her own body.  
   
As we know, Indiana is the first state in the nation, after the Dobbs
decision, to hold a special session where they have proposed legislation
that will essentially and effectively ban access to abortion for the
women of this state.  Because if you understand specifically what
they’re proposing and if you know how a woman’s body works, then you
will understand that at the point that the vast majority of women
realize they are pregnant, abortion will essentially be banned.   
   
And, again, we are clear that it should be that woman’s decision, not
the government telling her what to do with her body or her life.  And no
one has to give up their faith or their beliefs to agree that the
government should not tell somebody else what they should do.  It should
be a personal decision based on what people value and what they hold
dear and what are the most intimate decisions any person can make about
their life and their family.  
   
So with that, I’m here to support the legislators who are here and to
support the folks who are doing the work on the ground, in terms of
service providers, to let them know we stand with the women of Indiana. 
We trust the women of Indiana to make decisions about their own lives
without requiring their government to tell them what to do with their
bodies.  
   
So with that, I’m glad to be here.  Thank you all.   
   
                          END
