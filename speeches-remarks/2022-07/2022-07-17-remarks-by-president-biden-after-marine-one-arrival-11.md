South Lawn

(July 16, 2022)

Q    Is the Saudi foreign minister lying, President Biden?   
  
     The Saudi foreign minister says he didn’t hear you accuse the Crown
Prince of Khashoggi’s murder.  Is he telling the truth?

THE PRESIDENT:  No.  
  
     Q    Do you regret the fist bump, Mr. President?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  Why don’t you guys talk about something that matters? 
I’m happy to answer a question that matters.  
  
     Q    Will inflation go down from here, Mr. President?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m hoping.  We’ll know in the next few weeks.  
  
     Q    President Biden, will you be honoring your campaign pledge to
release all the marijuana inmates in prison?

THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t think there should — I don’t think anyone in
pri- — anyone should be in prison for the use of marijuana.  We’re
working on the Crime Bill now.  
  
     Thank you.
