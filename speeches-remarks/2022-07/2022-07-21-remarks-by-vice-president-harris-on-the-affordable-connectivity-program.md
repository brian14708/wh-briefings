1:32 P.M. EDT  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  All right!  Can we hear it for Ms. Tiffany? 
(Applause.)   
   
Well, good afternoon, Charlotte.  It’s so good to be back.  Good
afternoon.  You know, Ms. Tiffany and I were talking in the back, and I
said, you know, “The President” — who I’m going to speak of in a moment
— “The President — I talked to him this morning.  I told him I was on my
way here.  And he said, ‘Tell everybody hello.’”  And he knew why I was
here, which is to talk about what we are doing to connect folks to
high-speed Internet.   
   
And the work that we’re going in Washington, D.C., the work that we are
doing in terms of the policy work, it’s not real until it hits the
streets.  It’s not real until real people have the ability to take
advantage of what we hope will help them and uplift their lives.  
   
And the connectivity, if you will, between what we do in Washington,
D.C., and it hitting the streets of Charlotte are people like Ms.
Tiffany.  So she makes all the difference.  So, again, can we please
applaud her?  (Applause.)  Please applaud her.  
   
And before I begin, I do — wanted to speak about our incredible
President, Joe Biden.  This morning, he and I spoke by phone.  He is in
good spirits.  He is feeling well.  He is doing well.  He is fully
vaccinated and twice boosted.  And — of course, he is, and as everyone
we — who would encourage, who was eligible, would do the same.  And he
is working from the White House Residence.  
  
And when we spoke, he was very pleased, as I said, that we were all here
together today talking about the work our administration is doing on
behalf of parents and working families and all who deserve to be seen
and heard.  
   
So, with that, it is good to be with everyone today.  The great Governor
Roy Cooper.  Where is Roy?  He was here earlier.  He’s been with me all
at — he’s been with me all morning and met me on the tarmac.   
   
And I have to tell you, Roy Cooper is extraordinary, because there’s so
much about we are doing that is about getting these resources to folks. 
But we cannot do it if there’s not a governor in place who takes
seriously the importance of the partnership to make sure that they don’t
let anything get in the way of the services and resources getting to the
people of the states.  So I really do thank Governor Roy Cooper for all
that he has done.  And if we’d applaud him, please.  (Applause.)  
   
And Governor Cooper and I were most recently together at the White House
highlighting the jobs that have been created under his leadership here
in North Carolina through the American Rescue Plan.  So I thank him, of
course, for all the action he has taken get folks online.   
   
I also want to recognize the leaders of the National Telecommunications
and Information Administration for your work advancing our
administration’s efforts to ensure Internet for all.  And thank you to
all of the leaders who are here today, including, of course, the
advocates and the organizers who have fought so long to connect our
communities.  
   
So I will begin with a simple and obvious truth: In the 21st century,
high-speed Internet is not a luxury, it is a necessity.  (Applause.) 
It’s as basic as is what we have come to accept over generations: how
electricity is a necessity.  Same point.  
   
Students use the Internet for so many reasons that are in pursuit of
their education, including to attend virtual classes.  Workers use the
Internet to find jobs and receive training.  Seniors use the Internet to
see a doctor without leaving their home.   
   
For so many of us, the Internet is an essential part of our daily
lives.  And yet, more than 30 million people in our country still do not
have access to high-speed Internet.  Think about that.  It’s a lot of
folks.  And millions more cannot afford the cost of a high-speed plan.  
   
Every person in our nation, no matter how much they earn, should be able
to afford a high-speed Internet plan.  
   
So last year, our administration invested $65 billion through the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to help connect every household in our
country with affordable high-speed Internet and to lower monthly
Internet bills for tens of Americans through an initiative that we’re
here to talk about today called the Affordable Connectivity Program.  
   
So this program provides working families with up to $30 a month off of
their Internet bill or $75 a month for those living on Tribal lands. 
And it also gives families a one-time discount of up to $100 to purchase
a laptop, a desktop computer, or a tablet — because an Internet
connection is not much good if you don’t have a way to get online, if
you don’t actually have the technology that allows you to take advantage
of the service.   
   
So we have been working with Internet service providers to make sure
they offer plans for $30 or less a month, which means the vast majority
of households eligible for the Affordable Connectivity Program can
receive high-speed Internet without paying a dime.   
   
So, if you are eligible, or even think you might be eligible — I’m going
to give you a website; everybody get ready.  Write it on you smartphone
or pull out a pen and paper.  Please visit — the website is
GetInternet.gov.  GetInternet.gov.  And when you log on there, you can
check to see if you qualify, you can find a plan, and you can sign up.  
   
The Affordable Connectivity Program has already done so much good. 
Today, about 13 million people are enrolled.  And these are students who
can now study at their kitchen table instead of in the parking lot of a
local fast-food restaurant, which is what so many of our students did,
especially during the height of the pandemic — because, you see, they
would take advantage of the Internet accessibility from the fast-food
restaurant by sitting in the parking lot.  
   
Think about it: The people who will benefit include parents who used to
rely on their cell phone data plan to connect the whole family, which
can be incredibly expensive.  And now, those families can stream and
search and study on Wi-Fi for free.  This includes women who need access
to healthcare.   
   
Because as many of you know, this is an issue that has been a priority
of mine for a long time — the issue of maternal health.  And our nation
is facing a maternal mortality crisis.  
   
In fact, Black women are three times as likely to die in our country
from pregnancy-related causes.  Native American women are more than
twice as likely to die.  Rural women — women who live in rural America —
are one and a half times more likely to die.  
   
And think about it: For many of the women who live in rural communities,
they also live in maternal care deserts, which means they lack access to
health providers and facilities.  
   
But with high-speed Internet connection and through telehealth, these
women can access lifesaving maternal care.  
   
Among the other 13 million people who have benefited from our program,
there are also folks who are the entrepreneurs in our communities; folks
who always wanted to start a business online and work from home but
could never afford Internet access to do so until now.  
   
Here is what it comes down to: We created this program because we know
when we connect folks with high-speed Internet, it is also a connection
to opportunity — the opportunity to live a healthier, happier, and more
prosperous life and, importantly, more affordable lives.  
   
Every month, the Affordable Connectivity Program saves working families
over a quarter billion dollars, and it is important for so many reasons,
incler- — including our larger fight to make sure that we do everything
— and the President and I feel very strongly about this — to bring down
the costs for lower — and lower the costs for working families.  
   
So, we expanded the Child Tax Credit, which lifted millions of children
out of poverty last year.  And we passed a tax cut  
to give parents up to $8,000 for childcare so they will have more room
in their pockets to buy food and medication and school supplies for
their children.  And we are fighting to pass legislation to lower the
price of prescription drugs, and healthcare, and childcare, and so much
more.  
   
Today we are in Charlotte because we need your help.  We know that when
we hold events like this, more people sign up.  But it takes the support
of leaders like you in this room to sustain that momentum.  
   
So, we need your help, and that’s why I’m here to ask you, like Ms.
Tiffany — we’re going to look at her as a role model for this — to help
us spread the word.  Think about it.  Talk to everybody who comes over
for Sunday dinner, at Little League games, at work, at school, in your
neighborhood.  Talk with folks about what is available to them that they
may not otherwise know but can be a huge help for everything that is
about their daily lives and obligations.  
   
And we need community and faith-based organizations to help people fill
out their applications.  There is an application.  It’s not too
detailed.  It’s not too complicated.  But folks might need an extra
hand, so please offer to help them fill out the application as well.  
   
And we need state and local governments to drive enrollment every way
they know how.  I know that Governor Cooper is already hard at work on
this front.  The partnership between the leaders here today is
essential.  
  
So, again, I am here to ask you to help spread the word to let people
know what is available to them.  And like Tiffany’s story, when we see
people take advantage of it, we see so much good that is not only about
that individual but truly is about their family and the community as a
whole.  
   
So thank you, all of you, for all that you have done to help connect the
people of our nation with a better future.  And I look forward to seeing
you all again soon.   
God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.  Thank you. 
(Applause.)
