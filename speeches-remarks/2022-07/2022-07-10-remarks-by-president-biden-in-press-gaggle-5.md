Q    Good morning, Mr. President.

Q    Good morning!

THE PRESIDENT:  I want you to know an important thing: I took off the
clamps on my (inaudible).  (Laughter.) 

Q    How you feeling?

THE PRESIDENT:  I’m feeling good. 

Q    Good.  That’s great.

THE PRESIDENT:  I’m looking for the sun though. 

Q    Have you made a decision on tariffs, sir?  I know you had a meeting
about that on Friday. 

THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, we’re having further discussions on that.  And —

Q    And do you have a — do you have a message, Mr. President, for women
who were protesting outside the White House yesterday?

THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  Keep protesting.  Because — keep making your
point.  It’s critically important. 

We can do a lot of things to accommodate the rights of women in the
meantime.  But, fundamentally, the only thing that’s going to change
this is if we have a national law that reinstates Roe v. Wade.  That’s
the bottom line.

Everything else, we can get pieces of it, and I’m trying to do that. 
Some things that some of the groups want —

I’m going to look like a fool here in this interview, but — (points to
his bike helmet).  (Laughter.)  

Q    You look good.

Q    You look great.  

THE PRESIDENT:  I put a helmet on because this is a tough interview. 
(Laughter.) 

But all kidding aside, I think that there’s things we can do to
accommodate particular abuses beyond like not being able to cross state
lines, those kinds of things, and being able to access women’s private
information, and so on.  That — we can work on that. 

But as President, I don’t have the authority to say that we’re going to,
you know, instate Roe v. Wade as the law of the land.  The only way we
do that is through an election in the United States Congress.  In the
meantime, states can make those judgments. 

But — so my ultimate goal is to reinstate Roe v. Wade as the national
law by passing it in the United States Congress.  And I’ll sign it the
moment that happens. 

But I’m going to go on my ride.  Okay?

Q    Yes, yes, Mr. President.  One quick follow-up.  One of the things
they are asking for is a public health emergency.  Is that something
you’re considering?  Or —

THE PRESIDENT:  That’s something I’ve asked the folks to — the medical
people in the administration to look at, whether that is — whether I
have the authority to do that and what impact that would have. 

Okay?

Q    Thanks so much.

THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
