  Leaders"

*MacDill Air Force Base  
*Tampa, Florida**

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, good afternoon, everyone.  I am very much
looking forward to our discussion.  And I’m very pleased to be here on
the ground with you, who have been doing extraordinary work on so many
levels.   
   
I was — all that I — that I admire about the service, the dedication,
the discipline, and the skill that our men and women apply to this work
was reinforced with the quick visit that I just had out in the hangar. 
And so, I want to thank everyone here for what you do every day.   
   
We are here to highlight and to — to uplift with praise the work of
CENTCOM and SOCOM.  This work is critical to our national security.   
   
As we know, the President is overseas right now in the Middle East.  And
there is so much about what happens through the leadership here on the
ground that allows us to reinforce and strengthen our partnerships
around the globe and reinforces our commitment to international rules
and norms and America’s willingness and preparedness to uphold and
defend those international rules and norms.   
   
So, I’m here to speak with these leaders — in particular, General
Kurilla and General Clarke.  And I want to thank you both for hosting us
today.   
   
The United States Military, without any question certainly in my mind or
the President’s mind and in the mind of the American people, is the
strongest and the best fighting force in the world.   
   
When you look at the work that happens just right here, you will see
extraordinary work that is about dedication, discipline, the building
and strengthening of skills, and just sheer commitment to defending our
country and the principles upon which we were founded.   
   
And so, I’m here to talk with the leaders here to discuss the missions
that are currently active around the globe and to talk with them about
what might be necessary in terms of the additional support and resources
that they need to do their job and complete their mission.   
   
 I also am here to express gratitude not only to the service members but
to their families.  In particular, the folks who work out of CENTCOM and
SOCOM are supported by wonderful families who dedicate so much of their
lives to allow their family member to serve as they do for our
country.   
   
So I am here to praise, again, the work that is being done by all of
these folks.  I also want to mention that partic- — in particular,
regarding the work of CENTCOM, President Biden, being in the Middle
East, is there to also make sure that we are clear about the role and
the responsibility the United States plays in that region of the world,
with an emphasis on many points, including our enduring relationship in
support of our allies and friends and partners in Israel.   
   
His visit is also about emphasizing the work that is happening through
CENTCOM that strengthens the relationships that we have in that region
of the world.   
   
CENTCOM’s work also directly benefits the American people, in addition
to ensuring that all of the values we care about in terms of our
security are upheld.   
   
CENTCOM’s work includes protecting commercial shipping lanes and energy
resources that Americans rely on and — in this moment when we know that
commerce and the — the active ability of us to engage in commerce is
something that directly affects the American people where they live and
how they live.   
   
Regarding SOCOM, this year we celebrate the 30th — 35th, excuse me,
anniversary of its founding.   
   
PARTICIPANT:  Yes.   
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  (Laughter.)  
   
And we call the Special Operations Forces our “quiet professionals” for
a reason.  They do big work.  They never look for praise or
acknowledgement.  But the work they do we take for granted.  Sometimes
we don’t see, but we surely benefit from it.   
   
And so, I’m here to also talk about the work that is happening in the
frontlines on our continued fight against terrorism around the world and
the work that SOCOM does to ensure that America’s interests are well
served, including at this moment during Russia’s unprovoked aggression
and the war in Ukraine, where the men and women of this division have
been doing the work that they do around the globe, including training
the forces that are the forces of our allies and, in particular, the
Ukrainians in their fight to preserve their sovereignty and territorial
integrity.  
   
So together, CENTCOM and SOCOM advance our national security interests
and defend and strengthen our international rules-based order.   
   
And with that, I will conclude by saying to all here how much we
appreciate you every day.  I mentioned to the folks that I was with in
the hangar: We talk about you guys all the time when we’re sitting in
the Situation Room or in the Oval Office, talking about America’s
responsibility not only to the citizens of our country but to our
friends and allies around the world.  We talk about you, because we
could not follow through on anything that we do in the context of those
relationships and priorities were it not for what you all are doing here
on the ground.   
   
So, thank you.  And your mission remains critically important to the
President, to me, and to our country.   
   
And with that, I thank the press.  I’ll see you all later.   
                           
                               END
