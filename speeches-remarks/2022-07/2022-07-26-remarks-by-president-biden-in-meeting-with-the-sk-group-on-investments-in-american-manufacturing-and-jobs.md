MR. DEESE:  Hi, Mr. President.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  How are you?   
   
Hey, Tony.  How are you, pal?  
   
MR. CHEY:  Hello.  Yes, really good to see you.   
   
MR. DEESE:  So, Mr. President —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I should be sitting immediately to your right.   I’m
only a couple hundred yards away.  I apologize I’m not there. 
(Laughter.)  
   
MR. DEESE:  Yeah, Mr. — Mr. President, thank you for — thank you for
joining us.  
   
And as you know, we have the — we have the delegation from SK here. 
We’re — we’re thrilled to have you here at the White House and to
discuss this very significant announcement of investments that SK is
making today.   
   
With your permission, Mr. President, I will just turn the floor to
Chairman Chey to brief you and update you directly on the announcement
that they’re making today.  And then we can get into the conversation.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  It’s a big announcement.  Take as long as you need,
Tony.  (Laughter.)  
   
MR. CHEY:  Thank you.  Yes, good afternoon, Mr. Biden — yeah, President
Biden.  I know I speak for the people of the South Korea in wishing you
the speedy recovery.  
   
And I would like to express that my sincere gratitude for this
opportunity to discuss our current and future cooperation in
manufacturing critical technologies in the U.S.  
   
Thank you also, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Director of the
National Economic Council Brian Deese, for your support of our
investment in United States.  
   
We are also grateful for the strong partnerships we have formed across
your — the administration, in Congress, and in many state government —
yeah — that have helped make our investment happen.    
   
So, tomorrow we will commemorate 69 years since the end of the Korean
War.  So, the American and Korean relationship is deep and
longstanding.  Our countries fought side-by-side during the terrible
conflict, and now we have worked side-by-side to build the technologies
and infrastructures that will power the 21st century economy around the
world.   
   
So, SK’s commitment to grow and invest in Korea is enduring.  But today,
though, we are here to talk about the investment in U.S.  So our
cooperation will make the supply chain in both our countries more
resilient in critical technologies.  And the SK Group commitment to the
United States runs deep, and we have backed that commitment with $22
billion of investment in U.S. in recent years.  
   
Today, we are announcing another $22 billion in new investment in the
U.S., so including the major investment in semiconductor EV batteries
and biotechnology.  
   
All this means that SK will invest in nearly $30 billion going forward,
expanding on our recent announcement of $7 billion investment in EV
batteries.  
   
And so, SK will invest the half of our total investment amount in the
U.S. in semiconductor ecosystem.  Well, this money will fund R&D
programs in partnership with the leading American universities and
restoration advanced packaging (inaudible) in the U.S.  
   
Well, this initiatives will contribute to developing the next generation
of memory chips, which will benefit the entire U.S. high-tech
industry.  
   
So, President Biden, we share your commitment to green energy.  In
addition to our new EV battery factories in Georgia, we will — we will
be investing more — $7 billion more out of the total, our JV investment
amount — up to $14 billion — to build two new gigafactory in Tennessee
and Kentucky as a part of our joint venture with the Ford Motor
Company.  
   
So we will invest an additional $5 billion in other green energy
businesses, including the ultra-fast EV charging system, the green
hydrogen, and battery materials, recycling, and also small modular
reactors.  
   
Also, our investment will expand our facility in the U.S. in bioscience
and biopharmaceutical sectors.  We believe our initiatives will
contribute to strengthen the U.S. supply chain resilience and to address
the climate change.   
   
So we are sincerely grateful to your administration’s continued support
in our shared prosperity.   
   
Thank you, Mr. President.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Tony, and to your delegation.  This is — as
someone once said in a similar circumstance, this the big deal. 
(Laughter.)  This is really, really consequential.  
   
And, you know, I’m sorry, as I said, I’m not with you in person, but I
wanted to make sure that — to personally thank you for this historic
announcement.  
   
You know, this pathbreaking announcement represents clear evidence that
the United States, Korea, and its allies are back and winning the
technology competition of the 21st century.  
   
For folks at home, the SK Group is the second-largest conglomerate in
South Korea.  And since I’ve been President, it has made significant
investments in United States.   
   
SK has already committed $30 billion in investment here, and today
they’re announcing another $22 billion in addition.  That’ll grow their
U.S. workforce from 4,000 to 20,000 workers by 2025, investing in a
range of advanced technologies, some of which Tony already mentioned,
from semiconductors to large-capacity batteries, to electric vehicle
chargers, and to pharmaceuticals.   
   
And partnering with iconic American company, like Ford and Intel, it’s
just incredible.  Further proof that America is open for business. 
Proof that we’re meeting the emergency and the climate crisis with
urgency and opportunity and innovation to save the planet and create
good-paying jobs to benefit both our countries.  
   
We’re investing more than $1 trillion in the United States to modernize
our infrastructure, including 500,000 electric charging stations across
America.  
   
Since I came to office, we’ve seen more than $200 billion in private
sector energy investments in electric vehicles, advanced batteries, and
semiconductors.  Construction of overall manufacturing facilities in
America has increased by 116 percent.  And this is only going to add to
that, Tony.  Thank you.  
   
And the construction in America means jobs for Americans.  Since I’ve
been in office, the economy has created 613,000 overall manufacturing
jobs — just manufacturing jobs.  
   
Today’s announcement is also proof that America is back to working with
our allies.  
   
By uniting our skills and innovation, we will be able to manufacture the
technologies that create the critical changes that are needed both for
our — for both our countries.  
   
During my visit to South Korea in May, when I got to sit at the table
across from Tony — and it was a crowded room — I toured Samsung’s campus
with President Yoon, and I saw how the factory there is manufacturing
advanced semiconductor chips and is committing $17 billion to build a
similar factory here in America.  
   
In Seoul, I met with the Chairman of Hyundai, and we announced — as we
announced $10 billion in new investments in America — American
manufacturing, including a $5.5 billion investment for an advanced
automotive factory near Savannah, Georgia, where — where SK is also
going to be investing and create — creating more than 8,000 jobs.  
   
In the past, these kinds of technology investments went to China. 
Today, under my administration, these technology investments are coming
to the United States.  We’re talking about some of the most significant
investments we’ve ever seen in our country.  
   
America is the key destination for advanced technologies, and it’s the
kind of — it’s that kind of proactive engagement that reminds me one of
the benefits of investing in the United States, and that is the
opportunity to partner with some of the most highly skilled, dedicated,
and engaged workers in the world: American union members.   
   
Now, look, just yesterday, I met with members of my economic and
national security teams and CEOs and labor leaders to highlight the
urgency of getting the bipartisan CHIPS Act to my desk.  
   
And today, the Senate took a very important bipartisan step to get us
closer.  They, in fact — they, in fact, met the cloture requirement, and
getting that bill to my desk is much closer now.  Because this really
matters.  
   
Let me — let me close with this: You know, Tony, you and your team, I
want to thank you for being here at the White House.  And again, I feel
so badly — I’m so close to you, but because I’m in the last day of
having been diagnosed with COVID — I’m feeling great; I hope it comes
across that way as well.  I hope I look as great as I feel here.   
   
But you know — and you’re — (laughter) — well, you know what I mean. 
That sounded off a bit.  (Laughter.)  I never look that good.  I hope I
look as good as I usually do, which is not that good.  (Laughter.)  
   
Hey, look, but — (laughs) — but I want to thank you again for being at
the White House and for your investment in American workers, our
greatest resource.  
   
And, Tony, as you begin the rest of the meeting today, what more do you
think we can do to keep this momentum going?  
   
MR. CHEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.  And it is really my pleasure being
here even though you’re not in person with me, but close enough. 
(Laughter.)   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I can walk out on the balcony and holler to you. 
(Laughter.)  
   
MR. CHEY:  But you certainly don’t have to sell us on investing in the
U.S. because we already committed about $30 billion and $22 billion in a
pipeline.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yep.  
   
MR. CHEY:  Well, we created tens of thousands of highly paid and highly
skilled jobs.  But we believe — our view is the United States is our
most important business partner.  But one thing we can work together is
building a skillful workforce.  That would be the crucial for ensuring
that America has a type of worker necessary to lead the next generation
— the manufacturing economy.  
So, we will work closely with the state and community colleges to help
ensure that workers know what they need to know to lead jobs in our
facility.  The federal, state, and the local coordination, and the deep
investment in job training, would help other companies to find the
skillset they need and invest more in — here in U.S. as well.

So we look forward to working with you, Mr. President, and — on
advancing the workforce, the training in the coming years.

That’s one thing.  But here is another things that I want to mention to
you as well: I’d like to actually emphasizing some partnerships among
the company and the nonprofit organization in U.S. and Korea.  So we
believe the collaboration among the organization of the two countries
will motivate them to invest more across the border.

So, for example — I will give you some — some examples that SK worked
closely with Novavax as a — the pharma — U.S. pharmaceutical company to
develop the produ- — produce the COVID-19 vaccine.

THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.

MR. CHEY:  So, as a result of the co-investing in R&D and the production
capacity.

One other example is, as a recent matter, is SK is also partnering with
the Gates Foundation and the University of Washington to develop the new
COVID vaccine.  This is a new one.

THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.

MR. CHEY:  So this is a kind of proven collaboration model that can
booster the investing in the U.S.

So, Mr. President, and we look forward to working with you — this
fostering such a kind of partnership with you.   
   
Thank you.

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, it is a partnership.  And we’ve been partners a
long time.  And — and as we — I think about it, I can remember the
pictures of my uncle — anyway, from people being sent from Korea back
home when I was a kid, about (inaudible) partners a long time.

And, look, one of the things that I promise you we’re going to do is
we’re going to continue to invest in the education side of this to have
— so you have the best trained, the best equipped workers in the world. 
I really mean it.  And particularly with regard to our community
colleges, which have great assets to bring to the — bring to bear.

And I think that — I just see this as the beginning of — of so many more
things we can do.  And I can see that — that the Secretary is smiling,
and she thinks it’s the beginning too.  And I’m going to leave it to you
guys to talk about.

But anyway, thank you, all three of you.  And again, I apologize for not
being with you.  Next time you come, I’m going to force you to have
lunch with me in the Oval Office so you can see what we — what I don’t
do.  You know?  I mean, the Oval Office is lovely, but we — I got — I’m
all the way over here; I can’t even be near you.

So at any rate, thanks again for everything.  I look forw- — I really
mean this: The way you treated our delegation when we’ve gone to Korea,
to the Republic; the way you’ve — we’ve hung together on foreign policy
as a matter of domestic and economic policy — I know that’s not your
responsibility.  But your — but your country has stepped up as an
enormous, enormous asset and ally.

So thank you, thank you, thank you.
