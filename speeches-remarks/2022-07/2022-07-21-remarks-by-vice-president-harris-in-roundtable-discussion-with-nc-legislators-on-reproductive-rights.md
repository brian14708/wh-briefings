THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Governor Cooper.  And back at you. 
(Laughter.)  Because we have — Roy Cooper and I stood
shoulder-to-shoulder fighting for working people of America.  And I’ve
seen him in rooms when there are no cameras and in rooms when the
cameras are on, and he’s always fighting for the people.  
   
So it is my honor and joy to join you yet again as we stand up for the
principles that I think we, as Americans, hold dear.  
   
I will also mention what I don’t need to tell all the leaders here, who
are not only state leaders but national leaders on so many issues: We
got to make sure that Governor Cooper — who is right now the only line
of defense in the state house, in terms of his veto power — that we
ensure that we give him the support he needs in terms of the legislature
so that he can continue to hold the line, as you have been.  And thank
you for that.  
   
There are certain principles that are at stake on this issue and in this
discussion.  And one of them is that every woman in America should be
free to make decisions about her own body without government
interference.   
   
And let’s be frank about this issue: As has been said, to stand for a
woman’s right to make one of the most intimate decisions that she can
make about her own life without government interference, to agree with
the importance of her right and ability to do that does not require you
to abandon your faith or your beliefs.  It’s to agree that she should be
able to make that right without the government telling her what to do.  
   
That really is, as much as anything, what’s at stake here.  Every woman
should be free to make that decision for herself and, if she chooses, in
consultation with her loved one, with her physician, with her pastor,
her priest, her rabbi.  But the government should not be making this
decision for her.   
   
Ultimately, that is what this is about.  It’s about one of the most
important principles upon which our nation was founded: freedom, liberty
— freedom from government interference in the most intimate decisions
that are essentially about heart and home.  Because when we look at
what’s going on right now, let’s understand it is the issue of
choice.   
   
But it is an interpretation of the right to privacy that — you know,
Clarence Thomas said the quiet part out loud — puts at risk the right to
make decisions about contraception, the right to make decisions about
who you love in terms of same-sex marriage.  All of this is at stake.   
   
So, the United States Supreme Court took a constitutional right, that
had been guaranteed and recognized, from the people of America — the
women of America.  That is also what is at stake.   
   
And as Vice President, I have traveled the world.  I have talked with at
least 80 prime ministers, presidents, kings around the globe.  And when
we look at our highest court taking a constitutional right from the
people of our country, we must understand what this also means in term
of — in terms of what we stand for as a democracy, which has stated
certain principles about the rights of individuals to be free from
interference by their government.  So all of this is at stake.   
   
And we are looking at — in particular, after the Dobbs decision, but
even before — extremist so-called leaders around the country who are
daring to also pass laws that will not provide an exception for violent
criminal acts like rape and incest.   
   
I spent the majority of my career as a prosecutor.  And during the time
that I was working in courtrooms, a great deal of my focus was on crimes
against women and children, including child sexual assault.   
   
And we have so-called leaders who are saying there is no exception for
those violent acts, for that woman, for that person to be able to have
agency over their own body after they have been a victim of such a
heinous act.  
   
These are the issues that are at stake right now in our country.  This
is what’s happening right now in our country.   
   
And so, yes, the President has signed an executive order to say that we,
in terms of the federal government, will do what we must and what we can
through the executive branch to protect a woman’s legal right, in terms
of interstate travel, to protect access to medication.   
   
But we have three coequal branches of government.  The Court has acted
now.  Now it is time for Congress to act and to codify the protections
of Roe, which means to put it into law at a national level.   
   
And this is also going to require us to look to the leaders in the
states to do what the leaders here in North Carolina, at this table and
elsewhere, have been doing: to have the courage to stand up for the
rights of women and the rights of the American people to make certain
decisions for themselves.   
   
And so, I’m here to thank you all.  You are fighting on the frontlines,
including our courageous service providers.  And we are in this
together.   
   
I will emphasize again — you know, I asked my team to do a Venn diagram
for me of where we are seeing attacks and who are the attacks against
and the similarity.  And if you look at attacks on a woman’s right to
choose, attacks against the LGBTQ community, attacks on voting rights —
it’s very interesting to see a lot of them are coming from the same
source.   
   
And so that’s also to say that let’s bring folks together, understanding
that on this issue, as well as so many others, we all have so much more
in common than what separates us, in terms of the need to stand up for
these rights against those who have decided to attack them, and to do so
fighting for the best of who we are as a country.   
   
And with that, I look forward to our discussion.   
   
And, again, I thank you.  I’m here to listen as much as I am to share
with you my thoughts because, truly, we have extraordinary leaders here
in this beautiful state.   
   
So with that, thank you all.  And I think we should begin our
discussion.   
   
Okay, thank you.  (Applause.)
