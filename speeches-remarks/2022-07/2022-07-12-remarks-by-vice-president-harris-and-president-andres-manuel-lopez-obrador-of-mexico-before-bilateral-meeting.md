VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  It is my great pleasure to welcome my friend,
the President of Mexico.  He and I have spent some wonderful time
together both in Mexico City and here in Washington, D.C.  But it is my
great honor to receive you at my home.   
   
The time that I spent with you in Mexico was so special to me.  We spent
time looking at the art, talking about the culture, and, of course,
talking about the relationship between our two nations.   
   
So welcome, my friend.  I look forward to our discussion and to
continuing our partnership — longstanding partnership based on
traditions and based on a friendship that has been so important to both
of our nations.  Welcome.  
   
PRESIDENT LÓPEZ OBRADOR:  (As interpreted.)  I am so happy about this
meeting today with Vice President Kamala Harris.  She’s our friend but
also a woman with principles, an intelligent woman, honest.  She’s a
partisan of equality.  
   
So I congratulate the U.S., the American people, because they have a
first-order Vice President.  I congratulate the American people for
that.  
   
We’ve always been speaking for the benefit of our peoples and both of
our nations.  And today, we are going to do exactly the same thing.  
   
Thank you so much.  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Welcome.  Welcome.  
   
PRESIDENT LÓPEZ OBRADOR:  (As interpreted.)  Thank you.
