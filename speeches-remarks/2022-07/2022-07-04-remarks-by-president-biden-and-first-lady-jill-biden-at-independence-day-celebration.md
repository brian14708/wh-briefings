THE PRESIDENT:  Hey everybody.  (Applause.)  Welcome to the White
House.  (Applause.)  It’s like this every weekend, you know, just
several thousand people. 

Look, I want to welcome you all to the White House and tell you how
happy we are you’re able to be here.  And what a day to celebrate and to
celebrate with all of you. 

Now I’m going to turn it over to the boss.  (Applause.) 

THE FIRST LADY:  Thanks, Joe.  So, you know what?  I think Andy Grammer
should do just one more.  What do you guys think? (Applause.) 

Will you do it, Andy?  Will you come back up?  Yes!  (Applause.)  Yes,
come on back up.  Okay he’s coming.  (Applause.)  He’s coming. 

AUDIENCE:  “Fine by me!”  “Fine by me!”  “Fine by me!” 

MR. GRAMMER:  When Jill asks you to stay, you stay.

This one is called “Give Love.”  (Performs “Give Love.”)

THE FIRST LADY:  Let’s give it up for Andy Grammar!  (Applause.)  Thank
you.  Oh my God, you’re so great.  (Laughter.)  Honestly. 

Joe, you’re great too.  (Laughter.) 

So, sharing this evening with you has really just been so special for me
and for Joe and for all the Biden family.  I can’t thank you all enough
for your support, especially our military families.  Can we give it up
for our military families?  (Applause.) 

And speaking of that, I want to say thank you to our military band and
all their members.  Honestly, they’re incredible, aren’t they? 
(Applause.)

And still to come is White Ford Bronco.  (Applause.) 

So, are you ready for the fireworks?  (Applause.) 

Okay, so God bless you all.  Thank you for coming.  Happy Fourth of
July.

And here’s our President.  (Applause.)

THE PRESIDENT:  And she still hangs out with me.  (Laughter.)  

Hey, guys, one serious note: You know, the — there was a shooter, as you
well know, in Highland Park, in Chicago.  And they have — I talked to
the governor and to the mayor.  We’re giving all the help we can
possibly give, including FBI and special service.

Any rate, they’ve identified the individual.  They haven’t stated the
name, and I’m not going to do that now either.  But they’re trying to
find him.  And six people have passed and others are wounded. 

But we got a lot more work to do.  We got to get this under control.  We
got to get this under control. 

But having said that, I just wanted to keep — just a slight moment of
silence for all those families.

(A moment of silence is observed.)

Folks, look, we — it’s been a great day, and the fireworks haven’t even
started yet.  And so, we’re looking forward to having you all enjoy the
rest of the evening. 

And when you head home, head home safely.  Head home safely. 

And as a — I used to have a grandpop, every time I walked out of his
house in Scranton, he’d say, “Joey, keep the faith.”  And my grandmother
would yell, “No, Joey, spread it.”  Let’s spread the faith, folks. 

Thank you all so very, very much.  Thanks.  (Applause.)

THE FIRST LADY:  God bless America.  God bless America.  

THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, and —

THE FIRST LADY:  God bless America.  Thank you.  (Applause.)

THE PRESIDENT:  And God protect our troops.  Thank you.  (Applause.)
