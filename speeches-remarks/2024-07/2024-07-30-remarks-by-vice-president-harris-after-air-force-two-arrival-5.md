4:23 P.M. EDT

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  So, I want to address what’s happened over the last
few hours in terms of the Middle East and be very clear: Israel has a
right to defend itself.  And I unequivocally support Israel’s right to
remain secure and — and to defend the security of Israel. 

What we know in particular is, yes, it has a right to defend itself
against a terrorist organization, which is exactly what Hezbollah is. 
But all of that being said, we still must work on a diplomatic solution
to end these attacks, and we will continue to do that work.

Thank you, all.
