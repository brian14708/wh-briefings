THE PRESIDENT:  The only reason I’m coming over is (inaudible) being
here so late.

Q    Mr. President, what do you want your legacy for Gen Z to be?

THE PRESIDENT:  That I’ve cured the economy —

Q    When are you going to go ou- —

THE PRESIDENT:  — and the environment and a few other small things.

Q    When are you going to go out and campaign for the vice president?

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I did today.

Q    Mr. President, how about your legacy for LGBTQ Americans?

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’m really proud of my position.  I was the first
guy to come out for gay marriage.  Remember that little problem with the
Obama administration? 

And, look —

Q    Have you — have you been giving her —

THE PRESIDENT:  — my dad had a simple proposition.  God’s truth.  My dad
was dropping me off to get a license to be a lifeguard in the city of
Wilmington — the projects. 

As I get out of the car and — Rodney Square, it’s called — the center of
the city — someone from the DuPont company and the Hercules company —
two large companies that are in buildings adjacent to one another — and
I’m getting out of the car, and these two guys leaned up and kissed one
another.  I’d never seen that before.

And I looked to my dad, and he said, “Joey, it’s simple.  They love each
other.  It’s simple.”  That’s my position.

Okay.  Thank you.

Q    What do you think of the VP’s choices?  Who do you think she’s
going to pick as VP?

THE PRESIDENT:  We’re talking.  Thank you.
