Joint Base Andrews

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  So, many of you have been asking me about the
debate.  And I’ll tell you, I’m ready to debate Donald Trump. 

I have agreed to the previously agreed upon September 10th debate.  He
agreed to that previously.  Now it appears he’s backpedaling.   
  
But I’m ready.  And I think the voters deserve to see the split screen
that exists in this race on a debate stage.  
  
And so, I’m ready.  Let’s go.
