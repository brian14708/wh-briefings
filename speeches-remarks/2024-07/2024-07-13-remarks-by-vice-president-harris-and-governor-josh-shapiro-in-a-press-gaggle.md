title: "Remarks by Vice President Harris and Governor Josh Shapiro in a Press\_Gaggle"
---
 
*Reading Terminal Market  
Philadelphia, PA*

     Q    Mrs. Vice President, how do you think President Biden did at
the press conference?

     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  What?  Sorry.

     Q    How do — how do you think President Biden did at the press
conference?  Do you think he put voter concerns to an end?

     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I think that the president did an outstanding
job.  I mean, you look at it from the press conference he did during
NATO.  He is a master of the issues.  He is so highly respected among
our colleagues around the globe. 

And then you look at everything from then to even just what he did last
night in Michigan.  He’s turning out big crowds.  There’s a lot of
enthusiasm, and there’s a lot of support.

     And I’ll tell you, it’s good to be back here in Pennsylvania with
the governor, who’s been a great partner to the president and me. 

     And we’re clear that in this election, which is taking place in 115
days, the stakes are very high.  You’ve got the former president in
Donald Trump who is pushing extreme policies, including taking away the
freedoms of the American people, the women of America.  They’re pushing
this Project 2025, which is a direct threat to so many of the
institutions and — and ideals that we hold dear.

     So, the stakes are high.  But it’s good to be back with you —

     GOVERNOR SHAPIRO:  Good to be with you.

     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — Governor Shapiro. 

     GOVERNOR SHAPIRO:  Good to be with you.

     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Would — do you want to share your thoughts
with the — with the group?

     GOVERNOR SHAPIRO:  I’m just grateful that the vice president is
here today.  I — I would point out I — I had coffee with the president
in Harrisburg last week, a little pad thai with the vice president this
week. 

We’ve been friends for 20 years.  She’s an outstanding vice president. 
And I couldn’t be more proud to support the Biden-Harris ticket — to
continue to support the Biden-Harris ticket.

     And let me tell you, there is a clear contrast in this race. 
Donald Trump wants to rip away our fundamental freedoms — freedoms that
Madam Vice President fought for as attorney general, as senator, and now
as vice president.  He wants to inject more chaos in our lives, take
away health care from 1.2 million Pennsylvanians. 

     There is a clear choice in this race.  I’m going to continue to do
everything in my power to support the Biden and Harris ticket and make
sure we stand up for real freedom — freedom that was born right here
just a few blocks away and freedom that we in Pennsylvania know how to
fight for.

     We’re the swingiest of all swing states.  We’ve got a unique
relationship with freedom and democracy.  We’re again going to turn out
big for the Biden-Harris ticket. 

     Thank you, all.

     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Governor Shapiro.
