Reverend Lee, the President and I are so grateful for your ministry,
your love, and your support. Rob, thank you for joining us today and for
your special blessing.

Joining Forces, my White House initiative that supports military and
veteran families, caregivers, and survivors is only possible because of
amazing organizations like the USO. And, this BBQ is an example of the
work we do together to support our military and their families. Thank
you.

Welcome to the White House and happy Fourth of July!

When I was a little girl, a photo of my dad in a uniform always caught
my eye when I visited my grandmom’s house. We didn’t really speak about
it, but its very placement made it stand out. As I grew older, I learned
the story.

At 17-years-old, my father, decided that he wanted to fight in World War
II.

But he was too young to enlist and had to get my grandmom’s permission.
She was terrified to send her teenaged son to war, but ultimately, she
signed the papers. It was a hard choice—but one they made because they
loved each other and our country.

Service is often about those hard choices—the ones servicemembers make,
and the ones their families do too.

I only truly understood that choice when our son, Beau, joined the
Delaware Army National Guard and went to war for a year in Iraq.

All of you have made that same choice—to serve our country.

You’re the brave and the bold—who step forward for all of us.

You’re the spouses who always cheer twice as loud at soccer tournaments
and hug twice as hard at birthdays to try and fill that empty space
beside you.

You’re the military kids who save up all your stories to share during
that one, precious video call.

Today’s fireworks displays and barbeques—these celebrations of our
freedoms, our democracy—are only possible because of your service and
sacrifice.

As a military mom, grandmom, and the daughter of a veteran, I want to
let you know how much you all mean to me—and to your Commander-in-Chief.

We love you and are so proud of you. Now, please help me welcome,
Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin.
