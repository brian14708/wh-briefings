THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thanks, everybody, for being here — and
particularly you for hosting us, Mayor.

Look, we’re here to talk about extreme weather.  We’re here to talk
about a briefing my — from my team on what we’re going to face this
summer.  And it’s going to be significant.

And, by the way, you’ve got the guy running this show doing the elevator
too.  I get in the elev- — he’s operating the elevator.  He does it all,
man.  I tell you what.

So, we — we’re going to face a tough summer, but we’ve taken significant
steps to ameliorate the concerns. 

That’s what we want to talk about, so why don’t we get started.  Why
don’t we get the meeting underway.
