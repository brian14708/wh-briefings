PRESIDENT BIDEN:  (Inaudible) this conference, but welcome, again.  And,
look, you know, the last few months on the battlefield, you’ve shown
that the stories about your demise are not true, that you’re doing —
you- — you’re holding them back.   
  
And the fact is that over the past few months, the battle for Ukraine
has shifted.  But Ukraine stopped Russia for Kharkiv, number one.  And
you should be complimented for that.  Number two, you blunted Russia’s
advances, you’ve imposed significant costs on Russia, and — and you made
it clear Russia will not prevail in Ukraine — will not prevail in
Ukraine.  Ukraine will prevail.   
  
And I want you to know we’re going to be with you every step of the
way.   
  
Two days ago, I announced a historic donation of air defense equipment
to Ukraine.  Today, I’m proud to announce a new security systems package
for Ukraine.  This will be the eighth package I have authorized since
we’ve signed the national security bill.  The Secretary of Defense, we
can talk about what the details of all that are.  I signed it yesterd- —
or last night, I guess.   
  
And — and we’re working with our NATO Allies to ensure Ukraine is flying
F-16s this summer.  And we’ve showed the world that we stand with
Ukraine now and in the future.   
  
So, Mr. President, thank you again for being here.  We got a lot of work
to do together.  And I yield the floor to you.  
  
PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.  Thank you very
much for the invitation to the summit, and thank you for such strong
news about secur- — new security package.  And I’m grateful to you; your
team; your administration; of course, Congress — both parties, both
chambers; and all Americans for — for their vital and your strong
support of Ukraine and Ukrainian people.  
  
Together, we are saving lives of our people.  You mentioned about
Kharkiv.  Thanks to your support, and thanks to our soldiers.  Really,
it was — it was tough work, but they — they did it. 

And together, we are preserving Ukraine’s independence and freedom.  And
these are historic actions that will protect the world from — from
similar wars.   
  
And I especially want to thank today President Biden for his support and
personal statement following the Russian strike on the children’s
hospital in —  
  
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  That was sick.  
  
PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY: — in Kyiv.  Yes.  
  
This is our largest children’s hospital, and it was a direct hit by
Russian missile.  That is why we have — greatly appreciate your
decisions to strengthen our air defense — the five new Patriots and
other — dozens of other systems.

And — and we have — and I want also to speak today how we can continue
this support.  And I also want to discuss, Mr. President, how we can
quickly and decisively stop Russian terror with this big problem for us,
its guided bombs.  And, of course, we need some quick steps — some to
lift all limitations for our Ukrainian soldiers.   
  
And, of course, we are thankful for — for — that you helped us to save
our energy.  It’s tough (inaudible) for people without energy.  But
anyway, we are thankful to you and partners.  And, of course, we will
discuss achieving a just end to the war.  
  
We must end this war justly and for peace to return as soon as
possible.  We need a second peace summit this year.  Thank you for your
participation.  And we are counting heavily on America’s support in
this.   
  
God bless America.  *Slava Ukraini*.  
  
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  We will stay with you, period.  
  
Thank you, press.  
  
PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY:  Thank you.  
  
Q    Mr. President, your — is your decision final?  
  
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  I support Ukraine to the end.
