THE PRESIDENT:  Thanks for coming, folks.  I’ve been thoroughly briefed
by all the agencies in the federal government as to the situation, based
on what we know now.

I have tried to get a hold of Donald.  He’s with his doctors.  They —
apparently, he’s doing well.  I plan on talking to him shortly, I hope,
when I get back to the telephone.

Look, there is no place in America for this kind of violence.  It’s
sick.  It’s sick.  It’s one of the reasons why we have to unite this
country.  We cannot allow for this to be happening.  We cannot be like
this.  We cannot condone this. 

And so — and I want to thank the Secret Service and all the agencies,
including the state agencies, that have been engaged in making sure that
the people who — and we have more detail to come relative to the other
injured — other people who may be injured in the audience.  I don’t have
all that detail, but we’ll make that available to you. 

I may be able to come back a little later tonight.  But we’ll put out a
statement if we don’t — if I am not able to give — if we — if it’s not
convenient for you all. 

But the bottom line is that the ra- — the Trump rally was a rally that
he should have been able to con- — be conducted peacefully without any
problem.  But the idea — the idea that there’s political violence or
violence in America like this is just unheard of.  It was just not
appropriate.  And we — everybody — everybody must condemn it. 
Everybody. 

I’ll keep you informed.  And if I am able to speak to the — to Donald,
I’ll — I’ll let you know that as well. 

But so far, it appears he’s doing well.  Number one.

Number two, that they’re as thoroughly investigating what happened to
anyone else in the audience.  I have s- — we have some reports, but not
final reports. 

And every agency in the federal government, and I’ll be — and I’m going
back to — to my phone to speak with the federal agencies that are being
put together again to give me an updated briefing — has anything
happened, have they learned anymore in the last couple hours. 

So, thank you very much.  And I hope I get to speak to him tonight.  And
I’ll get to — back to you if I do.  Okay?

Q    Mr. President, do you think this was an assassination attempt?

THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t know enough to — I — I have — I have a — I have
an opinion, but I don’t have any facts.  So, I want to make sure we have
all the facts before I make some comment — any more comments. 

Thank you.
