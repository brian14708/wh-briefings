12:02 P.M. EDT  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Justin.  Thank you so much and for all
of your work and your continued leadership on this issue.   
   
So, hello, everyone.  It’s good to be with you.  I was just looking up
on the screen at — at the participants.  And I want to just thank you
before I start offering you a few comments.  But thank you for your
dedication and commitment to this issue.  
   
I know it’s been — it’s — you know, it’s frustrating.  It’s been
frustrating, but we are committed, and we are not giving up in any way
in terms of what we will do together on this most important issue.  
   
So today, we are joined by members of our administration and by leaders
who are activists, who are organizers, and who are the opinion leaders
of their communities.  
   
And we are fighting, all of us, together every day to safeguard and to
strengthen the freedom to vote.  
   
As many of you know and you were there earlier this month, I was in
Selma, like so many of us, to commemorate this year the 57th anniversary
of Bloody Sunday and to reaffirm that President Biden and I will
continue to fight for the freedom to vote by continuing to push Congress
to pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights
Advancement Act, which, of course, I was proud to sponsor when I was as
United States senator.  And we are committed through what we can do to
take executive action.  
   
So, last year, on the anniversary of Bloody Sunday, President Biden
signed an executive order that directed executive agencies to do
everything in their power to promote voting access and protect the
freedom to vote.  
   
And today, I’m proud to be joined by representatives of the 11 executive
agencies that have been working since that order was signed to create
ambitious and — and affirmative ways to use their legal authority to
accomplish our shared goals.  
   
Today, they will provide detailed updates on those efforts and will
solicit your perspective — your candid perspective is what we want and
need — on these important steps moving forward so that we can ensure
that they’re not only relevant but that they will hit the streets and
have an impact.   
   
Before they — they share the work that they are doing, I just want to
share three quick announcements.  As many of you know, disabled
Americans often face unique challenges in exercising their freedom to
vote.  
   
I had the honor of convening some of the leaders at — in my office here
in Washington, D.C., to have these discussions and — and to talk about
what we must do to address these challenges.   
   
And I don’t need to tell you all, you know, voting systems can be very
difficult for many people to use — and in particular, blind or
low-vision voters.  
   
Polling places can be extremely difficult to access for voters who use
wheelchairs or that fail — those voting locations that fail to offer
appropriate support for voters who are deaf or hard of hearing.  
   
In 2020, disabled Americans were almost twice as likely to experience
problems while voting than other populations.  And I think we all know
and agree this is completely unacceptable.  
   
So today, I’m proud to announce that the National Institute of Standards
and Technology is releasing a report that lays out a comprehensive
assessment of the barriers that disabled Americans face when they’re
voting and offers specific recommendations for what we must do with a
sense of urgency to break down those barriers — for example, including
more disabled people in the design of election procedures because, of
course, we should be having the leaders lead and — and not replacing
what we think is — is important with what leaders can tell us is
important.  
   
And it’s about also conducting more regular and more comprehensive
accessibility audits of voting sites and systems so that we can make
sure what we intend is actually happening.  
   
Today, we are also announcing new steps to protect the voting rights of
members of Tribal Nations and Native communities.  
   
Last year, I brought together a group of Tribal leaders and leaders from
Native American and Alaska Native communities here at the White House to
discuss the discrimination and the exclusion that Native Americans have
experienced historically and continue to experience in exercising their
freedom to vote.  
   
And I brought them in to also strategize about what we must do as a
nation to correct that obvious injustice.  
   
So, today, informed by those conversations and many others, our
administration is releasing a set of proposed actions that elections
officials and federal, state, and local policymakers can and really must
take to help secure the freedom to vote for members of Tribal Nations
and Native communities.  
   
For example, improving and expanding postal service in Native
communities so that more people can vote by mail and increasing the
number of polling places in those communities to make in-person voting
more accessible.  
   
Finally, today, we are announcing new guidance that will make it easier
for federal employees to vote and to serve as nonpartisan election
workers by giving them more paid time off to participate in our
democracy and more flexibility in being able to use that time off — for
example, to cast a ballot early or to serve as a poll worker in federal,
state, local, Tribal, or territorial elections.   
   
We believe the federal government should serve as a model employer —
and, by the way, we’re the largest employer in the country, so we can do
this and we should do this — and then therefore serve as a model
employer when it comes to helping employees participate in their
democracy.  And we’re going to therefore call on all employers to do the
same.    
   
The President and I have the full power of the executive branch behind
this effort.  And I commend the agencies that are here today for your
innovative work.   
   
It is going to take — it will continue to take an all-hands-on-deck
approach to protect our democracy.  And together, with your help, I know
we can safeguard and strengthen the freedom to vote for generations to
come.  
   
Thank you all for the work you do.  Thank you for the work you do.  It’s
hard work.  It is work that is done with great commitment and conviction
and passion and, obviously, a very profound sense of purpose.   
   
As you know, the President and I — we — we hold bilateral meetings with
heads of nations around the world.  We travel.  The President right now
is, of course, overseas.  And we talk about and believe ourselves to be
a — one of the best, if not the best, models of a democracy.  And this
issue of voting rights and the freedom to vote, I think we all know, is
one of the most important pillars and indications of that strength or
not.  
   
And so, this work is critical in terms of what it means to an
individual, what it means to society, what it means to our nation, and
what it means to our standing in the world.  And you all are doing the
work on the ground every day, and I can’t thank you enough.   
   
Take care.
