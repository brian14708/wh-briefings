PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Madam Ambassador, thank you very much.  And, Mr.
President, thanks for the welcome.  Thanks for having us here.  And to —
and we sent you our best.  We sent you Brzezinski as our ambassador, and
I’m glad he’s here as well.  
   
And, you know, as you and I have spoken before, Mr. Ambassador — excuse
me, Mr. President — the single-most important thing that we can do from
the outset is keep the democracies united in our opposition and our
effort to curtail  
the devastation that is occurring at the hands of a man who, quite
frankly, I think is a war criminal.  And I think it will meet the legal
definition of that as well.  
   
But I want to thank everyone for — and I think it’s been a surprise —
about how we’ve all stayed together across the board.  The most severe
punishing sanctions in the history of the world — economic sanctions —
have been imposed.  And there’s more that will come.  
   
But, you know, there’s still an awful lot of suffering.  I, like many of
you, in the past have been through refugee camps all around the world,
literally, and seen the devastation as a consequence of people who were
abandoned and — in war-ravaged regions of the world, whether it’s in the
Middle East, or Africa, or wherever.   
   
I mean, it’s just devastating to see those little babies, little
children, who are looking at mothers who — you don’t have to understand
the language they speak — you just see in their eyes the pain.  And I
mean, literally, the pain of watching their children.  
   
I don’t think there’s anything worse for a parent than to see a child
suffering — their child suffering.  I mean that sincerely.  It’s not
hyperbole.  I mean it from the bottom of my heart.  
   
And so what you, the humanitarian community, are doing is of such
enormous consequence.  
   
Brother, this is what we say we’re about.  This is what we say that our
obligations are.  But you’re living up to it.  We’re doing it every day,
all of you who are sitting at this table.  
   
And so, you know, I’m here in Poland to see firsthand the humanitarian
crisis.  And quite frankly, part of my disappointment is that I can’t
see it firsthand, like I have in other places — they will not let me,
understandably; I guess it would cross the border — and take a look at
what’s going on in Ukraine.   
   
But, you know, I’m eager to hear from you, the humanitarian community,
about what you see, what you’re doing, and where you think we go from
here — because you’re doing it every day.  
   
As has been pointed out, 10 million people have been displaced thus far;
3.8 million people to other countries, including more than a million
children.  And according to the U.N., there are thousands of civilian
casualties, 12 million in need of assistance, but hundreds of thousands
— hundreds of thousands of people who are being cut off from help by
Russian forces and are in — besieged in places like Mariupol.  I mean,
it’s not stopping.  It’s like something out of a science fiction movie. 
You turn on the television and see what these towns look like, and the
cities.   
   
And I want to thank each one of you and your organizations.  Excuse me. 
(Takes sip of a drink.)  When I was visiting our troops, they had pizza
pie with hot peppers on it.  (Laughter.)  
   
But, you know, you’re helping millions of people — millions of people. 
And we must — have to continue to scale up that assistance and
coordinate it closely with the government of Ukraine, which is really —
I think even you Poles, who know Ukraine so well, have to be a little
bit surprised at how what — how much courage and capacity for resiliency
of the Ukrainian people.  When you see a 30-year-old woman standing
there in front of a tank with a rifle — I mean, talk about what happened
in Tiananmen Square; that’s Tiananmen Square squared.    
   
And, look, the — whether it’s food or a blanket or cash or the care for
medical teams that we send in, or child welfare specialists, they need
it now.  They need it as rapidly as we can get it there.  
   
And so, yesterday I announced, on behalf of the American people, we’re
prepared to provide another 1 billion, as the Ambassador pointed out — 1
billion dollars for those who fled and those who are affected around the
world as a consequence of the negative impact of this war on food
security.   
   
The bad news is they’re — been the breadbasket of the world, Ukraine and
Russia.  But we, the United States, are going to do our part because
we’re the third-largest producer of wheat in the world.  And our
Canadian friends are going to do the same thing.  But we’re going to try
very hard.  
   
But in the meantime, the suffering that is taking place now is at your
doorstep.  You’re the ones who are risking, in some cases, your lives
and risking all you know to try to help.  And the American people are
proud to support your efforts.    
   
And today, I want to hear from all of you.  The problem is I know
they’re going to tell me I have to get on the plane, and I’m going to
have to leave.  But I have a lot of questions because I — I really mean
it — I learned a great deal from you and your counterparts as I’ve
traveled the world in the last 30 years.   
   
And so, I’m honored that President Duda is here today.  And I’m joined
by Secretary Blinken — he’s an old friend, as well as my Secretary of
State; and our USID — USAID Administrator, Samantha Powers, who, like my
sister — whatever I say, she says, “It’s not enough.”  “It’s not
enough.  I don’t get to do more.”  And this is a workhorse.   
   
So — but now going to turn it back to her so we can get to the
question-and-answer period.  
   
ADMINISTRATOR POWER:  Thank you so much.  Thank you, Mr. President.   
   
President Duda, I’d love — if you’d like to say a few words.  And before
you do though, just — I think, on the behalf of the entire humanitarian
community, we just want to extend our thanks to you for the way that you
and the Polish people have opened your borders, your hearts, your
homes.  The generosity and the show of solidarity has been
breathtaking.  Thank you so much, sir.  Over to you.   
   
PRESIDENT DUDA:  Thank you very much, Madam Ambassador.  
   
Excellency, Mr. President; Mr. Secretary; Madam Ambassador; Polish and
American friends: Please, if you can take these electronic devices and
use it — channel two is English — because I would like to speak in my
mother tongue, Polish.  
   
(As interpreted.)  Your Excellency, Mr. President; dear American and
Polish friends; ladies and gentlemen: Thank you so much to you, Mr.
President, and to the whole U.S. delegation for coming to Poland.  But
first and foremost, thank you for coming here to Rzeszów, to the region
of Podkarpackie, which is very close — which is located directly to the
Polish-Ukrainian border.   
   
Thank you for coming to the place where this influx of refugees to
Poland is the biggest.  Your presence here, Mr. President, first of all,
sends a very big sign of unity.  This is a huge sign of support and
Euro-Atlantic unity — unity with my country, with Poland.  It
demonstrates great friendship between Poland and the United States, and
a very profound alliance.   
   
This is an evidence of great support and care for our mutual relations,
but also — a thing of importance to me — it is a sign and a message that
you care about the security of Poland.   
   
Today, Mr. President, you met with U.S. soldiers who are deployed here
and who watch over our security.  They also help in this very difficult
work, which is receiving millions of refugees who are crossing the
border to our country right now.  But first and foremost, they are
guarding the security of the Polish border and guarding the security
also of the entire Euro-Atlantic community of the whole of NATO —
because, today, the eastern flank of NATO — and I do not hesitate to say
this; I also said it yesterday at NATO summit — this is a front line
today, the eastern flank.   
   
I’m very happy to have you here, Mr. President, because as I said, your
presence here sends a great signal and evidence of unity — unity within
NATO.  It demonstrates a huge support and also a big significance
attached by the United States to the stability and world peace, to
reinstating the peace where difficult situations are happening in places
where somebody resorts to acts of aggression against other democratic
and free nations, as it is happening today against Ukraine where the
Russian aggression, unfortunately, happening for a month now is
effect.  
   
But your presence, Mr. President, here today in the city of Rzeszów is
also a great sign of support to us — support in terms of humanitarian
assistance, which today is provided to the refugees from Ukraine, but
also it is provided to us Poles who are receiving guests — because this
is the name we want to apply to them.  We do not call them “refugees.” 
They are our guests, our brothers, our neighbors from Ukraine who today
are in a very difficult situation where 12 million people have fled
their houses by the war, by the Russian attacks.  More than 3.5 million
have already fled abroad.  They crossed different borders, but first and
foremost, they have crossed the border with Poland.  
   
Today, we have got 2.5 million people in Poland, and the number is
growing all the time.  So, the number — exceeding 2 million right now —
is still growing.  And all signs are that if the Russian aggression
continues, those numbers will continue to grow.    
   
So, first and foremost, this — it gives me an opportunity to extend my
gratitude to you, Mr. President, to our guests from the United States,
but also to the NGOs, both from my country — starting from the
organizations which are present here at this table today — but also, I
want to express my gratitude to all NGOs — Polish NGOs who are
involved.   
   
But also, I would like to thank the U.S. organizations.  A big number of
them is already present in Poland, and a lot of them sends assistance to
our country.  And in this context, I’m so much grateful to you, Mr.
President, for your support.    
   
But also, I would like to ask you to convey my personal words of thanks
to the First Lady of the United States, to Mrs. Jill Biden — your
spouse, Mr. President.  And please convey very heartfelt greetings from
my wife to your wife.  Both ladies had a conversation a couple of days
ago.  My wife gave an account of the situation in Poland.  Both ladies
exchanged their views on the possibilities of help.  Then my wife paid a
visit to the United States.  And from the United States, she brought —
in order to support Ukraine; in order to support Ukraine hospitals and
also centers here in Poland, which treats children from Ukraine, also
wounded children from Ukraine — she brought from the United States a
number of medical equipment and medicines from the United States.   
   
So, thank you so much for this very swift assistance.  Thank you so
much.  And please convey these words of greetings and these words of
thanks to your wife.  And also, please convey very heartfelt wishes from
my wife to your wife.    
   
So, ladies and gentlemen, this presents a huge challenge.  This
assistance is something unprecedented, because within a couple of weeks,
more than 2 million people have come to our country.  We have never
experienced anything like that throughout our history.  This is the
first time.  
   
But I would also like to thank all my compatriots who have opened their
hearts and opened their houses, who have welcomed refugees — but as I
said, first and foremost, our neighbors, our brothers from Ukraine — who
are in a difficult position today, who are in need today.  And all of us
want to help them so much.  They are staying in private houses, and
they’re staying in different facilities.  Very often, these people are
very much affected by the war — wounded persons, ill persons.  Many of
them have undergone mental trauma after the experiences they had.   
   
Recently we have received people without any belongings to Poland.  They
fled from bombs.  So the situation is extremely difficult.  That is why
we are so much thankful for any help and assistance, because this is
what we very much need today.    
   
On our part, we are doing everything we can with huge dedication and
devotion.  NGOs have also demonstrated huge dedication.  Also
volunteers, firefighters.  So there is a lot of assistance from NGOs,
from churches — Catholic church, but also other churches in our country
and religious communities.   
   
There is a lot of support offered from all different sides, also from
abroad.  And once again, we’re so much grateful for that.  This presents
a huge challenge to us, but it is also a huge challenge to the whole
free world as we understand it, and we all have to live up to it.   
   
Once again, thank you for this visit.  And I’m so happy and delighted
with the conversation that we can have.  All the authorities in Poland
are involved in providing assistance.  It’s not only the government,
NGOs, and volunteers, but also local governments.    
   
Tomorrow, Mr. President, you will meet refugees in Warsaw.  But also,
the Prime Minister of the Polish government will be present there, Mr.
Mateusz Morawiecki.  The Mayor of Warsaw, Mr. Rafał Trzaskowski, will be
there.  And they will share with you, sir, all the activities that are
being conducted in Poland in order to live up to this difficult
situation, in order to solve the problem.  
   
So, once again, we are delighted with the visit you are paying here,
sir, and a very warm welcome to our country.   
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  I’m going to get in real trouble if I don’t — I forgot
to say something: My wife sends her best as well.  She also went to St.
Jude’s Hospital, which is a cancer hospital in the United States, to see
those young Ukrainian children who were brought over seeking serious,
serious help with the cancers they have.  And she said to give her best
to your wife.  That’s why she’s not with me today.  She’s out west doing
that.  So, thank you.  Thank you for saving me.  
   
ADMINISTRATOR POWER:  (Laughs.)  Thank you, Mr. President.  And thank
you, President Duda, so much.  If I may just ask now the media to leave
the room — thank you so much for being — so we can commence our
discussion on the humanitarian circumstances.  Thank you so much.  
   
(The press departs.)
