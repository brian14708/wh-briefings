Roosevelt Room

11:25 A.M. EST     
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning, folks.  Sorry to keep you waiting.  I was
on a couple of phone calls.    
   
Today I’m announcing the United States is targeting the main artery of
Russia’s economy.    
   
We’re banning all imports of Russian oil and gas and energy.  
   
That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at U.S. ports, and
the American people will deal another powerful blow to Putin’s war
machine.  
   
This is a move that has strong bipartisan support in the Congress and, I
believe, in the country.  
   
Americans have rallied support — have rallied to support the Ukrainian
people and made it clear we will not be part of subsidizing Putin’s
war.  
   
This made — we made this decision in close consultation with our Allies
and our partners around the world, particularly in Europe, because a
united response to Putin’s aggression has been my overriding focus, to
keep all NATO and all of the EU and our allies totally united.  
   
We’re moving forward on this ban, understanding that many of our
European Allies and partners may not be in a position to join us.   
   
The United States produces far more oil domestically than all of
European — all the European countries combined.  In fact, we’re a net
exporter of energy.  So we can take this step when others cannot.  
   
But we’re working closely with Europe and our partners to develop a
long-term strategy to reduce their dependence on Russian energy as
well.  
   
Our teams are actively discussing how to make this happen.  And today,
we remain united — we remain united in our purpose to keep pressure
mounting on Putin and his war machine.  
   
This is a step that we’re taking to inflict further pain on Putin.  But
there will be costs as well here in the United States.  I said I would
level with the American people from the beginning.  And when I first
spoke to this, I said defending freedom is going to cost — it’s going to
cost us as well, in the United States.  
   
Republicans and Democrats understand — alike understand that. 
Republicans and Democrats alike have been clear that we must do
this.    
   
Over the last week, I’ve spoken with President Zelenskyy several times
to hear from him about the situation on the ground and to consult and
continuing to consult with our European allies and — about U.S. support
for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.  
   
Thus far, we’ve provided more than $1 billion in security assistance to
Ukraine.  Shipments of defensive weapons are arriving in Ukraine every
day from the United States.  And we, the United States, are the ones
coordinating the delivery of our Allies and partners of similar weapons,
from Germany to Finland to the Netherlands.  We’re accom- — we’re —
we’re working that out.   
   
We’re also providing humanitarian support for the Ukrainian people, both
those still in Ukraine and those who have fled safely to a neighboring
country.   
   
We’re working with humanitarian organizations to surge tens of thousands
of tons of food, water, and medical supplies into Ukraine, and with more
on the way.  
   
Over the weekend, I sent Secretary Blinken to visit our border between —
the border Poland and Ukraine and to Moldova to see what the situation
was firsthand and report back.  
   
General Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of our Defense
Department, is also — was also in Europe, meeting with his counterparts
and Allies on NATO’s eastern flank to reassure them — those countries
bordering Russia, NATO countries — that we will keep our NATO commitment
— a sacred commitment to Article — of Article 5.  
   
The Vice President Harris is going to be traveling to meet with our
allies in Poland and Romania later this week as well.  
   
I’ve made it clear that the United States will share in the
responsibility of caring for the refugees so the costs do not fall
entirely on the European countries bordering Ukraine.  
   
And yesterday I spoke with my counterparts from France, Germany, and the
United Kingdom about Russia’s escalating violence against Ukraine and
the steps that we’re going to take together with our Allies and partners
around the world to respond to this aggression.  
   
We are enforcing the most significant package of economic sanctions in
history, and it’s causing significant damage to Russia’s economy.   
   
It has caused the Russian economy to, quite frankly, crater.  The
Russian ruble is now down to 50 percent — by 50 percent since Putin
announced his war.  One ruble is now worth less than one American
penny.  One ruble is less than one American penny.  
      
And preventing Russia’s Central Bank from propping up the ruble and to
keep its value up.  They’re not going to be able to do that now.  
   
We cut Russia’s largest banks from the international financial system,
and it’s crippled their ability to do business with the rest of the
world.    
   
In addition, we’re choking off Russia’s access to technology, like
semiconductors that are — and sap its economic strength and weaken its
military for years to come.  
   
Major companies are pulling out of Russia entirely, without even being
asked — not by us.  Over the weekend, Visa, Mastercard, American Express
— they all suspended their services in Russia.  All of them.  
   
Joining a growing list of American and global companies from Ford to
Nike to Apple, they’ve suspended their operations in Russia.  
   
The U.S. stock exchange has halted trading of many Russian securities. 
And the private sector is standing united against Russia’s vicious war
of choice.   
   
The U.S. Department of Justice has assembled a dedicated task force to
go after Russian — the crimes of Russian oligarchs.  
   
And we’re joining with our European allies to find and seize their
yachts, their luxury apartments, their private jets, and all their
ill-begotten gains to make sure they share in the pain of Putin’s
war.   
   
These, by the way, are giant yachts.  You put some of them in your
press.  I mean, some of them are — I think I read one was over 400 feet
long.  I mean, it’s — this is worth hundreds of millions of dollars.  
   
The decision today is not without cost here at home.  Putin’s war is
already hurting American families at the gas pump.   
   
Since Putin began his military buildup on Ukrainian borders, just since
then, the price of the gas at the pump in America went up 75 cents.  And
with this action, it’s going to go up further.  
   
I’m going to do everything I can to minimize Putin’s price hike here at
home.  In coordination with our partners, we’ve already announced that
we’re releasing 60 million barrels of oil from our joint oil reserves. 
Half of that — 30 billion — million — excuse me — is coming from the
United States.  
   
And we’re taking steps to ensure the reliable supply of global energy.  
   
And we’re also going to keep working with every tool at our disposal to
protect American families and businesses.  
   
Now, let me — let me say this.  To the oil and gas companies and to the
finance firms that back them: We understand Putin’s war against the
people of Ukraine is causing prices to rise.  We get that.  That’s
self-evident.  But — but, but, but — it’s no excuse to exercise
excessive price increases or padding profits or any kind of effort to
exploit this situation or Ameri- — or American consumers — exploit
them.  
   
Russia’s aggression is costing us all, and it’s no time for profiteering
or price gouging.  
   
I want to be clear about what we’ll not tolerate, but I also want to
acknowledge those firms in oil and gas industries that are pulling out
of Russia and joining other businesses that are leading by example.  
   
This is a time when we have to do our part and make sure we’re not
taking — we’re not taking advantage.  
   
Look, let me be clear about two other points.  First, it’s simply not
true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy
production.  That’s simply not true.  
   
Even amid the pandemic, companies in the United States pumped more oil
during my first year in office than they did during my predecessor’s
first year.  
   
We’re approaching record levels of oil and gas production in the United
States, and we’re on track to set a record of oil production next
year.   
   
In the United States, 90 percent of onshore oil production takes place
on land that isn’t owned by the federal government.  And of the
remaining 10 percent that occurs on federal land, the oil and gas
industry has millions of acres leased.  They have 9,000 permits to drill
now.  They could be drilling right now, yesterday, last week, last
year.  They have 9,000 to drill onshore that are already approved.   
   
So let me be clear — let me be clear: They are not using them for
production now.  That’s their decision.  These are the facts.  We should
be honest about the facts.   
   
Second, this crisis is a stark reminder: To protect our economy over the
long term, we need to become energy independent.  
   
I’ve had numerous conversations over the last three months with our
European friends of how they have to wean themselves off of Russia —
Russian oil.  It’s just not — it’s just not tenable.  
   
It should motivate us to accelerate the transition to clean energy. 
This is a perspective, as I said, that our European allies share and the
— a future where together we can achieve greater independence.  
   
Loosening environmental regulations or pulling back clean energy
investment won’t — let me explain — won’t — will not lower energy prices
for families.  But transforming our economy to run on electric vehicles
powered by clean energy with tax credits to help American families
winterize their homes and use less energy, that will — that will help.  
   
And if we can — if we do what we can, it will mean that no one has to
worry about the price at the gas pump in the future.  
   
That’ll mean tyrants like Putin won’t be able to use fossil fuels as
weapons against other nations.  
   
And it will make America a world leader manufacturing and exporting
clean energy technologies of the future to countries all around the
world.    
   
This is the goal we should be racing toward.  
   
Over the last two weeks, the Ukrainian people have inspired the world —
and I mean that in a literal sense.  They’ve inspired the world with
their bravery, their patriotism, their defiant determination to live
free.  
   
Putin’s war — Putin’s war has caused enormous suffering and needless
loss of life of women, children, everyone in Ukraine — both Ukraine and,
I might add, Russians.   
   
Ukrainian leaders, as well as leaders around the world, have repeatedly
called for a ceasefire, for humanitarian relief, for real diplomacy. 
But Putin seems determined to continue on his murderous path no matter
the cost.   
   
Putin is now targeting cities and has been targeting cities and
civilians — schools, hospitals, apartment buildings.  
   
Last week, he attacked the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, with
an apparent disregard for the potential of triggering a nuclear
meltdown.   
   
He has already turned 2 million Ukrainians into refugees.  
   
Russia may continue to grind out its advance at a horrible price, but
this much is already clear: Ukraine will never be a victory for Putin.  
   
Putin may be able to take a city, but he’ll never be able to hold the
country.  And if we do not respond to Putin’s assault on global peace
and stability today, the cost of freedom and to the American people will
be even greater tomorrow.    
   
So we’re going to continue to support the brave Ukrainian people as they
fight for their country.  And I call on Congress to pass the $12 billion
Ukraine assistance package that I have asked them for of late.   
   
The Ukrainian people are demonstrating by their physical courage that
they are not about to just let Putin take what he wants.  That’s clear. 
They’ll defend their freedom, their democracy, their lives.   
   
And we’re going to keep providing security assistance, economic
assistance, and humanitarian assistance.  We’re going to support them
against tyranny, oppression, violent acts of subjugation.   
   
People everywhere — and I think it’s maybe even surprised some of you
all — people everywhere are speaking up for freedom.  And when the
history of this war is written, Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left
Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.  
   
May God bless all those heroes of Ukraine.  And now I’m off to Texas. 
Thank you very, very much.   
   
(Cross-talk by reporters.)  
   
I know there’s a lot of que- —  
   
Q    Mr. President, will you cut off trade with Russia? Will you cut off
trade with Russia?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I know — I know there’s a lot of questions, but there’s
a lot more that has to be made clear.  And I’m going to hold on that
until we get more information.  Thank you.  Appreciate it.
