Throughout our history we’ve learned this lesson – when dictators do not
pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos. They keep
moving. And, the costs and threats to America and the world keep
rising.  
  
That’s why the NATO Alliance was created to secure peace and stability
in Europe after World War 2. The United States is a member along with 29
other nations.  
  
It matters. American diplomacy matters.  
  
Putin’s war was premeditated and unprovoked. He rejected efforts at
diplomacy. He thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. And, he
thought he could divide us here at home.  
  
Putin was wrong. We were ready.

We have a choice. One way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and
make Americans poorer. I have a better plan to fight inflation.  
  
Lower your costs, not your wages. Make more cars and semiconductors in
America. More infrastructure and innovation in America. More goods
moving faster and cheaper in America. More jobs where you can earn a
good living in America. And, instead of relying on foreign supply chains
– let’s make it in America.  
  
Economists call it “increasing the productive capacity of our economy.”
I call it building a better America.  
  
My plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit.
