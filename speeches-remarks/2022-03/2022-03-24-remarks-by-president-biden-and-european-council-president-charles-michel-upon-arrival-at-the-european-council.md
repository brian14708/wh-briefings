Europa Building  
Brussels, Belgium

7:19 P.M. CET  
   
PRESIDENT MICHEL:  We are very pleased, dear President, dear Joe, to
welcome you again in Brussels.  Your presence here and your
participation in this European Council meeting is a very strong
signal.   
   
Our unity is rock solid, and we are very, very pleased to coordinate, to
cooperate with you.  These are difficult times, challenging times, and
we need to take the right and the intelligent decisions for the future
and for the security, for the stability.   
   
And thank you for this excellent cooperation and coordination.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, I came to congratulate a man who just got
reelected without opposition.  I dream about that someday.  
   
But, look, from the very beginning, I was of the view: The single most
important thing that we have to do in the West is be united.  I’m not
saying that — that’s not a euphemism.  I mean it literally. 
Literally.  
   
I spent some time with Vladimir Putin back in November and December, and
we had a conference in — in Switzerland, at the time.  And it was clear
to me, and it was to you, that his intentions were very different than
benign intentions.  
   
And one of the things that he’s tried to do — his overwhelming objective
— and I’ve been speaking about it for a year and a half.  His
overwhelming objective is to demonstrate that democracies cannot
function in the 21st century — because things are moving so rapidly,
they require consensus, and it’s too difficult to get consensus — and
autocracies are going to rule.  
   
As a matter of fact, we’ve lost more democratic in- — democratic
countries — fewer democratic countries today than there were 10 years
ago.  
   
And so, from the very beginning, my objective — and I had a great
partner in this — was to see to it that we built total, complete unity
among the major democracies of the world.  I’m not joking about that.   
   
That’s why I called just a couple weeks ago and asked NATO to set up a
new — a NATO meeting of the heads of state, and it was took — which took
place today.  And I fortunately am able to attend two other
conferences.  
   
But my point is: unity.  Unity.  And the very thing that Putin has tried
to do from the beginning — and I’ve been saying this since my days as
Vice President of the United States — is to break up NATO — break up
NATO.  He’d rather face 30 independent countries than 30 united
countries with the United States of America.  Not a joke.  I’m being
deadly earnest.  I believe that’s been his intention from the very, very
beginning.  
   
And so, what I want to thank Michel for is the — Michel — is that the
whole idea of the unity of Europe as a whole, not just NATO — the G7 and
this organization — really matters.  It’s the single most important
thing that we can do to stop this guy who’s — in our country, we believe
he’s already committed war crimes.  
   
But thank you very much for the time, and thank you.  
   
PRESIDENT MICHEL:  Thank you.  Thank you.  
   
Q    Mr. President, do you trust China?  Do you trust China?  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Yes.  Well, we’ll discuss China.  I’ve spent some time
with Xi Jinping.  And I hope we’re going to get a chance to discuss
China.
