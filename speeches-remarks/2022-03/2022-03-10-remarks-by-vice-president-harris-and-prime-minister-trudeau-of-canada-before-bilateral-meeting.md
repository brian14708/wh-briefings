*Warsaw Marriott Hotel  
*Warsaw, Poland**

6:48 P.M. CET  
  
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Mr. Prime Minister, it’s good to see you.  And
as part of the strong, enduring, lasting, and deep friendship between
the United States and Canada, we find ourselves by coincidence, or maybe
fate, to be here in Warsaw at the same time, with the same purpose,
which is to continually reaffirm the strength of the NATO Alliance and
our two countries’ commitment, in that regard, to Ukraine — the people
of Ukraine — and, as we are here in Warsaw, also the people of Poland.  
  
And so, it is good to see you.  We have many things to discuss — in
particular, what we can continue to do together to strengthen our
assistance in terms of security assistance, humanitarian assistance to
the people of Ukraine, what we can continue to do to coordinate and
collaborate within the NATO Alliance and with our EU partners in terms
of the ongoing needs and the dynamic nature of what we are presented
with in terms of this crisis.  
  
I know we stand in solidarity in terms of our outrage at this war and
the aggression that Russia has taken against Ukraine, unprovoked,
unjustified.  And we value, of course, the territorial integrity and
sovereignty of Ukraine and look forward to continuing our partnership in
that regard.   
  
So, thank you.   
  
PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU:  Thank you so much, Madam Vice President.  It’s
a real pleasure to see you again and to see us once again standing so
strongly, side to side, on issues that matter so deeply.   
  
You, yourself, and the Biden administration, and President Biden
particularly, have been so strong on this issue, coordinating likeminded
countries over the past week to prepare for this possibility of the
unthinkable — of Russia invading Ukraine.  And so, when it did, the kind
of alignment, the kind of strength of unity that we’ve shown, I think,
has really made a difference.   
  
First of all, Vladimir Putin totally underestimated the strength and
resolve of the Ukrainian people.  But he also underestimated the
strength and resolve of democracies to stand up in support of Ukraine
but in support of those values and principles that underlie everything
we do.   
  
So, from crippling sanctions on Putin and his top supporters, to
unprecedented humanitarian aid, to security and military support for
Ukrainians who are fighting not just for Ukraine but for all of us, we
continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder and will continue to.  
  
We also have lots of other things to discuss.  But obviously, the
priority that brings us both to Warsaw is our standing with Ukrainians
and all Eastern Europeans as we reinforce the eastern flank of NATO and
continue to do the work that matters in the world.
