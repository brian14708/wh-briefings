  \ Poland in Joint Press\_Conference"

*Belweder Palace  
Warsaw, Poland*

12:57 P.M. CET  
   
PRESIDENT DUDA:  (As interpreted.)  Your Excellency and distinguished
Madam Vice President of the United States of America, distinguished
ladies and gentlemen: This is a very important moment in our relations. 
But, first and foremost, under these circumstances which we are facing
right now in Europe, behind our Eastern border, in Ukraine — friendly to
us and with us — where the Russian troops are carrying out a barbarious
aggression and murdering innocent people, murdering civilians, bombing
maternity hospitals from which, under dramatic circumstances, wounded
women right before labor — are being carried out.  
   
None of us has ever expected that we would be able to see such things in
the 21st century.  
   
Especially it is a great satisfaction to all of us here in Poland that
Madam Vice President of the United States of America, Ms. Kamala Harris,
is here with us in Warsaw, in our country.  
   
And she’s demonstrating that strength and depth of the atlantic —
transatlantic and Allied bond, demonstrating decisive engagement and
commitment of the United States to the security of NATO’s eastern flank
and to Europe as a whole.  
   
Let me stress very forcefully: There is no doubt whatsoever that
together with the United States and our other Allies within the
framework of the North Atlantic Alliance, and along with the entire free
and honest world, we stand with Ukraine.  We stand with Ukraine, and we
will try to do our best to make sure that Ukraine can be defended.  
   
Thank you very much, Madam Vice President, for coming.  Thank you for
our meetings today, for the conversations that we have had.  
   
We had a meeting just a couple of minutes ago.  We had a private
meeting, a tête-à-tête meeting.  And we also met with Polish and
American delegations.  We discussed all the important topics.  And I
highlighted very forcefully how important it is, and I thanked also for
the position of the President of the United States, Mr. Joe Biden.  I
thanked for the position of Madam Vice President and her team.  But I
also thanked for the position of the U.S. Congress.    
   
I thanked for this necessity and, actually, the imposition of effective
sanctions on the Russian Federation.  The United States is in the
vanguard of those sanctions, and, speaking honestly, these sanctions are
working.  
   
Above all, thank you also for all the support which is being provided to
the fight in Ukraine — to Ukraine, which is defending itself.  
   
Thank you for the humanitarian assistance, which is being supplied
there.  
   
And to you, Madam Vice President, I would like to thank for the
involvement of all the organizations and of all the NGOs that are being
involved in providing assistance — humanitarian assistance.  Also,
they’re providing medical aid.  They’re providing equipment for
children, for wounded, for the sick.  
   
My wife Agata is involved in this as well.  And I know that, in those
respect, she is in cooperation with various institutions from the United
States.  She is in contact with the First Lady of the United States,
Jill Biden.  
   
I’m very happy that this Polish-American cooperation is developing.  But
I’m pleased that it serves to provide common aid to the fight in Ukraine
and common aid to all those who are suffering, all those who need this
assistance from us.  
   
And today, I shared with Madam Vice President — I described the
situation that we are facing.  I said that, today, for a number of days
actually, we have been receiving refugees from Ukraine in Poland.  This
number is close to 1.5 million persons who have come to us.  And I’m
addressing my compatriots right now.  I was proud to tell Madam Vice
President that all those people have not been sent to any camps and
refugee camps.  They have been accepted and received by Polish families
in Polish homes.  They are accommodated in Polish hotels, in Polish spa
resorts, in Polish motels.  
   
Most often, however, they’re accommodated with private people.  They
have been received by ordinary Polish people who feel in their hearts
that they should extend a helping hand to the people in need.   
   
And I thank you so much for this, to my fellow Polish people.  This is a
reason to be proud for us, for the Polish authorities.  And I’m very,
very much grateful to you for that.   
   
At the same time, I asked Madam Vice President for support, as it is
quite obvious that such a huge refugee crisis is a surprise for Poland. 
And it is a complicated situation for Poland, for the Polish authorities
in the era of the crisis.  The prices are growing — of fuel prices are
growing; generally, the prices are growing.  That is why we do need this
support.  And I’m going to be hugely grateful for any form of support
because we have to survive this difficult time.  
   
And we have to do that by helping our neighbors, because that is
extremely important right now.   
   
However, first and foremost, we discussed security issues.  
   
The presence of Madam Vice President here in Poland is yet another
demonstration of U.S. presidents — of U.S. presence in Poland, next to
the U.S. troops that we have here, next to U.S. defensive systems that
are protecting our skies today and our land.  
   
We also have with us here today the political representation, the
top-level political representation of the United States, led by Madam
Vice President.    
   
And this is a very clear political message where important — most
important things are happening today on the global stage in Europe: We
have to rescue Ukraine.  All of us are acutely aware of that.  All hands
should be on board.  Ukraine needs to be helped.  And we have to stay
united in that respect.  We need to stand together in this respect
within the North Atlantic Alliance, keeping solidarity, speaking
absolutely with one voice, just as we have to stand together in the
European Union and in all the other international communities.  We have
to impose more sanctions on Russia.  
   
We cannot accept such military activities, which bear the
characteristics of the features of a genocide, because I don’t think
that anybody is in any doubt if hospitals are bombed, if hospitals are
bombed where pregnant women are staying, where children are staying,
when ordinary people are killed, where bombs are dropped, when missiles
are launched into residential houses where there are no military
installations, then this is an act of barbarity bearing the features of
a genocide.  It aims at eliminating and destroying a nation.  Hence, we
have to stand and present a very tough stance here as representatives of
the free world.   
   
And Poland stands here together with the United States of America, just
like — I have no doubt about that — our Allies stand with Ukraine and
all the honest authorities and states, especially democratic states.   
   
And at the end of our conversation, I mentioned the fact that we want to
boost our security also on our own here in Poland.  Also, thanks to the
purchase of American equipment for our armed forces, there are already
ongoing programs such as Patriot programs, such as HIMARS program, the
program of the purchase of F-35s, or the recently started program — the
purchase of Abrams tanks for Poland.   
   
I asked Madam Vice President that those programs should be accelerated
as far as this as possible, because we want to provide this
state-of-the-art equipment to our armed forces as soon as possible.    
   
If there is such a need — I think everybody can see that.  We do not
need to comment on this situation.  We are able to witness the dramatic
scenes unfolding in Ukraine every day in the media.  You can see those
horrific — horrifying scenes.   
   
But at the same time, we’re able to witness the huge heroism and
incredible determination of the Ukrainian people.  And we stand at the
side of the Ukrainian people.  We’re going to support them with all our
strength, but at the same time providing the security of our countries
which is of crucial importance to us.  
   
Once again, thank you very much, Madam Vice President, for coming to
Warsaw.  Thank you for this demonstration that we stand together and
that we are a huge Euro-Atlantic community of freedom and security. 
Thank you.   
   
I’d like to give the floor to Madam Vice President of the United States
of America.  Madam Kamala Harris.  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Thank you, President Duda, and for the warm
welcome under unfortunate circumstances, given what is happening in
Ukraine, our friend.  But I thank you for the warm welcome and for the
very constructive and productive conversations we had today as part of
our ongoing dialogue and friendship that spans generations.   
   
I would like to also speak directly to the Polish people.  I have shared
with your president that, under his leadership — and your leadership has
been extraordinary — the world has been watching Poland, Mr. President,
your leadership and the leadership of the people of your country.  And
we’ve witnessed extraordinary acts of generosity and kindness.  We have
seen through images on the television — looking at images of ordinary
people doing extraordinary things in support of the dignity and the
wellbeing of perfect strangers.  
   
So I, first and foremost, want to express the thanks for the people of
the United States to you, Mr. President, on behalf of our President, Joe
Biden, and to the people of Poland for what you are doing every day.  It
really represents the best of who we are.  
   
We are here and I am here in Poland today as part of an enduring,
longstanding friendship and commitment between the United States and
Poland based on shared values and priorities.    
   
I am here, standing here on the northern flank — on the eastern flank
talking about what we have in terms of the eastern flank and our NATO
Allies and what is at stake at this very moment.  What is at stake this
very moment are some of the guiding principles around the NATO Alliance
and, in particular, the issue and the importance of defending
sovereignty and territorial integrity, in this case, of Ukraine.  
   
As President Duda has described, we have been witnessing for weeks — and
certainly just in the last 24 hours — atrocities of unimaginable
proportion.  A maternity hospital, a children’s hospital, where we have
witnessed pregnant women who were there for care, for one reason — being
taken out, because they required care because of an act of violence —
unprovoked, unjustified.  
   
I am here, in Poland, as an expression of the enduring and important
relationship between the United States and Poland that, again, has been
longstanding, but, in particular on the issue of Ukraine, is unified and
is clear.  We will do everything together, in partnership, in
solidarity, to support what is necessary at this very moment in terms of
the humanitarian and security needs of Ukraine and the Ukrainian
people.   
   
Today, we discussed, Mr. President, many issues that relate to our
special bond also, because, I will say as a point of personal privilege,
we have a substantial Polish American community in my hometown of Los
Angeles but throughout the United States, who understands the
relationship that we have on many levels, including the diplomatic but
also cultural relationships that span generations.   
   
And so, through all of that and in the spirit of those relationships and
our shared commitments — our shared commitment to the importance of
international norms and rules — you and I discussed today many important
topics, in particular as it relates to the eastern flank.  And we talked
specifically about what we cared deeply about in terms of our commitment
— the United States commitment to Article 5.    
   
I’ve said it many times; I will say it again: The United States
commitment to Article 5 is ironclad.  The United States is prepared to
defend every inch of NATO territory.  The United States takes seriously
that an attack against one is an attack against all.  We are here today
to restate that commitment, but also do what we must do to reinforce our
support of Poland and our Allies through the EU and NATO Alliance.  
   
In particular, as it relates to troop deployment, we have recently
deployed an additional 4,700 American troops to Poland.  That’s on top
of the years of rotation of about 5,000 American troops in Poland.    
   
We are pleased to have announced this week that we have directed two
Patriot missile defense systems to Poland.  And today, I can announce
that we have delivered those Patriot systems to Poland.  We do this as a
reminder and as a demonstration of our commitment to the security of our
Allies and our commitment, in particular, to Poland at this moment in
time.  
   
As it relates to the people of Ukraine: They have suffered immensely. 
When we talk about humanitarian aid, it is because, yes, the assistance
is necessary, but what compels us also is the moral outrage that all
civilized nations feel when we look at what is happening to innocent
men, women, children, grandmothers, grandfathers who are fleeing
everything they’ve known.  Our outrage, which compels not only our
security assistance but our humanitarian assistance, is rooted in the
fact that also we support the people of Ukraine who have shown
extraordinary courage and skill and their willingness and, yes, ability
to fight against Putin’s war and Russia’s aggression.   
   
So, today we are also announcing, in pursuit of what must happen, which
is to provide humanitarian assistance, that we will give another $50
million — the United States will — through the U.N.’s World Food
Programme to assist with humanitarian aid.   
   
The President and I also talked about the fact that, as he mentioned,
Poland has taken, in just a very short period of time, in excess of one
and a half million refugees in from Ukraine.  And that has put an
extraordinary burden on Poland and the people of Poland.  And so, we
will continue with the support that we can give you, Mr. President, in
terms of the work that you and the people of Poland have been doing to
bear this burden, but in a way that really has been with such grace  
and such generosity.  
   
We also are pleased to have shared with the President what our United
States Congress has done, which is there is a commitment now of $13.6
billion in human- — humanitarian and security assistance that will be
then distributed and shared with Ukraine and the people of this region
and Europe, all again understanding that this moment in time requires
both a humanitarian response as well as security assistance.   
   
And today, I’m also pleased to say that we are in ongoing discussions
with Poland and our Allies about the effectiveness of sanctions thus far
and going forward.  As we have announced in the United States, we have,
through the United States Department of Justice, started a task force to
do what is required and necessary and appropriate in terms of
investigations as it relates to any criminal activities and behaviors on
behalf of institutions and individuals, including oligarchs.   
   
We talked — the President and I — about the effectiveness of the
sanctions we’ve seen thus far, in terms of the courage and the bold
action that has been taken through the NATO Alliance to do what is
necessary to send a clear signal that there will be, as we promised,
severe cost and consequence for Russia’s aggression to the point that we
have now seen a freefall of the ruble, to the point that we have now
seen that Russia’s credit rating has been rated as junk, and what we
know to be real economic consequence to Russia because of Putin’s war.  
   
As you know, the President of the United States also made the decision
to do what was necessary in terms of the purchase of Russian oil in the
United States.    
   
Again, we will continue to focus on this issue, keeping in mind that
this is a moment that requires severe and swift consequence for Russia’s
aggression against Ukraine.   
   
And I’ll close by saying what we say every day for these last weeks,
which is we stand with the people of Ukraine, that we admire their
courage, and that we are aligned in our support of their sovereignty and
territorial integrity.   
   
Thank you, Mr. President.  
   
Q    (As interpreted.)  My name is Żaklina Skowrońska.  I represent
Polish Television.  I would like to ask my question to both Madam Vice
President and Mr. President.  In what way has this brutal attack of
Russia against Ukraine impacted Polish-American relations?  Antony
Blinken, State Secretary, during his last visit to Poland was saying
that the Polish-American friendship has never been so strong in history
as it is now.  Is it going to translate also on the permanent military
presence of the United States in Poland?  Thank you very much.  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  It cannot be said too frequently or strongly
enough: The relationship between the United States and Poland is a deep,
enduring, and strong one and, dare I say, has become even stronger when
we have been faced as a world with such adversity.  I think we all know,
even in our personal lives, adversity really, truly, can present the
real measure of an individual or a relationship.  And what we have seen
without any doubt is that this friendship and relationship between the
United States and Poland is a strong one.  
   
PRESIDENT DUDA:  (As interpreted.)  Ladies and gentlemen, answering your
question, I want to go a little bit back into history — or deeper into
history.  Let me put it in the following way: When I started my service
as President of the Republic of Poland in 2015, I was perfectly aware of
the fact that an aggressive Russia, like President Lech Kaczyński was
saying in Georgia in 2008, would not stop only attacking Georgia in 2008
and attacking part of Ukraine in 2014.  I knew that this appetite, this
imperial appetite will grow.   
   
And if the world does not react to that — if the world does not react,
if the North Atlantic Alliance does not stand up, does not present a
tough stance, then we will see more attacks from Russia — to which
perhaps, sooner or later, also my country, Poland, would fall victim
to.  
   
And when I started as President of Poland, I knew that I had to do
everything that I could to protect Poland from such a scenario.  One has
to use very clear and strong words here in the presence of Madam Vice
President of the United States.  Those who understood well what I was
saying back then, speaking about the Russian threat, were precisely the
representatives of the United States, were the representatives of Barack
Obama administration and the President himself back then, the U.S.
generals as well.  
   
And precisely thanks to their support, we were able to obtain the North
Atlantic Alliance presence on the eastern flank, were able to execute
the strengthening of the eastern flank for the first time since we
joined NATO in 1999.  
   
It was precisely in NATO Summit in Warsaw, through, first and foremost,
the decisions of the U.S. President and his team, but also through the
decisions of other Allies whom we were able to convince, has led to
putting this presence on the eastern flank of the Alliance and,
symbolically, in Poland.  
   
The United States is the framework nation.  At the same time, the U.S.
soldiers came here and started the rotational presence in Poland.  It is
a rotational but also a persistent presence, enduring presence.  It is a
back-to-back presence.  Soldiers change, but the U.S. armed forces are
present on our soil all the time.  And that was a breakthrough.  
   
If we recall the words of President Lech Kaczyński, which I quoted many
times and who said those words to me back in 2008, he said, and I quote:
“Andrzej, when U.S. soldiers are on our soil, when U.S. military
installations are on our soil, when U.S. military equipment is put in
our soil, then the whole world will be able to see that we are no longer
a Russian sphere of influence.”  This is a true friendship.   
   
As Madam Vice President remarked today, “A friend in need is a friend
indeed.”  That is why I’m really happy that today, when we are in need
and when the NATO eastern flank is in need, the United States, by the
decision of President Joe Biden, has deployed additional troops.  The
U.S. is deploying more troops, and the U.S. is announcing the
strengthening of this presence in our part of Europe and also in Poland,
because this is precisely the understanding of the geopolitics of
strategic goals that have to be achieved by this geopolitics and by the
free world.  This is the understanding of the security.  
   
Is Polish American presence today, if we look at the last couple of
years, stronger than ever?  Yes, Polish-American friendship, for sure,
over the last seven years of my presidency is stronger than ever
before.   
   
And today’s presence here today in Warsaw of Madam Vice President Kamala
Harris is yet another strong evidence of that, just as the presence of
all the representatives of Mr. President Joe Biden’s administration here
recently on our soil.  
   
And also, this is evidenced by the frequency of contacts that I have
with the President of the United States.  We frequently talk and discuss
the most important security-related topics and our mutual relations.   
   
Yes, of course, whenever we speak about great politics and friendship,
this is this friendship and great politics.  And this is the friendship
between states for sure.  This is the friendship between Poland and the
United States of America.  It is very strong right now — the strongest
perhaps ever in history.  
   
WHITE HOUSE AIDE:  The next question will come from Nandita Bose of
Reuters.  
   
Q    Hi, Madam Vice President.  Thank you for — and President Duda. 
Thank you for taking my question.   
   
President Zelenskyy has strongly asked for better air power in recent
days.  And my question is: What kind of alternative plans does the
United States have to get materials to help Ukraine defend itself,
especially now that you have declined Poland’s offer on jets?  Can you
give us some specifics on what you discussed with the Polish leaders on
this issue, Madam Vice President?  
   
And one for President Duda.  The United States says, Mr. President, it
was not consulted before you made the offer to make your jets available
to the United States.  Is that accurate?  And did Poland act
unilaterally in making an offer?  If yes, why?  Especially now that you
have spoken about the strong relationship that U.S. and Poland has
shared over the years.  Thank you.  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  I want to be very clear: The United States and
Poland are united in what we have done and are prepared to do to help
Ukraine and the people of Ukraine, full stop.   
   
In terms of the work that the United States has done thus far, we have,
as you know, given military, humanitarian, and security assistance, and
that is an ongoing process.   
   
As I mentioned earlier, Congress — the United States Congress has now
made a decision for 13-plus billion dollars of United States — of U.S.
money to go to Ukraine and our European allies to assist in terms of
both their security and humanitarian needs.  
   
We have also, just this past week, given $240 million in security
assistance delivered to Ukraine, and that’s on top of the $1 billion in
just the past year that we have sent to Ukraine.   
   
I can tell you that the issue facing the Ukrainian people and our Allies
in the eastern flank is something that occupies one of our highest
priorities in terms of paying attention to the needs, understanding it
is a dynamic situation and it requires us to be nimble and to be
swift.   
   
I mentioned being swift in terms of accountability and consequence.  We
also fully appreciate we must be swift in terms of providing assistance
where we can be helpful.  And we will continue to do that.  
   
Q    Can you (inaudible) plans, especially in light of the issue with
Poland on jets?  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Well, we’re making deliveries every day, in
terms of what we can do in terms of assistance and, in particular, when
you look at what we’ve been doing, as it relates to anti-tank and anti —
defense systems.  That is an ongoing process, and that’s not going to
stop to the extent that there is a need.   
   
Thank you.  
   
POLISH AIDE:  (No translation provided.)  
   
PRESIDENT DUDA:  (As interpreted.)  One moment.  I need to give an
answer as well.   
   
Madam, that situation is extremely complicated, because we are all
saying that there is a fight going on in Ukraine for independence, for
sovereignty, for freedom, and for survival.  And all of us support, with
all the strength we have, the people of Ukraine.   
   
It is not only the military.  Also, the people of Ukraine have taken to
arms to defend their homeland.  It is not only men; it’s also women who
fight on the frontline shoulder-to-shoulder with men in order to defend
their country.  And we have no doubt whatsoever that they need help and
assistance.  
   
Let me say something more.  We accept that they have the right to demand
this assistance from the international community.  They can demand this
support from NATO.  We are providing them humanitarian assistance and
material assistance the best we can.  We are trying to do our best.   
   
Some expectations were addressed in a very strong and unequivocal way,
also towards us — towards Poland.  However, we are members of the North
Atlantic Alliance.  And as far as security-related issues are concerned,
we have to look at these not only through our own lens — through the
prism of the security of Poland — but we also have to adopt the
perspective of the security of NATO as a whole.    
   
So, in a nutshell, we have to be a responsible member of the North
Atlantic Alliance.  That is why there were requests addressed to us. 
Those requests were addressed to us by the Ukrainian side and also, to a
certain extent, by the media.   
   
We behaved in such a way as a reliable member of NATO should behave — a
member of NATO who does not want to expose NATO to any difficult
situation.  On the other hand, we, as members of NATO, also wanted and
want to look for ways of support for the fight in Ukraine.  And that is
why we formulated statements, together with the Polish government — so
myself as president, together with the Polish government.    
   
And this statement or this declaration was announced by the Polish
Minister of Foreign Affairs.  It talked about the Polish possibilities —
military possibilities of assisting Ukraine.  Simply, we decided to put
those jets at the disposal of NATO, not expecting anything in return,
because we stressed very clearly that, as a gap filler for the donated
equipment, we were able to buy something that we would need as a
replacement.  And we, ourselves, we’re ready to provide our equipment
free of charge.   
   
But we wanted NATO as a whole to make a common decision so that Poland
remains a credible member of NATO, not a country who decides on its own
on important issues which impact the security of NATO as a whole — which
would impact the security of all members of NATO — also our neighbors
who are part of NATO — members of NATO.   
   
Thank you.  
   
Another question?   
   
POLISH AIDE:  Maja Wójcikowska, TVN24.  
   
Q    Madam Vice President, each day we can see death and unimaginable
suffering of the Ukraine people caused by decisions made by Vladimir
Putin.  My question is: Will the U.S. support an international
investigation into war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine?  And can
you see any political future for Putin?   
   
(As interpreted.)  This is also the question to the Polish President.   
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Okay, I’ll go.   
   
PRESIDENT DUDA:  (Points to himself.)  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  You go this time, please.  (Laughs.)  
   
Q    (Inaudible) I will start with Madam Vice President.  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  (Laughs.)  Okay.  
   
PRESIDENT DUDA:  (Points to Vice President Harris.)   
   
Q    Thank you.  I appreciate that.  (Laughter.)  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Not at all.  I — we are very clear: The NATO
Alliance is stronger and Russia is weaker because of what Putin has
done.  That is very clear to us.    
   
And when it comes to crimes and violations of international norms and
rules, we are also very clear that any intentional attack on innocent
civilians is a violation.  The U.N. has set up a process by which there
will be a review and investigations, and we will of course participate
as appropriate and necessary.   
   
But we all watched the television coverage of just yesterday.  That’s on
top of everything else that we know and don’t know yet, based on what
we’ve just been able to see.  And because we’ve seen it or not doesn’t
mean it hasn’t happened.  
   
But just limited to what we have seen: Pregnant women going for
healthcare being injured by — I don’t know — a missile, a bomb in an
unprovoked, unjustified war, where a powerful country is trying to take
over another country — violate its sovereignty, its territorial
integrity, for the sake of what?  Nothing that is justified or
provoked.  Absolutely there should be an investigation, and we should
all be watching.  And I have no question the eyes of the world are on
this war and what Russia has done in terms of this aggression and these
atrocities.  I have no doubt.   
   
PRESIDENT DUDA:  (As interpreted.)  It is obvious to us that in Ukraine,
Russians are committing war crimes.  I hope that also in the future it
will be obvious for a court investigating those issues who bears
responsibility for that.  
   
Now, please remember that the refugees from Ukraine are coming to us
right now.  And right now, as we speak, there are people crossing our
border who witnessed their houses destroyed, who saw their neighbors
being killed, who saw hospitals being bombed, who saw civilians being
shot at, children being shot at.  These are proofs.  These are the
reports of witnesses, and they also have those proofs on their
smartphones.  If you look at those footages, it just makes your blood
curl.  Such scenes are happening today, and they have been happening
over the last days in Ukraine, and their perpetrators are Russians.   
   
A group of prosecutors has come to us delegated by the court to look at
the facts of this case.  They are collecting evidence.  We, as Poland,
try as much as we can to give them best — the best possible conditions
for work and then to fulfill this very difficult task.   
   
Let us remember, the witnesses are here.  There is a lot of evidence —
the footages as I mentioned.  We have those proofs and the evidence. 
All of that is being collected.  The work is ongoing.  And I do believe
that it is going to result in very serious indictment acts.   
   
And I do believe that the war crimes — criminals will be sentenced —
those responsible for the war that is happening in Ukraine right now as
a result of this (inaudible) Russian assault.   
   
WHITE HOUSE AIDE:  And the final question will be from Asma Khalid of
NPR.  
   
Q    Thank you.  Thank you, Madam Vice President.  I wanted to ask you
about some reporting that my colleague here in Poland noticed.  He
recently spoke with the mayor of the largest border town, who told him
that the refugee system is essentially not set up for this, that it will
collapse.  It’s an improvised system that can work for maybe two weeks,
but not indefinitely.  And I’m wondering what the United States is going
to do more specifically to set up a permanent infrastructure.  And
relatedly, is the United States willing to make a specific allocation
for Ukrainian refugees?   
   
And for President Duda, I wanted to know if you think and if you asked
the United States to specifically accept more refugees.  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Okay.  (Laughs.)  A friend in need is a friend
indeed.  (Laughter.)   
   
PRESIDENT DUDA:  Okay.  I’ll go first.  Okay, so this time — (as
interpreted) — Madam, the situation is very complex.  This is what I was
saying today and I discussed this at length with Madam Vice President
Kamala Harris.  I said, in a very blunt way, that today we are seeing a
refugee crisis.  It is unfolding because Poland is still able to receive
— it is all the time able to find the accommodation for those people who
are coming to us all the time.    
   
But we have got almost 1,500,000 people who have come to us over the
last couple of days.  So it’s been 10 days.  We have received more than
1 million people within 10 days.  Never before have we witnessed such a
situation.  So this is something totally new to us, and we are grappling
with this huge challenge.  Our entire society is facing up to this
challenge.  I have already expressed my gratitude to the Polish people
for their wonderful position in this very difficult situation — that
they are so openhearted.   
   
But we are aware that the problem is growing and that this problem is
increasing.  We have to somehow handle it, and we do not have the
experience.  Therefore, yesterday, I had a long conversation with Mr.
António Guterres, Secretary General of the United Nations organization. 
And I flagged out that problem to him.  I described to him the situation
— how it looks, how it develops.  I described to him the reaction of the
Polish society, of the Polish authorities, how we have been handling
with this problem.  But I told him that unless we receive international
assistance, then, given further influx of refugees to Poland on this
scale, this will end up in a refugee disaster.  And I asked for help —
both the material assistance, financial assistance — so that we are able
to solve this in Poland.   
   
I also asked for expertise, for the know-how, because the U.N. has got
experts who have seen a multitude of crises of this dimension, and I’m
sure that they have worked out methods of how to handle it.  And I’m
sure they know how to solve the problems, which ensue due to such a
crisis situation.   
   
And this is something that I described in detail also today to Madam
Vice President.  I said that the assistance of the United States in this
respect is invaluable to us, and we would be very much grateful if we
could use this assistance as soon as possible.   
   
Furthermore, we discussed the refugees from Ukraine who have got
relatives and families in the United States, and who would be willing —
at least for the time when the war is still waging, they would like to
visit those families, to stay with their families in the United States,
and to wait there until the war is over and then come back to their
homes.  
   
I asked to speed up and simplify the procedures for such people — the
consular procedures to be simplified for those people who would like to
leave for the United States, to give the opportunity to these people to
see their families as soon as possible, to be reunited with their
families, to help them to survive this time.   
   
So we are acting, and we are looking for international support because,
indeed, the vast majority of Ukrainian refugees are coming to our
country.  Frankly speaking, that is because, first of all, we are a big
country.  And also, the material status of an ordinary citizen of Poland
is for sure much better than the material status, the living conditions
of an ordinary Ukrainian citizen, although we are not among those
wealthy countries of Western Europe, but our living standards have
increased over the last couple of years in Poland.   
   
But they are coming because I believe that also the — it is their belief
that thanks to the presence of NATO armed forces, thanks to the presence
of our Allies from NATO — from Canada, from the UK, from Romania, and
from other countries whose soldiers are deployed in Poland — they
believe that Poland, due to that presence, is a safe country, a country
which is not going to be attacked, a country where you can safely wait
out this difficult situation.   
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  As the President said, we did discuss this
issue.  And I started by thanking the President in Poland and the people
of Poland for what they have done.  And I will restate what I said
earlier this afternoon: They’ve shown extraordinary generosity and
kindness and courage.  And they have — there have been some here who
have relatives who have arrived from Ukraine, but I think there are many
more who are taking in perfect strangers with barely a lot to give but
giving a lot nonetheless.   
   
So, we recognize that, and we recognize the burden that it places on the
government of Poland, on the president, and the infrastructure of this
country; when you look at — as the President said, over one and a half
million people coming within two weeks, virtually.  Unprecedented if you
track and look at refugee flows over the history of time from regions of
conflict.  
   
So the United States is absolutely prepared to do what we can and what
we must to support Poland in terms of the burden that they have taken on
that I think all of us who understand the moral obligation we should
feel to help people who are fleeing harm and seeking refuge; the burden
we should all be prepared to take on to support those people who are
fleeing their home when they don’t want to leave.   
   
In terms of what we are doing in the United States, we will then take
this in terms of what we can do to support and look at those Ukrainians
who want to come to the United States.  What we’re seeing thus far is
large parts of that population who are fleeing Ukraine, who desire to
stay in Europe.   
   
You probably know that we have made a decision as it relates to TPS —
the Temporary Protected Status.  So for Ukrainians that are in the
United States whose visa may expire or has expired: If they were in the
United States before — I believe it’s March; I don’t have the exact date
— they will be able to stay; they won’t be required to leave, even
though their visa has expired because, of course, we would not send them
back to what is a warzone.    
   
And the bottom line is that I have stated the position to the President
this afternoon.  As we have said many times through our work
collectively in the U.N., through NATO, we will support Poland in terms
of the burden it is facing and our collective responsibility to ensure
the safety and wellbeing of these refugees.  
   
POLISH AIDE:  (As interpreted.)  This concludes our press conference. 
Thank you very much for your participation, ladies and gentlemen.   
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Thank you.
