Resource Connection of Tarrant County  
Fort Worth, Texas

4:05 P.M. CST   

THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everyone.  Please, please, sit down.  Thank you. 
I don’t know who’s coming.  (Laughter.)  
   
I want to thank you, Councilwoman Beck.  You know, look, what I said to
her on the way out: The thing that bothers me the most when veterans
aren’t looked out for, because of what we owe them, is every single,
solitary veteran deserves to be treated with dignity.  They shouldn’t
have to ask for a damn thing.  It shouldn’t be, “Can you help me?” 
It’s, “I’ve got a problem.”  And we should say, “How can we help?”  
   
And so, I thank you for your service.  I thank you for all of you who
are here for your service.  
   
And I hope — I hope that hearing — hearing you will inspire more
veterans to do exactly what you’re doing: sign up — sign up for the
benefits and support you have earned.    
   
What I found with my son, what I found with my friends, what I found
with the generation of Vietnam: There’s this notion that you never have
to — you shouldn’t ask for anything.  You’re military — you don’t ask
for anything; you just serve.  
   
You should be asking.  You should be letting us know.  You should let us
know what is bothering you, what is the problem — because we owe it to
you.  
   
It’s great to be here in Fort Worth at the Resource Connection.  And I’m
able to spend time with Mayor Parker earlier, very briefly.  And I want
to thank her for the passport into town.  And I also want to thank Judge
— Judge Whitley, all — and all the city and council members — city
council and county council members as well here today.  I want to thank
you.  (Applause.)    
   
I often tell the story: I got elected to the county council in my state.
 We have a — we’re like a miniature Illinois.  We have one state with 60
percent of the population, so a councilman has a district seven times as
big as a House member and three times a big as a state senator.  
   
And I did not want to run, but I ran just to show the flag.  And,
unfortunately, I won.  (Laughter.)  And they reapportioned me.  It was
in 1970.  I got reapportioned from a four-year term to a two-year term
because my — the opposition party saw more in me than I saw in me.  And
I was forced into, what we say in public life, “up or out.”  And I ended
up running for the Senate before I was old enough to be sworn in.  I
didn’t expect to win that either.  And here I am.  You’re stuck with
me.  (Laughter.)   
   
But — (applause) — but the reason I ran for the United States Senate was
it was too hard being a county councilman.  You’d knock on the door and
say, “My name is Joe Biden, Democratic candidate for the county
council.”  And they’d look at you like — and you know what they’re
thinking.  Well, you know part of what they were thinking: “What does
county council do?”  (Laughter.)  Well, you affect people’s lives as
much as anybody else.  And people go, “County council?”  
   
Anyway.  But I just think that — Jake, you’re a fighter pilot.  You get
this stuff.  I mean — you know what I mean.  You can smile, Jake.  It’s
okay.  (Laughter.)  It’s okay.  
   
Jake is a Republican, but I like the hell out of him.  He’s got — no,
I’m serious.  This guy is the real deal.  
   
The three congressmen you have here — two of them look like they could —
they really could and did play ball.  And the other one looks like he
could bomb you.  (Laughter.)  And — that’s — it’s a tough group but a
good group.  
   
Look, I want to thank you and your staffs for welcoming us to town. 
It’s a one-stop shop connection for people in this county to the
services and benefits they need.  And that’s important.  
   
And I’m here today to talk about the critical community it serves: our
veterans, their families, caregivers, and survivors.  
   
I’m joined today by the bipartisan group of Texas Reps that are here and
who care deeply about these issues.  Congressman Marc Veasey is — I want
to thank him so much for giving me the passport into his district here. 
And I want to let them know how proud I am to sign into law the bill to
create a national monument to Medal of Honor winners and recipients and
the values they represented.  It was a very important thing you did. 
(Applause.)  
   
And, Congressman Colin Allred, I want to thank you for your work in the
Veterans Affairs committee in the House of Representatives, particularly
your leadership dealing with veterans mental health issues.  
   
And Congressman Jake Ellzey, a member of the House Veterans Affairs
committee, a veteran himself, served 20 years in the United States Navy
and multiple combat tours as well.   
   
Congressmen, thank you all for being here and for allowing me to be with
you and continuing to serve our country.  
   
You know, I’ve often said — and I mean it sincerely, from the bottom of
my heart — veterans are the backbone, the spine, and sinew of who we are
in this country.  One percent of you these days — one percent of you
serves all the rest of us.  And the 99 percent who aren’t with you
deserve to treat you with the dignity and respect in service that you
deserve.  You’re the best of us, and we owe you.   
   
And I’ve always believed that — and I’ve said this from the time I was a
young senator — we have many obligations in the United States Senate and
the United States Congress, the President of the United States to the
American people — to the elderly, to the poor, to those in need.  But we
only have one truly sacred obligation, and I mean this — sacred
obligation — and that is to train and equip those who we send into
harm’s way and care for them and their families when they come home.  
   
Only a small percentage, as I said, deserve and can claim the title of
veteran.  More than 1.4 million of them are living here in Texas. 
That’s about 6.5 percent of your population.  And to be a veteran is to
have endured the survival — and survived challenges most Americans will
never know.  And you have done it, and you’ve done it for all of us. 
All of us.  
   
A week ago, during my State of the Union message in Washington, I spoke
about the bipartisan Unity Agenda.  
   
Four big things that I think all of us — Democrats, Republicans, and
independents — can agree on and rally around.  
   
One is dealing with the opioid epidemic, which is stealing the lives of
so many people.  
   
Two: mental health for our children in the wake of all that’s happened
because of COVID and all the — all the consequences.  There’s over a
million people out there who are no longer sitting at the kitchen table
this morning because of COVID.  And people worry about that — and the
kids particularly.  
   
Third is ending cancer as we know it, which I’m confident we can do.  
   
And fourth is supporting our veterans — fully supporting them.  
   
These are the issues that unite us because they impact Americans in
every single solitary state — issues that go beyond partisan politics
because they’re about people — about people, our neighbors.  
   
Caring for our veterans has been a central focus of my administration
since day one.  And for the last year, the Department of Veterans
Affairs, led by Secretary McDonough, has been the linchpin — the
linchpin of our government-wide push to make life better for American
veterans, providing assistance through this pandemic like job training
and housing.  
   
We’re helping lower-income veterans access VA care debt-free.  
   
We’re expanding access to healthcare services for women veterans and the
LGBTQ community veterans.  
   
We’re implementing a plan to bring down the rate of suicide among
service members and veterans.  You know, it’s sad to say, but to this
day, we average 17 veterans a day commit suicide every single day.  More
than get killed in combat every single day.  It’s an absolute tragedy
that demands not only a whole-of-government approach but a
whole-of-country working together to deal with this issue.  
   
Texas is one of those states particin- — participating in the Governor’s
and Mayor’s Challenge to take on this crisis.  
   
And as I announced in my State of the Union message, we’re focusing on
meeting the specific care and needs for all our veterans who suffer
because of their service — for all our veterans.  
   
We learned a horrible lesson after Vietnam.  It was harm — the harmful
effects of Agent Orange, which was dropped upon so many thousands of
veterans, and the years it took to manifest illnesses in veterans. 
Because then the veteran had to prove that whatever his problem was was
directly a consequence of Agent Orange.  
   
Well, we passed a law that I was proud to be a co-sponsor of a long time
ago saying that if you were — if you had Agent Orange drop upon you, it
was presumed that the illness you had was a consequence of that.  
   
And how we were even slower to connect the dots of what’s happening to
those too many Vietnam veterans living in the lurch, unable to access
the care they needed.  
   
It was only in the past year that we added bladder cancer and conditions
of un- — underactive thyroid and Parkinson’s to the list of conditions
tied to Agent Orange exposure, as science told us more, decades after
the exposure took place.  
   
It took far too long to reach that decision, in my view.  And I refuse
to repeat the mistake when it comes to the veterans of our Iraq and
Afghans- — Afghan wars.  
   
Not only they — they faced the dangers on battlefield, but they were
breathing toxic smoke in burn pits where they’re — near where they were
based.  I was in and out of Afghanistan and Iraq 23 times.  I spent a
fair amount of time there as a United States senator and as Vice
President.   
   
The burn pits that incinerate the wastes of war — medical and hazardous
material, jet fuel, and so much more — just dug in big pits where — not
far from — the hooch is not far from where our veterans were sleeping.  
   
And when our troops came home, the fittest among them, the greatest
fighting force in the history of the world, too many of them were not
the same.  Headaches, dizziness, numbness, dizziness, cancer.  
   
And we know — we don’t yet know enough about the connection between burn
pits and each of these diseases so many of our veterans are now facing. 
But I’m committed — I’m committed that America make the commitment to
find out everything we can.  
   
I’m committed to the families like Danielle Robinson, the widow of
Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson, who joined my wife Jill in the Vice
Pre- — in the First Lady’s box at the State of the Union.  
   
Sergeant Robinson was born a soldier.  National — Army National Guard. 
Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq.  Stationed at the same bases and at
around the same exact time as my son Major Beau Biden, United States
Army.  
   
In Baghdad, Sergeant Robinson was stationed yards from burn pits the
size of football fields.  
   
And back home in Ohio, Danielle and their little girl waited for him to
come home — to coach the soccer team, to build Legos.  But when he
finally came home, cancer — likely caused by prolonged exposure to the
burn pits — ravaged his lungs and his body.  
   
A soldier who could bench press 315 pounds, squat 400 pounds, and run
two miles in 12 minutes would be bent over in the bathroom, gasping for
air.  
   
And Danielle, working full-time, turned to become a 24/7 caregiver,
scared to leave him alone for even a minute.  
   
He was just 39 years old when he was held — she held his hand as he took
his last breath.  
   
But Daniel \[sic\] said he — Danielle said he never stopped fighting and
neither did she.  She kept fighting for his memory, in his memory — for
our veterans and their families that are going through the same thing
today.   
   
Families like hers, like so many of yours — you’re the reason why we’re
doing everything we can.    
   
We’ve increased funding for VA research to study the health effects of
toxic exposure in the military.  
   
We’re speeding up the process to identify and address adverse impacts of
military-related environmental exposures.  
   
We’re following the science in every case, but we’re also not going to
force veterans to suffer in limbo for decades if the science is eve- —
even if it’s evenly divided.  
   
When the evidence doesn’t give a clear answer one way or another, the
decision we should favor is caring for veterans while we continue
working to learn more — not waiting, not waiting.  (Applause.)   
   
So, I directed — I directed the VA to move quickly to review more of the
cancers and provide determinations of whether or not they are presumed
to be service-connected within 90 days.  
   
And, by the way, you saw what happened in the — what happened when — at
9/11 when the buildings went down in New York.  You saw the thousands of
firefighters who, in fact, were — because of the toxic smoke they
inhaled — finally, finally, because of some of the people in the media
and in entertainment insisted that they be compensated for.   
   
Well, when diseases are so rare that there isn’t enough evidence, we’ll
examine other factors as well.  
   
And this week, Secretary McDonough is developing a new rule that will
add several rare respiratory cancers to the list of presumptive
conditions for certain veterans.  
   
We also need to know more about which of our veterans may have been
exposed to burn pits in the first place or other environmental toxins
during their service, to record possible exposures before service
members separate from the military.  
   
So we’re building a more comprehensive database from the Departments of
Defense and Veterans Affairs to use to track access to exposures.  
   
And we’re working hard to educate everyone across the VA system about
the potential impact of specialized care needed for burn pit exposure,
urging veterans to sign up for the VA burn pit registry and to make sure
we know about them — they know about the benefits that may be available
to them.  
   
You know, what I’ve found about veterans as we worked for those who are
trying to deal with the mental health problems, is they’re used to
always giving — you don’t think you have a right to ask for anything. 
You don’t think you have a right to ask.  We’re asking you — asking you
to tell us.  Tell us where you’ve been.  Tell us what your needs are. 
It’s nothing to be ashamed of; it’s to be proud of.  We owe you.  
   
Improving training for VA providers to make sure they’re equipped to
diagnose and treat exposures to related conditions.  
   
And this year, launching a new wo- — network of special care —
specialized care providers and call centers to help connect veterans
with questions about exposure to care that is consistent, comprehensive,
and high quality.  
   
Folks, these are the kinds of steps that can make a difference in
getting the proper care for more patients and providing support for
veterans, especially those facing a cancer diagnosis.  
   
And every one of you know the earlier cancer is diagnosed, the greater
the prospect of dealing with it, the greater the pa- — the prospect of
curing it.   
   
It reinforces the new goal of my Cancer Moonshot to cut cancer deaths —
the death rate by 50 percent over the next 25 years at a minimum, to
create a more supportive experience for all the patients and families.  
   
Secretary McDonough is part of my newly formed Cancer Cabinet.  The
Department of Veterans Affairs is an essential part of our
whole-of-government initiative because we’re going to invest billions of
dollars solving this problem — to turn cancers from death sentences into
treatable diseases.   
   
These are all things my administration is moving on.  We’re not
waiting.  We’re not waiting.   
   
But some of the most important next steps need congressional action. 
Both the United States House of Representatives and the Senate have
bills in motion that would extend the eligibility period for VA care for
burn pit-related health impacts from 5 years after leaving the military
to a minimum of 10 years.  That would open enrollment to all veterans
who served in Iraq and Afghanistan.  
   
And, in February, the Senate passed their bill to do just that,
unanimously — Democrat and Republican.   
   
And the House bill that passed just last week would do even more:
expanding healthcare, mandating research, reforming the process for
determining presumptions, and adding more conditions to the list of
presumptive care.  
   
Both these bills have bipartisan support.  These are bills that unite
the American people.  These are the bills that will deliver necessary
care for our veterans and their families.  
   
Let’s get those bills to my desk so I can sign them immediately —
immediately.  (Applause.)   
   
Folks, we have a sacred obligation as a nation.  
   
I promised Danielle Robinson and I promise all of you here today that
we’ll do better.  We must.  We owe you.  We owe you.  
   
I can’t say enough about the veterans community.  And there’s a famous
expression by a famous English poet who said, “They also serve who only
stand and wait.”  
   
To every husband and wife of the deployed — of the deployed husband or
wife, to every child with a mom or dad deployed: We owe you.  We owe
you, because they also serve who only stand and wait.  
   
I remember the head of the National Guard in the State of Delaware wife
used to say a prayer.  When my son got deployed — my wife was a school
teacher who got up earlier than I did to get to school.  I’d get to the
train — the 7:30 train.  And I’d walk downstairs.  I wouldn’t be — I’d
just be — I’d just had shaved and have my trousers on to get a cup of
coffee.  She’d be standing over the sink, like many of you have done,
looking out the window mouthing a prayer that she was given by the
commander’s wife — a prayer — a prayer for her son who was in harm’s
way.   
   
All of you did that.  All of you do that.  All of you worry about that
call.  So, thank you.  Thank you as well.  
   
Concluding point I’ll make — and we talked about it, the Congressman and
I, on the way down: You know, this is an incredible generation — the
9/11 generation that fought.   
   
They served in a way, I think, that maybe they’re right up there with
the Greatest Generation, because they not only got deployed once, but
sometimes twice, three, four times into harm’s way.  They’d come home
and go back, and after knowing that they cleaned off the blood of the
seat of that up-armored Humvee that they — where they lost somebody. 
And they’d have to saddle up and go back out again.   
   
An enormous generation.  An incredible generation.  
   
I was telling the guys on the way down I remember flying into Iraq one
of those times, and I went up in the cop- — the cockpit.  And there
were, I believe, seven members — six members: five men and one women —
one woman.   
   
And I asked the question of all of them.  I said, “How many is this your
first tour of duty?”  Nobody raised their hand.  “Second tour of duty?” 
Nobody.  “Third tour?”  Two of them.  “Fourth tour?”  Two of them. 
“Fifth tour?”  One.   
   
No other generation has been deployed, redeployed, and redeployed, and
redeployed.  It takes nothing away from the World War One and World War
Two and Vietnam generations.  But it’s one thing to serve and come home
and then go back, and go back, and go back.   
   
So, we owe you.  We owe you all, every veteran in here and every family
member of a veteran.   
   
May God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops. Thank you for
all you do.  (Applause.)
