Q    Mr. President, what do you think about Russia changing its
strategy?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m not sure they have.  
   
Q    And what’s the impact of this on you, Mr. President?  Tell us about
what you saw.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’ve been to an awful lot of places like this with a lot
of refugee camps in my life.  And what I — what I never — I’m always
surprised by is the depth and strength of the human spirit.  I mean it
sincerely.  And it’s incredible.  It’s incredible.  
   
You see all those little children?  Just wanted to — just want a hug. 
They just want to say thanks.  I mean, they’re — I mean, it’s — it just
makes you so damn proud.  And they’re wonderful, wonderful,
wonderful.   
   
And, you know, the Ukrainian people are — each one of those children
said something to the effect, “Say a prayer for my dad, for my
grandfather, for my brother who’s back there fighting.”  And I remember
what it’s like when you have someone in a war zone.  Every morning you
get up and you wonder.  You just wonder.  You pray you don’t get that
phone call.  And they’re an amazing group of people.  
   
Q    How does this make you think of —  
   
Q    How do you get into some of these cities like Mariupol that’s got —
you know, that’s got nothing?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, they’ve got nothing.  I met two people from
Mariupol.  It’s — it’s astounding.  
   
Q    What were the commitments with Ukraine?  
   
Q    What is this — I mean, you see this in your — you know, you’re
dealing every day with Vladimir Putin.  I mean, look at what he’s done
to these people.  What does it make you think?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  He’s a butcher.  That’s what it makes me think.
