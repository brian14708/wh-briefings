title: Remarks by President Biden and Prime Minister Martin of Ireland Before Virtual
  Bilateral Meeting

Via Teleconference

11:22 A.M. EDT

     PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, Taoiseach, I’m really deeply sorry you —
for the inconvenience that we’re having to meet virtually again this
year, although I did, at a little distance, for seven and a half minutes
get to see you yesterday, but — and your beautiful wife.  But — and
especially after your flying all the way here to Washington and with a
lot going on up in the Hill and the rest. 

     But just as we did last year, the tradition of this beautiful bowl,
the tradition of these beautiful shamrocks I have here with me.   
   
And we’re meeting in a moment when demands on unity in the world are
really accelerating.  And we have to be united, and we certainly are. 
And — but I — Putin’s brutality and what he’s doing and his troops are
doing in Ukraine is just inhumane.   
   
And so, you know — as you know, your predecessor and you occasionally
kid me about always quoting Irish poets.  But — but Yeats had a great
line in “Easter Sunday, 1919” \[sic\].  He said, “All has changed,
changed utterly: A terrible beauty has been born.”  He was talking about
his Ireland and what was going to come, which had turned out to be
better than — than worse.  
   
But all has changed.  I think that your leadership on the global stage
has really been noticeable and impressive.  You’re now a member of —
temporarily for the — as you are a member of the Security Council.  Your
leadership on the global stage within the EU as well.  And — and your
condemnation of Putin’s aggression and support of the — of the
sanctions.  And it’s costing Ireland.  It’s costing Ireland.  But as
usual, you’re basing it on principle and moral standing of the
country.   
   
And — but I also want to emphasize this administration’s unequivocal
support for the Good Friday accords — for the Good Friday Agreement. 
I’ve made that clear, as you probably heard, to the Prime Minister and
others: I think it’s — too much blood, sweat, and tears have been shed
to get that done.  And this is no time to change it.   
   
And we have a full agenda to discuss, I know.  And — but deepening our
cooperation — Ireland and the United States — bilaterally and through
the European Union is — is — and taking on climate change, looking at
economic opportunities we both have, and combating COVID combined is
something that we’re going to work closely together on.  
   
We have a lot to talk about, but I’m talking too much.  Let me yield the
floor to you, Taoiseach.  And — and you have my best wishes for — I know
you’re looking good, feeling good, but I’m looking forward to you
getting cleared as quickly as you can.  
   
PRIME MINISTER MARTIN:  Well, thank you very much indeed, President. 
And last year, we met virtually across the Atlantic.  This year, we’re
meeting virtually across the road.  (Laughs.)  So, we’re getting
closer.   
   
But I’m feeling good.  And I think that reminds us of the importance of
vaccines, and — because vaccines prevent severe illness.  And it reminds
us of that can- — central message we give to people: Get vaccinated if
you’re not vaccinated.

     But, of course, it is unfortunate, but it’s no more than that.

     And I share with you our horror at the barbaric attack on the
civilians of Ukraine.  And I want to take this opportunity to genuinely
salute your leadership — it’s firm, it’s determined, it’s strong, it’s
measured in the teeth of this crisis — and, particularly, your capacity
to marshal like-minded democracies.  The U.S., the European Union, the
United Kingdom, the other — Canada, and other like-minded democracies
are coming together to respond in an unprecedented way to this barbaric
attack on the women and children of Ukraine.

     Our thoughts are with them and all the young people who are dying
because of this unjustifiable and immoral war on their people by the
regime of Vladimir Putin. 

     And I think it’s extremely important that we keep this unity of
purpose over the coming while. 

     And Ireland stands ready to do everything we possibly can on the
humanitarian front and in supporting the broadest and widest sanctions
possible to keep the pressure on and to get this war ended, because
there’s simply too much suffering.  And it’s heartrending to see the
appalling loss of life and also the terrible trauma on the children of
Ukraine and their mothers as they flee this war zone. 

     And we’re very seized by this in Ireland.  And the response has
been — has been great to behold, in terms of the people of Ireland who
want to do everything they possibly can here.

     May I also just thank you again, in respect of the Good Friday
Agreement, your steadfast support, and that of Speaker Pelosi and our
friends on the Hill, in giving a very clear message in respect of how
important the Good Friday Agreement is in respect of — of stability and
peace on the island of Ireland. 

     And over the vast number of days, as I’ve been here, we’ve also
witnessed once again that two-way, very robust economic relationship
between the United States and — and Ireland.  It’s a two-way
relationship.  

     I met Irish companies yesterday who are creating 100,000 jobs in
the U.S. now.  And that’s because of that partnership between Ireland,
Europe, and the U.S.

     So I look forward to discussing these issues in greater detail. 
But, again, to say that it’s wonderful to meet with you. 

     And we met in Glasgow recently.  We had a good chinwag there, in
respect of a number of issues.  But, again, that — that also illustrated
that partnership between Europe and the U.S. in terms of the existential
crisis of our time — climate change.

     So, great to have this opportunity to meet with you, President.

     PRESIDENT BIDEN:  I want to say one thing while the press is here
before they leave, and that is: What Ireland is doing now, what you are
doing, taking in Ukrainian refugees, speaks so loudly about your
principles.  And it’s amazing, and I want to publicly compliment you for
it. 

     I think you’ve already brought in over 7,000 or so refugees from
Ukraine, and you’re prepared to do more.  So you’ve — thank you.  Thank
you.  I just want to make sure everybody knows that.  Thank you.

     PRIME MINISTER MARTIN:  It’s our duty.
