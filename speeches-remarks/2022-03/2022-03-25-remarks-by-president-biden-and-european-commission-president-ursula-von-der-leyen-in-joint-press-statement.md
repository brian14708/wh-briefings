title: Remarks by President Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der
  Leyen in Joint Press Statement

10:05 A.M. CET

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Good morning.  Today I’m proud to once again be
standing together with President von der Leyen as we announce a new
groundbreaking initiative between the European Union and the United
States.  
   
First, we’re coming together to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian
energy.  Putin has issued Russia’s energy resources to coerce and
manipulate its neighbors.  That’s how he’s used it.  He’s used the
profits to drive his war machine.  
   
And that’s why, earlier this month, I announced the United States would
ban all imports of Russian energy to make it clear that the American
people would not be part of subsidizing Putin’s brutal, unjustified war
against the people of Ukraine.  
   
At the time, I noted that we were able to take those steps when others
could not because the United States is a net energy exporter of energy,
with a strong domestic industry.  
   
And the United States welcomed the European Union’s powerful statement
earlier this month committing to rapidly reduce its dependence on
Russian gas.

Today we’ve agreed on a joint game plan toward that goal while
accelerating our progress toward a secure clean energy future.  
   
This initiative focuses on two core issues: One, helping Europe reduce
its dependency on Russian gas as quickly as possible.  And, secondly,
reducing Europe’s demand for gas overall.  
   
To address the first point, the United States, together with our
international partners, they’re going to — we’re going to work to ensure
an additional 15 — one-five — 15 billion cubic meters of liquified
natural gas — LNG — for Europe this year.  
   
And as the EU works to discontinue buying Russian gas well before 2030,
it will also work to ensure additional EU market demand for 50 billion
cubic meters of LNG from the United States annually by 2030.  
   
To accomplish this, the European Commission is going to work with the
member states to store gas across the continent, to build more
infrastructure to receive LNG, and to take steps to increase the
efficiency of gas.   
   
This build-out — this build-out will occur in a way that consists — is
consistent with, not in conflict with, the zero — net-zero climate goal
we — that we’re shooting for.  It’s going to take some time to adjust
gas supply chains and infrastructure as is built the last decade — for
the last decade.  
   
So we’re going to have to make sure the families in Europe can get
through this winter and the next while we’re building an infrastructure
for a diversified, resilient, and clean energy future.  
   
At the same time, this crisis also presents an opportunity.  It’s a
catalyst — a catalyst that will drive the investments we need to
double-down on our clean energy goals and accelerate progress toward our
net-zero emissions future.  
   
That’s what the second part of this initiative is all about.  
   
The United States and the European Union are going to work together to
take concrete measures to reduce dependence on natural gas — period —
and to maximize the available — the avail- — the availability and use of
renewable energy.      
   
We’re going to accelerate widespread adoption of energy-efficient
technologies and equipment, like smart thermostats, the work — that work
to — and work to electrify heating systems all across Europe.  
   
We’re going to invest in innovative solutions and technologies to make
the switch from fossil fuels.  
   
And together, we’ll advance the use of clean and renewable hydrogen to
reduce our carbon emissions.  
   
This — these steps will increase energy security, economic security, and
national security.   
   
And we’re going to stand up a joint task force to implement these
changes and drive progress that will be co-chaired by representatives
from the White House and the President of the European Union’s team —
Commission’s team.  
   
Madam President, I know — I know that eliminating Russian gas will have
costs for Europe.  But it’s not only the right thing to do from a moral
standpoint, it’s going to put us on a much stronger strategic footing.  
   
And I’m proud to announce that we’ve also reached another major
breakthrough in transatlantic data flows.  Privacy and security are key
elements of my digital agenda.  
   
And today, we’ve agreed to unprecedented protections for data privacy
and security for our citizens.  
   
This new agreement will enhance the Privacy Shield Framework; promote
growth and innovation in Europe and the United States; and help
companies, both small and large, compete in the digital economy.  
   
Just as we did when we resolved the Boeing-Airbus dispute and lifted the
steel and aluminum tariffs, the United States and the EU are finding
creative, new approaches to knit our economies and our people closer
together, grounded on shared values.  
   
This framework underscores our shared commitment to privacy, to data
protection, and to the rule of law.  And it’s going to allow the
European Commission to once again authorize  
transatlantic data flows that help facilitate $7.1 trillion in economic
relationships with the EU.  
   
So thank you again, Madam President, for your personal friendship, for
your partnership, and above all, your leadership.  
   
All of this is bringing the European Union and the United States even
closer together, and that’s a win for all of us.  
   
So I thank you all, and I’m now going to yield the podium to the
President.   
   
Let me pull this out.  (Pulls out the step stool.)  Got to earn my
salary here.  (Laughter.)  Is it out enough?  There you go.  Thank you. 
(Laughs.)   
   
PRESIDENT VON DER LEYEN:  Thank you.  Mr. President, Dear Joe, your
presence here in Brussels this week — at the NATO summit, at the G7, and
at our European Council — sends a very powerful message to the world.  
   
The transatlantic partnership stands stronger and more united than
ever.  And we are determined to stand up against Russia’s brutal war. 
This war will be a strategic failure for Putin.  
   
Our cooperation on the four successive waves of sanctions against Russia
has been extraordinary and exceptional.  The sanctions are now working
their way deep into the Russian system, draining Putin’s resources to
finance this atrocious war.  
   
Our work on sanctions also shows that when we act together, we’re
stronger and we really can make a difference.  
   
And we are continuing to reinforce our cooperation in many strategic
ways: on humanitarian and security assistance to Ukraine; on energy; on
fighting the threats against our democracies; on solving outstanding
issues in the EU-U.S. cooperation, including in data protec- —
protection and privacy.   
   
In a world faced with disorder, our transatlantic unity upholds
fundamental values and rules that our citizens believe in.  Let me focus
first on refugees.  
   
Until now, around three and a half million people have left Ukraine,
half of them children.  Every second refugee is a child.  And the
numbers will keep rising.  So, together, we are mobilizing massive
resources to support those displaced by the conflict, be it in Ukraine
or in the neighboring countries.   
   
Just this week, for example, I announced that the European Union will
allocate an extra 3.4 billion euros for this purpose, and more will
come.  This demonstrates our deep support for Ukraine and its
citizens.   
   
And I want to tell the American people how grateful Europe is for their
unwavering support.  This support also extends to strengthening Europe’s
energy security and independence from Russian fossil fuels.  As you
know, we aim to reduce this dependency on Russian fossil fuels and to
get rid of it.  And this can only be achieved through, of course, first
of all, investment in renewables, but also through additional gas
supplies, including LNG deliveries.   
   
So we want, as Europeans, to diversify away from Russia, towards
suppliers that we trust, that are friends, and that are reliable.   
   
And therefore, the U.S. commitment to provide the European Union with
additional at least 15 billion cubic meters of LNG this year is a big
step in this direction because this will replace the LNG supply we
currently receive from Russia.  
   
And looking ahead, the United States and Europe will ensure stable
demand and supply for additional at least 50 billion cubic meter of U.S.
LNG until 2030.  And if we look at that, this amount, 50 bcm per year,
is replacing one third already of the Russian gas going to Europe
today.  So, we are right in — on track now to diversify away from
Russian gas and towards our friends’ and partners’ reliable and
trustworthy suppliers.   
   
We need to secure our supplies not just for next winter but also for the
years ahead.  And this is a — an important, a big starting point to do
that.   
   
Our partnership aims to sustain us through this war, to work on our
independence from Russian fossil fuels, but it also focuses on building
a greener future with climate neutrality.  We will work together also
with our energy-intensive industry.  And the good news is that the
infrastructure that we use for gas today can be used for clean hydrogen
in the future.  So, this investment we are doing right now is also an
investment in the decarbonizing of our economy.  
   
The cooperation shows the power of our democracies.  I particularly
welcome that we will step up our respective action on strengthening
democracies, the rule of law, the freedom of media in the world.   
   
And we also need to continue adapting our own democracies to a changing
world.  This is particularly true when it comes to digitalization, in
which the protection of personal data and privacy has become so
crucial.   
   
And therefore, I’m very pleased that we have found an agreement in
principle on a new framework for transatlantic data flows.  This will
enable predictable and trustworthy data flows between the EU and U.S.,
safeguarding privacy and civil liberties.   
   
And I really want to thank Commissioner Reynders and Secretary Raimondo
for their tireless efforts over the past month to finish a balanced and
effective solution.  This is another step in our — strengthening our
partnership.  We managed to balance security and the right to privacy
and data protection.   
   
Mr. President, Dear Joe: Putin is trying to turn back the clock to
another era — an era of brutal use of force, of power politics, of
spheres of influence, and internal repression.  I am confident he will
fail.   
   
We are working together to forge a peaceful, prosperous, and sustainable
future.  And I know we will succeed.  
   
Thank you very much.   
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you.   
   
PRESIDENT VON DER LEYEN:  Thank you very much.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you, everyone.
