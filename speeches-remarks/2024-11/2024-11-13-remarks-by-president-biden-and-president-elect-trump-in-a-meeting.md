PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, Mr. President-Elect and former president —

PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much, Joe.

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  — and — Donald, congratulations.

PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  And looking forward to having a, like we said, smooth
transition — do everything we can to make sure you’re accommodated, what
you need.  And we’re going to get a chance to talk about some of that
today.  So —

PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Good.

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  — welcome.  Welcome back.

PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  And thank you very much.

And politics is tough.  And it’s, many cases, not a very nice world, but
it is a nice world today.  And I appreciate it very much — a transition
that’s so smooth it’ll be as smooth as it can get.

And I very much appreciate that, Joe.

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  You’re welcome.

Thank you all.
