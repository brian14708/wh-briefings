The White House

Good afternoon.

This beautiful Fraser fir was grown at Cartner’s Christmas Tree Farm,
where the Cartner family has been growing trees for more than 60 years.

Their farm is nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, a
region that was recently devastated by Hurricane Helene.

The Cartner family lost thousands of trees to the storm. But this one
remained standing—and they named it “Tremendous” for the extraordinary
hope that it represents.

It’s an honor to be here today with Congresswoman Virginia Foxx, as well
as members of the North Carolina National Guard—and their families—who
are leading the work to rebuild after Hurricane Helene. This tree
recognizes your tremendous strength and service.

In just a few days, volunteers from all over the country will pour in to
transform this tree—and decorate the entire White House. And out of the
whirlwind of glitter and garlands, will come the warmth and comfort of
the season. I can’t wait for everyone to share in it.

Happy holidays!
