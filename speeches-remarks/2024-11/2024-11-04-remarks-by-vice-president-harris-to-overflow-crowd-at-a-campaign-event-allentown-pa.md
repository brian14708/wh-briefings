THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Hey, Allentown!  Hi, everybody.  (Laughs.) 
(Applause.)  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  (Applause.)  Hey, everyone.  Hi.

Oh, it’s so good to see everybody.  Thank you all.  Thank you. 
(Applause.)

Are we ready to do this?  (Applause.) 

Are we ready to vote?  (Applause.)

Are we ready to win?  (Applause.)

All right.  Well, we’re going to get to work.  We are going to get to
work.  We’ve got 24 hours to go.  (Applause.)  And, Allentown, you are
going to make the difference.  The path to the White House runs through
this room right here.  (Applause.)

And — and sincerely, I want to thank everyone for taking the time out of
your lives to be here — (applause) — and all the work that you have been
doing, the work we will continue to do.  I’m going to say it in that
room, but I needed to come here and say to you all here.  (Applause.) 

Over these next 24 hours, I say to all the leaders who are here, let’s
get out there.  Let’s remind people of the power that they have through
their vote.  (Applause.)  Their vote is their voice about the future of
our country, because we are fighting to move forward.  (Applause.) 

We love our country, and we are going to see this through.  And in the
process, we are going to build community, and we are going to build
coalitions.  (Applause.)  And we are going to remind each other we are
all in this together.  (Applause.) 

And I thank you all so, so very much.  Please take care.  I’ll see you
on the other side of it all.  All right?  (Applause.)  Thank you. 

God bless you.  God bless you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)
