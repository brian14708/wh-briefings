PRESIDENT BOLUARTE:  (As interpreted.)  Dear Mr. President of the United
States —

(The interpretive audio devices are adjusted.)

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  I have to tell you before I begin, when I was a young
senator, the president — a senior senator from Texas said, “Joe, someday
you’re going to run for president.  You better learn Spanish.” 
(Laughter.)  I only speak English.

All right.

PRESIDENT BOLUARTE:  (As interpreted.)  Dear Mr. President Biden, first
of all, I would like to welcome you to our dear country amidst the APEC
2024 Leaders’ Week.  We hope that you and your delegation are enjoying
your stay here in Lima, Peru, and that you are well treated. 

Thank you very much for your visit.  Thank you very much for sharing our
mutual interests through this APEC forum, where we gather with the most
important 21 economies in the world. 

You, Mr. President, and your delegation are most welcome to my country.

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, Madam President, thank you very much.  And my
only concern is my colleagues are not going to come home with me. 
(Laughter.)  They’re going to want to stay.  You have a truly beautiful
country. 

And you’re a very important and valued partner.  That’s for real. 

Our countries work closely together, day in and day out, to manage the
regional challenges we both face, to defend democracy, to protect the
environment, and to provide good jobs — good-paying jobs for our
people. 

With your permission, Madam President, I’d like to highlight three areas
of growing cooperation. 

First, we want to thank you for elevating our fight against drug
trafficking, a mutual concern.  I’m pleased to announce $65 million over
the next five years to assist — in assistance to Peru, including the
nine Black Hawk helicopters and training for more than 130 pilots and
technicians.

And second, we are partnering on infrastructure.  California Caltrain
has donated 150 passenger cars and locomotives to the Lima metro rail,
part of a much larger collaboration that will save Peru millions of
dollars and reduce pollution and deepen ties between and among our
businesses.

And third, we’re cooperating on space exploration.  Now, that fellow
right there, the former senator from Florida — very close friend of mine
— every time my wife thinks I’m getting out of hand, she says, “I’m
going to call him and have him send you to space.”  (Laughter.)  And I’m
a little concerned he may want to send me to space because we got to get
some folks back home.  (Laughter.)

In May, Peru joined the — the Artemis Accords and set the principles of
the be- — best practices for how we move on space.

And this week, we’ve agreed to cooperate on research rockets as well —
our countries.

So, Madam President, thank you for your leadership within APEC, and
thank you for your partnership and friendship with the United States. 
And I genuinely look forward to our discussion.

PRESIDENT BOLUARTE:  (As interpreted.)  Thank you very much.
