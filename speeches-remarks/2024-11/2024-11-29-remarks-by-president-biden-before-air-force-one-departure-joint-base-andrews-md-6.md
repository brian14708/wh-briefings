Q    Mr. President, what does this mean for getting the rest of the
hostages home, sir? 

The hostages.  What does today mean for the rest of the hostages to come
home?

THE PRESIDENT:  A lot of pressure on Hamas to set them free.

Q    If you would come closer, sir, you could — you could hear us better
and vice versa.

How are you feeling today with the announcement, sir?

THE PRESIDENT:  Good, just like I told you today.

Q    Is Trump starting a trade war, sir?
