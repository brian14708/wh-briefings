PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, Mr. President, welcome to the White House.

PRESIDENT SUBIANTO:  Thank you very much, sir.

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Good to have you here.  And we’re making —

PRESIDENT SUBIANTO:  Thank you very much.

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  We’re marking an important anniversary: 75 years of
diplomatic relationship with Indonesia and the United States — 75
years.  I’m proud that the partnership between our countries is stronger
than it’s ever been. 

And today, we’re going to discuss how we continue to strengthen that
partnership, first, in my view, by advancing free and open Indo-Pacific
with ASEAN at its center.  As two of the largest democracies in the
world, it seems to me that our nations have a special responsibility in
this vision. 

Second, fighting the climate crisis.  Indonesia is a critical player in
the clean energy transition.

And third, by building a secure and resilient supply chain.

And finally, by deepening our comprehensive strategic partnership that
includes deepening our security cooperation. 

We’ll discuss, also, global challenges, including in Gaza and the South
China Sea. 

So, Mr. President, I’m looking forward to our discussion, and welcome. 
I’m delighted to have you here, and the floor is yours.

PRESIDENT SUBIANTO:  Thank you.  Thank you, President Biden.  Thank you
for receiving me. 

I also would like to thank you: You — you phoned me yourself upon my
election and —

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  A great victory.

PRESIDENT SUBIANTO:  Yes.  Thank you very much.

And then, finally, I could make it and you received me today.

United States, for us, is a very great friend.  United States supported
us in our struggle for independence and helped us many times in our time
of need. 

Therefore, I will work very hard to strengthen Indonesia and United
States’ relationship.  And I would like to work towards this end, that
we have a strong cooperation.

Once again, President Biden, thank you very much for receiving me.

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, thank you.  I look forward to our discussion.

PRESIDENT SUBIANTO:  Thank you, sir.

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you.

PRESIDENT SUBIANTO:  Thank you, sir.
