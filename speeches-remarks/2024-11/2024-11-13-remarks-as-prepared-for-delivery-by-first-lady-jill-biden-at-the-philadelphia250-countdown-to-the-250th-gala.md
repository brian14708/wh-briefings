Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

Thank you, Governor—Ed. You always have Pennsylvania in your heart. Joe
and I are so grateful to have seen that heart—and to have had the
opportunity to show you ours, to be able to call you a friend.

You’re a true leader—putting people first, always thinking about how you
can do the most good, how you can bring in more voices and perspectives.
It’s been an honor to walk by your side all these decades, to see how
your smile, your wit, and advocacy change every room you’re in. Thank
you for inviting me to be a part of this special event.

It’s always great to be home, especially during football season—go
Birds!

And I’m glad to be joined by so many members of the Philadelphia City
Council.

Growing up here, you learn a lot about our history—even without trying.
On any corner, you can find the footprints of our past. And that’s
before you look up and see the tour guides dressed as Benjamin Franklin.

Like every kid from this city, I remember school trips to the Betsy Ross
Museum and Independence Hall. Those historic halls shaped how I see the
world—and I carry those memories with me everywhere I go.

But sometimes it can be hard to see how that history connects to us,
right now—how those pieces of the past can be a part of our present and
our future.

That’s why this project is so important.

The work Philadelphia 250, Danielle, and everyone in this room is doing
reminds us to keep reaching for those promises on which our nation was
founded: That we are all created equal. That our rights can never be
taken from us. That happiness is ours to pursue.

You’re also showing the nation that Philly is more than a backdrop—it’s
a place of inspiration, of freedom, and of people working to live up to
those founding ideals.

Our city isn’t just an echo of days past. It also holds our future.

You know, at times, people have told me that Philadelphians are tough.
That we’re outspoken—loud. And that’s putting it nicely.

But what they’re talking about is the same grit that made this country.

Yes, we are tough. We’re fierce. When we get knocked down, we get back
up. And we never stop fighting for the things we care about—the people
we care about.

What you’re doing today is part of that great tradition. And that’s who
Philly taught me to be. It made me.

I hold this city in my heart every day. And it’s been the honor of this
Philly girl’s lifetime to serve as your First Lady.

Our democracy was born here.

A moment that changed the world.

And today, down every side street and great boulevard, at every Wawa and
corner store, in city hall and union halls, are the conversations that
will shape this city’s next 250 years.

Just as Philly has done again and again, we will keep standing up for
what we believe in—putting forward our best ideas by the people, and for
all the people, and loving each other and this city we call home,
always.

Thank you.
