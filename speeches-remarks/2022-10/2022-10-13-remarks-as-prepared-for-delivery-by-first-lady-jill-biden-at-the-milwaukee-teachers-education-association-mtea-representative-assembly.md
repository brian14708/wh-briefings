Milwaukee, WI

Thank you, Amy! And thank you for your 30 years as a special education
teacher. Your leadership has helped this union thrive, and I know that
everyone here is grateful for your work.  
   
And Becky, you have been a wonderful partner and friend. As always, I’m
honored to be with the NEA—the union that has supported me for so many
years.   
   
I know that Lieutenant Governor Barnes will be joining you today—and I
just had the chance to meet his mom, LaJuan, who was a Milwaukee public
school teacher for almost 30 years!   
   
Looking at this crowd, I’m reminded that Wisconsin’s recertification
process was created in order to weaken unions. And yet, every year, you
come together to stand up for your right to collectively bargain. You
come together to fight for the MTEA and WEAC because they fight for
you.   
   
Despite the obstacles in your way, Milwaukee is—and will continue to
be—union strong!  
   
As a teacher myself, being with you—feeling your commitment and
excitement—is exactly what I need right now.  
   
Because we’ve all reached that point in the semester when the shininess
of those first exciting days of class have rubbed off—but we’re still
far away from winter break. You know the feeling. Maybe you need an
extra espresso shot in your iced coffee; maybe you take a little longer
to get out of your car in the morning.  
   
This isn’t always an easy job—in fact, sometimes it feels harder than
ever, doesn’t it? But we keep coming back. Because this isn’t just a
job. It’s a calling.  
   
So, when the budgets run thin and the lesson plans go wrong, teachers
find a way to push past the chaos and build something beautiful.   
   
When kids aren’t getting enough to eat, cafeteria staff work long hours
to make extra meals—and bus drivers deliver them to students in need.   
   
When families are struggling to find housing, when they’re wrestling
with trauma or grief, school counselors call after work and make sure
they have the help they need.  
   
Educators, you are the heart of your communities. And you were called to
this profession for a reason. Because you never give up on the families
you serve. Because when extremists try to stop you from doing your job,
you put your shoulders back and focus on the kids who need you. Because
you continue to believe that a better world is possible—and you make
that world real, one student at a time.  
   
And I am here today to say that you aren’t in this alone. You have a
friend in the White House—two, in fact: me, and my husband, Joe.  
   
I always knew that Joe would be an education President. Because this
means so much to him. And he’s delivered on his promises: from historic
investments to safely re-open schools, to addressing the mental health
and academic needs of our students, to signing the bipartisan gun bill,
to loan forgiveness for public servants.  
   
And he’s working every day to support what we call the three R’s of
teaching: recruiting, respecting, and retaining our educators. He’s
working hard to help bring more people to this profession and give them
the support and mentoring they need to succeed.  
   
Here in Wisconsin, Governor Evers and Lieutenant Governor Barnes have
been incredible partners in that work. They’ve invested millions so
every student can have access to mental health services, so students
with disabilities have the support they need, and so teachers can have
manageable class sizes.  
   
In fact, later this evening, the Governor and I will be heading to a
“Homework Diner”—and I’m excited to see how school communities are
coming together to better support families here in Milwaukee. But
there’s much we still need to do.  
   
If we hope to invest more in our schools and your salaries, if we want
to rebuild the middle class, if we want to protect women’s rights and
Social Security—we need leaders who will stand up for you and your
students.  
   
That’s why we all need to get involved. Because you know what’s at
stake. And because this union knows how to get things done.  
   
We have to speak up for justice and equity. All of us have a “Teacher
voice”—and now is the time to use it. We must come together—as NEA
always has—and demand that we be heard. I’ll be there beside you, every
step of the way.  
  
Now, it won’t be easy. We know that. But we do this work because it’s
who we are: We’re optimists. We’re true believers. We’re union members!
We stand together and we fight for the communities we care about.  
   
We will never give up. So underestimate us at your own risk.  
   
I want to end by saying thank you. Thank you for fighting for your
students and for each other. Thank you for the good you do and the lives
you’ve touched.   
   
Right now, someone out there is a better thinker because of you.  
  
Someone is standing a little taller because you helped her find the
confidence she needed.  
  
Someone is working a little harder because you pushed him to try.  
  
Someone is kinder because you showed her what that meant.  
  
Someone is braver because you helped him find his courage.  
   
This group is powerful. And in little ways and big ones, you change the
world every day.  
   
Thank you!
