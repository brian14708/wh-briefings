6:47 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much.  And I thought I saw Fred
Sears in that picture.   
   
PARTICIPANT: You have.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  And, by the way, you know, I owe — I owe Fred a debt of
gratitude.  Years and years ago, he — he’s the reason why my first wife
ended up marrying me.  We flipped a coin.  I said I wanted to go talk to
her first, down in Flor- — in the Bahamas on spring break.  And another
guy named Mike McCrann wanted to see her.  He said, “I’ll flip a coin.” 
And I won the toss.  Thank you, Fred.  I’m indebted to you, pal.  
   
All kidding aside, look, I want to thank Lisa.  Look, you’re all a big
part of — she’s a big part of why I got elected — all of you are —
national co-chair of the campaign, helped lead the Vice Presidential
Selection Committee, and a great partner, and someone I trust
completely.   
   
When Lisa ran for Congress, she’d say, “When Lisa goes to Washington, we
all go to Washington.”  Well, that’s Lisa.  She brings everybody along. 
Doesn’t leave anybody behind.  Whether it’s the economy or jobs or
housing, public safety, environmental justice, the rights of working
people, she’s always there, always looking for solutions to bridge the
divides.  And we got some real divides these days.   
   
She’s always working for people and — and it’s — she takes it
personally.  I mean, she — she gets engaged.  And we all know it runs in
the family.  Ted, you and I have known each other for a long time.  You
were a significant public official, but you’re also probably one of the
best college basketball players in history.  Not a joke.  He was an
all-American.  
   
And, Ted, we’ve known each other, as I’ve said, a long time.   
   
And, Marla, you used to work for my Senate office.  I didn’t think I
could make it without her, but I’m working — I’m hanging in there.  But,
Marla, thank you.  
   
Look, so many of you on the call today are like family, and I want to
thank you all for your support.  We’re less than 30 days away from the
midterms, and the stakes are clear.  The right to choose is on the
ballot.  Your Social Security you paid for your whole life is on the
ballot.  The safety of our kids and gun violence is on the ballot. 
Literally, the survival of the planet is on the battol \[sic\] — on the
ballot.  And your right to vote.  And democracy itself on — is on the
ballot.  
   
And, by the way, I point out that the vast majority of American people
cite their concerns about the maintenance of our democracy as being a
genuine concern.  That hadn’t been the case for God knows — anyway,
well, that’s unusual.   
   
And I know it’s been a rough four or five years around the country, but
there’s some bright spots.   
   
You know, when we came to office, the economy was flat on its back.  We
were — had a high unemployment rate.  Things didn’t look good at all. 
Only 2 million people had been vaccinated.  
   
But we — now there’s nearly — we created 10 million jobs.  They tell me
— the historians tell me that more than — more jobs created at this
point in the presidency than any President on record, with your help.  
   
We have record employment of 3.5 percent.  We’ve created over — almost
700,000 manufacturing jobs.  
   
This — you know, the story — look, it — it’s been real clear: “Made in
America” is no longer just a slogan.  It’s a reality.  
   
IBM — I was just there with them up — up in Upstate New York.  IBM is
investing $20 billion to manufacture advanced quantum computers here in
America.   
   
The company Micron is investing $100 billion to manufacture computer
chips — the biggest investment of its kind in America.  And it’s doing
it up in Syracuse, New York.  
   
SK, one of the largest conglomerates in South Korea — it’s the second
largest, I think, if I’m not mistaken — makes everything from
semiconductors to pharmaceuticals.  They’ve committed to invest $50
billion in investments in America.  
   
And we still have a lot of work to do, but we’re building a stronger
economy than we’ve had before by a longshot and — one that is built from
the middle out and the bottom up.  
   
As Ted can tell you — your dad — I’m not a big trickle-down guy.  I —
you know, when we build from the middle out, everybody does well.  The
wealthy do very well and the middle class does well, and the poor have a
way up.  And so, it — so it matters.  
   
And yet, you know, we — Republicans have a very different view.  And, by
the way, if you ask anybody what is the Republican platform now — I’m
not joking; I’m being deadly earnest.  The Republican platform is
basically they just want to undo what we’ve done.  You know, they —
attack Democrats.  They really don’t want to see their — they don’t they
want us to see their plan.  
   
Well, guess what?  The guy in charge of the Senate races and the House
races is talking about the need to change — put Social Security on the
block every five years.   
   
But then, there’s a senior senator from the state of Wisconsin, he comes
along and says, “No, we should do it every year.”  Meaning, if you don’t
vote to reauthorize Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, they’re
gone or you can amend it and change it.  That’s a totally different
thing.  
   
And — but, you know, we need to focus on this November. Let’s start with
inflation.  I think about inflation the way my dad used to talk about
it, the way so many of you talk about it around the kitchen table: How
much of your monthly bills are you able to pay?  And after they’re all
paid and your necessities are paid, is there enough breathing room left
just to have a little bit of space?  Just a little bit of space.  
   
Well, we’re giving families a lot more breathing room.  We passed the
Inflation Reduction Act that is going to give Medicare the power to
negotiate lower prescription drug costs.  
   
By the way, we pay the highest — the highest drug costs of any major
nation in the world — by a longshot.  It locks in savings on healthcare
premiums for millions of people on the Affordable Care Act.  And it
saves families thousands of dollars in energy bills because of the
ability to weatherize your home, reduce costs, and deal with major
investments that are — you get tax benefits from investing in solar and
— even — and what it does to ordinary families when they have to replace
the coffee machine, the refrigerator, whatever.  You get a tax credit
for using the most efficient — most efficient new machines.   
   
And for the first time in a long time, we’re going to make sure the
biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share or at least close to
their fair share in federal taxes.  
   
You know, there were three — of the Fortune 500 companies, there were, I
think, 55 or 56 who, in the year 2000, made $40 billion and they didn’t
pay a single penny in federal taxes.  Not a single penny in corporate
taxes.  Now they have to pay a minimum of 15 percent.   
   
And, folks, no one — no one — no one making less than $400,000 had one
single penny of their taxes — federal taxes increased.   
   
We’re doing all this while we’re reducing the federal debt.  We reduced
the debt last year by $350 billion — so much for “big spending
Democrats”; more than a trillion dollars this year; and another $300
billion over the next decade because of the ability of Medicaid to
negotiate drug prices.  
   
And every single — every single Democrat joined Lisa and voted for the
Inflation Reduction Act, but every single Republican — every one — voted
against it.  Not only that, now they’re telling us their number-one
priority is to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act if they gain control
of the Congress, which means they’re going to wipe out those
benefits.   
   
They’re going to — right now what we passed is: Nobody who is on
Medicare will have to pay more than $12,000 \[sic\] a year.  I mean —
excuse me — $2,000 a year for prescriptions.  No matter how much the
prescription costs, there’s a $2,000 cap on prescriptions.  A
$35-a-month cap on insulin for folks on Medicare.  It goes away.  And
these things go away if they win.   
   
And, by the way, it only cost the companies a total of 10 bucks to make
that insulin.  That’s all it costs to make it and package it.   
   
Savings on healthcare premiums under the Affordable Care Act go away
that — we saved a family of four $2,400 a year because they got a better
coverage now.  And they’re still determined to repeal the Affordable
Care Act.   
   
Remember, they — they’ve tried it like 50 times, right?  Well, not 50 —
probably 20, 25 times in the previous year — when we ran and a year
before that.  And what were they doing?  They would take away the only
protection someone who has a pre-existing condition has, who can’t
afford private insurance — is to rely on the Affordable Care Act.  To
take that away, pre-existing conditions raise the premiums
exponentially.  
   
And if Republicans get their way, they’re going to get rid of the
corporate minimum tax as well.  The biggest corporations, as I said, pay
zero in federal income tax.  Now they got to pay 15 percent.   
   
Republicans are also coming after Social Security and Medicare as
well.   
   
The senator in charge of electing Democrats \[sic\] — I repeat this
because it’s important — to the U.S. Senate this year — electing
Republicans, I should say — has proposed a plan to put Social Security
on the chopping block every five years.  And that means: Every five
years, Congress will have to vote to cut, reduce, completely eliminate,
or increase Social Security and Medicare.  What do you think they’re
going to do?  What do you think they’re going to be able to play with
that?  
   
And we’ve been paying — you’ve been paying into Social Security since
the time you started working as a 16-year-old.  
   
And then there’s Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin.  I spoke — where it
bears repeating.  He thinks five years is too long to wait.  He thinks
every single year, Social Security and Medicare should be on the
chopping block — every single year.  And if Congress doesn’t vote to
affirmatively keep it, it goes away.  It’s not just Social Security;
it’s Medicare as well.  He wants to put everything else on the federal —
veterans’ benefits are at risk, the whole deal.   
   
I don’t know where these guys come from.   
   
And I hope you all saw the news report that describes Republicans who
voted against the infrastructure bill attacking me and Democrats, what
they call “socialism,” “radical spending,” “rush to
irresponsibility.”   
   
What they’re talking about is they’re talking about my forgiving debt
for the average person making less than $75,000 a year for student
debt.  If for five — if you had — for $10,000.  And if you had a Pell
Grant, it was — it was more than that.   
   
Now, Republicans are quietly, privately sending letters to my
administration asking for the money back, taking away — talking about
how important the projects are for their districts.   
   
But here’s the other thing: When we passed the le- — when we pass the
legislation relating to — to the infrastructure bill, you know, only
about 15, 16 of them voted for it.  But guess what?  Now they’re out
there holding press conferences, saying, “The money for this bridge and
the money for this road and the money for…”  All of this was done, and
they voted against the legislation, but they’re taking credit for it
now.  Seriously.   
   
And I’ve got to say, I was surprised to see there are so many socialists
in the Republican Party.  You know, they called us the “socialists.”   
   
Republicans are also coming after your freedoms on choice.  Lisa and I
are Democrats who want to codify Roe v. Wade.  Republicans want a
national ban with no exception for rape or incest, and they’re going to
criminalize doctors and nurses.   
   
I could go on, but the bottom line is simple: If Republicans take
control the Congress, historic victories we just won for the American
people are going to be taken away.  Every kitchen table cost was going
to go — are — under our position is going to go down.  Your freedoms are
going to be at — at greater risk.   
   
But when it comes to electing the next Congress, it’s not a referendum;
it’s a choice between two different ways of looking at our country. 
Democrats got a lot done.  We have so much more to do.  And it’s
understandable why people know we have so much more to do.  
   
For example, we finally, for the first time in almost 30 years, got gun
legislation passed.  But it didn’t include banning assault weapons.  I’m
going to get that done: banning assault weapons.   
   
If we expand our majorities in the House and Senate, we’re going to do a
lot, and we need Lisa.  And I mean it sincerely: We need Lisa.  A lot of
her colleagues look to her and look to her judgment.  And she can cross
the aisle and get some Republicans to move on some of our things.  So it
really matters.  
   
We cannot afford to lose our majority in the House, and we have to
increase our majority in the Senate.  We’re 50-50 now.  
   
And I just think — I apologize, I’m only supposed to have spoken a few
minutes to you, but there’s so much more to say.  I don’t want to keep
you here, but I really, really think it’s important that we understand
how much is at stake.   
   
You know, like I said, it’s not political polling.  Look at what — they
were asked — the broad polls done by the networks.  The American people
are, for the first time in God knows how long, worried about whether we
can keep our democracy.  Not a joke.  Who’s going to count the votes? 
Will it be the state legislature that can make a determination of who
won the election?  Things — I could go on and on.  There’s so much at
stake.   
   
So, I view this — this off-year election as one of the most important
elections that I’ve been engaged in, because a lot can change because
the institutions have changed.  The Supreme Court is more of an advocacy
group these days than it is a — evenhanded about it.   
   
So there’s a lot of stake.  I strongly urge you to do all you can to
continue to help Lisa.  And I’m sure — I have confidence in her.  And
she’s going to — she has a long, long future.  She’s going to make a big
difference in this country.   
   
So, I want to say God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops. 
Thank you.  
   
REPRESENTATIVE BLUNT ROCHESTER:  Mr. President, thank you so much.  I
appreciate you saying I have a long, long history.  Many people on this
call know I turn 60 this year, so it might not be as long as everybody
thinks.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  What?  I thought you were turning 30.  (Laughter.)   
   
REPRESENTATIVE BLUNT ROCHESTER:  Double that.   
   
And — but I have to say that being there at the very beginning of you
making the decision to run, at the time in our history that you did —
again, I am so proud.  You have been able and we have been able to do
some incredible things.  
   
I started with: recover, rebuild and restore.  Because, number one, we
had to really diligently recover from a pandemic: putting shots in arms,
getting businesses to stay open.  We’ve got some doctors and others on
this line that were helpful in those efforts too, with the American
Rescue Plan and to be able to recover.   
   
To rebuild, with the Bipartisan Infrastructure legislation, our roads,
our bridges, our ports, broadband investments in the state of Delaware
like we’ve never seen before.   
   
And then you just look at everything from the PACT Act for our
veterans.  You look at what we’ve done for the Safer Communities, as we
mentioned.  That was also something — 30 years — that you started years
ago to work on for gun safety.   
   
And then the — again, you mentioned the Inflation Reduction Act.  And we
didn’t even mention CHIPS and Science.  I mean, there are so many things
that you’ve been able to accomplish and we’ve been able to with the
slimmest of slim majorities in the House and hardly any majority at all
in the Senate.   
   
And so —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I told the Vice President, every time she votes, she’s
going to win.   
   
REPRESENTATIVE BLUNT ROCHESTER:  Yeah.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  And that turned out to be true.  
   
REPRESENTATIVE BLUNT ROCHESTER:  And you didn’t even mention the first
Black woman Supreme Court justice.   
   
So, in two years —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m proud of that.   
   
REPRESENTATIVE BLUNT ROCHESTER:  This has been two years that you have
done what some presidents don’t get done in a lifetime.   
   
And so, I just want to thank you so much for your support.  I want to
tell the people that are on this — this Zoom that this race does matter
and means a lot.  It means a lot to me because I want to represent
Delaware in Congress.   
   
And as you said in the beginning, everybody on here probably knows: When
Lisa goes to Washington, we all go to Washington.  That’s our theme. 
And I am just grateful to be of service right now.   
   
And we thank you so much for all that you have done for this country and
all that you will do.  And know that just like you have our backs, we’ve
got your back too, Mr. President.  We’ve got your back, too.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I can tell you, I see a lot of people on this call
I’m seeing now for the first time, like Robby Buccini.  And the Buccinis
helped me so much.  They were raised in my living room like my son Beau
and Hunter were raised in theirs.   
   
I look out there and I see people that have been around for a long time
like the Conways, who’ve been helping me, and — no, I really mean it,
Joe.  And I — I just think there’s so many people.   
   
And Betsy, I — you come from a family of real Democrats, and you’re
doing a hell of a job.   
   
I just — I’m going to get in trouble because I’m going to miss somebody
on the screen here.  But I just think it really matters.  And there’s a
lot — a lot we can do.   
   
And look, a lot we’re doing, our kids’ future depends on it.  We are
really —  
   
REPRESENTATIVE BLUNT ROCHESTER:  Yeah.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  We’re at a real inflection point in world history. 
Things are changing, and the decisions we make the last four or five
years and the next four or five years are going to determine what this
country looks like for the next four or five generations.  For real.  
   
REPRESENTATIVE BLUNT ROCHESTER:  And you’ve made — you’ve —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  In domestic policy and foreign policy — anyway, I’m
going on too long and keeping you too long.  Thank you for helping,
Lisa.   
   
And I’m supposed to go deal with a little issue having to do with
Ukraine.  So, thank you.  
   
REPRESENTATIVE BLUNT ROCHESTER:  Thank you again, sir.  Thank you, Mr.
President.  Thank you so much.
