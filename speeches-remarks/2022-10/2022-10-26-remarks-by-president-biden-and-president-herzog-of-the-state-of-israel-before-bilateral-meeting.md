Oval Office

12:53 P.M. EDT   
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  I warned the Israeli press about how you guys come in
with your boom mics, so they — they’re all ready for you.  
   
PRESIDENT HERZOG:  They’re not any easier, Mr. President, in Israel
either.   
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  (Laughs.)  Anyway, Mr. President, welcome.  It’s great
to have you here in the Oval Office.  And, you know, I want to thank you
for your hospitality you showed me when I was in Israel.  And thank you
again for the honor you showed me.   
   
I was bragging to the President: I have presented — been presented by
the President the Israeli Presidential Medal of Freedom, which is on the
table behind you over there.  I’m very proud of it.  And — but thank you
for that honor.  
   
And tomorrow, Israel and Lebanon are going to sign an agreement to
establish a permanent — a permanent maritime boundary between your two
countries.  I think it’s a historic breakthrough.  It took a lot of
courage for you to step up and step into it.  It took some real guts. 
And I think it took principled and persistent diplomacy to get it done,
and I compliment you and I compliment the government.  
   
This agreement is going to allow the development of energy fields in —
for both countries.  And it’s going to create new hope and economic
opportunities for — for the people of Lebanon and enhance the stability
and security of the people of Israel, in my view.   
   
I’ve been — as you probably know, I’ve been working on this since I was
Vice President of the United States, and I really compliment you.  
   
We’re also going to discuss the ironclad commitment — and this is — I’ll
say this 5,000 times in my career — the irontad \[sic\]– -clad
commitment the United States has to Israel based on our principles, our
ideas, our values.  They’re the same values.  
   
And I — I’ve often said, Mr. President, if there were — if there were
not an Israel, we’d have to invent one.   
   
PRESIDENT HERZOG:  Thank you.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  And I’ve told you before: My dad was a — a righteous
Christian who — we used to sit for dinner to have conversation and
incidentally eat.  And I remember, even when I was a teenager, my dad
talking about how we should’ve done so much more.  “Why didn’t we bomb
the railroad tracks?  Why didn’t we…”  And so on.  
   
PRESIDENT HERZOG:   In World War Two.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  In World War Two.   
   
And so it’s a deep shared concern.  And so we have bedrock values and
interests, and I’m going to — hope we get to talk about those a little
bit today.  And I think our interests are pretty consistent around the
world and in the region.   
   
So, thank you for being here.  
   
PRESIDENT HERZOG:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I want to thank you
wholeheartedly for your hospitality, for inviting me here.  It’s an
expression of true friendship.  And we had the enormous pleasure of
hosting you at the President’s home and in Israel at large a few weeks
ago.  It was a true moment of pleasure for the people of Israel.  And I
also think it was one hell of a pleasure for you too, as far as I could
get it.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  It was.  
   
PRESIDENT HERZOG:  You are a true friend of Israel, Mr. President, and
the United States is our closest, strongest historical ally.  And I’m
very proud to come here as the head of state of the State of Israel to
express my feelings of friendship and bonding and the unbreakable bond
between our nations.   
   
You know, Mr. President, today marks 40 days to the killing of Mahsa, a
young Iranian woman who protested.  And today the Iranian regime is
crushing thousands of Iranian citizens — men — young men and women — who
are demonstrating and simply pleading to have their own liberties.

And this is an example of the way Iran is working: crushing its own
citizens, moving towards nuclear weapons, and supplying lethal weapons
that are killing innocent citizens in Ukraine.  And I think the Iranian
challenge will be a major challenge, as — which we will be discussing.

I want to thank you, Mr. President, and the administration for moving
forward and carving the deal between Israel and Lebanon on the maritime
borders.  And we appreciate the effort and, of course, the bringing it
to fruition tomorrow.

We will also be discussing the inclusion and integration of Israel in
the region, in the Middle East, as we see more and more nations coming
onboard and cooperating with Israel in so many fields.  
   
For one item that you and I will participate, together with leaders from
all over the world, in the COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt a few weeks
down the road — I think the climate chan- — challenge can serve as a
common denominator for so many nations, and also between Israel and the
United States.

And finally, Mr. President, you know, we have elections in Israel, and
you’re having midterm elections in the United States.  But one thing is
clear — and I think this visit epitomizes it best — is that our
friendship and strong bond transcends all political differences and
opinions and parties. 

And I hope that together we can continue to work towards the wellbeing
of the State of Israel, the United States, and the world at large. 
Thank you very much.
