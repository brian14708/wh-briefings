Q Sir, why don’t more candidates want to be seen in public with you,
like Mr. Fetterman?

THE PRESIDENT: They’re — they’re — what are you talking about?

Q Tim Ryan in Ohio says he doesn’t want you there. Warnock said he
wouldn’t say. Do you think they’re making a mistake?

THE PRESIDENT: No. There have been 16 that have already (inaudible), and
a lot more have asked — another 20 or so. So I’m going to be doing it.

Q (Inaudible) vote in the Senate?

THE PRESIDENT: I think so. Because it ain’t over until it’s over.

Q Do you feel like, sir, the economic message — your economic message is
resonating with voters in these key states?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, we’ll soon find out. You have to ask these folks
right here.

CUSTOMER: Don’t ask us. Don’t ask us.

THE PRESIDENT: Fire rescue, right?

CUSTOMER: Don’t ask us. (Laughs.)

THE PRESIDENT: Anyway, thank you.

Q Why aren’t you doing more rallies, sir?

Q So if it does come to that, do you think you’ll be able to work with
the Republicans if they’re the ones in control of the Congress? You’ve
been saying you want to be a bipartisan kind of figure in the country.

THE PRESIDENT: Well, I’ve been able to do that. I’ve gotten — I got a
lot of bipartisan stuff passed you guys never thought I’d get passed.

Q Are you worried about Ukraine aid when Republicans take charge of the
House?

THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I am worried about that, because they said they’ll
cut it.

Q Sir, do you have any plans to go to Nevada or Georgia in the coming
weeks?

THE PRESIDENT: Pardon me?

Q To Nevada or Georgia.

THE PRESIDENT: Both the congressmen asked me to go out. I don’t know if
I’m going to be able to get out in Nevada. And in Georgia, they asked me
to come down. We’re trying to work it out now.

Q Are you going to go next week?

THE PRESIDENT: I don’t know where I’m going. I’ve got about 16, 18
requests around the country, so I don’t know who’s going where. I get
told.

Q How are you feeling about the election in general?

THE PRESIDENT: I’m feeling good.

Q You’re feeling good?

THE PRESIDENT: I’m feeling good.

These guys, all they want to do is eat their lunch.
