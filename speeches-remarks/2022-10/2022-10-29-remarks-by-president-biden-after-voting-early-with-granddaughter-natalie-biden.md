THE PRESIDENT:  I want to make a brief statement about Nancy and Paul
Pelosi.  You know, I talked to them.  He seems to be doing a lot
better.  It looks like he’s going to recover fully.   
   
And — but also, don’t know for certain, but it looks like this was
intended for Nancy.  He kept asking, “Where’s Nancy?  Where’s Nancy?”  
   
And the generic point I want to make is that, you know, it’s one thing
to condemn the violence.  But you can’t condemn the violence unless you
condemn those people who continue to argue the election was not real,
that it’s being stolen, that all the — all the malarkey that’s being put
out there to undermine democracy.   
   
You can’t just apologize and say, “The violence….”  It affects people’s
mentality.  It affects how people think, particularly people who are
not, maybe, as stable as other people.   
   
So, the vi- — the talk has to stop.  That’s the problem.  That’s the
problem.  You can’t just say, “I feel badly about the violence; we
condemn it.”  Condemn what produces the violence, and this talk produces
the violence.  
   
Thank you.  
   
Q    Mr. President, can you say a few words about the stampede in South
Korea?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  You know, I just — I was down watching her game down at
school, and I didn’t hear about it until on the way in the car.  I know
nothing about it except — South Korea, correct?  
   
Q    One hundred and forty-six people, up to now, were killed in a
stampede for Halloween (inaudible).  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, I apo- — I will make a statement when I find out
more about it.  I — but I — I just literally heard about it from staff
on the way down in the car.  
   
Q    How are you feeling about the midterms with nine days to go?  And
how are you feeling about deciding where to go and where not to go down
the stretch?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m feeling good.  I mean, I’ve been into, I guess, now
36 constituencies, either campaigning for a specific candidate or going
in with a candidate who is doing some — like out at the bridge in
Pittsburgh.   
   
And I’m going to — I’m going to be going to — the remainder of the week,
I’m going to be engaged.  And I’m going to be back in Pennsylvania.  I’m
going to be in Maryland.  Going to be, I believe, in — I’m going to be
New Mexico, California.  So I’m going to be all around the country.   
   
My wife, Jill, is up New Hampshire right now.   
   
So, I’m going to be spending the rest of the time making the case that
this is not a referendum.  It’s a choice — a fundamental choice — a
choice between two very different visions for the country.  And that’s
what it’s about.  
   
Q    Mr. President, do you have a reaction to Russia moving to suspend
the U.N. grain deal with Ukraine?   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, I do.  It’s just pure — purely outrageous.  It’s
going to increase starvation.  There’s no reason for them to do that.   
   
And — but they’re always looking for some rationale to be able to say
the reason they’re doing something outrageous is because the West made
them do it.  And it’s just — it’s just not — there’s no merit to what
they’re doing.  The U.N. negotiated that deal, and that should be the
end of it.   
   
Thank you.  
   
Q    You were with Fetterman yesterday.  Are you confident about his —
about the way it looks there?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, I thought he was really good.  I thought he knew
was doing.  I thought he was strong.   
   
And, look, Fetterman is Pennsylvania.  I mean, Fetterman is everything
that he appears to be.  You know where he stands.  He has great
courage.  He has no reluctance to say what he thinks.  He’s my kind of
guy.  And I think he’s going to be fine.  And he’s just getting better
and better.   
   
He had a stroke; he’s recovering.  
   
Thank you all very much.
