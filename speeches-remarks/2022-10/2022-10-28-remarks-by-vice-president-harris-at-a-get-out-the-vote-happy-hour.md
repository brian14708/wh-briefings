*Reserve Lounge  
*Philadelphia, Pennsylvania**

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  What’s up, Philly?  (Applause.)  Are you going to
elect John Fetterman to be the next senator from the great state of
Pennsylvania?  (Applause.)  
   
So I’m in town to say hey to all of you.  And —  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBERS:  Hey!  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  And to thank you for what you
continuously do and what you’re about to do in 11 days, because the
stakes could not be higher.  
   
You know, I was saying to the lieutenant governor, soon to be senator,
that one of the things I know about this town and this state is you love
a fighter.  And you got a fighter in John Fetterman.  (Applause.)  You
got a fighter.  You got a fighter.  
   
And we need our fighters on the ground in D.C., because the fight is
on.  It really is.  You watch what’s happening around the country, in
particular from extremist so-called leaders.  And, you know, the stakes
are high in this election.  And so, I’m here to thank you for what you
did to elect Joe Biden and me to the White House in 2020 — (applause) —
and to ask you to do what you know how to do again in these next 11
days.   
   
And I will remind you of what you did.  You turned out historic number
of voters in 2020, historic number of young voters in 2020.   
   
And let’s not forget, it was during the height of a pandemic.  People
had suffered so much loss — loss in terms of their families and their
friends, loss in terms of jobs, loss in terms of normalcy.  Parents were
trying to figure out how to educate their children online.  So much was
going on — during the height of a pandemic.  And you turned out and
turned out an historic number of voters.   
   
And what I think it was about is that folks went to the polls because
they knew — because you promised them: Look, voting is about putting in
your order.  It’s about saying — and we’re going to remind people they
went to the polls in 2020 because they said, “You know what?  We need to
deal with child poverty in America.”  And because they voted, we
extended the Child Tax Credit so that we, in the first year, reduced
child poverty in America by 40 percent — (applause) — including Black
children in poverty in America.   
   
Folks went to the polls and put in their order and said, “You know
what?  Parents are having a hard time.  It’s expensive to raise these
children.  We need some help.”  And because you voted, and because you
convinced your neighbors and your friends that their voice mattered, we
got elected.  And we were able to pass a tax cut for working families to
get up to 8,000 more dollars in their pocket to help with the cost of
food and medicine and school supplies.  (Applause.)  Because we voted. 
Because we voted.   
   
And people went to the polls and said, “You know what?  There are some
of us who are proud HBCU graduates.”  (Applause.)  You know. 
(Laughter.)  “And understand what centers of academic excellence they
are but that they need some help in terms of the financial situation
because we don’t have the same kind of endowments as other
institutions.”  And because people put in their order, we put over $5
billion into our HBCUs.  (Applause.)  
   
People stood in line; they took time out of their lives, their busy
lives, to vote.  They said, “You know what?  I appreciate what y’all did
in 2008 with the Obama-Biden administration and reforming the healthcare
system, but there’s still more work to do because it’s still expensive
to get prescription medication.”  And in particular, because, you know,
we have family members who have diabetes, and the cost of insulin is so
expensive that, for some of our seniors in particular, they’re making a
decision about whether they fill the doctor’s prescription which is
about their life, versus paying their rent or buying food.  
   
And because they stood in line and voted — because they said — Black
Americans are 60 percent more likely to have diabetes; Latinos, 70
percent more likely, and we need to deal with that.  Because they voted,
we got elected.  And we are now capping insulin at $35 a month. 
(Applause.)  Because they voted.  
   
Because they voted and said, “You know what?  The pharmaceutical
companies keep jacking up the price of prescription medication.  Can’t
you negotiate against that?”  And because they voted, for the first time
in so long we took this on and said Medicare can negotiate against the
pharmaceutical companies to bring down the cost of prescription
medication for 60 million Americans.  Because you voted.   
   
Because you voted and you went to the polls, and you said, “It’s about
time we have a Black woman on the United States Supreme Court.” 
(Applause.)  Because you voted, please call her Justice Ketanji Brown
Jackson.  (Applause.)   
   
That’s the power we have.  
   
So let’s look at what’s happening.  For almost every one of what I’m
talking about, we need those numbers in the United  
States Senate.  Right now, we are looking at a situation with Thurgood
Marshall’s court.  The court of Thurgood Marshall just took a
constitutional right from the people of America, from the women of
America.   
   
The way we can undo that is we need the votes in the Senate because the
President is prepared to pass the Women’s Health Protection Act.   But
we need two more votes in the United States Senate.  We got to hold on
to our numbers, and we need John Fetterman in the United States Senate. 
(Applause.)  We need him there.  We need them there.  We need those
votes.  
   
The President has said: Two more senators in the United States Senate,
and he will sign the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. 
(Applause.)  Two more senators.   
   
So I’m here in Philadelphia to ask for your help.  And while thanking
you and recognizing what you did in 2020, I’m asking you to do that
again.  These seats — that Senate seat is for six years.  Understand
what that means.  That six years is a long time in the life of folks who
have things at stake in this election.  
   
So we have 11 days.  Voting has already started.  I know the power of
this room.  I know the power that we have, understanding that we will
not let things happen to us, that we know our power to determine the
future of our country in so many ways, including when we put in our
order and go to vote.   
  
So, please, with everything you’ve got, we can’t get these 11 days
back.  And then it’s going to be six years for Pennsylvania.  Six
years.  
   
So I know you got a lot going on in the next six days.  I know you got a
whole lot — you know, a game that you’re going to be watching. 
(Laughs.)  (Applause.)  I know you going to be watching that game.  Mad
respect.   
   
But we cannot get back these 11 days, guys.  Six years.  All right?  
   
So, Josh Shapiro has to be governor.  (Applause.)   
   
And John Fetterman.  Please, help this fighter fight.  Help this fighter
fight.  Because we need you.   
   
And with that, I thank you.  And enjoy the evening.  Thank you. 
(Applause.)
