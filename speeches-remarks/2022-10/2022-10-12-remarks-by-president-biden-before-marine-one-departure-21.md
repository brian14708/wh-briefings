Q    Mr. President, what has your reaction been to the Herschel Walker
controversy in Georgia?  And do you think Democrats can hold that
seat?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  Negative.  And yes.   
  
Q    Mr. President, Blumenthal and Khanna right now, they’re calling for
a stopping of U.S. arm sales to Saudi Arabia.  Do you support that
legislation?   
  
THE PRESIDENT:  We’re going to react to Saudi Arabia, and they’re doing
consultation when they come back.  And we will take action.  
  
Q    What’s your reaction to recent Russian attacks on civilian
infrastructure in Ukraine?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  Same as it’s always been: It’s brutal.  It’s just — it’s
beyond the pale.  
  
Q    You said you would be open to meeting with Vladimir Putin to
discuss Brittney Griner.  Have you seen any movement on that front?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  Not with Putin.   
  
Q    You want to codify Roe v. Wade, sir, right?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.
