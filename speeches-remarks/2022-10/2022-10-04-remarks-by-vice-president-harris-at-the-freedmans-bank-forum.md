*Treasury Department  
Washington, D.C.*

12:10 P.M. EDT  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Good afternoon.  Please have a
seat.  Good afternoon.  
   
And to our incredible Secretary, Janet Yellen, thank you for welcoming
us, thank you for hosting us, and thank you for your partnership.  I
think you all — many of you here have worked with our Secretary, with
Janet Yellen over the years, and you know that she’s an extraordinary
fighter for the working people of America, and she’s been an
extraordinary partner to me and the President as we work on the issue of
ensuring that all people in our nation have the ability and the capacity
to realize their dreams and that access to capital will not be a barrier
to those achievements.  
   
So, thank you, Secretary Yellen.  And everyone here — this is a room
full of leaders — thank you all for joining us this afternoon.  
   
So, I will begin with some history, which I think is familiar with many
people in this room, but there are many who are not familiar with the
history of the — of Freedman’s Bank.   
   
So, Freedman’s Savings Bank was founded by the United States Congress in
1865.  It was a bank unlike any other our nation had known.  Freedman’s
Bank was established to serve Black Americans newly freed from slavery,
to help them build wealth and to build a better future.  At Freedman’s,
to open a savings account, you just needed five cents, which, as I’ve
calculated, is about a dollar today.   
   
In the years after its founding, tens of thousands of Black families
opened an account at Freedman’s.  They saved up to buy a farm, to build
a home, to open a business.  Even schoolchildren saved their pocket
money to deposit it in this institution.    
   
And then, nine years later, after the bank first opened its doors,
because of an economic downturn and because of the organized assault on
the project of Reconstruction, Freedman’s Bank was forced to close. 
Over 60,000 people lost their savings.    
   
Now, Freedman’s Bank was guided by a vision — the vision of an economy
that works for all Americans and includes all Americans; the vision of a
nation in which all people have access to the financial resources they
need to succeed, to thrive, and to determine their own future.  Truly,
at the heart of that bank was the concept of self-determination.  
   
Over a century and a half later, in communities across our nation, that
vision remains unrealized.   
   
Consider: Today, Black entrepreneurs are three times more likely to
report they did not apply for a loan for fear of being turned away by a
bank — often, anecdotally, because they heard about that experience from
friends and relatives.   
   
Today, Black and Latino homeowners are rejected by traditional financial
institutions at a higher rate when applying for home loans.  And this is
the case even when they have credit profiles similar to other
applicants.   
   
Today, many immigrant businessowners, including some Asian American
businessowners, face language barriers that limit their ability to
access capital and banking services.   
   
And people who live in rural areas, including many Native Americans,
often lack access to traditional financial services of any kind.   
   
So, President Biden and I know that for our nation to succeed, these
disparities must be spoken of, acknowledged, and addressed.  
   
One of the last actions — actions, as you heard Secretary Yellen
mention, I took as a United States senator was to team up with Leader
Chuck Schumer and Senator Mark Warner and Senator Cory Booker and
Chairman — Chairwoman, excuse me — Maxine Waters to invest $12 billion
in community lenders, which, of course, are financial institutions that
predominantly do business in overlooked and underserved communities.  
   
Last month, I was proud to announce that because of that hard work and
the work of many of the leaders in this room, our administration has
distributed more than $8 billion of that investment to 162 community
lenders across our nation.  That is $8 billion on the ground in
communities across our nation right now.  (Applause.)   
   
And I’ll share with you some of the examples.  In North Dakota, Native
American Bank lent $10 million to help fund an opioid addiction
treatment facility on Tribal lands.   
   
In Georgia, Carver Bank lent over half a million dollars to help
Black-owned companies build affordable housing.   
   
And in Mississippi, Hope Credit Union — led, of course, by the great
Bill Bynum — (laughter) — lent $10 thousand to a Black-owned and
women-owned coffee company to help them expand.  And that’s just one
example of the incredible work that they do there.  
   
Since taking office then, I will tell you, I have traveled our nation
and spoken with small business owners who have received funds from
community lenders.  And I have seen what it means in terms of — in terms
of acknowledging and recognizing, and then feeding their ambition and
aspiration and creativity, both in terms of their own aptitude and
capacity, but also because they are in the best position to understand
the needs and the capacity of their communities.  
   
And I’ve seen how they use that capital to hire people from the
community, to open a new storefront on the main street, how they buy
inventory from local businesses.  The whole community benefits in one
way or another economically — not to mention psychically — from their
presence.  
   
And, at the same time, I have also seen how the great need for capital
still remains in our country, meaning how much more work we still have
yet to do.  
   
You know, I hope and know that everyone here does get the opportunity to
travel our country.  And from my travels, I will share with you: There
are so many people in our country that have incredible dreams — fueled
by their ambition, fueled by their aspiration, fueled by seeing what is
possible and then going for it — but far too many still lack the
resources and the support to make those dreams a reality.   
   
And what ends up happening then is these entrepreneurs cannot access
capital to start a business.  We’re talking about families who then
cannot access the capital they need to buy a home; students who cannot
access capital to get an education because they live in an underserved
community and because, often, they also do not have the benefit of
intergenerational wealth.  
   
We need to address this because, again, there is a complete disconnect
between their inability to grow and — and the fact that they are so
talented and desirous of doing just that.   
   
So let’s deal with that disconnect — which we also refer to as
disparities, because we see that people in our country are having an
experience that is not equal.  And that’s why we talk about equity,
because we recognize not everybody starts out on the same base.  They
don’t start out in the same place, even though they have the same
God-given capacity.  
   
So, when we talk about the work we are doing here together, it is
recognizing that and being guided by this principle of what we must do
in the spirit and in the interest of equity.  And to do this, one of the
aspects of the success we have seen so far is the benefit and the
incredible power of public-private partnership — the public and the
private sector joining together.   
   
And what we have been doing and must do more is to combine the expertise
and the experience of the private sector with the reach and the scale
that only the government can provide.  And together, that is what we
have done so far, which has resulted in the success we have seen.  
   
As Secretary Yellen mentioned, earlier this year, we launched the
Economic Opportunity Coalition.  This coalition consists of over 20
private-sector organizations.  It includes technology companies,
philanthropies, and some of the largest consumer banks and investment
firms.   
   
And together, these private-sector leaders have committed tens of
billions of dollars to promote and then provide capital to community
lenders to support entrepreneurship and minority-owned businesses, and
to expand access to financial services, and to create and protect
affordable housing.   
   
And today, this coalition has committed more than $1 billion to
community banks serving minority and rural communities.   
   
So all of our work thus far — we still have more to do — all of our work
thus far, I believe, comes down to this: America is a nation driven by
the ambition and aspiration of her people.   
   
And so let us continue to fight to make sure all people have a chance to
realize their dreams and to determine their own future.  Because when we
do, we not only advance economic justice, we strengthen our economy as a
whole, creating prosperity and opportunity for all.  
   
Together, we here know we have the ability and the responsibility and
the duty, dare I say, to realize the vision of Freedman’s Bank.  And
that is what we have gathered here to do.   
   
So, thank you all so very much for your vision, for your commitment, and
your work.  Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)
