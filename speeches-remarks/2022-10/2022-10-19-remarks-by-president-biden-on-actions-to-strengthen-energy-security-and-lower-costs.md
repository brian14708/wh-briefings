THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Ready, get set, go?  Well, good
afternoon.   
   
Earlier this year, because of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, the price of
oil and gas increased dramatically, and I acted decisively at the time. 
And thanks in part to those actions, the price of our gas has fallen 30
percent from the summer highs.   
   
Now it’s down about $1.15 a gallon from their peak during the summer,
and gas prices have fallen every day in the last week.  Let me repeat:
Gas prices have come down, and they continue to come down again. 
They’re now down more than 27 cents a gallon in Wisconsin this past
week, 27 cents in Oregon, 16 cents in Ohio, 25 cents in Nevada, 17 cents
in — in Indiana in just the last 10 days.  And that’s progress.   
   
But they’re not falling fast enough.  Families are hurting.  You’ve
heard me say before, but I get it.  I come from a family — if the price
of gasoline went up at the gas station, we felt it.  Gas prices hit
almost every family in this country, and they squeeze their family
budgets.   
   
And when the price of gas goes up, other expenses get cut. That’s why I
have been doing everything in my power to reduce gas prices since
Putin’s invasion of Ukraine caused these price hikes — these prices to
spike and rattled international oil markets.  (Clears throat.)  Excuse
me.   
   
I focused on how we can protect American families from that spike and
give folks just a little bit of breathing room, as my dad would say.   
   
Today I’m announcing three critical steps that my administration will
take to reduce gas prices at the pump.  First, the Department of Energy
will release another 15 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve, extending our previously announced release through the month of
December.  
   
Independent analysis they — excuse me, independent analysts have
confirmed that drawdowns from the reserves so far have played a big role
in bringing down oil prices — bringing them down.  So, we’re going to
continue to responsibly use that national asset.   
   
Right now, the Strategic Pol- — the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is more
than half full, with about 400 million barrels of oil.  That’s more than
enough for any emergency drawdown.  
   
With my announcement today, we’re going to continue to stabilize markets
and decrease the prices at a time when the actions of other countries
have caused such volatility.   
   
And I’ve told my team behind me here to be prepared to look further —
look for further releases in the months ahead if needed.  We’re calling
it a “Ready and Release” plan.  This allows us to move quickly to
prevent oil price spikes and respond to international events.   
   
Secondly, we need to responsibly increase American oil production
without delaying or deferring our transition to clean energy.  Let me —
let’s debunk some myths here.  My administration has not stopped or
slowed U.S. oil production; quite the opposite.  We’re producing 12
million barrels of oil per day.  And by the end of this year, we will be
producing 1 million barrels a day, more than the day in which I took
office.  In fact, we’re on track for record oil production in 2023.  
   
And today, the United States is the largest producer of oil and
petroleum products in the world.  We export more than we import.  And I
still heard from oil comp- — and I’ve heard from oil companies that
they’re worried that investing in additional oil production today will —
will — in case of the — in case demand goes down in the future, and
they’re not going to be able to sell their oil products at a competitive
price later.  
   
Well, we have a solution for that.  Today, I’m announcing a plan to
refill the Strato- — the Strategic Petroleum Res- — Oil Reserve in the
years ahead at a profit for taxpayers.  The United States government is
going to purchase oil to refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve when
prices fall to $70 a barrel.  And that means oil companies can invest to
ramp up production now, with confidence they’ll be able to sell their
oil to us at that price in the future: $70.  
   
Refining and refilling the reserve at $70 a barrel is a good price for
companies and it’s a good price for the taxpayers, and it’s critical to
our national security.  
   
To put it in context, since March, the average price of oil has been
more than $90 a barrel, the highest since 2014.  By selling from the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve at the higher price of $90 earlier this year
and then refilling it in the future at a lower price, around $70, it
will actually make money for the taxpayers, lower the price of gas, and
help bolster production, all while totally consistent with my commitment
to accelerate to transition to clean energy.   
   
So my message to oil companies is: You’re sitting on record profits, and
you’re — and we’re giving you more certainty.  So you can act now to
increase oil production now.  
   
The third thing I’m doing is I’m calling on oil companies to pass the
savings on to consumers.  
   
Consider this: In the second quarter of this year, profits at six of the
largest produce- — publicly traded oil companies were more than $70
billion.  That’s $70 billion in just one quarter — 90 days.  Seventy
billion.   
   
So far, American oil companies are using that windfall — the windfall of
profits to buy back their own stock, passing that money on to their
shareholders, not to consumers.  
   
In fact, in the first half of the year, those same companies spent over
$20 billion buying back their own stock and, most importantly, buying
back — a buyback that — the most significant buyback in the last —
almost a decade.  
   
That’s great if you own a lot of stock in oil companies or if you’re an
executive in an oil company.  It puts a lot of money in your pocket. 
That — it’s how you get paid.  But it’s not the case for the vast
majority of Americans paying at the pump.  
   
Here’s another thing: When the cost of oil comes down, we should see the
price at the gas station — at the pump come down as well.  That’s how
it’s supposed to work.  But that’s not what’s happening.  
   
In the past two weeks, the price of oil has fallen $4 a barrel.  And you
think — and thanks in large part to steps we’ve taken this year, the
price of oil has fallen nearly $40 a barrel since mid-June.  That’s a 30
percent drop in the price of a barrel of oil.   
   
But guess what?  Gas prices haven’t fallen that much.  And it’s not
right.  Gas prices at the pump should be lower.  
   
In fact, if retailers and refiners were earning the average profit
they’ve made over the last 17 years, Americans would be paying at least
60 cents less per gallon for every gallon they buy.  Say it again: 60
cents less for every gallon they buy.  That makes a big difference in a
family.  
   
My message to the American energy companies is this: You should not be
using your profits to buy back stock or for dividends.  Not now.  Not
while a war is raging.  
   
You should use those record-breaking profits to increase production and
refining.  Invest in America for the American people.  Bring down the
price you charge at the pump to reflect what you pay for the product.  
   
You still make a significant profit.  Your shareholders will still do
very well.  And the American people will catch the break they deserve
and get a fair price at the pump as well.  
   
One more thing I want to mention today.  Our country needs to pass
permitting reform to accelerate the development of clean energy.  
   
Right now, the process of getting clean energy projects approved is too
cumbersome and too time consuming.  So, I’m asking the Congress: Pass a
permitting bill to speed up the approval of all kinds of energy
production from wind, to solar, to clean hydrogen.  Because we need to
get this moving now, quickly — now.  
   
It would take — you know, this — if we do this, it would take the
historic clean energy investments that I signed into law and put them
into action.  
   
In fact, one independent analyst has already estimated that the $369
billion we’re making in federal investments that will generate — if we
just — just that will generate $1.7 trillion in total public and private
investments in the years ahead.  
   
You can increase oil and gas production now while still moving full
speed ahead to accelerate our transition to clean energy.  That way —
that way, we can lower energy costs for American families, enhance our
national security at a very difficult moment.   
   
Let me close with this.  I know it’s been a rough four or five years for
the country.  For a lot of families, things are still tough.  
   
The choices made by other countries are affecting the price of gas here
at home.  That’s why I’ve been acting so aggressively.  
   
Without the steps we have taken over the past several months to ramp up
production and lower prices and get relief to consumers, gas prices
would be higher than they are today.  
   
And we’ll keep doing everything we can to keep it going to ensure our
energy independence and security is available and to lower gas prices
here at home and to give folks a little bit of breathing room.  
   
We just have to remember who we are.  We’re the United States of
America, for God’s sake.  There’s not a single thing we can’t do when we
put our minds to it.  And we can strengthen our energy security now, and
we can build a clean energy economy for the future at the same time. 
This is totally within our capacity.  Totally within our capacity.  
   
Gas prices are coming down.  We’re going to do everything we can to make
sure they continue to come down and companies act responsibly so it’s
reflected at the pump.  
   
Thank you all.  And may God bless you.  And may God protect our troops. 
Thank you.  Appreciate it.  
   
Q    Mr. President — Mr. President, what is your —  
   
Q    Mr. President, what do you say to —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t hear it.  Can you speak louder?  (Laughter.)  
   
Q    What is your response to Republicans who say you are only doing
this SPR release becau- — to help Democrats in the midterms?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  “Where have they been the last four months?”  That’s my
response.  
   
Q    Is it politically motivated, sir, this move —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, it’s not.  
   
Q    — three weeks before the midterms?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Look, it’s makes sense.  I’ve been doing this for how
long now?  It’s not politically motivated at all.  It’s motivated to
make sure that I continue to push on what I’ve been pushing on.  And
that is making sure there’s enough oil that’s being pumped by the
companies so that we have the ability to be able to produce enough gas
that we need here at home, oil we need here at home, and, at the same
time, keep moving in the direction of providing for alternative energy. 
That’s what I’ve been doing.  
   
Now, the problem is: These guys were asleep.  I don’t know where they’ve
been.  And they seem — you know.  
   
The price at the pump should reflect what the price of a barrel of oil
costs, and it’s not going down consistently.  
   
Q    Mr. President, Vladimir Putin has declared martial law in parts of
Ukraine.  What does that say to you, sir, about where his thinking is on
the war in Ukraine right now?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I think that Vladimir Putin finds himself in an
incredibly difficult position.  And what it reflects, to me, is it seems
his only tool available to him is to brutalize individual citizens in
Ukraine — Ukrainian citizens — to try to intimidate them into
capitulating.  They’re not going to do that.  
   
Thank you.
