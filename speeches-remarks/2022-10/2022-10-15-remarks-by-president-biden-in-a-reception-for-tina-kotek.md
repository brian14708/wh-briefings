THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you — hello, hello, hello?  Is this working —
there we go.  Thank you.  Please, have a seat if you have one. 
(Laughs.)

I — Gov, a little premature, I know, but you’re going to be our next
governor.  (Applause.)  You know, I wrote a lot of stuff down here for
me to say — (laughter) — but before we begin, it’s not just the governor
running this time; you got probably one of the best senators in the last
four, five generations: Ron Wyden.  (Applause.)  I don’t know that Ron
is here or not.  And Jeff Merkley.  (Applause.)  
   
I couldn’t have gotten much of anything done — we got a lot done this
first 18, 20 months, in long — large part because of them.  And also,
you know, Suzanne Bonamici — it was her birthday yesterday.  That’s why
I came out.  (Applause.)  
   
Look, let me talk about Tina, because it’s a race that matters well
beyond the state of Oregon.  And I really mean that.

We’re at one of those inflection points in — in American history where
things are changing so rapidly that the things that happen in the last
several years, the next three or four years, are going to determine the
direction of the country for the next four or five generations. 
(Applause.)

No, for — no, I — I mean it sincerely.  I’m not — this is not a
political comment.  I think it’s a historical comment.  Things are
changing so consequentially around the world.  You think about it,
regardless of who the leaders are, the world is in — not necessarily
disarray, but it’s like all the glacial parts are moving.  The
relationship be- — with one nation and another.

I’ve spent the bulk of my time holding NATO together since I got in
place.  (Applause.)  Lead- — no — spent a lot of time dealing with the —
with — with Latin America and South America, an overwhelming amount of
time in the Middle East, what’s happening in the Far East, dealing with
China and Japan, and a whole ra- — the things are — things are moving.

And at home, they’re moving at well — as well.

We’re in a circumstance where the — I don’t ever remember a time — and I
was a senator for 36 years and Vice President for 8 years.  I don’t ever
remember a time where the nation has been as divided as it has been in
the last four years.  And God willing, we won’t — we’ll see what happens
the next four.

But, you know, there’s — there’s a deal in Washington where when the
President is — the — the President is leaving office defeated or
otherwise, and a new President is coming in, what happens is there’s a
requirement that the incoming President cannot go into that office
before two o’clock in the afternoon and the outgoing President has to be
out by 10:00 in the morning.

Now, the good news was, my guy never showed up anyway.  But anyway —
(laughter).  But, all kidding aside — and it’s to determine what you
want the office to look like — do you want to keep the same portraits,
do you want to see the same bust, do you want to keep the same rugs, do
you want to keep the same desk, et cetera.

So I asked my best friend, my buddy, Jimmy — my brother, my younger —
younger brother — will he take care of it for me.  He contacted a
historian named Jon Meacham.  Jon Meacham is a presidential historian
and a really serious guy, a good guy.

And Jon — and he came and worked out what my office would look like —
the Oval.  And in the process, I had, every single day, walked into that
office as Vice President for eight years, and before that, because I was
a senior senator and chaired a lot of committees, I was in that office a
lot with other presidents as well.

And there was always a picture of George Washington directly over the
mantelpiece; I walk in and it’s gone.  There was a picture — a big
portrait painting of Franklin Roosevelt.  And then on the right, there
was a smaller portrait of George Washington and, under him, Abraham
Lincoln, and then Madison and Jefferson on the other side.

And I looked at my brother, and I said, “Why Roosevelt?”  And Meacham
spoke up.  He said, “Because no President has ever inherited economic
circumstance more complicated or diverse or dire than he did.”

And then I said, “Why Lincoln?”  True story.  This is a serious
historian.  He said, “Because the nation has never been as divided since
the Civil War.”

Well, think about where we are.  When you have a clear majority of the
American people saying they worry about — Democrat or Republican — they
worry about whether or not we’ll maintain democracy, will democracy —
our democracy be sustained.  Not a joke.

Think of all the state legislative races going on, and the races for
secretary of state and the decisions being made in some of the more
conservative states about how they’re going to count votes and whether
or not the votes are counted federally or locally, and who gets to make
those judgments.  That hadn’t happened before.  Hadn’t happened since
the Civil War.

And 254 or 56 — don’t hold me to the exact number — election deniers
running for office on the Republican ticket for secretaries of state,
for governor, for senator, and for Congress.  It’s never happened
before.  Never in American history.

So — and you — and you turn on the television and you see serious
commentators talking about — I mean, did you ever think you’d be in a
position where the first question that a nominee this year would be
asked, for whatever officer they’re running: “Will you accept the
outcome?”  No, I’m — I’m being deadly earnest.  Think about it.

And the role of governors in America is increasing exponentially, in
terms of how the states function and the roles they play.  And not
withstanding what’s at stake, I’m incredibly optimistic.  I’m more —
never been more optimistic about America’s chances than I am today.  And
the reason being that we’re the only nation in the world that’s come out
of every crisis stronger than we’ve gone into it.  Not a joke.  Stronger
than we’ve gone into that crisis.  Every single one.

That’s going to happen again, but it depends desperately — desperately
on having serious people as your governor, your senators, your state
representatives.  I mean, it matters, down the line.

And the reason I’m here is Tina is a very serious, serious,
consequential person.  And this is a state that the rest of the country
looks to.  You know, you guys out west here think no one looks west,
that everything — all our (inaudible).  But I’m serious. 

Oregon is viewed as a progressive state.  Oregon is viewed as a state
that has always been in the forefront of change — positive change.  And
that’s why this race going to matter so much — not only for 2022, but
for 2024.

And I’m not talking about my race in 20- — no, I’m talking about races
in 2024.

And so, look, think about this: Think about who you elect governor,
whether or not that governor is prepared to say that they want their
state to be pro-choice or — or, you know, not just doing away with the
Court’s position of right to privacy across the board.  Did you all
think you’d be making that decision?  Fifty-one — almost fifty years.

You have an articulate, tough, committed woman who’s going to make sure
there’s a right to privacy.  (Applause.)

And did you all know what it says — it says it’s up to the states now to
make these judgments.  And so, you have a bunch of MAGA Republicans out
there running.

Not all Republicans are — you know, there’s some very, very conservative
Republicans I strongly disagree with but I respect greatly.  Like, for
example, Liz Cheney.  I don’t agree — we don’t agree much of anything on
substance.  But it’s a matter of intellectual principle we debate over. 
But we still both really respect the institutional structure of the
Constitution.

And so, if you take a look at what’s going on here, you have a situation
where, literally, the first time in my career and any of your lives,
where the only thing that really puts us in je- — fundamental jeopardy,
for real, is global warming.

If we don’t maintain below 1.5 percent — 1.5 percent — degrees
centigrade, if we don’t make sure that that doesn’t get exceeded, then
we got a real problem.  We got a real problem.  It’s affecting
everything.  It’s affecting international policy.

You got — you have the President of the Uni- — of — of Russia, Putin —
who I know fairly well.  He has eight time zones and his tundra is
melting.  It’s not going to refreeze.  And it’s emitting methane that’s
four times — four times as damaging to the environment as CO2 is.

You know, the changes taking place — I mean, I just — I’m not sure — I’m
not going to make that assertion that I know about what’s happened, but
you have more days above 80 degrees out here this time of year than any
time.  It may just be coincidental.  (Laughter.)

There’s a lot going on.  And so, you have a gubernatorial candidate who
knows what she knows and knows what she has to do, and she’ll support
national efforts.

One of the things we did and the thing that Ron Wyden was helpful and
most responsible for getting done for me was the legislation we passed
relating to taking care of the cost of prescription drugs and
healthcare, as well as the $368 billion for climate change.  (Applause.)

But the thing I like about your governor is she’s — she’s very
practical.  She knows what needs to be done.  For example, I am — I
think that we should be funding police more, not less, because they need
not just more cops better trained, they need more social workers.  They
need more psychiatrists and psychologists on the staff.  (Applause.)

No, but I’m — I’m deadly earnest.  I’ve been supportive of law
enforcement my whole career, and I come out of the Civil Rights
Movement.

I passed leg- — I’ve made executive orders relating to what fed- — what
federal police can and cannot do: no chokeholds, no no-knock warrants,
et cetera, et cetera.

There’s a lot we can clean up.  But the idea that we’re in a situation
where you have, on the one hand — you know, these guys on the right —
and I’m not commenting on her opponent; I don’t know enough to know.

But here’s the deal: We’re in a situation where they think they are —
support police and support democracy.  How can you support police and
democracy when you deny the outcome of an election and when you call
“patriots” the people who broke down and broke through the United States
Capitol, thousands of them?  Three cops end up dying, many people
injured.

Some of you travel around the world.  You know what the rest of the
world is wondering: What in God’s name has happened in the United
States?

First G7 meeting I attended as President — that’s the largest econo- —
economic democracies in the world — I sat down in February, after I was
elected, in England.  And I said, “America is back.”  And the response
was — almost simultaneously — not a joke — “For how long?  For how
long?”

And I think it was Macron who said to me — from France — “Imagine what
you’d think, Mr. President, if you went to bed tonight and woke up and
found out that there was a group of people who, disagreeing with the
outcome of the parliamentary elections in Great Britain, broke in the
parliament, broke down the doors of the parliament, destroyed the
parliament floor and ended up killing several bobbies — police
officers.”

What would you all think?  You’d wonder what was going on.  Well, what
the hell do you think the rest of the world thinks about what we’re
doing?

And so, as long as Trump controls the Republican Party, he’s going to
have an incredible impact on state legislative bodies, as well as state
governors as well.

So there’s so much we can do and have to do, but it takes somebody ready
to stand up and lead.

And I always get asked, you know — you know, what advice do I have for
pe- — because I got elected at a time when Nixon won in my state with 67
percent of the vote, I think it was, and I won by 3,300 votes, 3,100
votes as a 29-year-old kid.

And they said, “Was — is — there must be some secret sauce you had to
know.”  So I always get asked by new people who want to run: What’s the
secret?  What do I have to know?

The one thing you have to know is what Tina knows.  You have to know
what’s worth losing over.  You have to le- — know what’s worth — worth
losing over, and basic fundamental rights.  (Applause.)  
   
And so, let’s think about what’s at stake in this election: the right to
choose, the right to privacy, the right to vote, Social Security,
Medicare, climate, our very democracy.  
   
If Republicans control the Congress, their number-one priority — they’ve
already stated it — is to do away with the — the Inflation Reduction
Act.   
   
The first time we took on Big Pharma — we’ve been trying to do it, I’ve
been trying to do it, others have been trying to do it for 35 years.   
   
We took them on, and we beat them.   
   
You know, we pay the highest price for drugs of any nation in the world
— any nation in the world.  And we pay it because no one is afr- —
everyone is afraid to take on pharma.  They spend hundreds of thousands
and millions of dollars lobbying against people being able to have a
rational position.    
   
Well, we now have a situation where we have dealt with that so that
we’ve — we’re going to cap the cost of prescription drugs for anybody on
Medicare at $2,000 a year no matter if they have to spend $30,000 — at
$2,000 a year.  (Applause.)   
   
And we’re in a situation where we capped the cost of insulin.  It cost
10 bucks to make and package.  It’s being charged $450 to $700 a — for a
month for someone needing insulin.  Well, that’s going to be capped at
$35.  Period.  (Applause.)  
   
And because of Ron, guess what?  The 55, 54 Americans — Fortune 500
companies who made $40 billion and didn’t pay a penny in taxes now are
going to have to pay taxes.  (Applause.)  
   
Look, there’s so much we can do.  And, by the way, when you hear
Republicans talking about “big-spending Democrats,” they raised the
deficit by $2 trillion over the four years that he was in office — the
last guy.   
   
My first year in office, I was able to reduce the deficit by $350
billion with all we’re doing.  (Applause.)  And this year, you know how
much we reduced it?  By $1 trillion — the debt.  (Applause.)     
   
So, folks, I think there’s so much — you know, so much we’re able to do
if we have really competent, straightforward, honest people who are not
afraid to say what’s on their mind, not to take — not afraid to take on
special interests.  
   
And that’s Tina.  She’s got a heart of a lion.  She’s got a brain bigger
than yours and mine.  (Applause.)  
   
But, you know, when you have positions that — and, by the way, the
Republicans have made it clear that they’re going to pass a national ban
if they win — a national ban on abortion.  No exceptions for rape,
incest, life of the mother.   
   
So there’s a lot going on.  And I could go into specific detail — I got
a whole five pages of it here — about what Tina is for and what she’s
not for.  But the truth of the matter is, she’s rational, she’s smart,
she knows what needs to be done.   
   
She knows we need more police officers on the street.  I provided for
billions of dollars for additional cops.  But she also knows that those
cops need different training, and they need more help.   
   
You know, more cops get killed rep- — responding to domestic violence
cases than anything else?  What you need is psy- — you need
psychologists and social workers working with the police — not for them,
but — for them, not — not on them, working on the people they’re working
on.  
   
So, folks, I — I just think that, you know, the Infrastructure Law, you
know, it’s — it took a long time to get that sucker passed.  And if you
remember — (laughter and applause).  
   
You’ll remember, they told me none of the things that I had proposed
when I ran would — could pass.  None of them.  Well, they all passed,
but it took time.  (Applause.)  It — it took time.   
   
But who knows better what to do with that?  You’re going to get several
billions of dollars here in the state of Oregon all ready for your
airport, and for your roads, for highways, for Internet, for clean
water, for getting rid of lead in pipes, and it will get done.  It’ll
get done.  And guess what?  A whole hell of a lot of carpenters will go
to work.  (Applause.)  
   
You know, what I should probably do is I should — I’m not supposed to
do, but I should probably do — is take a few questions.   
   
But here’s what I want — maybe the best way to do it is conclude with
this.  You know, I’ve never been more optimistic about the chances for
America than I have been — than I am now, for two reasons.   
   
One, I think that — look at the younger generation, between 18 and 30
years old.  They’re the best educated.  They’re the least prejudiced. 
They’re the most open.  They volunteer more than any generation,
including the vaulted Baby Boomers.  They’re there.  They’re ready. 
They’re ready to go.  But they need people to look to, to the step up
for them, to show the way a little bit.   
   
And the second reason is, the rest of the world is figuring out who we
are.  For example, when we — when I — when we wrote and passed the CHIPS
and Science Act, one of the reasons why inflation is so high is because
of the lack of computer chips.  About a third of all inflation last year
is because of automobiles.  They couldn’t be built because they didn’t
have these computer chips.  Everything requires them, from your
cellphone to everything — it requires these computer chips.   
   
We invented them in the United States.  We, the United States — we
modernized.  We did the — all the major research, and we lost the
market.  
   
And along came a pandemic, and the chain — the supply chain dried up. 
And everything dried up in America, in terms of what we could do, in
terms of being able to build.   
   
And so, we’re now in a situation where, because we passed — we used to
invest — in the United States, we used to invest 2 percent of our gross
domestic product — we use in- — for — in research and development. 
That’s down to 0.7 percent.   
   
The rest of the world has moved ahead us, but we’re coming back. 
Because I — and there’s a little provision in the law that Tina supports
— a provision written in the law that no one paid much attention in the
late ‘30s.  It wasn’t that unions could form, it’s “they should be
encouraged to form.”  Number one.  (Applause.)  
   
Number two, that there is a provision of law that’s consistent with the
trade practices, and it’s called “Buy American.”  So because I’m
President, I get to spend about $700 billion of your money, and I sign
contracts every year.  Well, I made a decision: I will not give any
contract to any company that is not an American company.  (Applause.)  
   
And guess what happened?  Now you have — you have about $300 billion
being invested by chip companies, including South Korean companies,
including — I’m serious, in the United States.  Tens of thousands of
jobs.  Tens of thousands of jobs.   
   
We’re in a situation where, for example, Intel decided spend $20 billion
in Ohio, outside of Columbus.  What I refer to “a field of dreams in an
empty field.”  It’s going to create 12,000 jobs.  Seven thousand of
those are building the facilities.  And, by the way, all union wages. 
(Applause.)  
   
The other thing is, of those folks who are working in these factories,
the average salary is going to be $123,000.  And guess what?  Over 70
percent of those jobs don’t require a college degree.  
   
So we’re changing things.  The same thing — I was just about
Poughkeepsie, New York.  You have IBM investing $20 billion in
supercomputers because of this.  They’re going to hire thousands of
people over time.  
   
Then up in Syracuse, New York, there’s going to be an investment of over
$100 billion over 10 years.   
   
My point is, there’s nothing we can’t do, but it’s going to take — it’s
going to take more than the United States Congress supporting something
a President suggested.  It’s got to be implemented by governors.   
   
And, by the way, you got a little port here in Portland.  I predict to
you it’s going to be a multi-billion-dollar effort for you all here. 
And I predict to you it’s going to happen.  It’s going to mean lots of
jobs.  We just need someone who knows what they’re doing to get it
done.  (Applause.)  
   
Folks, I’ve talked enough.  And I just want you to know that our
Republican colleagues, they have a fundamentally different view of what
they should do for this country.  They have a fundamentally different
view on what constitutes fair taxes, a fundamentally different view on
what education should look like in America, a fundamentally different
view on who should be paid what and whether or not the union movement is
an asset or a liability, a fundamentally different view on American
education and what we should be spending money on.   
   
And so, you’re a progressive state.  You’re a state that’s always been
ahead of the curve.  Stay ahead of the curve, and elect Tina. 
(Applause.)
