*Lumen Field  
Seattle, Washington*

10:27 A.M. PDT  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  Good morning, everyone.   Good
morning.  And to all the young leaders who are here and the young-ish
leaders — (laughter) — good morning to all of you.  Have a seat.  
  
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Good morning!  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good morning, my dear.  Good morning.  Good
morning.  
  
I’m here because of you, by the way.  I’m here because of all of our
young leaders who are here.  It is you who has motivated the work that
we are doing that is demonstrated by these beautiful yellow school
buses.  And so I’m — I’m just so happy to be with all of you.  
  
And to the governor, the senator, our Administrator Reagan — to all of
you, thank you for your leadership.  Mayor, thank you for the warm
welcome.  
  
So here’s the thing: Who doesn’t love a yellow school bus, right?  Can
you raise your hand if you love a yellow school bus, right? 
(Applause.)  Just — there’s something about the — and — and most of us,
many of us went to school on the yellow school bus, right?  And it’s
part of — it’s part of our — our experience growing up.  
  
It’s part of, you know, a nostalgia and a memory of — of the excitement
and joy of going to school to be with your favorite teacher, to be with
your best friends, and to learn.   
  
The school bus takes us there.  And in America today, 25 million
children a day go to school on the yellow school bus — 25 million
children a day.  
  
And today, 95 percent of our school buses are fueled with diesel fuel,
which contributes to very serious conditions that are about health and
about the ability to learn.  
  
So, when I think about what the experience should be for our children of
going to school on the school bus, I think about the fact that it should
be about maximizing that experience for them, understanding that this
bus symbolizes so much about our collective investment in our future. 
Because, of course, it is about our investment in our children, in their
health, and in their education.  
  
And in that way, our electric school bus program really does represent
an intersection of all those points, on top of the importance of
investing in domestic manufacturing.  
  
We all know when, during the height of the pandemic, we saw what it
means when we don’t have domestic manufacturing around the things that
we need every day: It slows us down.   
   
We know that domestic manufacturing means that we can create jobs right
here in the United States.  And that by creating these jobs, because we
are creating a new industry, we must also then think about what the jobs
require, which is highly skilled labor, and what, then, that means in
terms of investing in apprenticeship programs, investing in training
programs to build the skills in America’s workforce to do the work of
growing this new industry, which is totally directed at benefiting our
children.   
  
Those are the intersections.  So that’s why I’m so excited about these
electric school buses.   
   
And when I think about what we have been able to do through the
Infrastructure Law, what it means is that we have now invested — and
that’s the announcement today — $5 billion over the next five years —
what we are doing today is the first of those billion dollars, $1
billion — through grant proposals from the 50 states — distributing to
the 50 states an investment for their ability, starting the next school
year — next school year — to roll these buses out to pick up our kids
and take them to school.  That’s our announcement today.  (Applause.)  
   
And these investments are going to go everywhere that our school buses
go.  It’s going to be in urban communities.  It’s going to be in rural
communities, Tribal communities.  It will be in all 50 states.  And what
it will also be is about understanding that when we think about our
children right now, they have so much capacity.   
   
But when we think about — how many of us, for example, have had to go to
the emergency room because our child has asthma?  Right?  How many of us
have had to deal with the fact that when our children are exposed to
pollutants, what that means in terms of their respiratory status, not to
mention illness?   
   
These are some of the issues that we are going to address, which is not
only about our children but about our parents and what you must do to
take care of your children on a daily basis.   
   
We are thinking about this in terms of yellow school buses being the
largest form of mass transit in our country.  Think about that.  And we
are thinking about it in terms of creating healthy learning environments
for our children.  
   
So, all of that is at play with what we are doing today.  And I met with
some of our young leaders this morning on our way here.  And — and one
of them said to me — I said, “Well, what is today about?”  And they
said, “Saving our planet.  Saving our planet.”   
   
So, the youngest of our children understand not only their power, but
the importance to them of saving our planet.  And I guess that’s what
brings it home in terms of the concluding point: We owe it to our
children to, right now, take these issues very seriously.  The clock is
ticking loudly.   
   
We are witnessing, around our country and around the world, the effects
of extreme climate.  There is a direct correlation that, thankfully, as
we progress as a nation, is not being debated, which is the correlation
between all of that and human behaviors.   
   
And so, what we are announcing today and what we are, as a community of
friends and parents and leaders — what we’re announcing today is a step
forward in our nation’s commitment to be a leader on these issues to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to invest in our economy, to invest in
job creation, to invest in building the skills of America’s workforce —
all with, as that young leader this morning said to me, a goal of not
only saving our children, but, for them, saving our planet.   
   
I thank you all very much.  (Applause.)
