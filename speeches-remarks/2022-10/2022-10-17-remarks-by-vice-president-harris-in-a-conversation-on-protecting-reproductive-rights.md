REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  How was that?  How was that for a welcome home?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  It is good to be home.  It’s good to be home.   
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  Well, we love having you in L.A.  Absolutely.  So,
why don’t we get right to it?  This is an important moment in the time
of our fight for rights.  So, tell us what it is like for you to be
championing this issue?  How has it been?  I read off all of the
meetings, all of the state legislatures.  You’re going around the
country.  What’s it feel like?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  It’s a combination of feelings that I think we all
have about this.  And when I’m traveling the country, one of the
feelings that I hear most is fear.  It’s fear.  
   
But I’ll tell you, you know, here’s how I think about it: You know,
people have asked me, “Well, what has caused you to focus a large part
of your work on…” — as you said — “…the health, safety, and well-being
of women and children?”   
   
And, as you know, I was raised by a mother who had two goals in her
life: to raise her two children — my sister, Maya, and me — and to end
breast cancer.  She was a breast cancer researcher, a scientist.   
   
And so, from my earliest days of life, I remember my mother being so
passionate about women’s health and access to health, and it was always
grounded, so much of her work, in the importance of women having dignity
in the healthcare system — in the healthcare delivery system and — and
having rights and having power over the decisions that were being made
so that it would be theirs to make, whatever it was.   
   
And that’s how I was raised.  I mean, you know, I was raised hearing the
phrase “mammary gland” all the time.  It was — it was just a common word
in our household.   
   
And so, when I think about this issue and this fight right now, it’s an
extension of that.  And so, to your point, I have been traveling the
country in so-called red states and so-called blue states, talking with
leaders on the ground — in particular a lot of state-elected leaders,
legislators — about what we can do collectively to build up support for
what we need to do, which is to empower women and restore their rights
on this issue.  
   
But it’s — really, it’s — it was unthinkable, I think, for so many of
us.  We knew it might happen, but let — I mean, let’s just pause for a
moment.  The highest court in our land, the United States Supreme Court,
just took a constitutional right that had been recognized from the
people of America, from the women of America.  
   
And if I may, I would like to put it in context to how I feel about this
in the context of being Vice President.  So, as Vice President, in the
last a year and a half, I have, as of now — my staff has counted — I
have now met directly or by phone with 100 world leaders, presidents,
prime ministers, chancellors, kings.  And here’s what I think we all
know about what those experiences are like: The United States — we, as
Americans — can walk in those rooms with a certain level of authority
—  
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  That’s right.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  — chin up, shoulders back — to talk in those rooms about
the importance of democracy, the importance of rule of law, the
importance of human rights.  And in that way, we have held ourselves out
to be and have been considered a role model on these matters.   
   
But what we, as role models, all know is that when you are role model,
people watch what you do to see if it matches what you say.   
   
And the point then is a realization that this issue is not only directly
impacting the people of America, but when we think about autocratic
governments around the world who can then look to their people and say,
“Well, you want to hold up America and rights as an example of what we
should do?  Well, look at what they just did.”  So, by extension, what
just happened will invariably impact women around the world.   
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  That’s right.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  So, there’s a lot of fear.  But also, as we all
know, we know how to fight.  
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  Oh, yeah.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Because when you know what you stand for, you know
what to fight for.  (Applause.)   
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  Celinda.  
   
MS. VÁZQUEZ:  We do know how to fight.  So, what steps is the
administration taking to protect reproductive rights?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  So, well — and, first, can I just say, it’s so good
to be with the two of you on this stage?  It’s so good to be home.   
   
MS. VÁZQUEZ:  So good.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Celinda, you have been such an extraordinary
fighter.  You and I’ve been in many of these rooms together in these
past many, many months.  And I cannot thank you enough for being on the
ground and the courage that it takes for our frontline folks, like you,
to do what you are doing.  And to all of those who are here on the
frontline, I applaud you.  Let us applaud them.  (Applause.)   
   
Because around the country and here, it is not without risk that you do
what you do.  
   
To Madam Congresswoman — (laughter).  It’s not a political event, I
know.  (Laughs.)  You — you and I have worked together for so many years
when I was AG and you were at the capitol — at the state capitol, and
then in Washington, D.C.  
   
You are a courageous, fearless fighter on so many of these issues.  And,
in particular, what you have done throughout your career to be a strong
voice for women, for children, for all communities, for the coalition: I
thank you.  And it’s an honor to be on the stage with you as well. 
(Applause.)   
   
And so, what we are doing as an administration is a number of things. 
Through the Health and Human Services agency, led by a Californian,
Secretary Xavier Becerra — (applause) — we are — we’ve been actually
sending out a number of things that are really intended to make sure
that there’s clarity in the midst of the confusion.   
   
And one of the things that HHS did that I think is very significant is
sent out to pharmacies information about their legal requirement to
administer medication as prescribed.  And — and I also applaud that
agency for also having announced that they will investigate where there
are any violations of the rules of conduct on that issue.  
   
The Department of Education has been extraordinary.  Secretary Cardona
has been doing some important work around making sure that that we
protect students and their reproductive rights, including their ability
to take leave from school for whatever reproductive healthcare they
need, and make sure that there’s no discrimination in that regard.  
   
The Department of Justice has been coordinating with a number of
agencies as appropriate but has also set up, for example, a process of
eliciting pro bono hours, because there are going to be so many folks
who are on the ground doing the work who are not sure of the legal risks
that they are taking in these various states.  
   
They’ve also set up a task force, led by Vanita Gupta, who is a great
civil rights lawyer, and they are pursuing whatever litigation is
appropriate.  
   
Also, through the Department of Justice, they’ve set up a hotline for
providers, so there is an ability to report threats and things of that
nature.  
   
The FCC and the FTC are doing — the Federal Trade Commission, and the
Federal Communications Commission — are doing important work to, one,
check with the biggest providers to see what their privacy policies are
and their data retention policies are.  And that’s extremely
important.   
   
I think I have a website here, but I’ll tell you that the — that they’ve
also set up a number for people to issue complaints and to register
complaints around privacy violations, which is a big issue, because, of
course, there are an assortment of mobile apps that folks use to monitor
their menstruation cycle.  There are mobile apps that folks use to just
get directions to go to a facility to get their healthcare, and we want
to make sure that that information is not being violated.   
   
So, that is the kind of work that’s happening through our
administration.  
   
The President has signed two executive orders that relate to making a
very clear statement that we intend to protect and defend the right that
people have for travel and for access to emergency healthcare.   
   
The VA is doing great work, in terms of the number of women who are
veterans, in ensuring that they will be able to have access to all of
the care that they require — including the Department of Defense,
because — think about it, if you’re a servicemember — and there are at
least 300,000 women, I believe, who are in active service right now —
you don’t have any choice where you’re deployed and could very well be
deployed to a state where it’s been rendered illegal.  
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  Right.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And so, they’re working through what they can do to
ensure that the servicemembers are not subject to — to those kinds of
threats to their healthcare and their independence.  
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  Well, you know, Madam Vice President, this is kind
of on the same lines of that.  I’m wondering what kind of stories you
might be hearing from people.  
   
You know, in another life, I worked in healthcare.  I’ve worked in the
emergency room and also in primary care.  Every now and then, you hear a
story in the news like a woman — a woman that has an ectopic pregnancy;
or the 10-year-old girl; or a woman who is — if she carries the
pregnancy to term, might not live.  As you’ve gone around the country,
are you hearing stories like that?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I am hearing those stories.  And those are the
stories that are the public stories.  But as you and I know, what we’re
hearing about only is just a fraction of what’s actually happening. 
Many of you know: As a former prosecutor, the bulk of my career as a
prosecutor, I was focused on violent — crimes of violence against women
and children, and, in particular, I specialized in child sexual assault
cases.   
   
The vast majority of those cases are not reported.  And the idea that
laws would be passed, as it relates to people who have endured and
survived such violation and violence, and to then say to them, “And you
will also not have autonomy over your body on this issue” — it’s
immoral.  It’s immoral.  
   
As a former prosecutor having handled those cases, I can tell you the
vast majority of those cases are not reported for a variety of reasons
that have to do with the nature of it all, including it might be about a
family member, it might be about someone who otherwise could harm that
person or their family.  
   
And what’s happening in these states on that and so many other related
issues is abhorent: punishing women, criminalizing healthcare
providers.  In fact, I’m going to — I don’t know if everybody in the
audience can see this.  
   
(The Vice President holds up a map.)  
   
This is a map of the United States.  So, you don’t need to see — you
don’t need to read the words to see the point that I’m going to make.   
   
So, you see all the different colors.  So, one of the colors on this map
is — represents the states in which abortion is banned from conception
with no exceptions.  One color is abortion banned from conception with
an exception for rape, but not incest.  Another, banned from conception
with exceptions for rape and incest.  There’s a 6-week ban on here, a
15-week ban, an 18-week ban.  You get the point.  
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  Not incest?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Absolute —  
   
MS. VÁZQUEZ:  No.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  But absolute confusion —  
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  Yeah.  That’s (inaudible).  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — which also creates an environment that is ripe
for misinformation, disinformation, and predatory practices.  
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  Yeah.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  So, in addition to what I’m seeing around the
country, there’s fear.  There’s also just absolute and utter confusion
about what are — for any individual: What are my rights?  And that is
something that, we as opinion leaders, of which there are so many here,
we have to continue to use our voice and our platform in a way that
informs people about their rights with an — with a full appreciation
that it’s so confusing they may not be aware.  
   
MS. VÁZQUEZ:  So, you’ve touched upon this, but how else do you see the
fight for reproductive freedom impacting the everyday lives of
Americans?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  (The Vice President reaches for the map.)  
   
MS. VÁZQUEZ:  Right, so —  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  So, okay.  
   
MS. VÁZQUEZ:  — just a little expansion.   
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I love Venn diagrams.  Okay?  (Laughs.)   
   
MS. VÁZQUEZ:  Just a little expansion.   
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I really do.  I love Venn diagrams — you know, the
three circles — sometimes there are more.  
   
So I asked my team,  “Do — do me a Venn diagram on — from which states
are we seeing attacks on reproductive healthcare, voting rights, LGBTQ+
rights.”  You would not be surprised to know that there is a significant
overlap.  Right?   
   
So that’s what — so when we talk about who’s being impacted, well, you
know, if you read the Dobbs decision — or you don’t need to, I’ll just
tell you — Clarence Thomas said the quiet part out loud: They’re coming
for the right to conception, the right to marry the person you love.  
   
But I do see in, then, this moment, another thing in that Venn diagram,
which is the reminder about the importance of coalition building, of
bringing together all those folks who have been fighting forever on
reproductive healthcare and maternal mortality, something that Karen
Bass has been a leader on, bringing together the folks that have been
fighting forever on voting rights, bringing together all the folks who —
who are responsible for the victory on marriage — but we still have so
much more work to do — and building our coalition.  
   
Because here’s the thing: There was a movement that was started
generations ago that culminated in Roe v. Wade.  We are now the ones
that are responsible for picking up that movement.  And as with any
movement in our country that has been about progress and the expansion
of rights, one of the most productive ingredients of those movements has
been the coalition and our commitment to building that coalition and
growing it, for a number of reasons, one is that we all have so much
more in common than what separates us.  But the other is, almost
everyone should understand what rights of theirs are subject to and now
exposed to attack.  
   
And on this point — my final point on this would be, we need to take
back the flag on this.  Because this is absolutely about freedom and
liberty.   
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  Yes.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  This is about freedom and liberty, which are
foundational notions for the existence of our country.  These are
founding principles that we, as Americans, hold dear: freedom and
liberty.  And that means all of us are susceptible.  
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  And for freedom and liberty, we need to hold on to
the House and the Senate, I’m just saying.  (Applause.)   
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  So, it’s not a political event, but that doesn’t
mean we don’t speak truth.  (Laughter.)   
   
So, in fact, so, 22 days, there’s an election.  
   
REPSENTATIVE BASS:  Yes.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  That’s a — that’s a fact.  It is a fact that there
is a bill in Congress that the congressmember was a part of leading —
the Women’s Health Protection Act — which would codify, which means put
into law, the protections of Roe v. Wade.  
   
The Court took it away; Congress can put it back.  
   
The President of the United States — our President, Joe Biden, has said
he will not let this thing called the “filibuster” get in the way of
signing that law.  All of those are facts.  
   
It is also the fact that, in order for that bill to get to the
President’s desk so he can sign it into law, we need two more senators. 
We need to hold on to what we have, and we need two more senators.  That
is a fact.  
   
It is also fact, by the way, that in that same context, the President
has said he will sign into law the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement
Act.  (Applause.)   
   
Two more senators.  
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  I could think of two.  (Laughter.)  
   
You know, along with this, in terms of, you know, understanding that the
Dobbs decision was about the right to privacy and, Madam Vice President,
you know, I’m not a lawyer, but I do wonder, like: How far could they
go?  
   
I mean, you know, Jim Crow laws?  I mean, could business say, “Well,
it’s my right to only allow certain people to come in”?  How far — what
are the implications?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I mean, I think you should — that everything that
you can imagine, you should assume is possible.  
   
It was unimaginable that the court of Thurgood Marshall would do what
this court just did.  
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  Right.  Right.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And — and that’s, again, why I think that the point
that you made about, you know, who is vulnerable to this moment:
Everyone is vulnerable to this moment.  
   
And we just — we have to understand that, I think, in so many ways, we
are living in unsettled times.   
   
You think about it on the global stage, there is a war in Europe.  You
know, for 70 years, there was an assumption that, in spite of the
differences among nations, that there was still certain international
rules and norms, including the importance of sovereignty and territorial
integrity.  But with Russia’s unprovoked aggression in Ukraine, we see
that we can’t necessarily take that for granted.   
   
Unsettled times.  Unsettled times.  
   
The Voting Rights Act, guided by the United States Supreme Court in
Shelby v. Holder, a decision they rendered in 2013, and then you look at
what happened in 2020, which is historic numbers of people voted in the
midst of a pandemic, including an historic number of young voters, and
almost immediately thereafter — because that scared people —  
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  Right.  (Laughter.)  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — there are children here — they started passing
laws making it illegal to give people food and water if they’ve been
standing in line for hours to vote; passing laws making it intentionally
more difficult for people to vote.  Unsettled times.  
   
We thought the issue of voting rights had been settled.   
   
Unsettled times.  In this year of our Lord 2022, taking away a woman’s
ability to make decisions about her own body.  
   
So, I think we have to listen to the words of Coretta Scott King. 
You’ve heard me paraphrase her so many times on this.  She famously
said: The fight for civil rights — which is the fight for justice, it’s
the fight for equality, fight for freedom — the fight for civil rights
must be fought and won with each generation.  
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  Yes.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Because let’s always remember that these rights
will not be permanent if we are not prepared to be vigilant.  
   
And in that way, this is so much about a democracy.  I think about
democracy in this regard.  I think — I think of democracy as there’s a
duality to it, in that, when it is intact, it is strong in terms of what
it does to create a system that preserves and fights for rights, civil
rights, human rights.  So, there’s an aspect to it that is about
strength in terms of what it can do to lift people up.  
   
On the other hand, it’s very fragile.  It’s extremely fragile.  It will
only be as strong as our willingness to fight for it.  And so, fight we
will.  
   
MS. VÁZQUEZ:  You have touched upon many of these topics, but how are
you seeing the intersection of attacks on — well, no, I think we already
— we already did that.  
   
But we have an expert here — our congresswoman worked on the floor — a
maternal morbidity expert, and all of the things.  What — what is the
administration doing to address the maternal mortality crisis, which, we
know, we you’ve done a lot of work previously?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Celinda.  Maternal mortality — and,
again, I recognize and thank Karen Bass for her work as a leader on this
for so many years.  
   
In America today, Black women are three times more likely to die in
connection with childbirth.  Native women, twice as likely.  Rural
women, one and a half times likely.  And as it relates to, for example,
the experience of Black women, it is unrelated to their educational
level or their socioeconomic level.  It is very clear it literally has
to do with the fact that when she walks into that clinic or that
doctor’s office or that emergency room, she is not taken as seriously.  
   
And so, there is a lot of work that needs to happen that also
understands and appreciates that, for so many of these women — for
example, women in rural America — are living in the midst of healthcare
deserts.  There’s no hospitals.  I — I have somebody that’s very close
to me whose relative just died, just weeks ago, in connecti- — during
childbirth, and the baby died, in rural America.  Because there was
nowhere, where she lived, to get her the kind of care that the
complication required.  Right?  
   
So, this is a big issue.  But the idea that in this country, at this
time, it is still such an issue of the proportion.  
   
And so, there are a number of things.  One, when I was in the Senate, we
had a bill that would address the bias in the healthcare delivery system
and require training of healthcare providers — of all types of
healthcare providers.  And I wrote into it, in particular, that the
trainers would include doulas, who — (applause) — yes — who provide some
of the best care and could teach a few things to others.  
   
We are doing the work as an administration of — you know, I’m very proud
of this — we have lifted this issue up to the stage of the White House,
actually convened a group of leaders to come to the White House to
present on this issue.   
   
We have done the work of also extending in states Medicaid coverage and
encouraging, in extension — can you believe?  Okay, so Medicaid —
(applause) — Medicaid covers, but we’re changing this — only two months
of postpartum care.  Two months.  
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  You better not have a problem.   
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  You just gave birth to a human being.  
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  Right?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  So, there is — so we’re extending it to 12 months —
right? —  
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  Excellent.  That’s great.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — for all that that requires and it requires, you
know, the details of pelvic examinations.  It requires the details of
whatever kind of healthcare that might be, you know, in any level of the
body.  Healthcare — for mental healthcare, physical.  
   
And so, this is some of the work we are doing, and — and it’s a good
start.  There’s more work to be done, also recognizing that the
disparities exist based on also lack of access to transportation, lack
of access to all types of healthcare, in addition to maternal
healthcare.  Because there is so much of this that also can be
attributed to unique stressors, right?  
   
Take, for example, the fact that poverty is trauma inducing.  And what
that might mean, in terms of the unique stressors that low-income women
are facing that can have an impact on their pregnancy.   
   
And so, all of this work is being done by our administration in
conjunction with the Congress.  We have the “Momnibus” — we called it
the “Momnibus.”  An omnibus bill.  
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  Yes.  Yes, that’s great.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And we —  
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  That was a great effort.  Members of the
Congressional Black Caucus that led that effort.    
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Exactly.   
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  You know, when you were talking about maternal
mortality, especially amongst Black women, when Beyoncé and Serena
Williams get into trouble —  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Right?  
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  — when they’re in the delivery room, we know this
is a huge problem.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  That’s exactly right.  
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  The idea that you have high rates of maternal
death in the United States of America is an outrage in and of itself.   
   
How about a few words on contraception, in terms of what the
administration has done?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, we have done some good work in terms of
making clear that there is a right to contraception.  
   
But, you know, I mean, to your point about what’s at risk, they pulled
it back, but you saw what happened with the University Idaho — right? —
which was — which was the issue was that the university — they pulled it
back, so it’s no longer the case — but had essentially said that they
would not provide contraception at the university.   
   
And you mentioned earlier that the convenings that I’ve been doing, one
of them was with university presidents.  And I brought them in because,
of course, they’re — the 18- through 24-year-old population is most at
risk on this issue.  
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  Right.  That’s right.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And I brought them in and asked them, “Well, what’s
your plan?”   
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  (Laughs.)  And they said?   
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And it was a good and productive meeting.  
   
MS. VÁZQUEZ:  What did they say?  
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  (Inaudible.)  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  It was a (inaudible) meeting.  
   
But, you know, for example, “What’s the plan?”  And I’ve just recently
convened a bunch of extraordinary college student leaders, just in the
White House, in my office, last week.  Just brilliant.  They’re
brilliant.  They’re so good.  Like, the future of our country is so
bright if they’re leading.  And — and — (applause) — yes.  
   
And so, they — but we were talking about — for example, universities,
colleges, community colleges, any, you know, educational institutions
for educating after high school — what are they doing about privacy
protocols as it relates to their health clinics?   
   
What are they doing as it relates to absenteeism, because they may be in
a state where she has to go to another state to receive her abortion
care?   
   
What are they doing in terms of — many universities, for example, will
have — this might not be the right word — but bereavement funds, right? 
So if a student has a death in the family and they can’t afford the
transportation, that there’ll be assistance with that.   
   
Well — well, maybe we should be considering the fact that there are
going to be students who can’t afford to leave the state and pay tuition
and pay for books and pay for dorms, right?  And how are they thinking
about that approach?  
   
And so those issues have come up.  In connection also has been the issue
of contraception and what are they doing to ensure that they are
complying with the law but, at the same time, doing everything they can
to fulfill a right that their students have.  
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  Well, Madam Vice President, I know you have so
many places to go.  We would love to keep you here all day.  So we want
you to come back again soon.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Of course.  
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  But maybe you can share some final thoughts. 
Final thoughts about today, where you’re going, where you been.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, a few things.  You know, one of the — you
know, the additional facts — if we don’t have the issue in California,
we have an — we have extraordinary members of Congress.  Mayor Garcetti
is here.  Rob Bonta, the Attorney General.  Alex Padilla, the senator. 
Toni Atkins, who convened a bunch of state legislators for a previous
meeting that I did in San Francisco.  
   
But elections matter on this one, as with everything else.  When I’m
traveling the country, I remind folks: Elections matter in terms of who
your local prosecutor is.  If you’re in a state that has criminalized
this, that matters.   
   
Who your governor is matters.  Governor Newsom has done an extraordinary
job on this.  Because it’s going to be about whether, depending on the
composition of their legislature, do they need to veto stuff that would
be bad and restricting rights, or are they going to sign legislation
that is about preserving and expanding rights where they’ve been taken
away in particular.  
   
And so, 22 days.  And the reality of it is that we’re going to have to
protect these rights ultimately by having national legislation.   
   
And there’s only one path to getting there.  There’s only so much that
the executive branch can do on this.  We have three coequal branches of
government.  The Court has acted, and now we need Congress to act.  And
so we need people in Congress to recognize that responsibility.  
   
So I’d urge everyone to just remember that and to talk with your friends
and your neighbors, in particular in states where these rights are being
attacked, and to remind them.  
   
And then my last point would be just to repeat: I think the
coalition-building piece on this is so extraordinarily important.  You
know, this is an intergenerational movement.  This is a movement among
so many people who are allies, who are — who are in this together for so
many reasons.  
   
So let’s just stay committed to it all and know that this moment was
meant for those of us who are here to recognize we cannot afford to
throw up our hands on this; we got to roll up our sleeves.  
   
Thank you all.  (Applause.)  
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  Roll up our sleeves!  Thank you.  Thank you so
much.  It’s an honor to have you here.  Thank you.  
   
MS. VÁZQUEZ:  Gracias, Madam Vice President.
