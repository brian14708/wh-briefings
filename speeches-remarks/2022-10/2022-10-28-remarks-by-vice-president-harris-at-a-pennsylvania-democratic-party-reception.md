*Pennsylvania Convention Center  
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania*

(October 28, 2022)

7:36 P.M. EDT  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Hello, Pennsylvania!  (Applause.)  Good evening. 
Good evening.  Good evening.  It is so good to be here with all of these
extraordinary leaders.  
  
I just said to Jaime — he was just on fire tonight, wasn’t he? 
(Laughs.)  I want to thank Jaime Harrison, the Chairman of the DNC, for
all the work.  He’s been traveling all over the country and doing an
extraordinary job.  So, Jaime, thank you for that warm and wonderful
introduction and all that you do.  (Applause.)  
  
And thank you to the Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairman, Sharif
Street.  Thank you for your leadership — (applause) — wherever he is.  
  
So, Philadelphia, it is good to be back.  It is good to be back with you
— and, in particular, with your courageous Governor, Tom Wolf. 
(Applause.)  Your next governor, Josh Shapiro.  (Applause.)  Your great
senator and my friend, Bob Casey.  (Applause.)  And your soon-to-be
senator, John Fetterman.  (Applause.) [](http://)  
   
And, of course, it is wonderful for all of us to be with one of
Pennsylvania’s proudest sons, our President, Joe Biden.  (Applause.)  
  
So everyone here knows Joe and that Joe Biden has always stood for what
we stand for as Democrats: working people, good jobs at fair wages,
decency, democracy.  And I do believe that when you know what you stand
for, you know what to fight for.  And we’ve got 11 days to get it done. 
(Applause.)  Eleven days, Pennsylvania.  Eleven days until this
November’s election.   
   
And all of those issues that I just mentioned that we stand for are on
the ballot.  So we’re here to say that we are committed to making each
and every day count.   
   
And we’ve done this before.  We know how to do what we do.  We’ve done
it before.  
  
Remember in November 2020?  Patriotic Pennsylvanians of all ages, all
races, all backgrounds braved a global pandemic, stood in line, cast
ballots in record numbers, and then you ensured every single vote was
counted.  Thank you, Josh Shapiro.  (Applause.)  (Laughs.)  
  
You stood firm against election deniers, outside this very building. 
(Applause.)  We watched.  We saw what you were doing.   
  
And because of millions of Americans like you, in 2020, Joe Biden and I
won the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania — (applause) — and we won the White
House.  
  
And over these last 22 months, Democrats, led by President Biden, have
delivered.  In fact, over these last 22 months, Democrats have delivered
big time.  (Applause.)  
  
We know what we stand for.  We know what we stand for.  And so we knew
what to fight for.  
  
But, Pennsylvania, our work is far from finished.  Just think: The
United States Supreme Court — the highest court in our land, the former
court of Thurgood Marshall — just took a constitutional right, that had
been recognized, from the people of America, from the women of
America.  
  
And now, extremist so-called leaders, including some right here in
Pennsylvania, are calling for an abortion ban nationwide.  
  
AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Apparently — because I was watching TV the other
night — apparently, this fellow running against John Fetterman even
believes that local politicians belong in an examination room —  
  
AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — while a woman is in that room with her doctor.  
   
So, these folks are something else.  (Laughter.)  These folks apparently
believe that government should be making decisions about women’s
bodies.  Well, we do not.  (Applause.)  We trust the women of
Pennsylvania.  We trust the women of America.   
   
And recall — because there’s just hypocrisy upon irony on this — recall:
When Dobbs was decided, the proponents said, “Well, you know, we — we
should just send this issue to the states.”  Now, understand it’s these
same folks saying that that are the ones making it more difficult to
vote in the states, including right here in Philadelphia.  Undemocratic
laws.  Un-American laws.   
   
So, Pennsylvania, the stakes are high.  Up and down the ballot, here in
the Commonwealth, as so-called leaders are undermining rights, pay
attention to the state house races, pay attention to the state senate
races.  (Applause.)  Elect Josh Shapiro governor.  Hold on to the U.S.
House of Representatives.  And expand our majority in the United States
Senate by electing John Fetterman.  (Applause.)  
   
The stakes are high.  
   
And to illustrate, I’d offer us to consider just for a moment two very
real scenarios as alternatives.  First, imagine — it’s difficult and
hard to imagine — but imagine if we lost the governor’s office in
Harrisburg and our majorities.  But what’s at stake?  Imagine if we lost
that and our majorities in the House and the Senate.  That would mean
that big lies and extremism would rule the day.  That’s what will
happen.  
   
And we know what would then follow.  Because you see, Justice Clarence
Thomas said the quiet part out loud.  Contraception is on the line. 
Marriage equality is on the line.  With Republican Party leaders in
charge, healthcare is on the line.  Social Security would be on the
line.  Medicare would be on the line.  Good jobs and fair wages for
working families on the line.  
   
But we can also imagine a better scenario because that’s what we’re
working toward.  Imagine we hold the governor’s office, we hold the
United States Senate, and we elect two more — two more Democratic
senators, including John Fetterman.  (Applause.)  We can then protect
and build on our progress.  When we do that, we can fight for paid
family leave and affordable childcare.  We can fight to renew the
assault weapons ban.  (Applause.)  We can fight for working people of
America.  
   
In that scenario, the President has been clear — our President has been
clear the filibuster will not stand in the way of protecting two very
fundamental freedoms.  And here’s my perspective on it.  Jaime told you
about it.  So, as Vice President, I’m also the President of the United
States Senate.  And I will tell you, as a point of pride, I have already
broken John Adams’s record of tiebreaking votes in the Senate in my
first year.  (Laughs.)  (Applause.)  
   
And I cannot wait to cast the tiebreaking vote to pass the Women’s
Health Protection Act — (applause) — and the John Lewis Voting Rights
Advancement Act!  (Applause.)  I cannot wait.   
   
Just two more seats.  Two more seats.  One of them right here. 
(Applause.)  Two more seats.  
   
So, Pennsylvania Democrats, we know what we stand for, and so we know
what to fight for.  In the place — this beautiful place that first
defined the meaning of freedom and liberty, we have 11 days to fight
like we have never fought before.   
   
And the thing I know about everybody in this room: When we fight, we
win.  (Applause.)  
   
Thank you.  May God bless you, and may God bless America. Thank you. 
(Applause.)  Thank you all.
