*Cahill Recreation Center  
Baltimore, Maryland*

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, hello, Baltimore!  (Applause.)  It’s good to
be back.  (Applause.)  Well, hello, Baltimore.  Hello, Maryland.  It is
good to see all of you.  (Applause.)  All right.    
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  We love you!  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I love you.  I love you for everything you have
done for Chris Van Hollen.  I love everything you have done for Wes
Moore.  I love what you’re going do over the next 10 days and what we
are going to do to restore a sense of honor, a sense of purpose to these
offices, knowing that we have exceptional people who are prepared to
lead in a way that is reflective of the needs and the desires and the
will of the people.  I am so happy to see all of you.  (Applause.)  I am
so happy to see you.   
   
So, let me — let me tell you a bit about Chris Van Hollen.  So, he and I
are classmates.  Did you all know that?  And I’ll tell you why.  We’re
classmates because we entered the United States Senate on the same day. 
(Applause.)  
   
And I have served with Chris and I have seen him in these rooms when the
cameras are on and when the cameras are off.  And he is always fighting
for the people in Maryland, always fighting for the people of Maryland. 
(Applause.)  
   
You know, in the United States Senate, we have these caucus meetings. 
And when I was there, we were in the minority, so it was in the LBJ
room.  And they’re all these big, round tables.  And it’s only the
senators who are in the room.    
   
And every single time — you know, and people eating their lunch during —
during the meeting — whenever Chris Van Hollen would stand to speak,
people would put their forks and knives down and listen.    
   
And Chris would talk about working people.  Chris would talk about the
need to remember the priorities that we have as Democrats.  Chris would
talk about the work that he has done to say that we need to make sure
everyone pays their fair share and that we don’t try to put everything
on the backs of working people — shouldn’t corporations be required to
pay their fair share?  And he has been a leader on all of these
issues.    
   
So, I’m here to thank you for sending him to the United States Senate
those years ago and to thank you for returning him to the United States
Senate.  (Applause.)  
   
Then you got Aruna Miller, who is going to be extraordinary as the next
lieutenant governor of the great state of Maryland.  She has been a
proven leader.  She is a partner to Wes Moore.  And the two of them will
be a dynamic duo in the work that they will accomplish in the state
house.  (Applause.)  
   
And then, of course, you’ve got Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, who can
preach as well as any pastor I know — (laughter) — and who has been just
the voice of courage and consistency in the United States Congress. 
There’s Steny.  Over — just when we have been in the majority, when we
have been in the minority, you are such a fighter and really a
conscience for who we are as Democrats and what we stand for.  And it is
so good to be with you today in Baltimore, Steny.  Thank you. 
(Applause.)  
   
And I also want to mention a daughter of Baltimore, Speaker Nancy Pelosi
— (applause) — and her husband, Paul.  And I know we are all sending our
prayers to their family for Paul’s speedy recovery.    
   
I know that folks on the stage today have mentioned it, but, you know,
what’s happening in our country right now — and I’ve been traveling our
country — there’s some scary stuff happening.  We got to speak truth
about that.    
   
You know, there was a time when we appreciated and understood the
importance to a democracy of vigorous debate, where we appreciated that
it is the diversity of opinions that will lead us to progress, to smart
decisions.    
   
But something has been happening in our country where powerful people —
so-called leaders — have been using the bully pulpit that they were
given by the people in a way that is about the preservation of their
personal power and is being used to divide our country.   
   
They’re using the bully pulpit in a way that is promulgating hate.  And
so, this is one of those moments that requires all good people to make
our voices louder, as a true reflection of who we are as a nation, to
say, “We will not stand for that.  We will require that we speak truth. 
We will require that we engage in civil discourse.  We will require that
so-called leaders actually lead, understanding that the true sign of
strength is not based on who you beat down, it’s based on who you lift
up.”  (Applause.)  
   
 Ten days.  
   
AUDIENCE:  Ten days!  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Ten days.  We got a lot of work to do.  And so, I
know who’s here.  And I know this is a room of leaders who, every
election cycle, show up and remind our neighbors and our friends and the
perfect strangers we see — but in their face, we see a neighbor and a
friend — we ask them to vote.   
      
And during an election season and these next 10 days, we will then
continue to ask people to vote.  And what we know is that they will then
ask us a very righteous question: “Why should I vote?”  
   
But here’s the thing, Baltimore: We got some really good material. 
(Applause.)  We got some really good material.   
   
So, when they ask us that question, the first thing we’re going to do is
say, “Well, first, I just want to thank you.  Because in 2020, when you
last voted, you voted during the height of a pandemic where there was
untold loss of life.”  People lost their jobs, a loss of normalcy. 
Parents with school-aged children, trying to figure out how you’re going
to keep your child engaged with their process of education.  And in the
height of a pandemic, we had record turnout of voting — record turnout —
record turnout of young voters.   
      
And the way I see it is: In 2020, people stood in those lines, took time
out of all of the burdens of their everyday life to fill out a ballot,
to drop it off.  And in so doing, they put in their order.  They said,
“This is what I want from my government and my country.”  And they put
in their order.   
   
And so, they stood in those lines, they took that time out, and they
said, “We want you to deal finally with the issue of child poverty in
America.”   
   
And because they stood in those lines, we extended the child tax credit,
which, in its first year, reduced child poverty in America by over 40
percent.  (Applause.)  
  
They said, “When I’m standing in this line, when I’m taking the time to
vote, I want you to deal with the fact that it’s expensive to raise
children and we need some help.”    
  
And so, because they stood in those lines and because they voted Joe
Biden and me into the White House and voted Chris Van Hollen’s
colleagues and Democrats into the Senate and Steny’s colleagues into the
House — because they stood in those lines, we passed a tax cut where
people parenting children will get up to 8,000 more dollars in their
pocket for the cost of medicine and school supplies and food to help
them in raising their children.  Because they stood in line and they
voted.  (Applause.)  
   
Because they voted and said, “You know, you all did a really good job
back in 2008 with reforming that healthcare system.  And let’s build on
that, because prescription medication is still expensive and because I
got a lot of people in my family who have diabetes.”  (Applause.) 
“Because Black folks in America are 60 percent more likely to be
diagnosed with diabetes, Latinos are 70 percent more likely to be
diagnosed with diabetes.  And because we have, in particular, seniors
around our country who, on a daily basis, are deciding whether they fill
a prescription that a doctor recommended because it will save their life
versus paying for their rent or food.  I’m going stand in this line to
vote, but I want you all to handle that.”    
   
And because they voted, we have now capped the cost of insulin at $35 a
month.  (Applause.)  
   
They said, “I’m going to take time out to vote.  But you really need to
deal with the fact that, for too long, the pharmaceutical companies have
been running this system around the cost of prescription medication.”   
   
And because they voted, because you all organized, we now are going to
have, for the first time, Medicare be able to negotiate against the
pharmaceutical companies on behalf of 60 million Americans. 
(Applause.)  
   
And I see all my friends in labor, SEIU — everybody here.  You know what
I’m talking about when you’re at that negotiation table.  Collective
bargaining works.  (Applause.)  
   
Because they voted and said, “You all need to fix the fact that the
infrastructure in America is about 150 years old, and these roads and
bridges need to be handled.  Because, by the way, when I drive over
these potholes and these broken roads and bridges, I get a flat tire,
which my insurance doesn’t cover.”  
   
And so, while others had been talking about “Infrastructure Week”
forever, folks took the time out to vote, and we passed an
infrastructure bill into law — (applause) — so that BWI is going to get
25 million more dollars.  (Applause.)  So that Penn Station will get 26
million more dollars.  And the Chesapeake Bay restoration 238 million
more dollars.  (Applause.)  Because you voted and you organized and you
reminded people that when they vote, things can happen.    
   
People put in their order in 2020.  They said, “You know what?”  Now,
this really resonates here in Baltimore.  “It’s about time we have a
black woman on the United States Supreme Court.”  (Applause.)  The home
of Thurgood.  (Applause.)  
   
And because they voted, there is now Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. 
(Applause.)  Because they voted.   
   
So, we’ve got a lot of good material to remind folks that the power is
with the people and voting matters.  And now we are 10 days away from an
election where the stakes are equally as high.    
   
So, think about it.  The United States Supreme Court — the Court
previously of Thurgood Marshall — just took a constitutional right that
had been recognized from the people of America, from the women of
America.    
   
And by the way, on the subject, one does not have to abandon your faith
or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her
what to do with her body.  (Applause.)  
   
And you know, the thing about it is you look at the decision that came
out of the Supreme Court.  It’s called the Dobbs decision.  The
proponents of the decision said, “Well, you know, we — we think that
this should now — this is an issue that should go to the states and the
voters can decide.”  Right?  
   
But look at who’s talking.  Because out of those same mouths, you will
see people who are across our country pushing laws, making it
intentionally more difficult for people to vote.    
   
This is happening in our country right now.  You look at what they’re
doing: pushing laws, proposing laws, passing laws that would criminalize
doctors and nurses and healthcare providers; make no exception for acts
that are some of the most violent and violative of a person’s body.   
   
And on that point, just consider these extremist, so-called leaders
saying no exception when there’s been that kind of violation and then to
— to take away from that individual the ability of self-determination to
make a decision about what happens to their body next.  It’s immoral. 
It’s immoral.  (Applause.)  
   
These things are at stake.  These so-called leaders are openly talking
about how they will go after Social Security and Medicare, not to
mention a national ban.    
   
On the Supreme Court, you know, Clarence Thomas said the quiet part out
loud — that what’s at risk now is your right to contraception, your
right to marry the person you love.  These are the things that are at
stake.  There is so much at stake in this election.   
   
And, you know, one of the things that has been very clear to our
President Joe Biden and me and our administration: All of the
accomplishments that we have gained terms of that list that we talked
about at the beginning, none of them would be real if it weren’t for our
ability to have a Governor Wes Moore and a senator in Chris Van
Hollen.  
   
Because here’s the thing: The job isn’t done just when you pass a bill. 
The job is done when it hits the streets.  And that’s why these
elections are so important.    
   
So, here’s how I see it, in terms of where we are.  We got 10 days to
go.  And, Maryland, you are always a leader in understanding what’s at
stake and fighting for our democracy.  (Applause.)    
   
And we need you.  We really need you.  We need you to be here.  We need
you to talk to your cousins and your play cousins in other states —
(laughter and applause) — and remind them of what’s at stake and remind
them of what they got the last time we asked them.  Because we really do
have a lot of good material.   
   
And so, let’s make sure that we take care of home base here in
Maryland.  And that’s going to be about the governor’s race.   
   
It’s going to be about Anthony Brown and making sure he is the next
attorney general of the great state of Maryland.  (Applause.)  There he
is.   
   
It’s going be about Aruna Miller.  It’ll be about Wes Moore.  It’ll be
about David Trone and flipping that seat.  (Applause.)  
   
And I think victory is ours to have if we work for it.  Because what we
know every time is we only make gains when we are prepared to fight for
them.   
   
And here’s what I’ll say as a — just a conclusion to these points.  As
Vice President, I have now — I have now — my team has told me, I —
they’ve counted — I have met with 100 — over 100 world leaders —
presidents, prime ministers, chancellors and kings.  (Applause.) 
Okay?  
   
Here’s the thing.  The United States of America, we have always been
able to walk in these rooms — chin up, shoulders back — talking about
the importance of democracies, the importance of the strength of
democracies.    
   
And so, we have had the authority, then, to walk in these rooms and talk
about rule of law, human rights.  And in that way, we have held
ourselves out to and have been considered a role model of the greatest
democracy in the world, flawed though we may be.   
   
But this is a room full of role models, so I’ll tell you what you
already know.  When you are a role model, people watch what you do to
see if it matches what you say.    
   
 And leaders around the world and people around the world are watching
what is happening in our country.  And I’ll tell you, Chris, Wes, one of
my greatest fears is that autocrats, dictators around the world can now
look at their people who are fighting for rights and say to them, “You
want to hold up the United States?  Well, look what they’re doing.  You
be quiet.”  
   
So, the stakes are high because it’s reasonable to believe that what we
are doing now will not only affect the people of Maryland but could very
well affect people around the world.  The stakes are high.    
   
And here’s the thing about the nature of democracies, in terms of the
way I see it.  I think there’s a duality.   
   
So, on the one hand, when democracies are intact, there’s an incredible
strength about it, in terms of what it gives its people when it fights
for and defends individual rights; defends equality, justice.  It’s
incredibly strong in terms of what it does to strengthen its people.   
   
On the other hand, democracy is very fragile.  It is only as strong is
our willingness to fight for it.  (Applause.)  It is only as strong as
the willingness of the people to fight for it.    
      
And so, fight we will!  All of the progress we have made as a nation has
been about understanding: We got to march.  We got to shout.  We got to
organize.  We got to vote.    
   
 We know what to do, Baltimore.  And when we fight, we win!  Thank you. 
(Applause.)
