*Eisenhower Executive Office Building*

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Hi.  Good morning, everyone.  Please, have a seat. 
Good morning.  I’m here to applaud you.  I’m truly here to applaud you
and to thank you all and, of course, Mitch, our dear friend.   
   
You know the President and I both started out our careers in local
government.  As you know, I held a — I was count- — I was the country
DA, a state AG, and then in the Senate.   
   
And the work that we’ve been doing in the last 20 months was and is work
that was motivated and informed by all of you who have feet on the
ground, ears to the ground.   
   
You know what the people need.  You know what we need to accomplish as a
country.  And you all then, from the very beginning of our
administration, helped informed our priorities.  You told us what
Michigan needs.  You told us where people were hurting.  You told us
what would help.  
   
You know, recently I find myself talking a lot, especially these days,
about, you know, real leaders can’t only be about talking about
problems; participate in the solution.  And that’s what you all have
done.  You’ve helped with what solves problems.   
   
And so we’ve been able to then do the work that we did — with everything
we did from the beginning around relief during the height of the
pandemic; to a once-a-generation investment in our infrastructure; to,
most recently, what we did with the Inflation Reduction Act, which
directly impacts so many issues that are immediate and need an
investment now for the long-term benefit.   
   
And so I am here to thank you all for, one, helping to inform all of the
work we’ve done so far, but then to make it real  Because, you know, I
often say to our folks: You know, it’s not about sitting around here and
patting ourselves on the back when a bill gets passed.  It means nothing
until it hits the streets.  And that, again, is where you all come in to
make sure that we see it through and that the people actually feel it. 
It’s not just about a press conference; it’s about making sure that
people feel it.  And so that’s what you all have been doing.   
   
When I look at what we have done, in terms of — I have some numbers here
— in particular about what it — how it has benefited Michigan: The
Infrastructure Bill is $2.9 billion for 120 projects in Michigan, which
is going to have a huge impact when we look at roads, bridges.  
   
One of my particular favorites about what we did with the Infrastructure
Bill was an investment in public transportation, which I know is a big
issue for Michiganders.   
   
When we look at what we did around lead pipes — and it is our intention
that, in the next 10 years, to rid our entire country of those pipes and
service lines.  (Applause.)  
   
And you all — you all were some of the first in the country to be the
loudest, in a way that was forceful and powerful, to say, “Our country
needs to deal with this” — you all in Michigan.  
   
We’re talking for generations — and the grandparents, the grandmothers,
the grandfathers, the parents.  Sadly, for generations talking about the
fact that our babies should not be drinking that toxic water and what it
does to impact their health and their ability to learn.   
   
And finally, we’re having a nationwide investment that’s going to see
what you all have been demanding to see it through.  I look at Great
Lakes — some of the most beautiful great lakes in the world — and what
we need to do in terms of restoration.  And so, we’ve got $1 billion
going into that.  We’ve got $80 million going into the Detroit Metro
Airport.  Right?   
   
And — and all of that is because, again, of you all helping to inform
where the priorities should be in a way that impacts the most people and
the people who are most in need, which can often be a different set of
folks.   
   
So I want to thank you for that.   
   
Electric vehicles.  You know, I just was in — in Korea and Japan a
couple of weeks ago.  And I was there actually representing our country
at the funeral of the former Prime Minister of Japan.  But while I was
there, I met with Japanese CEOs and separately met with the Koreans
around their investments in the United States and our encouragement that
they do more, because that means American jobs and contributes to what
we need to do in terms of U.S. manufacturing — manufacturing in our
country.   
   
And as you know, some people have been critical of what we did — right?
— with the CHIPS Act and the Science Act.  Our administration focusing
on what we need to do in terms of homegrown investments.   
   
And we’ve been very clear that is part of our policy, is to invest in
our country and in our people and in our workforce, while we — while we
— not to the exclusion — while we work with our allies on the issues
that we know are to our mutual benefit.  And we often talk about it in
the context of our mutual benefit as it relates to prosperity and
security.   
   
But what we are doing in Michigan in particular on this issue is quite
extraordinary, where we are so proud of what we intend to do to invest
in the American workforce, to invest in American manufacturing around
some of the most exciting technology when it comes to elite electric
vehicles, both in terms of automobiles and buses, trucks, but doing it
in a way that we are and will continue to maintain standing as a world
leader around doing some of the best work.  
   
All of this has happened because of you all.   
   
The work that we did around the most recent Inflation Reduction Act, it
was focused — you might — some might ask, “Well, what was the title
about?”  It was about dealing with the fact that life shouldn’t be too
expensive for working people.  People work hard.  They should be able to
afford to pay their bills and feed their children and take a vacation
from time to time.  And so, we focused on that by doing the kind of work
you all talked with us about.   
   
Let’s focus on the fact that too many people in our country are dealing
with medical debt.  Literally, debt that is weighing them down because
the cost of relieving their pain and extending the quality of their life
is too expensive.   
   
And because of the conversations that we all had, we said, “You know
what?  We’re done with the fact that for too long in this town, the big
pharmaceutical companies have gotten away with setting the prices
without fair negotiation.”  And so, for the first time, our
administration, with your support, has accomplished the ability to allow
Medicare to negotiate drug prices with Big Pharma for 60 million
people.  (Applause.)  Sixty million people.  
   
You know, a lot of us come from a labor background.  We understand what
this means.  It’s about allowing the collective to bargain.  Because if
you’re requiring that one person who needs medication to bargain against
the big corporations, and if you agree that the outcome of the
negotiation should be fair, unlikely that outcome is going to be fair,
given the disparity of power in that negotiation.  So, we’re changing it
up.   
   
We said, “Hey, the issue of diabetes in our country — big issue.”  And
then when you look demographically, Black folks are 60 percent more
likely to be diagnosed with diabetes; Latinos, 70 percent more likely. 
And the cost of insulin, which saves lives, is far too expensive.  And
so, we have now capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month.   
   
Again, it’s about dealing with the daily needs that folks have to get
through the day and move on, and a certain quality of life to which all
Americans should be entitled — and addressing the details.   
   
And so that brings me back to where I started, and it’s all of you —
because you keep us focused on the details, and you followed through on
the details.  And there’s nothing that we could do, in this town,
without all of you informing the work and then seeing it through.   
   
So, with that, I thank you all.  Welcome.  I’ll actually be in Michigan
on Saturday, and I’m looking forward to being there.  (Applause.)  And
with that, Mayor, back to you.  
   
MR. LANDRIEU:  Thank you.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:   Okay.  Take care, everybody.  (Applause.)
