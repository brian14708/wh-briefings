Q    What’s your reaction to the OPEC+ decision, Mr. President?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Disappointment.  And we’re looking at what alternatives
we may have.  
   
(Addressing other reporters.)  Don’t hurt him, man.  Don’t — you’re
knocking him through the wire.   
   
Q    Is Venezuela one of those alternatives?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  There’s a lot of alternatives.  We haven’t made up our
mind yet.  
   
Q    Will you meet President Putin at the G20 Summit, sir?  Will you
meet President Putin at the G20 Summit or APEC Summit to talk about
Ukraine and (inaudible)?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  That remains to be seen.   
   
Q    What would Venezuela have to do in order for the U.S. to ease
sanctions?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  A lot.  
   
Q    What does the OPEC move say about your relationship with the
Saudis?  Are there any regrets about that trip now?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No.  The — the trip was not essentially for oil.  The
trip was about the Middle East and about Israel and rationalization of
positions.   
   
But it is a disappointment, and it says that there are problems.
