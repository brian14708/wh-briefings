title: "Readout of Vice President Kamala\_Harris\u2019s Meeting on Reproductive Rights\
  \ with Student Leaders"
---
 
Today, Vice President Kamala Harris convened 75 student leaders at the
White House from colleges and universities across 33 states to discuss
the fight to protect reproductive rights.  
   
During the conversation, the student leaders spoke about reproductive
health care access on their college and university campuses, and they
shared stories about how students are organizing in their communities
following the Supreme Court overturning *Roe v. Wade* in *Dobbs* v.
*Jackson Women’s Health Organization.* The student leaders highlighted
how young people are mobilizing to oppose restrictive abortion laws, and
how these laws are creating confusion for individuals seeking
reproductive health services.  They discussed the intersection of
attacks on abortion access and attacks on voting rights and LGBTQI+
rights – noting the importance of building coalitions to defend rights
and freedoms.  
   
The Vice President and student leaders spoke about supporting survivors
of sexual violence on college campuses and making it easier for
individuals to receive health care free from stigma. The participants
raised concerns about access to contraception on campus and the ability
to travel out-of-state if necessary to receive reproductive care. The
Vice President applauded the student leaders for their work and
encouraged them to continue fighting for reproductive freedom.  
   
The Vice President has brought together leaders from across the nation
who are on the frontlines fighting to protect reproductive health care
and abortion access. This month, the Vice President has traveled to
Connecticut and Texas to participate in conversations with reproductive
rights leaders, and she chaired the Second Meeting of the Interagency
Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access at the White House. Since
May, she has held more than 20 convenings and met with 180+ state
legislators from 18 states to discuss protecting reproductive rights.
The Vice President has also convened health care providers,
constitutional law experts, faith leaders, state attorneys general,
disability rights leaders, higher education leaders, students, and
advocates.
