Yokosuka Naval Base  
Yokosuka, Japan*

THE VICE PRESIDENT: I heard you might have some questions.  
   
WHITE HOUSE AIDE:  And we’re going to start with Nancy Cook from
Bloomberg.  
   
Q    Thank you so much, Madam Vice President.  You talked in your speech
about the U.S. strengthening its unofficial ties with Taiwan.  And I
just think if you could talk a little bit more about how the U.S. plans
to do that.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, we remain dedicated to the principles that we
have long stated, which is that there should not be any unilateral
change to the status quo and that we are committed to peace and
stability in the Taiwan Strait, that we will work with our allies.   
   
But it remains one of our core principles, in terms of the importance of
a free and open Indo-Pacific and peace and stability in the region.  We
are a member of the Indo-Pacific region, and we take that
responsibility, as a neighbor, seriously.  
   
Q    What’s “deepening ties” mean, though, with Taiwan?   
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  It’s — it’s being here right now, doing the work of
meeting with and reaffirming our commitment to an ally like Japan as a
member of this region.  I’ll be in Korea tomorrow, as you know.  And the
work that we are doing — for example, these three countries: the United
States, Korea, and Japan — it’s about strengthening the trilateral
relationship we have.   
   
And I will speak for the United States, understanding that, again, as a
member of the Indo-Pacific region, we have a vested interest and a
priority in peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.  And that will not
change, and it has not changed.  And unfortunately, sometimes it bears
repeating.  And so that’s — that’s what you heard today.  
   
Q    Madam Vice President, what was the level of concern you heard from
the leaders that you met with on North Korea and China as it relates to
Taiwan?  And any concern at all about the President’s comments and sort
of articulating the U.S.’s position on Taiwan more clearly?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’ll tell you where we stand — and I said it
in my speech: There’s no question that we believe that it was intended
to and, to some extent, had a destabilizing effect in the region.  And
these are moments that I think require us to reinforce the importance of
the relationships that we have with our allies.  And so, a lot of the
conversations were just that.   
   
But the relationship and the alliance is based on shared principles in
terms of international rules and norms, such as sovereignty, territorial
integrity.  It is also about what we know to be our commitment to
security and prosperity for all these nations.  And so that was a lot of
the conversation.   
   
Q    A quick question on Russia.  What’s your message to the Russian men
who are currently fleeing their country out of fear of being drafted? 
And are they welcome in the U.S.?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Listen, what Putin’s war is doing is creating
massive destruction in Ukraine, and I support all good people standing
up in a principled way to articulate that it is an aggression that is in
violation of basic tenets of the importance of supporting and protecting
sovereignty and territorial integrity.   
   
And I do believe that in moments like this, all people should have the
freedom and the courage to stand and speak about the outrageousness of
the aggression and the consequences of that aggression to human life and
stability in that region.  
   
                          END
