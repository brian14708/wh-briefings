*Johnson Space Center  
Houston, Texas*

1:31 P.M. CDT  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good morning, everyone.  Please have a seat.  Good
afternoon.  
   
Madam Director, thank you for that very kind introduction and for your
work.   
   
I am thrilled to be here.  I am thrilled to be here.   
   
But, for our director, I want to thank you for your leadership.  You
have been an inspiration to so many.   
   
It is truly an honor to be with so many leaders here today.  I’ve had
the chance to visit with quite a few of you this morning.  And I will
tell you — each and every one of you and our panelists: You inspire me
and you inspire our nation.  And by extension, you inspire the world. 
So, thank you all for what you do.   
   
And to the members of our administration, the members of Congress who
are here, private sector leaders, international partners, and, of
course, my fellow Americans: Thank you and welcome to the second
convening of our National Space Council.  
   
So, 60 years ago next week, just up the road at Rice University,
President John F. Kennedy delivered an address on the future of the
American space program.  
   
At the time, the space race with the Soviet Union was well underway. 
And while our nation had made many discoveries and achieved many
milestones in the years before — at the time, America was at real risk
of falling behind.  
   
And so, to the assembled thousands and to the entire world, President
Kennedy made a vow: Before the end of the decade, America would do what
no nation had done before, we would set foot on the Moon.  
   
Because of the vision of President Kennedy; because of the commitment of
President Johnson — a champion of the American space program since his
days in the United States Senate; and because of the hard work and
ingenuity of thousands of Americans, our nation, in fact, did achieve
that goal.  
   
In the decades since, America has orbited Mercury, landed rovers on
Mars, and flown by Pluto.  We have looked back on our Earth from
billions of miles away.  And we have built a telescope powerful enough
to observe our universe as it was billions of years ago.  Imagine.   
   
For generations, with our allies and partners around the globe, America
has led our world in the exploration and use of space.   
   
And I do believe that our leadership has been guided by a set of
fundamental principles — cooperation, security, ambition, and public
trust — which is the recognition, of course, that space can and must be
protected for the benefit of all people.  
   
Today, as was the case 60 years ago, our nation’s leadership in space is
critical to our economic prosperity, to our scientific and technological
progress, and, in a time of increasing great power rivalry, to our
national security.  
   
So the mission of this council is to preserve and promote American
leadership in space, to synchronize our nation’s civil and commercial
and national security space activities so that America may continue to
use space to improve the lives of people in our nation and throughout
our world.  
   
Last year, at the first meeting of the National Space Council, we
identified three priorities essential to that mission:  
   
First, expanding our STEM workforce.  And I’ve invited some students
here today because they truly are the future of our leadership on that
level.   
   
Second, a priority is addressing the climate crisis.  
   
And third, promoting international rules and norms to govern space
activities.  
   
Today, the business of our work is for the council to report on the work
that has occurred since our last meeting across these areas.  We will,
today, also discuss the work yet ahead — the work we must still do to
continue to move forward.  In particular, the work we must do to build a
skilled, technical space workforce; to advance human space exploration;
and to establish rules for novel commercial space activities.  
   
First: Building our skilled technical workforce.  So, last week, with
many of you, I had the honor to visit the Kennedy Space Center.  There,
I met some of the people who are building the future of the American
space program.  
   
And as you might expect, these were engineers; literally, rocket
scientists; astronauts; and programmers.  And they were also welders,
machinists, and electricians.  
   
Today, the space industry employs tens of thousands of skilled technical
workers.  Even so, there are thousands more jobs for technical workers —
good-paying jobs that often do not require a four-year degree but are
essential to our space program.  And these jobs are just waiting to be
filled.   
   
Last year, I called on private sector leaders to help our nation
address, then, this workforce need.  And, today, I’m proud to say over a
dozen commercial space companies are answering that call.  
   
In fact, next month, these companies will kick off three regional pilot
training programs: one in Florida, one on the Gulf Coast, and one in
Southern California.  This coalition of companies will partner with our
community colleges, with our technical schools, and our unions to help
workers learn the skills they need to take on the new jobs that are
being created in the space industry and to help our nation lead the way
in space.   
   
So that brings me to our second area of focus, and a focus of our
meeting for today as well, which is advancing human space exploration. 
Soon, for the first time in half a century, America will go back to the
Moon.  
   
The Artemis Program will return American astronauts to the Lunar
surface, in- — yes.  (Applause.)  Yes.  And as Madam Director mentioned,
the — it will include the first woman and person of color.   
   
And think about it: So, when we went before, indeed, with pride, we
planted our flag.  It was rather temporary that visit.  With the Artemis
Program, it’s not just to visit but to live and to work on the Moon. 
Think about that.  
   
The Artemis Program — (applause) — yes.  The Artemis Program will
establish the first space station in lunar orbit and the first lunar
basecamp where astronauts will train for the first mission to Mars.  
   
And our nation is also leading the way in human space exploration closer
to home.  
   
For over two decades, astronauts aboard the International Space Station
have advanced scientific progress.  In fact, I was — I was honored to
speak with three of them this morning from here, of course.  NASA has
used the station’s unique microgravity environment to develop new
treatments for cancer and rare genetic diseases.  
   
And when I spoke with them this morning, they talked about how their
work is helping us fight the climate crisis.  They’re work is increasing
the productivity of our farms and slowing the effects of aging.  So our
administration and we all gathered today are committed to continuing
that work, which is why last year, our administration announced that we
would extend our commitment to the International Space Station through
2030. (Applause.)  
   
And that being said, we are aware that the International Space Station
will not remain operational forever — that we all know — which is why
NASA is working with the private sector to develop the first generation
of commercial space stations.  
   
And as we will discuss more today, our administration remains committed
to making sure that NASA maintains the capacity to conduct cutting-edge
research in space, which brings me then to our final area of focus:
establishing rules for novel commercial space activities.  
   
Today, private space companies have capabilities that would have been
difficult to imagine even a decade ago.  Today, private companies can
dock satellites in orbit.  They can capture and move space debris out of
the way of our satellites and space stations.  And soon, they will be
able to repair and even build new structures while in orbit.   
   
These novel activities will enable America’s continued leadership in
space.  But because these capabilities are so new, few rules currently
exist to ensure that they are conducted safely, effectively, and
sustainably, which is why, in consultation with civil and commercial
stakeholders, our administration is currently developing the first rules
as a framework for novel space activities.  
   
These rules will promote innovation and enable competition.  They will
reinforce the sources of America’s global strength, such as our
innovation and our industrial capacity.  These rules will be flexible
enough to cover space activities that have not yet even been imagined. 
And they will help ensure that our nation remains a global role model
for the responsible use of space.  
   
All of this, then, is part of our administration’s larger vision for
space.  As I explained last year: As activity in space grows, we must
also establish international rules and norms to reaffirm the rights of,
and demand responsibility from, all space-faring nations.  
   
Since our last meeting, eight new nations have signed on to the Artemis
Accords, which establish clear norms for civil space exploration,
bringing the total number of signatories to 21.  
   
This April, I announced that our nation would not conduct destructive,
direct-ascent, anti-satellite missile testing.  
   
And later this month, the United States will introduce a resolution at
the United Nations General Assembly to call on other nations to make the
same commitment.  
   
And here is my final point: Much has changed since our nation first set
our sights on the Moon six decades ago.  We have traveled billions of
miles into the unknown, and we have learned many great and profound
truths about our universe.  
   
And yet, in a very real sense, we have only just begun our journey into
space.  There is so much we still don’t know and so much we still
haven’t done.  Space remains a place of undiscovered and unrealized
opportunity.  
   
So, our task then and our responsibility, dare I say, is to work
together to guide humanity forward into this new frontier and to make
real the incredible potential of space for all people.  
   
May God bless you.  And may God bless America.  Thank you all. 
(Applause.)
