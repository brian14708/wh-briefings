*Joint Security Area*  
*Paju-si, Republic of Korea*

  
Q    Madam Vice President, should Americans be concerned about these
test launches that have been happening?  It’s now a record number this
year.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, we — I talked with the President about it. 
And it is clearly a provocation, and it is meant, we believe, to
destabilize the region.  And we’re taking it seriously.  
   
Q    What’s —  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And everyone should.  It’s — it’s — we’ve counted
probably 20 at this point.  So we’re taking it very seriously, and it is
destabilizing for the region.   
   
And that is one of the reasons why the visit that I have made to Korea —
to the Republic of Korea is important, because it is a statement about
the strength of our alliance and our dedication — the United States’
dedication to this alliance, both in terms of security, prosperity, and
stability for the region and for the Indo-Pacific as a whole.
