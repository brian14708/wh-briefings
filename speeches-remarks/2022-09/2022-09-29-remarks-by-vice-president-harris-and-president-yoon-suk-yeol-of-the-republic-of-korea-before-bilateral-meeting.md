*Office of the President  
Seoul, Republic of Korea*

PRESIDENT YOON:  (As interpreted.)  Once again, Madam Vice President, I
sincerely welcome you to Korea.  Now, the ROK-U.S. Alliance is advancing
beyond the Korean Peninsula to a global alliance, and beyond a military
alliance to an economic and technology alliance.   
   
Last week, President Biden and I met several times in London and in New
York, and we reaffirmed our common understanding about the future
directions of our alliance.  The ROK-U.S. Alliance is the linchpin that
defends the freedom, security, and prosperity of the Korean people, and
I will do my utmost to further strengthen our alliance.   
   
I believe that your visit to Korea, following President Biden’s visit to
Seoul last May, will be another turning point to achieve this goal.  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Thank you, Mr. President.  And it is my honor to
be here in Seoul.  As I shared with you, the Second Gentleman was
honored to lead the presidential delegation to your inauguration in
May.   
   
And of course, our President, Joe Biden, sends you his best and found
that his visit with you in May here in Seoul was extremely productive
and important.   
   
And thank you for the work that you continue to do to build on the
relationship and the enduring relationship between the United States and
the Republic of Korea.  
   
For seven decades, the alliance between the United States and the
Republic of Korea has been a linchpin of security and prosperity on the
Korean Peninsula and in the Indo-Pacific and throughout the globe.  I’m
here to reinforce the strength of our alliance and strengthen our work
together.  
  
END
