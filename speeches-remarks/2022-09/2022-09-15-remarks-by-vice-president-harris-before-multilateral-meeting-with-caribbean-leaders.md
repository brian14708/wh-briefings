title: Remarks by Vice President Harris Before Multilateral Meeting with Caribbean
  Leaders

*Blair House*

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, good afternoon, everyone.  And welcome.  It
is good see so many of you again.  It has been a point of — of pride and
joy for me personally that we have had many conversations over a short
period of time where we have renewed the commitment between our nations
to work together.   
   
I, as you know, first convened leaders from CARICOM and the Dominican
Republic back in April, and proposed — based on the conversation we had
— that we would meet on a more regular basis going forward, having heard
from the leaders at this table about the need to ensure that we have
consistency in the way that we communicate and collaborate.   
   
We then convened at the Summit of the Americas in June, where the
President — President Biden and I proposed three joint committees
between our nations, focused in particular on the issue of energy
security, finance, and food security.  
   
Each committee has been co-chaired by a leader from the Caribbean and a
senior member of our administration.  And the goal for each committee,
as designed, is to ensure that we collaborate on those issues and that
we produce concrete, near-term solutions to the work that we do.  
   
And I am proud to announce that that work has, in fact, taken place and
that today we will announce a series of steps that the United States
will take in response to the needs of our Caribbean partners.  
   
On the issue of the climate crisis, two of the committees — energy
security and finance, in particular — produced actions that will address
the climate crisis, which, of course, is an existential crisis for our
planet.  And the Caribbean is on the frontlines of this crisis.  
   
We will take steps to accelerate implementation of what we named the
U.S.-Caribbean Partnership to Address the Climate Crisis, also known as
PACC 2030, which I launched at the Summit of the Americas in Los
Angeles.  
   
The United States, to that end, is committed to four areas, in
particular.  One, to identify new clean energy projects; to provide
technical assistance to our partners in the Caribbean; to bring
investors to the Caribbean; and to improve access to development
financing, which was the subject of much discussion in our previous
meetings.  And we are sending a team, in fact, to the Caribbean this
fall to jumpstart this process.  
   
On the issue of food security: We know that disruptions from Russians
aggress- — Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, from the pandemic, and, of
course, from the climate crisis have put pressure on global food prices
and have led to food shortages.  
   
Addressing food security in the Caribbean and around the world is a
priority for our administration.  Since we met at the Summit of the
Americas, the work has already begun.  The United States has committed
$28 million to provide food security assistance to the Caribbean.  
   
In furtherance of that, the food security committee, having met and
worked these months, has developed a series of actions that the United
States will take.  In particular, we will promote good agricultural
practices and do what we can to enhance those practices in the
Caribbean.   
   
We will contribute to addressing the logistical barriers to
transportation.  And as we know, that is a very important detail when we
are talking about combating food insecurity anywhere, and in particular
in the Caribbean.  
   
We will remove non-tariff barriers to facilitate movement of the food in
the region.  
   
We will incorporate climate-smart technology into the food protection
system and food production system.  
   
And we will provide training on areas such as pest management — a very
important detail and something that must be addressed.  
   
In conclusion, I will say, as I have said before, the relationship
between the United States and the Caribbean is based on common bonds and
interests.  As neighbors in the Western Hemisphere, we believe it is
critical that we have a relationship that is based on close cooperation,
knowing that the result of that will be our shared prosperity and
security, which is why we, the United States, have pledged to increase
our commitment and engagement with our Caribbean partners.  
   
So, again, I welcome you.  I thank you.  And I look forward to our
discussion in our meeting this afternoon.  
   
And I’ll now turn to President Santokhi of Suriname to speak about the
role that you are playing as the chair of CARICOM and so much else.  
   
Thank you, and welcome again.
