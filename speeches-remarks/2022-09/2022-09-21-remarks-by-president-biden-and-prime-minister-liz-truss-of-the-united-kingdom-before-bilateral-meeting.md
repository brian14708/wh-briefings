PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, Madam Prime Minister, on behalf of the American
people, I want to again express our condolences for the loss of Queen
Elizabeth II.  It was an honor for my wife and I to be able to pay our
respects at her lying-in-state and attend the state funeral in London.

I was amazed and overwhelmed by the affection of the British people and
the world, quite frankly.  Even — I mean, the thousands and thousands of
people who stayed all night just to pay their respects was enormous.

And I want to extend my congratulations to you, Madam Prime Minister,
for becoming Prime Minister and working — and I look forward to working
closely with you.  You’re our closest ally in the world, and there’s a
lot we can do — continue to do together.

And there’s no issue that I can think of, of global consequence, where
the United States and the United Kingdom are not working in
cooperation.  And I expect we’ll be — continue to be able to do that.

And we have a full agenda today, from supporting Ukraine and — as it
defends itself against Russia and Putin’s challenges, as well as China
and it’s — posed by; preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons as
well.  There’s a lot on the agenda.   
   
We also want to talk about energy, which understandably is of
significant consequence to all of Europe and Great Britain and England —
the United Kingdom, in particular.

And finally, we both are committed to protecting the gains of the Good
Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland.  And I’m looking forward to
hearing what’s on your mind and how we can continue to cooperate.  
   
PRIME MINISTER TRUSS:  Well, thank you very much, Mr. President, for
welcoming me.  
   
And thank you also to you and the First Lady for coming to the United
Kingdom for the funeral of her late Majesty.  She was the rock on which
modern Britain was built.  And I have seen a huge outpouring of
affection for her in the United Kingdom but also here in the United
States.   
   
And we’re very grateful for all the support that you have given us over
the — what has been two very difficult weeks in the United Kingdom as we
move towards the reign of King Charles III and we enter a new era.  
   
And as you say, Mr. President, we are steadfast allies.  And I’ve
enjoyed working with Tony Blinken very closely in our response on
Russia’s appalling war in Ukraine and making sure that we are supporting
the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom.  But we face huge challenges
as autocracies seek to cement and increase their assertiveness around
the world.   
   
And that is why we’re stepping up in terms of our defense spending. 
We’re going to be moving to 3 percent of GDP on defense spending.  And
that’s why we want to work more closely with the United States,
especially on energy security, on our economic security, but also in
reaching out to fellow democracies around the world to make sure that
democracies prevail and we protect the freedom and future of our
citizens.  
   
And, of course, I’m looking forward to discussing the Belfast/Good
Friday Agreement and how we make sure that’s upheld into the future.   
   
Thank you very much, Mr. President, for welcoming me and my delegation
today.  Thank you.
