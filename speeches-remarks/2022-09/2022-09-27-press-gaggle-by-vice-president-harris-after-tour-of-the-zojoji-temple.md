title: "Press Gaggle by Vice President Harris After Tour of the Zojoji\_Temple"

*Zojoji Temple  
*Tokyo, Japan**

THE VICE PRESIDENT:   Well, it has been a very good and important trip
that we have made to Tokyo and to Japan — of course, under very sad
circumstances, which is the passing of former Prime Minister Abe.   
   
There has been much that has been said in honor of his role of
leadership to Japan but also to the United States.  It was he who coined
the term “a free and open Indo-Pacific.”  And as a member of the
Indo-Pacific region, as America, we cherish those principles and we
stand by them.  And it is part of the bond that forms the alliance
between the United States and Japan.   
   
So, last night, in fact, we celebrated his life with a dinner that was
hosted by the current Prime Minister of Japan, where there were
wonderful stories being told by people who spent time with him about his
life and his legacy.   
   
Since we’ve been here, I’ve also had meetings with the Prime Minister of
Korea.  I’ll be traveling to Seoul the day after next to strengthen and
reestablish, of course, that relationship.  And I do think about that
relationship in the context of a trilateral relationship — certainly a
direct responsibility that we have and a sense of responsibility to the
security of Korea, but also thinking of that relationship in the context
of the alliance with Japan.   
   
I also met today with Prime Minister Albanese of Australia.  He and I —
and he and the President — have a lot in common in terms of a
commitment, again, to the Indo-Pacific region and to an open and free
Indo-Pacific.   
   
But also, we had an extensive conversation about the climate crisis. 
He, as a leader, has really stepped up in a very significant — dare I
say “ambitious” — way.  But his ambition, I have no question, will be
achieved to have Australia be a leader on the globe on this issue.   
   
And we discussed the significance — perhaps coincidence, but
significance — of him stepping up in a role of leadership for Australia
just as we were able to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which the
President has signed, which will invest $370 billion in the work that
the United States will do on the issue of the climate crisis.  
   
So, this has been an important trip and — again, to re-establish,
confirm, reinitiate all that we have held dear in terms of our
membership in this region, but also the alliances that have been
longstanding and that we are intent on strengthening as we go forward.  
   
So, with that, it is good to see everyone.  Thank you.
