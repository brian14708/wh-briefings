*University of Illinois Chicago  
Chicago, Illinois*

1:08 P.M. CDT  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, good afternoon, everyone.  I want to thank
you all for taking the time to be here for this important convening.   
   
Governor, I thank you for the leadership you have been providing this
state.  You and I have had many conversations around the Dobbs decision,
and you really have been not only a leader for Illinois, but a national
leader on this issue.  So thank you for that.  
   
Mayor Lightfoot, thank you always for welcoming back to your beautiful
city and for your leadership, because truly, there is so much about this
issue that highlights the need for local leadership in addition to
statewide and national leadership.  
   
General Raoul, I want to thank you not only for the work that you’ve
been doing here in Illinois, but for being a leader amongst attorneys
general.  The meeting that we had when you came to D.C. with other
attorneys general on this issue meant a lot in terms of how we know we
want to coordinate around the law and what we can do in terms of
defending constitutional freedoms.  
   
So, to everyone, thank you for being here.  
   
So, we are here because, as we all know, with the Dobbs decision, the
United States Supreme Court — the highest court in the land — took a
constitutional right from the people of America, from the women of
America.  
   
And we are, in the wake of that decision, facing a healthcare crisis in
America that requires us all to speak up and do everything we can to
ensure that we will fight to protect a woman’s right to make decisions
about her own body.   
   
This issue raises many fundamental princip- — principles about who we
are as a country, including the principle of freedom, and liberty,
self-determination, and bodily autonomy.  
   
We must agree that the women of America have the ability to exercise
their own judgment in making decisions about their own body and that the
government should not be making that decision for her.  
   
And it bears noting, one does not have to give up their faiths or
religious beliefs to agree that the government should not be making that
decision for her.  
   
So we convened today to talk about we — in each of our respective
positions of leadership, what we can do individually and collectively to
address this issue and, frankly, this injustice.   
   
We do so understanding that the work that happens on this issue will
require the kind of leadership our President has provided in terms of
the executive orders that he has signed recognizing constitutional
rights to travel and access to healthcare.   
   
But also it is through the leadership of governors, like Governor
Pritzker, that we look to for what states like Illinois have been and
continue to do to not only provide for the women of this state, but, as
the governor has said — and he and I have talked about this — under his
leadership, to be a safe haven for women around the state, in
neighboring and surrounding states.  
   
In fact, I look at what’s happening in Illinois, Governor, and — and you
all are, without any question, being stretched thin, in terms of your
healthcare resources going directly to your constituents, but to
neighboring states as well.  
   
In fact, when I look at a map of the country and the neighborhood in
which you exist, there’s no question to me that you are helping women
from states like Indiana and Kentucky and Missouri and Tennessee and
Wisconsin, in addition to the women of Illinois.  So I thank you for
that.  
   
But I also recognize that when we are seeing — as we have been — women
from neighboring states going to those states that are protecting the
constitutional right of women, that it makes a statement also about the
fact that the women of those states that are banning access to
reproductive healthcare need that healthcare, want that healthcare.  And
in spite of that, are being denied access to that healthcare in their
own states.  
   
So we will continue to work together — all of us.  And we do recognize
this is just the beginning, both in terms of the movement that we are in
to fight for reproductive healthcare for all people, but also
recognizing that, frankly, Justice Clarence Thomas said the quiet part
out loud, which is, with the Dobbs decision, we are also looking at a
very high likelihood of a risk to the right to contraception, same-sex
marriage.   
   
So, to that end, we know that this is also an opportunity to build
coalition around all people who are directly affected or who care about
those who are affected when it comes to these attacks.  
   
And again, I thank all of the leaders who are here.  
   
And my final point will be: Elections matter.  Elections matter.  We
have a midterm coming up in 53 days.   
   
Who is your governor matters.  Whether they’re going to protect these
rights and support these rights to freedom and liberty, it matters.   
   
Who is your attorney general matters.  Whether they are going to protect
and defend the principles ingrained in the Constitution of the United
States, that matters.  
   
Who your local prosecutor is matters if you are in a place that has, as
many are attempting to do, criminalized healthcare providers and are
attempting to punish women.  
   
So I encourage everyone to exercise your right to express your voice on
this issue through your vote in 53 days.  
   
And with that, I thank everyone.  And, Governor, I will now pass the mic
over to you.  
                           
END            1:14 P.M. CDT
