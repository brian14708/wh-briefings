title: Remarks by Vice President Harris and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo of the Republic
  of Korea Before Bilateral Meeting

*The Okura Tokyo  
*Tokyo, Japan**

VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Good morning.  Mr. Prime Minister, good
morning.  I look forward to our conversation and, of course, as we
mentioned, my trip to Seoul in just two days.  This is on the heels of
the important conversation and a fruitful conversation that President
Biden had with President Yoon, where he discussed, as you and I will
discuss, America’s continuous and (inaudible) commitment to the Republic
of Korea and to your safety and security.   
   
The United States alliance with the Republic of Korea is the linchpin of
security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.  We take that relationship
seriously and we stand with you in the face of threats, knowing that we
are aligned on so many issues.  We have a shared history, and we have a
lot of work yet to do together to strengthen that relationship.   
   
I look forward to discussing with you, for example, the work that we are
doing as it relates to our investment in innovation and technology; the
work we are doing in space; and then, of course, your leadership, in
particular, on the climate crisis.  I look forward to talking with you
about the ambitious goals that you have set based on your personal, I
believe, commitment to addressing that issue and to the Republic of
Korea’s leadership globally on that very issue.  
   
So it is good to meet with you, and I’m looking forward to our
conversation.  
   
PRIME MINISTER HAN:  Thank you, Madam Vice President.  I and my
delegation are really very happy and honored to meet you and your
delegation here in Tokyo.  And we are looking forward to welcoming you
in Seoul in two days.  And our government and the Korean people are very
much looking forward to seeing you in person in Korea.   
   
And I think your visit to DMZ in Seoul is a real — a very symbolic
demonstration of your strong commitment to the security and peace on the
Korean Peninsula.  And we are working with you and U.S. in dealing with
North Korea when they actually made very public that they will be
aggressive in using nuclear power.  So, you know, it was very rare that
some country is actually making explicit how they will use nuclear — you
know, nuclear ambitions in such an explicit way.  
   
So, we should really go into real cooperation and work together in
making a really effective deterrence to the possible provocations of the
North Koreans.  
   
And our overall relations are very comprehensive now with your
President’s — President Biden’s visit to Korea in May.  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Yes.  Yeah.   
   
PRIME MINISTER HAN:  And not only we are steadfast on, you know,
military alliance, we are going into more economic and technological
alliances.  And we are moving forward into the world to work — to work
in — to work together in committing ourselves to protect some of the
basic common values of the global nature, including democracy and human
rights and market economy.  
   
So, I think that our strong commitments to the global principles with a
very strong collaborative cooperations with — between the United States
and Korea will really help and support where the global community should
go when there’s a lot of the challenges now occurring everywhere,
including, as you said, climate change and pandemics and some of the
forces to change the status quo by force.  
   
So, in the future — you know, in addition to what we did together, in
the future there are many more things that we can work together.  And in
that sense, we are very pleased to see you to have some discussions on a
lot of issues — although we cannot complete all our discussions right at
this moment, but we can continue in Korea and in Seoul.   
   
Thank you very much.  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  
   
                          END
