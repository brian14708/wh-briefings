title: "Remarks by Vice President Harris During Meeting with Groundbreaking Women\
  \ Leaders From the Republic of\_Korea"

*Chief of Mission Residence  
*Seoul, Republic of Korea**

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, good afternoon.  It is my privilege to be
here with such an impressive group of leaders, who happen to be women,
who have achieved great success, broken many barriers, and are role
models to so many people of both genders, of any gender.  
   
I do strongly believe that when women succeed, all of society succeeds. 
I also believe that a real measure of the strength of a democracy is to
measure the strength and standing of women.  And I therefore believe
that if we want to strengthen democracy, we must pay attention to gender
equity and do the good and important work of lifting up the status of
women in every way — socially, economically, in terms of safety, and in
terms of supporting women to have ambition and achieve  
their goals that hopefully are driven by ambition and knowing that they
can be and do anything.  
   
So I’ve asked this group of leaders to join me, as I have when I’ve been
traveling the world, asking women in various countries to come together
so we can talk about the status of women in our world.  And I’m looking
forward to the conversation that we will have.  I’m looking forward to
lifting up your stories and sharing your thoughts as I travel the world
and use my platform and voice to ensure that we always pay attention to
the status of women.  
   
So, with that, I thank each of you.  And I will — I will end with a
saying that my — my mother had many sayings, and one of them — she would
say to me, “Kamala, you may be the first to do many things.  Make sure
you’re not the last.”  And I know enough about the leaders at this table
to know that that is the spirit with which you do your work.   
   
So, with that, I thank you all.  And I’ll just make a final point that
the relationship between the United States and the Republic of Korea is
an important one.  It is a strong one.  It is an enduring one.  And we
share a responsibility to uphold democratic principles at home and
around the world.   
   
I had a very productive and important meeting with the President just
before I arrived here, where we reaffirmed the strength of the
relationship between our two nations and the work we have ahead.  
   
So, with that, I thank you all.  I thank the press.  And we can begin
our conversation.  
   
Q    Madam Vice President, did you talk about equity with the
President?  Did you talk about equity with the President?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  
   
END
