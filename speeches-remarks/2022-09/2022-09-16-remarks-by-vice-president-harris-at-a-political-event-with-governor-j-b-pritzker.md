  Pritzker"

* University of Illinois Chicago  
Chicago, Illinois*

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Hey, Chicago!  (Laughs.)  Good evening.  Good
evening.  Can we give it up for your governor, J.B. Pritzker? 
(Applause.)  You guys got to send him back to the statehouse.  We’re
counting on him to be there.  We’re counting on him.   
   
Well, it is so wonderful to be back in Chicago.  (Applause.)  It really
is.   
   
Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Lieutenant Governor Juliana Stratton, and all of
the leaders gathered here: I thank you.  I thank you for your service to
the people of Illinois and, by extension, to the people of America.   
   
And as it relates to your governor, J.B. Pritzker, let me tell you
something: He has been an extraordinary leader.  You know, I talk with
him on the phone, even when I don’t see him, and we talk about you.  And
we talk —  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible.)  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yes, we do.  And we talk about you, and we talk
about what’s at stake.  And what you all are doing here in Illinois
really is providing a model for the rest of the country about giving
voice to the people, putting the power in the people, and then with a
governor doing the work of leading in a way that is defined by strength
and compassion.   
   
And I’ll say about your governor: He’s the same person whether the
cameras are on or the cameras are off.  He is always fighting for the
people.  (Applause.)  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  I love you, Kamala!  (Applause.)  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  Thank you all.  Thank you all.   
   
So let’s talk about where we are today.  What we are looking at right
now is — is the fact that there are 53 days to go until this November’s
election.  Fifty-three days.  That’s a long time and a short time.  And
we have got to make every one of these 53 days count.   
   
So, as you know, Governor Pritzker is on the ballot.  Juliana Stratton
is on the ballot.  Your members of Congress are on the ballot too.  And
we need you.  We need you to send them to the positions of leadership
that they have so rightly earned to do what we need to get done.   
   
Because here’s the thing, Chicago: You know how to get Democrats
elected.  You do.  This is the home of Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth —
(applause) — who we must reelect.   
   
This is the home of Harold Washington and Carol Moseley Braun and Barack
Obama!  (Applause.)  
   
This is the home of hope and change.   
   
And so we need you to get the vote out this November.  Because truly —
truly, this election, I do believe, will determine the future of not
only your home state but our home country.  
   
Over the past 20 months, we as Democrats have proven that when the
people put Democrats in charge, we know how to deliver results for the
people.  
   
Think about it.  At the height of the pandemic, we got relief to the
American people.  Our administration partnered with Governor Pritzker to
put billions to work right here in Illinois and keep schools and small
businesses open.   
   
Just last month, we passed the Inflation Reduction Act to lower energy
costs, to lower healthcare costs, to lower prescription drug costs. 
(Applause.)  
   
And here’s the thing on that — on the prescription drug cost: For years,
Big Pharma tried to pocket bigger profits by stopping Medicare from
negotiating lower drug prices.  Well, we got in power thanks to you, and
we said “Enough.”  And now Medicare has the power to negotiate drug
prices on behalf of millions of seniors — because we believe, Democrats
believe, people must come before profits.  (Applause.)  
   
Since we got in office, we have expanded background checks for gun
purchases.  We have canceled student debt.  (Applause.)  
   
We have made the largest investment to combat the climate crisis in
history.  (Applause.)   
   
And let us not forget about our judiciary.  We are ensuring that our
judiciary looks like America.  And, yes, we have confirmed more women to
the federal courts than ever before at this point in a presidency —
(applause) — including to the highest court in our land.  And her name
is Ketanji Brown Jackson.  (Applause.)  Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. 
(Applause.)   
   
And because of you, we also led the way to the largest investment in our
nation’s infrastructure in generations.  This year alone, we’re
investing $3.4 billion in Illinois — in the public transit and airports
of Illinois; in roads and bridges like this Cicero Avenue Bridge in
Illinois.   
   
We’re also investing $288 million to replace lead pipes and upgrade
water systems across this country and this — and across the state.  
(Applause.)  
   
We know that Chicago is a city of neighborhoods, each of them unique. 
And our administration wants to see all of them thrive.  From Austin to
Chapman, from Little Village to Lake View, our investments will benefit
neighborhoods across Chicago.  
   
So, Illinois, we have delivered all of this.  And do note, in the
process, we did not raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a
year.  (Applause.)   
   
We delivered all of this, and we reduced our national deficit. 
(Applause.)  And, you know, the interesting point on that is: I’m sure
over the years you’ve followed how Republican Party leaders, they will
talk about fiscal responsibility.  Well, Democratic leaders know how to
be fiscally responsible.  (Applause.)  
   
So this year, the election is so important and the stakes could not be
higher.  And I know we say that every election cycle, and it is true. 
But what is at stake this year in these midterms is so apparent.  And I
do believe that when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight
for.   
   
So think about it: Right now, extremist, so-called leaders trumpet the
rhetoric of freedom while they take away freedoms. The United States
Supreme Court just took away a recognized constitutional right from the
people of America, from the women of America.   
   
And now, so-called leaders — extremist so-called leaders are passing
laws to criminalize healthcare providers and punish women around our
nation.  They are calling for a nationwide abortion ban that would
include Illinois.  
   
AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  They believe that government should be making
decisions for the women of America — personal decisions, decisions about
heart and home.  They believe the government should make decisions for
women about their own bodies.  Well, we do not.  We trust women! 
(Applause.)  
   
And an important point needs to be made: You do not have to abandon your
faith or your beliefs to agree the government should not be making
decisions for her.  (Applause.)  
   
There are extremist so-called leaders who claim we should return this
issue to the states.  
   
Now, check this out.  Remember, when the Dobbs decision came down?  They
said, “Oh, let’s return it to the states.”  But watch.  Because some of
the same people who were saying that are passing laws, making it more
difficult for people in those states to vote — laws that limit drop
boxes and restrict early voting, laws that make it illegal to give food
and water to people who’ve been standing in line for hours. 
Undemocratic laws.  Un-American laws.  
   
And, you know, if you take a look at which states we’re seeing this from
— states that attack the freedom to vote and attack LGBTQ rights and
attack women’s rights to make decisions about their own bodies — well,
you would not be surprised to know that some are doing all three. 
Florida.  Georgia.  And Texas.  
   
AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Those states aren’t lucky enough to have a governor
like J.B. Pritzker.  (Applause.)  And we need more Governor Pritzkers
and to elect more around the country to make sure that we protect these
rights.  But elections matter.  Who is your governor matters.  What is
happening in these other states also matters.   
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  You got it, Kamala!  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  We all matter.  (Laughter and applause.)  We all
matter.   
   
And so, you know — I mean, Governor, you were talking about it — your
opponent.  So I’ve been traveling the country, and I can tell you, from
everything I know about your opponent, he is one of the most extreme
anti-choice candidates in the country.  
   
AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And, you know, as I travel the country, I’ll tell
you another thing.  Folks know that in this election coming up in 53
days, the stakes are so high.  And as it relates to the election, got to
pay attention to everything up and down the ballot.  Up and down the
ballot.  
   
Because when we travel the country and we see what’s going on, doctors
are being criminalized.  What does that mean?  Pay attention to who your
prosecutor is and who you elect for DA and who you elect for state
attorney.  Pay attention to those county prosecutor races. 
(Applause.)  
   
As big lies are being perpetrated, pay attention to the secretary of
state races around the country.  In fact, I’ll tell you, you don’t have
that problem here; you got an incredible candidate.  But in 11 states in
the United States of America — in 11 states, Republican candidates for
secretary of state denied the results of the 2020 election.  
   
AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  So, consider what this means, though.  Consider
what it means.  The very people who don’t trust elections want to be
responsible for running them.  
   
I did an interview earlier, and the journalist asked me, essentially,
does this represent an emergency as it relates to our democracy?  
   
And I think we all know we are witnessing a potential significant crisis
in terms of putting in place office holders who do not agree with the
fundamental principles behind the Constitution of the United States and
our democracy, which includes fighting for fair and free elections.  
   
And then let’s pay attention to what’s happening in Washington, D.C.  We
need to and we will hold on to the United States House of
Representatives and expand our majority in the United States Senate. 
(Applause.)  
   
So let me lay out — let me lay out two very real scenarios for you in
that regard.  
   
First, imagine it’s a — it’s something we don’t want to imagine, but
imagine that we lose our majorities in Congress.  Okay?  I’ll remind you
that when the United States Supreme Court decided Dobbs, Republican
Party leaders started by saying “let the states decide,” but then just
this week introduced a nationwide ban on abortion.  Not — not — not
states.  Now they’re talking just in 12 weeks — the Dobbs decision was
just 12 weeks ago.  Now they’re talking about nationwide.  Okay?  So
they’re already moving the goalpost.  Check that out.  Watch what’s
happening.  They’re already moving the goalpost.  
   
So what’s next?  Well, Justice Clarence Thomas said the quiet part out
loud.  In the Dobbs decision, his piece of it  
was to say, basically, marriage equality is on the line, contraception
is on the line.  
   
So see what is happening and what is at play here.  See it clearly. 
We’ve got to hold on to our numbers in the House and the Senate, because
without Democratic majorities in Congress,  
the writing on the wall seems to be pretty clear about what other rights
they’ll also come after.   
   
Fifty-three days.   
   
Now imagine a better scenario.  Imagine what we can do if we defend the
five seats we need to hold on to our majority in the House of
Representatives.  Imagine that.  (Applause.)   
   
Imagine what we can do if we protect or better yet expand our majority
in the Senate.  Imagine.  We can then fight for every worker to have
paid family leave.  (Applause.)  We can fight for every family to have
affordable childcare.  (Applause.)  We can fight for a ban on assault
weapons finally.  (Applause.)   
   
So we still have work to do, these next 53 days, to see all of that
through.   
   
And we just need two more seats in the Senate.  If we hold on to what
we’ve got and get two more Democrats into the United States Senate, we
can codify — which means put into law — the protections of Roe v. Wade. 
Two more seats.  (Applause.)  
   
With two more seats in the United States Senate, we can pass the John
Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.  (Applause.)  Two
more Senate seats — just two more seats.   
   
So our job is clear.  And President Biden has been clear.  He said he’s
not going to allow archaic Senate rules to stand in the way of
protecting these two freedoms.  So that’s the job before us.   
   
You know, as Vice President, I’ll tell you, I’m also the President of
the Senate.  And — (applause) — and so for all the historians in here
and the history buffs — you might know this already — but our first year
in office for me as Vice President: I actually broke John Adams’s record
of casting the most tie-breaking votes in a single term.  (Applause.) 
How about that?   
   
This kid born in Oakland, California, just hit that record. 
(Applause.)  
   
And I will tell you then, I cannot wait to cast the deciding vote to
break the filibuster on voting rights and reproductive rights. 
(Applause.)  So help me do that.  Help me do that.   
   
So here’s the good news, Illinois: We have momentum on our side.  I know
you all have been tracking what’s going around around the country.  So,
momentum.  
   
Look, for example, at what just happened in Kansas.  (Applause.) 
Right?  The people there joined together and prede- — protected
reproductive rights in their state.  They said, “We’re not having
that.”  We know that we stand with the majority of Americans in saying
we need to stand up for that basic fundamental right.   
   
Look what happened in New York’s Hudson Valley.  So in that race — it
was a House race — pundits predicted — until the last hours, they
predicted — there was no question, there was going to be a Republican
victory.  But the people there elected a Democrat to Congress. 
Right?   
   
And look at what happened in Alaska.  (Applause.)  Mary Peltola is now a
member of the United States House of Representatives and the first
Native Alaskan to hold that seat.  (Applause.)    
   
And it’s the first time — momentum — it’s the first time a Democrat has
won that seat in 50 years.  (Applause.)  Momentum.   
   
So, from now until November 8th, it is up to all of us to build on the
momentum.  And over these next 53 days, let us say, if you believe in
the promise of America, if you believe in freedom, equality, justice,
then vote for Democrats.  (Applause.)  
   
If you believe we are stronger when we stand together than when we pull
apart, vote for Democrats.  (Applause.)  
   
If you believe women’s rights are fundamental to America, that immigrant
justice is fundamental to America, that LGBTQ rights are fundamental to
America, vote for Democrats.  (Applause.)  
   
And in this union town, if you believe workers’ rights are fundamental
to America, vote for Democrats.  (Applause.)  
   
If you believe responsible policing makes America safer, vote for
Democrats.  (Applause.)  
   
If you believe investments in small businesses make America more
prosperous, vote for Democrats.  (Applause.)  
   
If you want to expand opportunity and rights for every American, who do
you vote for?  
   
AUDIENCE:  Democrats!  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  So I’ll close by just saying this — it’s
something I quote a lot of time and I paraphrase, but it’s the — it’s
the admonition given to us by Coretta Scott King.  I talked about it all
the time.  Many of you have heard me speak before and heard me say
this.  But she famously said, “The struggle is a never-ending process
and freedom is never really won.  You earn it and you win it in every
generation.”  
   
So today though, I’m going to add this: You can earn it and you can win
it in every election also.  (Applause.)  
   
So voting in Illinois starts in two weeks, and you can request your
ballot today.  And in 53 days, we will determine our future.  So in
these next 53 days, let’s fight like we know how to do, because when we
fight we win.  (Applause.)   
   
Thank you all.  God bless you.  God bless America.  Thank you. 
(Applause.)  
   
END
