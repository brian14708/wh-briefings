Q    Could I start by asking you: A lot of the families, they want
justice done for the people who were responsible for 9/11.  And some of
them have been sitting in Guantanamo for two decades.  Do you have a
plan to deal with that, sir?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  The families of — the families in Guantanamo?  
   
Q    No, the families of the people who were victims on 9/11.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, there is a plan for that.  
   
Q    So what about — do you know what’s going on in Ukraine right now? 
There’s the reports that Russia is, like, on the run in large parts of
it.  What’s happening?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, I do.  But I’m not going to speak to that now
because things are in process.  
   
Q    Have you spoken with the King?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Not to — no, I — I have spoken to him many times, but I
haven’t spoken to him since he’s become king.  
   
Thank you so much.
