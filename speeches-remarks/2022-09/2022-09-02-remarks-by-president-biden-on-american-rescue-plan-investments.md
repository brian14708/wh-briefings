South Court Auditorium

Eisenhower Executive Office Building

11:23 A.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you all for your patience.   
   
Secretary Raimondo, thank you.  
   
Before we begin, I’d like to speak very briefly about today’s jobs
report that was just been issued.   
   
We received more good news.  In August, the economy created 315,000 new
jobs.  The great American jobs machine continues its comeback.  American
workers are back to work, earning more, manufacturing more, and building
an economy from the bottom up and the middle out.  
   
But with today’s news, we have now created nearly 10 million new jobs
since I took office.  Nearly 10 million jobs — the fastest growth in all
of American history.  
   
In August, we also saw that the share of Americans who are working in
our economy went up.  Economists call that the “labor force
participation rate.”  
   
Working-age women are now, for the first time, back at work at rates not
seen since before the pandemic.  
   
Wages are up.  Unemployment remains near a 50-year low.  And, yesterday,
we got that — we got data that showed that manufacturing orders were up
but cost increases of supply chain items were beginning to ease.   
   
The week before that, we got data showing that price increases may be
beginning to ease as well.  
   
The bottom line is: Jobs are up.  Wages are up.  People are back to
work.  And we are seeing some signs that inflation may be — may be — I’m
not going to overpromise you — may be beginning to ease.  
   
Couple that with the fact that gas prices have now fallen 80 straight
days — the fastest decline in over a decade –  
and the price at the pump is now $1.20 a gallon less than it was the
beginning of summer.  
   
America has some really good news going into Labor Day weekend.  
   
But we’re also seeing something else critical to the backbone of the
American economy: manufacturing.  Manufacturing is roaring back.  
   
Since I took office, the economy has created 668,000 manufacturing jobs
— the strongest manufacturing job recovery since the 1950s.  
   
And just last week, we’ve seen major American companies — from First
Solar to Corning to Micron — announce plans to invest tens of billions
of dollars — tens of billions, that’s not a misstatement — tens of
billions of dollars, expanding manufacturing in America.  
   
We’ve seen major global companies –like Toyota and Honda — announce that
they are choosing America to invest and build.  
   
None of this is happening by accident.  These investments and this
recovery are a direct result of my economic plan.  Some people gave up
on American manufacturing.  Not me.  Not the Secretary.  Not the
American people.  
   
“Make It in America” is no longer just a slogan; it’s a reality in my
administration.   
   
I’m committed to building an economy from the bottom up and the middle
out.  You’ve heard me say that a thousand times.  But that’s what’s
happening.  And that’s what we’re here to talk about today.   
   
Now, a big part of the American Rescue Plan that I signed once I — a
month after we got in office — we were facing a once-in-a-century
pandemic, historic joblessness, businesses struggling to stay open,
remote learning for our children.   
   
But thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we have come a long way. We got
vaccine shots in arms.  We helped people who needed it — it the most. 
We kept teachers in the classrooms, cops on the beat, firefighters on
the job — because the local communities didn’t have the money to pay for
them.  
   
And as a result, COVID no longer controls our lives.  More Americans are
working than ever.  Businesses are growing.  Schools are open.  And
today, we’re celebrating a signature program the American Rescue — of
the American — within the American Rescue Plan that’s going to help
communities that need it most.  
   
Look, it’s called the Build Back Better Regional Challenge.  It’s
centered around a vision that, as our economy recovers and modernizes,
as science and technologies accelerate and change the nature of how we
manufacture, we want workers and small businesses leading this
transition — making sure they’re a part of it, not just being shunted
aside — instead fearing that the transition will be leave them behind. 
We’re going to help them get retrained and many other things.   
   
And thank — think — look, think of the 55-year-old small businessman who
has been making a single screw — this is literally true — for a
combustible engine for cars for decades.  He and his workers are
worried.  Why?  Because we’re moving to high-tech electric vehicles. 
We’re going to help them and their businesses with training and new
technology to help them make parts for electric vehicles and lead the
transition to a clean energy economy so they’re not left behind.  
   
This is about investing in them, believing in them, helping them
transition to a new world.  They can do these jobs, just like they did
the ones they had before.  This is about jobs in their communities for
them — not having to leave or not having to go on unemployment.  
   
As new enterprises are created in the communities, they should have —
they shouldn’t have to leave.  They should be the ones being able to
fill in for those jobs.   
   
So we designed this program by thinking about people and places in a
really important way.  And I know I got all of you up on the screen here
in 21 different communities.   
   
This American Rescue Plan program invests $1 billion — a total of $3
\[billion\] — but $1 billion to create jobs and opportunity for people
in the places where they live and where they’ve worked their entire
careers so they don’t have to leave.  
   
I know when folks hear such big numbers, they don’t think it’s — it’s
for them.  But this is for them.  It is for them.   
   
Over 500 coalitions applied for these grants — from community
organizations to philanthropies, to labor unions, to colleges and
universities — all working together from every part of America.  
   
That kind of interest is a testament to the need and enthusiasm for this
type of investment.  I — it took — I take a look at this as a transition
investment.  
   
I’m so proud to announce 21 awardees, up on the screen here, who will
each receive between $25 million and $65 million jobs to turn their
plans into action.  
   
And as Secretary Raimondo just said — and I guess I wasn’t supposed to
start this off, was I?  Come to think of it.  All of a sudden, it dawned
one me: I was supposed to let her speak first.  (Laughter.)  
   
But estimate these projects are going to result in 100,000 jobs created
or saved, over $7 billion in additional private sector investment in
these 21 communities.  
   
We want you to continue having good jobs in your community so you don’t
have to leave, so your people in your communities are displa- — aren’t
displaced.  
   
The winners are all here up on the screen, and they’re going to empower
communities in Pennsylvania, West Virginia —  
   
Joe, is that you?  Is that Joe Manchin I see?  
   
SENATOR MANCHIN:  I’m right here with you.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Hey, Joe Joe.  Good to see you, man.  Thanks for what
you’re doing.  A matter of a fact, you’re one of the guys that started
this idea with me — what you needed — what you’re talking about needed —
had happened in West Virginia.   
   
But anyway —  
   
SENATOR MANCHIN:  And you kept your promise.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  They’re — they’re going to empower communities in
Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Louisiana to lead our nation’s transition
to clean energy.   
   
They’re going to empower small manufacturers in Michigan, Kansas, North
Carolina, El Paso, Texas — helping them modernize and become part of a
supply chains for cutting-edge technologies, advanced manufacturing,
biotechnology, aerospace.  
   
They’re going to empower agriculture workers in Fresno, California, and
women in St. Louis, Missouri, pursuing manufacturing careers through
quality job training and apprenticeships that lead to good-paying
jobs.  
   
And they are going to support entrepreneurship and small business
creation from Native American communities in Montana and to Tulsa
Greenwood neigh — to Tulsa’s Greenwood neighborhood, once known as the
Black Wall Street, that I visited on the 100th Anniversary of the Tulsa
Race Massacre.  
   
Together, these projects are going to uplift underserved communities and
include them as a key part of America’s economy for the 21st century.  
   
We’re putting people who have been left behind in the past or couldn’t
be — couldn’t have been lifted out of anything before.  They’re going to
be part of this recovery.  They’re going to be the ones who are going to
leading the way here.  They’re going to be the ones getting retrained
for these jobs.    
   
Take the project in Georgia.  I’ve recently signed a number of laws that
is going to bring manufacturing jobs back to America and to make sure
the future is made in America — think of everything from electric
vehicles to semiconductor chips.  
   
Georgia Tech, one of the great research universities, is a leader in
understanding how artificial intelligence can be used to strengthen
almost any industry.  
   
But too many folks, especially small manufacturers in Black communities
or in rural — or rural communities in Georgia, can’t afford access to
the knowledge and research to be able to capture these jobs, to be
trained for them.  
   
They can’t take advantage of all that technology that can make them —
for them, all the difference between their businesses closing and
thriving.  So, Georgia Tech partnered with HBCUs and — like Spelman
College and Fort Valley State, and local community colleges.  
   
With this grant, they’re going to take this technology on the road with
a mobile training studios.  That’s basically a high-tech van that’s
going to travel into underserved areas across Georgia to train a whole
new generation of workers.  
   
Technology experts will provide workers who are interested in four- to
six-week hands-on training that can make all the difference in their
employment.  
   
Think of a poultry farmer who might never have had a chance to learn how
to artificial — how artificial technology can help manage inventory or
improve safety and quality while increasing their productivity.  
   
Think of a family-owned paper manufacturer that could never have
afforded trying out cutting-edge technologies, but now they’re going to
be able to.  
   
And they’re going to be able to grow their businesses.  And they can do
it without ever leaving their home or their families.  This is a
gamechanger.  
   
Take the projections — the project in Manchester, New Hampshire.  And
I’d tell you what: I heard so much from the — from the delegation in New
Hampshire — from Maggie Hassan — anyway.  I won’t get into it.  But they
— this has been one of the things they’ve been pushing for a long time —
both senators and the congressman.    
   
Their goal is nothing short of becoming a global epicenter for the next
generation of advanced medicine.  But to do it, they need world-class
labs for clinical trials that will attract the most innovative
bio-medicine companies in the — to locate and create jobs in New
Hampshire.  
   
I have to say that Senator Hassan and Shaheen, and Congressman Pappas: I
hear you.  I hear you.  I hear you.  I know you’ve been talking about
this a long time.  We’ve finally gotten it.   
   
And they’re going to need to bring struggling communities along in the
process.  
   
Because of this grant, Manchester is going to revitalize what was once
one of the largest cotton textile plants in the world.  
   
Right now, 100,000-square-foot mill building is empty and idle, but not
for long.  Because of this grant, a coalition of city leaders and
research and community organizations is going to transform that old mill
into a modern marvel.  It’s going to house advanced science labs that
are going to conduct groundbreaking clinical trials.  
   
It’s going to be the place where they can test biotechnologies and test
— and treatments that are going to save lives.  And the governor — the
Republican governor is working on it — going to be there as well.   
   
For workers, small businesses, entrepreneurs in the Man- — in the
Manchester area, it means opportunity.  It means jobs you can raise your
family on in Manchester — not have to move.  
   
Because of this American Rescue Plan grant, they’re going to be able to
have access to cutting-edge technology and labs they never could have
afforded before.  This is going to allow them to compete with anyone
anywhere in the world, and make sure the supply-chain for these new
medicines advances — the medical advances are built right here in
America.  It matters.   
   
As you probably know, I could go on and on and speak about each of your
communities here, but time won’t permit.   
   
I applaud every community that received the grant and that applied. 
You’re the reason why I’m so optimistic for the future of our country. 
I mean it.   
   
You’ve heard me say it many times before.  America is the only nation in
the world that can be defined by a single word: possibilities.  There’s
nothing but possibilities here.  That’s what this is about.  
   
I want to thank you.  And now I’m — so I’m going to do what I should
have done to begin with: Turn it over to the Secretary to begin this. 
But we’ve already gone by it.  
   
So, Madam Secretary, the floor is yours.  
   
SECRETARY RAIMONDO:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I think the fact that
the President jumped in there right away is a testament to how excited
he is about this project.  He’s fired up, and he’s committed to it.  And
that’s because he knows — he knows that we have to be investing in every
community in America to help with the transition.  
   
So, let me fill in a few of the blanks about how this program is going
to work, and then we’re going to have a discussion with a handful of the
21 awardees.   
   
First of all, congratulations.  If you are one of the 21 here, you are
the cream of the crop.  Your applications were fantastic.  And
congratulations to each and every one of you.   
   
The President and I are so proud of you and just thrilled to be able to
work with you.   
   
I have to thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership.  Everybody
should know that this was the President’s idea.   
   
I mean, as he said, the American Rescue Plan was passed 17 months ago. 
Three billion dollars of that came to the Commerce Department to do
economic development.  And we decided to put $1 billion into this Build
Back Better Regional Challenge, and it’s because the President directed
me to make investments in communities to help communities revitalize
themselves and get ready for the transitions in our economy.  Because he
fundamentally said, “People want to work where they live, and they ought
to be able to do that.”  And so, that’s what this is all about.

We believe every single American, no matter where you live, ought to
have an opportunity to have a high-paying, family-supporting job in that
community.  And that’s what this is all about.

So, let me fill in some of the blanks about the approach.  It’s a novel
approach.  This is the first time ever the Department of Commerce has
made such sizable investments in individual communities.

When we started, to be very honest, we weren’t sure — we weren’t sure if
communities would apply and bring together coalitions and have the
capacity to invest tens of millions of dollars.

Well, we got 529 submissions.  We went from 529 down to 60 finalists. 
And then from those 60 finalists, we worked to get to the 21 who are
with us today.  So, again, the fact that you are among the 21 — hats off
to each and every one of you.

Here’s what makes this interesting: Everyone on this screen, of the 21,
will be receiving between $25 million and $65 million to address
regional economic challenges and to invest in revitalizing the economies
of these communities.

So, that’s a lot of cheese, folks, to make big investments and
revitalize your communities.  This was all bottoms up.   
   
We went to the community and said, “You tell us how to revitalize your
community.  And you bring the community together — public sector,
private sector, universities, philanthropy.  Get your community together
and tell us what you need to invest.

The — so, as a result, this federal funding will be matched by more than
$300 million of local investment and will leverage support from over 450
private sector and 27 labor unions or worker organizations.  We estimate
that, together, this whole initiative will create or save over 100,000
jobs and over $7 billion of additional private investment will be
catalyzed through the — each coalition’s efforts.

And as the President said, this is about growing industries that are
critical to our future — clean energy, biotechnology, advanced
mobility.  And it’s about saying to the small businesses and workers in
these communities: We know the economy is transitioning.  We’re moving
away from fossil fuels to clean energy.  We’re moving towards robotics,
we’re moving towards a more digital economy, a more technical
economy.   
   
And the point of it is: No one will be left behind, because we’re going
to retrain workers, we’re going to retrain small businesses, and we’re
going to light up abandoned buildings that may have once trained coal
miners and today will train solar installers.  Abandoned manufacturing
facilities that may have, you know, once made widgets will be, you know,
lighted up for new advanced manufacturing in solar panels.

And so the important point here, and the President talks to us all the
time about this, is that if you’re out there, you know, in — in Buffalo,
and you drive by, every day, an abandoned industrial building, and you
have a pit in your stomach, wondering, “Is there a place for me in a new
economy?”  Or if you are someone who’s worked for 30 years at one of the
“Big Three” auto companies and you only know how to work on a
traditional auto car and you’re worried do you have the skills to
transition to an electric vehicle economy, what we’re saying to you is:
Yes.  Yes.

Because we’re going to retrain you.  We’re going to retrofit small
businesses.  We’re going to do solar installations at industrial scale
over abandoned coal mines.  And we’re going to make sure that as we
transition, everyone is included and trained, and these small businesses
are able to do this.

I’ll just end with a personal story, which I told to the President. 
When we were designing this program, I had my father in mind.  My fath-
— once upon a time, Rhode Island, where I’m from, was the jewelry
manufacturing capital of the world. 

Everywhere you looked, jewelry manufacturing — low skill, but it was a
good job.  My dad had one of those jobs at Bulova Watch until he was 56
years old and his job and all the other jobs went to China.  And he
would so often say to us, “Gina, we were just left behind.  We weren’t
retrained.”  He wanted to work.  He could work.  And he said, “Our
leaders left us behind.”

So, what this is about is President Biden is committed to folks who have
that anxiety, who’ve worked in old-line manufacturing, who’ve worked in
the coal industry, who’ve worked in, you know, traditional combustion
engine vehicles, and they’re feeling anxious.  And we’re saying, “We are
going to be there for you to make sure you’re not left behind or left
out, and we’re going to make investments in your community so you can
work in the community where you and your family live.”   
   
So we’re excited and, quite honestly, I’m just very lucky that I get to
work for a boss who gets this, because he gets it.  And every time we
brief him, he says, “Secretary, don’t tell me how much money we’re
spending.  Tell me what are we doing for the people of America.”  And
that’s why this is so exciting.   
   
So, with that, we want to hear from you.   
   
Now, as the President said, if we had the time, we’d like to hear from
every single one of you because these — every one of you has put
together a phenomenal application.  But we don’t have the time, so we’re
just going to hear from a couple of you and hope to have a free-flowing
discussion.   
   
And I want to begin by calling on the Detroit Regional Partnership
foundation.  Congratulations, you all are receiving $52.2 million, which
is incredible.  We’d like to hear from you.  And I’d like to call on
Maureen.   
   
Just tell us a little bit about how are you going to invest the $52
million.  What’s — what are the projects you’re doing?  And what does
this mean for the small businesses in the supply chain in Detroit’s auto
manufacturing industry?  
   
MS. KRAUSS:  Good morning.  Thank you, Madam Secretary.  And good
morning, Mr. President.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.   
   
MS. KRAUSS:  We are thrilled to join you here today from Detroit, the
global epicenter of mobility.   
   
I want to introduce two of our partners who are with me today: Quentin
Messer, Jr., who is the CEO of the Michigan Economic Development
Corporation; Ned Staebler, who is the CEO of TechTown Detroit.   
   
In addition, we have a large group of over 140 partners who are joining
us virtually and who worked together for the successful application.   
   
We’re honored that the EDA has recognized that Detroit — the Detroit
region is leading the transformation from internal combustion engine to
electric vehicle.  The global epicenter of mobility — or GEM — is
Detroit’s answer to the Build Back Better Regional Challenge.  Through
an inclusive and equitable lens, GEM will help the Detroit region
redefine every aspect of mobility, from the cutting-edge technology that
most people in goods, to creating new quality jobs and readying new
sites for business.  We are building an inclusive, prosperous 21st
century with your help.  
   
GEM’s vision is to accelerate economic growth by building on the
region’s unrivaled mobility assets.  It will create a smart, secure,
sustainable, and inclusive advanced mobility industry, starting with the
transition to next generation electric, autonomous, and fully-connected
vehicles.  
   
This grant will fund six unique projects that will help the region and
country maintain its global automotive leadership.  
   
GEM will support workers, startup businesses, and small-to-medium-sized
companies as they adapt to a new, high-tech advanced mobility
industry.   
   
Led by one of the most diverse regions in the United States, GEM offers
the opportunity to create a national model for equitable — equitable
economic growth.  We are ready to help secure the nation’s advanced
mobility leadership for generations to come.  
   
Thank you again.  We welcome any questions.  And we also want to invite
you, Mr. President and Madam Secretary, in two weeks to join us in
Detroit at the North American International Auto Show where we can show
you in person how we are leading the way.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’ll be there.  
   
MS. KRAUSS:  Awesome.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m a car guy.  (Laughs.)  As you kind of noticed.  
   
Hey, look, I drive the Cabinet crazy and my staff crazy by asking them
to give concrete examples that, if you walked up to somebody on the
corner and said it, they could completely understand it.  
   
One of the things that I — and this is pure Biden — I believe, and I’ve
been saying for some time, that the next 10 to 15 years, more is going
to change, in terms of technology and innovation, than has happened in
the last 75 years.  I mean that sincerely.  Things are going to change
so rapidly.   
   
That’s good if we’re going to compete in the world, but also is scary as
hell for somebody who — like, we were talking on the way over to this
building about how there’s hundreds of small companies supplying small
parts to internal combustion engines.  And you were — you were giving me
an example, Madam Secretary, of a bolt —  
   
SECRETARY RAIMONDO:  A bolt.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  — one company provides that is not going to be useful in
a — in an electric vehicle.  And so, what we’re going to do is train
that — that company and the ownership of that company what parts they
can contribute to to make that vehicle.  
   
I’ll give you a concrete example.  Remember, when we were having the
great difficulty — we still have some difficulty in the supply chain of
items coming from Asia — and the shipping, the vast majority of it comes
through the ports in San Diego and — and Los Angeles and those ports. 
And the ports were asking for help all across the country for new
technologies, new cranes, new movements, more robotics.  
   
I said, “Okay, we’ll do it on one condition — that the people you have
on the job now at the port are the people you train.  You give them the
opportunity to man the new machinery.” Not a joke.  
   
And one of the things I think this is — was so important about what
we’re all talking about — all of you are talking about is — think of all
the people who’ve been breaking their neck and doing well, doing things
that really matter, who are going to become — what they’re doing is
become — is going to become obsolete because of how things are changing,
whether it’s a transition in the climate environment or whether it’s
cla- — manufacturing or medicine, whatever it is.  
   
And so, when you say you’re going to provide — we’re going to provide
in-depth assessment — assessment and assistance to 65 firms through a
supply chain transformation center, that can sound pretty abstract to a
lot of people.  Give me an example of what you really mean — what this
will really mean for a company and its workers in this supply chain
trans- — transformation center.  What are you talking about?  
   
MS. KRAUSS:  Absolutely, Mr. President, as you know, in our region,
because you were very important here a few years ago in helping us make
a transformation, we need to do it again.  We have a terrific, talented
workforce and supply chain.  But we need to give them the skills that
they need and the tools that they need.  
   
So, one example is a company in a community in the Detroit region called
Oxford.  It’s Barron Industries.  They’re a casting company, but they
need help in making sure that they can produce the right parts with the
right technology at the right speed with the right talent.  So they have
been receiving assistance on marketing, on cybersecurity, on production
techniques so that they can make the transition as rapidly as the OEMs
are making it and they can stay an important part of that supply chain.

That also includes making sure that their employees have the skillsets —
the upskilling that they need —  so that they can be successful and, as
you say, included and staying here in our region to do those jobs.

SECRETARY RAIMONDO:  Mr. President, one of the things I love about what
Maureen and her team is doing is that so often, we focus on the “Big
Three” automakers, which is important, you know, for all the obvious
reasons.  But what they’re doing is focused on the whole network of
small suppliers — you know, the hundreds, if not thousands, of small
family-owned suppliers to the “Big Three” and making sure that, as
Maureen said, they have the new materials, the new technology, the new
training so that they can continue to service as we move towards EVs.

And so I give you a lot of credit for getting into the supply chain.

THE PRESIDENT:  The last thing I’ll say — I could talk about this for a
long time, but — (laughs) — going through two of the major American
automobile plants for a long time, for an extended period of time, there
was a lot of concern by the UAW about robotics and — and how that was
going to displace workers when, in fact, being able to teach those folks
how to use those robots, it increased productivity and doesn’t displace
them is what’s really happening.

And so it’s all about — you can maintain the workforce, you can maintain
the — increase the productivity, remain competitive internationally, and
still get a lot done.

But at any rate, I — I — maybe with a — as my grandfather used to say,
“With the grace of God, the goodwill of neighbors,” I’ll see you at the
auto show.

MS. KRAUSS:  We welcome you.  Absolutely.

THE PRESIDENT:  All right.  Well —

SECRETARY RAIMONDO:  So, the mention of robotics is a perfect segue. 
I’d love to turn it over to Stefani from the Southwestern Pennsylvania
New Economy Coalition.  You all will be receiving $62.7 million.  I’d
love to hear Stefani talk a little bit more about that.

To put this in perspective and to pick up on the point you just made,
Mr. President, about robotics, Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh
is, we all know, a world leader in robotics.  And a lot of jobs have
been created right around CMU. 

But if you’re living in a coal community or a rural community outside of
Pittsburgh, you might wonder, “How do I fit in?  How do I get a job, you
know, with robotics and…”

THE PRESIDENT:  You go to the county executive, that’s what you do.

SECRETARY RAIMONDO:  Exactly.  (Laughter.)  That’s why he’s part of it.

So, that — so, that’s what these guys are doing.  So, we’ll turn it over
to Stefani and the team, and maybe tell us a little bit about what
you’re doing.

MS. PASHMAN:  Sure.  Thank you, Madam Secretary.  And yes, Mr.
President, I am joined today by several of your friends — the county
executive, Rich Fitzgerald; president of Carnegie Mellon University,
Farnam Jahanian; and my colleague and the chief equity officer on the
project, Majestic Lane.

And what I want to start off by saying is thank you for your vision. 
And thank you very much, Madam Secretary, to your incredible team and
for you in making that a reality.

What we have loved, in some ways, most about this project is that we get
to do what we do best in Pittsburgh, which is collaborate and bring
together what — we had 200 partners — in which (inaudible) in Pittsburgh
to make words into action to deliver on your vision.

And so, through this amazing challenge, we are able to do exactly what
you said, which is to look at those 3,000 manufacturers that are in
counties like Indiana and Fayette and Greene and Washington and marry
them with the over 100 robotics companies that birthed from Carnegie
Mellon University and many of our other folks — to actually put them
together to create the jobs and the technologies and the companies of
the future.

And we’re doing that in a way that is building programs for people. 
This is about people first: 14,000 workers, 750 companies that will fuel
an entire new economy for us that we think won’t just be about
Southwestern PA and not just the United States, but globally to redefine
how we do business and how we keep jobs at home in our communities, as
you so well described.

SECRETARY RAIMONDO:  Thank you.  One of the things I love about this is
— a lot of people when they hear “robotics” or they hear “autonomous
technologies,” they hear, “I’m about to lose my job.”  And so, what
Stephanie and the team are doing is saying quite the opposite.  This is
going to create job opportunities for you, including in your rural
community, not just in the neighborhood of CMU.

MS. PASHMAN:  Yeah, I so appreciate that question, Madam Secretary,
because as you can imagine, as the birthplace and the leader in
robotics, this is a question we tackle and think about extensively.

And I can start by telling you the data, which is we know that for every
one job that may be displaced with robotics technology in a company,
it’s creating at least 1.5 and sometimes more.

But what’s even more important and that we understand is for the
companies that are actually growing and scaling in our midst — those 100
companies I talked about — many of them have upwards of 1,000 employees
right now.  And those are middle-skill jobs.  Those are jobs where
people are tinkering and building sensors and using the skills that you
described, like your father had.  And that’s exactly what we’re trying
to do here today.  And we’re doing it across industries like energy,
like agriculture, like healthcare.

This is an incredible broad-based opportunity.  And what we even know
more as we talk to those workers: They are more fulfilled.  They are
actually enjoying their ability to use their creative skills, to
customize sensors, to repair robots, to work in partnership with
entrepreneurs in creating those actual technologies.

It’s a more fulfilling job.  It’s a higher-wage job.  It keeps them in
communities.  And it actually allows them to have family-sustaining jobs
where they were born and where they want to stay.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Mr. President, at Carnegie Mellon — I had the honor of
you showing me around Carnegie Mellon — it’s a great university for
real; I’m not being solicitous.  Are you working with smaller outfits,
like the community colleges in the region?  And talk to me about the —
the sort of coordination between a great national university like yours
and a community college in your community.

MR. JAHANIAN:  First of all, Mr. President, thank you very much for your
leadership.  It’s good to be with you.

There are two aspects of it that I want to highlight.  On one hand, what
we’re trying to do is to bring robotics and automation to small- and
medium-sized enterprises.

As you alluded to, the digital transformation is taking place, and it’s
really having a ripple effect across so many sectors of our economy.  So
we’re bringing those technologies and know-how to agriculture, to
construction, to energy, to healthcare, to manufacturing, mining, and
transportation.

So that element — bringing those skills and technologies to small and
medium enterprises to make them more competitive is extremely
important.  It’s extremely important for the nation because we live in a
global world.  So that’s one element of it.  

The second element that — that you alluded to has to do with upskilling
and reskilling the workforce.  And in this case, we’re working with
community colleges, we’re working on curriculum development, we’re
working on various ways that we can bring along the workers and retrain
them and upskill them to be ready for these new jobs that are going to
be created.

It’s extremely important to recognize that as we adapt these new
technologies in smaller and medium enterprises, we have the workforce
that’s going to be ready to take those jobs. 

So, the coordination with community colleges, with labor unions,
especially in our poor, urban areas, and, as Madam Secretary alluded to,
the 11 counties that surround us is part of our mission and what we’re
committed to.  Thank you again for the opportunity.

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, let me ask you: How is this going to play out on
the political scene?  As a county executive, what are you going to be
able to tell folks about what’s happening with this $62 billion —
million dollars?

MR. FITZGERALD:  Well, thank you, Mr. President.  What we can tell
people is: President Biden continues to invest in people and in jobs and
in our future.

First of all, congratulations on another great jobs report.  I mean, we
shouldn’t just go over that real quickly.  Ten million jobs in your —
your year-and-a-half tenure is really unbelievable.  And a lot of them
have been created right here in Southwestern Pennsylvania.

And as Stefani and President Jahanian have mentioned, it’s not just for
the — for the robotics software engineer in Pittsburgh, it is for the
small town in Westmoreland County and in Beaver County, the
manufacturing facilities that are transitioning and the type of training
that can happen throughout our community college but for families.

And I know you’ve talked about this all the time, and it’s so important:
It’s about hope and for the future, for the next generation who are out
there wondering what’s going to happen.  You mentioned the displacement
that’s going to — you know, could happen and the changes over the next
10 to 15 years.  This doesn’t leave people behind.  And we appreciate
that very, very much.

And by the way, we’re looking forward to seeing you on Monday on Labor
Day.  You’re always here with us, and we’re looking forward to it. 
We’re guaranteeing good weather, Mr.  President.  (Laughter.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  All right.  (Laughs.)

    All right.  Sir, do you have anything you’d like to add about what’s
going on in the community?  
   
MR. LANE:  Well, sure.  I think what’s important about this is, you
know, as you spoke to, Mr. President, often people think that robotics
and AI are leaving people behind.  But we’re being really intentional,
both demographically within our communities – people of color and women
— and also in our rural communities about how do we connect people to
inclusive career pathways but also actually connecting them up to
business development opportunities in the robotics and AI industry,
which traditionally, they may not have had access to.

So, what we’re really doing is being intentional about figuring out how
do we make these connections and really making this an economy for all.

So, thank you, Mr. President.

THE PRESIDENT:  You know, one of the things, if I may —  
having been a significant consumer of healthcare and having family
members who needed serious healthcare, one of the things that I think,
in the healthcare side, most docs will tell you that when people get a
diagnosis that is very dire, they need really a navigator.  They need
someone to help them know when to go to what appointment, what the
appointments are for, how to — what — just explain what’s going on.  
   
It seems to me, we need some navigators here.  And I’m wondering how
you’re doing that.  I mean, you had someone — let’s say, there’s someone
— we were doing this on a local Pittsburgh television station and
someone listening is saying, “Well, I’d like to — I’d like to get
trained.  I’d like…”  
   
I mean, how — how are you reaching out to the community?  And do we
have, essentially, whether — whatever they want to call them —
“navigators” to say, “Look, here’s the way you can get into this.  This
is what you do.”  Or are people going into those — those small
businesses that are going to be eventually displaced because of
technology — it’s going to be surpassed, and say, “This is what you…”  
   
I mean, is there — is there thought about that?  
   
MS. PASHMAN:  Absolutely, Mr. President.  Thank you for that question. 
And that really is the spirit of — as I was talking about earlier — our
project and the way our partners are coming together.   
   
So we have five projects that are woven together, each with incredible
organizations that know how to actually be on the ground.  Most of our
money is actually going out to neighborhoods and communities, so they
can actually use the organizations that know their people, that know
where the businesses are, that know where those individuals are that
have to get into the jobs, where those people are that are ready for
entrepreneurial opportunities.   
   
So, for example, it starts with our manufacturing extension
partnership.  They know where those manufacturers are, and they
understand their readiness to adopt technologies.  They will come
together in a manufacturing hub with entrepreneurs who can help de-risk
the prototyping and creation of products that can actually be
deployed.   
   
We also have our lead accelerator entity in the region that’s creating a
new model of startup factory with anchor makerspaces throughout the
communities where we can identify opportunities to create new
technologies that will be deployed into those companies.   
   
And taken all together, our workforce ecosystem, as Dr.  Jahanian
described, will actually be connected by a web of workforce boards and
other community organizations, including labor unions and other, at the
neighborhood level who can then bring those curriculum partnerships —
the workers — to the table for those jobs.   
   
So we’re really relying on, as I said, 200 entities and partners who
know how to navigate and know where businesses are and know where the
people are to make sure we have a marriage and an alignment that can
propel this opportunity,  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  One of the things I’ve raised — and I’ve not raised with
the Secretary but I’ve raised you guys and everyone who is part of this
grant effort: I think it’s useful — think — think about it — 25 years
ago, 30 years ago, almost every high school had shop classes, where you
learned how to work with your hands, where you learned — you could go
and get — take carpentry or automobile.  And you know, just — just to
get a sense.   
   
I really think we should be talking — and I don’t have a program, so —
but I think we should be talking about — a little bit about how we let
high school students know how things are changing and what may be
available down the road.  
   
And I know we’re supposed to — I’m — I know I’m taking this longer than
I should.  But a guy who has been talking about transition for a long
time with me has been Joe Manchin.  He’s — he lives, breathes, and eats
West Virginia.   
   
But, Joe, what’s — how — how is this going to help — if it is — the West
Virginia transition to a strengthened — not totally new, but a new
economy?  
   
SENATOR MANCHIN:  Yeah, well, Mr. President, you and I have spoken many
times about this when you first came into office, even when you — was
running at that time, about how West Virginians felt they were left
behind.   
   
My wonderful state and all the great workers and the people in my state
that worked hard and they’re very proud, they’ve done the heavy lifting
for years and years and years.  And basically, they never complained. 
And as things started changing and transitioning, there was nothing left
for them.   
   
Twenty-one of our most effective counties are in southern West
Virginia.  This is based around that, and it’s — it’s pumping into an
area which is — we call “the Appalachian Climate Technology,” or the ACT
Now Coalition, which is led by Brandon Dennison.  Brandon is here with
us, and he’s done a tremendous job with his team and the Coalfield
Development Corporation.  
   
It’s basically reinventing — not just reinventing, but basically being
able to meet the needs of the public as we transition to making sure
that we can provide the services.  That’s what they’ve been doing for
quite some time.  
   
And this — this announcement here and this Rescue Plan — the American
Rescue Plan continues to play benefits for West Virginia.  But, you
know, also, your co-chair of Appalachian Regional Commission, Gayle
Manchin, who I know very well — (laughter) — is very, very proud that
Appalachia has gotten so much consideration and assistance.   
   
And you’re the first person, Mr. President — and with your most capable
Secretary and our dear friend Gina Raimondo — directing it to the people
that need it the most.  I think that’s what we’re here to say is thank
you.  These 21 counties have great regional projects.  
   
I have with us here on the panel — I have my dear friend, Amy Goodwin,
the chairman — she’s the mayor of Charleston.  I have Steve Williams, a
fellow colleague of mine; and he is the mayor of Huntington.  Our two
largest cities.   
   
And we have with us also Stephanie Tyree.  She’s the West Virginian Hub
director that works directly with these projects.  
   
They can explain in detail what this is going to allow us to do.  And
we’ve gotten this $62.8 million — one of the top awards, and we’re so
proud of that — but the need is there.  And I can guarantee you, the
investments will be made.  
   
You and I have spoken many times about: You can spend money or you can
invest money.  And we’re going to give you a return on this.  We’re
going to give the taxpayers of the United States a return on their
investment in West Virginia.  That’s what this is about.  
   
And a reward based to the people who have done the heavy lifting to
allow them to continue to transition.  Now with our — our Inflation
Reduction Act, Mr. President, this leads — segues right into that
because now it’s going to allow them to start focusing on a new — a
complete new way of delivering the energy that this country is going to
need.  
   
Coal — all — we talked about all the cars.  And Debbie Stabenow and I
talk about that a lot.  And I said, “Debbie, you wouldn’t have a car if
it wasn’t for the coal and the steel that we produce to send you the
material that you need to make the car.”  So we’re — we’re all hooked to
the hip here.   
   
And as the transition goes on, the investments that are being made — the
48C Tax Credit — is going to put $4 billion on — additionally, back into
coal-hit communities so we can diversify and attract more business
there.   
   
So I just can’t tell you how much this means, Mr.  President.  And I’m
just so proud to be part of this and also so proud of what the ARP has
done — the American Rescue Plan.  And so excited to see what the
Inflation Reduction Act is going to do.   
   
So many people don’t know how much is in there that’s going to trans- —
transition their lives and transfer them into an economy that’s going to
give them an awful lot of stability.  So we’re very proud.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, Joe, thanks.   
   
I’d love to talk to every one of you, but I’m getting the sign here.  I
better cut.  They’re going to —   
   
SENATOR MANCHIN:  I was afraid you were going to get the hook. 
(Laughter.)   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  But — but — but, look —  
   
SECRETARY RAIMONDO:  I was going to say, we could do this all day, but
—  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  The — the point — let me conclude by saying this: This
is not going to waste money, what we’re talking about each of you doing;
it’s going to grow the economies.  It’s going to keep us in a position
where we are the most advanced economy in the world and where we bring
along the people who have made this country.  
   
You know, I joke — and I don’t want to — I shouldn’t get political, but
— let me put it this way: The people who built the country are
hardworking people who work with the sweat of their brow and their
hands.  And — and they’ve — they’ve — they’re — they’re the ones that
created the middle class.  And I think this going to enable that same
group of people, like most of us were raised by, to be able to have an
opportunity to continue to do well and to take us through this next
phase.   
   
Because, you know, there’s that — I always — Joe and my colleagues in
the Senate used to always kid me for — for quoting Irish poets, but —  
   
”All is changed.  It’s changed utterly: A terrible beauty has been
born,” as the Irish poet said.  And we’ve got to take advantage of it,
and I think we can.  I really, genuinely think we can.   
   
And I look forward to meeting all of you at some point along the way. 
And we’re going to continue to keep this moving because there’s $3
billion total in this, and it’s going to grow the economy.  Everybody is
better off.   
   
When you grow the economy, everybody from the local drugstore to the —
to the local supermarket to the local church — everything grows.  And
that’s what this is about.   
   
Anyway, thank you all.   
   
SECRETARY RAIMONDO:  Thank you, Mr. President.  
   
SENATOR MANCHIN:  If I can say one thing to you, Mr.  President?   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.   
   
SENATOR MANCHIN:  Thank you for not forgetting and not leaving anybody
behind.  I can’t tell you how much this means to our hardworking people
in West Virginia.   
   
And they are truly appreciative — the families are — to be able to stay
where they love and they — and their heritage and their roots are.  So
many of them had to leave.  You’ve given them that opportunity.  And you
didn’t forget, and you kept that promise.  And I appreciate it.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, Joe, remember I’m from hard-coal country:
Scranton.  (Laughter.)  All right?   
   
Okay, anyway, thank you all so very, very much.  And thank you, Madam
Secretary.   
   
SECRETARY RAIMONDO:  Congratulations.  Congratulations, everybody.  And
we’re excited to work with you to make all of this a huge success.   
   
And thank you, Mr. President.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thanks.  All right.  (Applause.)  
   
Q    Mr. President, do you consider — Mr. President, do you consider all
Trump supporters to be a threat to the country?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Come on.  Look, guys.   
   
Q    Just, Mr. —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  You keep trying to make that case.  I don’t consider any
Trump supporter a threat to the country.   
   
I do think anyone who calls for the use of violence, fails to condemn
violence when it’s used, refuses to acknowledge when an election has
been won, insists upon changing the way in which the rules — you count
votes — that is a threat to democracy.  Democracy.  
   
And everything we stand for — everything we stand for rests on the
platform of democracy.   
   
When people voted for Donald Trump and support him now, they weren’t
voting for attacking the Capitol.  They weren’t voting for overruling an
election.  They were voting for a philosophy he put forward.   
   
So I am not talking about anything other than: It is inappropriate — and
it’s not only happening here, but other parts of the world — where
there’s a failure to recognize and condemn violence whenever it’s used
for political purposes, failure to condemn the — the — an attempt to
manipulate electoral outcomes, a failure to acknowledge when elections
were won or lost.  
   
Thank you.
