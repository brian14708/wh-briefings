Private Residence  
Washington, D.C.  
   
(September 28, 2022)

6:46 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  First of all, let me start by saying a few things about
the hurricane, because there’s lots going on.  
   
I — we have been completely responsive to the governor of Florida —
everything he’s needed and asked for.  And it’s a lot, but I don’t think
we’re going to know the consequence of this hurricane until tomorrow
afternoon, because we have to figure out — first of all, it hadn’t
finished going through, number one.  But number two, we’re also not in a
situation where we know what — most of the damage and most of the people
who get hurt are in the aftermath.  And so there’s a lot going on.   
   
We’ve sent an awful lot of people, as we pointed out.  We’ve given them
the governor every single thing he’s asked for in terms of emergency
response.  And we’re — I’m going to be meeting tomorrow, early
afternoon, with — at the FEMA headquarters with all our folks and doing
whatever the people of Florida need, because this is — it may turn out
to be the most consequential hurricane they’ve had in a long, long
time.  Some are saying ever, but I don’t know; I can’t speak to that. 
But I know there’s a lot going on.   
   
And — and I want to thank, you know, all of the first responders. 
There’s an awful lot of folks who are putting their lives on the line
out there for these folks.  An awful lot of them.  And they’re not just
in FEMA — National Guard, a whole range of folks.   
   
So I just think it’s important we — we make sure that we do all that we
can.  And I assure you that we’re going to do that as a federal
government.  
   
And look, you know, the gov has heard me say before that I really do
believe that we’re at an inflection point in history here.  It occurs —
and I mean this sincerely, from the bottom my heart.  When I ran — I
wasn’t going to run for the presidency of United States again, and I
mean that sincerely.  I was a professor at the University of
Pennsylvania, and my son was — had just died.  And I didn’t have any
interest at all until I saw those folks coming out of the fields in
Charlottesville, Virginia, carrying torches, singing Nazi songs,
reciting the same bitter, vile stuff that they — as they carried Nazi
flags, accompanied by white supremacists.   
   
And when asked what — and, you know, that woman was killed; I spoke to
her mom — asked by the — the last guy was asked, “What do you think?” 
He said, “There are really fine people on both sides.”   
   
Well, folks, you know — and I mean this sincerely; you’re going to think
this is a little out of whack what I’m going to talk about — but, you
know, democracy is at stake.  Literally, there’s a — there’s a case
being made around the world, not just here, because democracy and
autocracy.  And there’s an awful lot of folks who believe that
democracies can’t be sustained in the 21st century because there’s —
problems are so — so much is changing in science and technology, the
environment, a whole range of things, that it’s awful hard to reach a
consensus in the short amount of time you have to reach.  
   
And so that’s why I have these constant arguments.  So I’ve had — I’ve
met with Xi Jinping over 78 hours, 68 of which are in person, over the
last 10 years.  And he makes the case straight up that democracies can’t
be sustained in the 21st century.   
   
You just saw what’s happened in Italy in that election.  You’re seeing
what’s happening around the world.  And the reason I bother to say that
is we can’t be sanguine about what’s happening here either.  I don’t
want to exaggerate it, but I don’t want to understate it.  And it’s the
reason why I’m so concerned about and so interested in and so committed
to seeing that the governors — Democratic governors are elected. 
Because, literally, the outcome of an election is going to be determined
by how well the governors run their states, who’s in charge at the time,
whether or not things are going to be — how we count the votes, whether
or not it’s transparent, and a whole range of things.   
   
And so I think you’re going to see everything in the state legislative
bodies — there’s just a lot at stake.  A lot at stake.   
   
And so I want to thank you all for supporting the governors and the
Democratic governors, the DGA.   
   
And, folks, look, you know, we need to keep control the Congress, to
state the obvious, because if we lose the Congress, we lose the ability
— I’ll be spending more time taking out a veto pen than I will be doing
much else.   
   
But the point is: With a bare majority — with no majority in the United
States Senate — 50/50 — thank God we have a great Vice President who
gets the vote.  Every — I point out to her — every time she votes, she
wins.  (Laughter and applause.)  You know, she’s the only person — the
only person in elective office: Every time she votes, she wins.   
   
But — but all kidding aside, there’s so much at stake.  You know, we
have less than 50 days now, and the stakes are clear.  The right to
choose — literally, the right to choose, personal freedoms.   
   
You know, when we talked about the right to choose and the Dobbs
decision, everybody — a lot of people thought it was just about choice. 
Well, it goes beyond choice.  And they’re making it clear it goes to
contraception, it goes to the ability to who you can marry.  It goes to
a whole range of things that are under attack in many of the states that
are out there now in state legislative bodies.   
   
You know, remember, the Court said that — in the decision that — but
women have a right to vote and change things if they like, as if — like
almost tongue in cheek that — so what are they going to do?  They ain’t
see nothing yet with women voting.  You think I’m kidding.  You all
watch.  Watch what — look what’s happened in Tennessee.  
   
Well, there’s also a fact that what’s on the ballot is it’s going to
affect the ability of folks in your states to do well.  And Social
Security, it’s under direct attack — these guys have made clear.  If
anybody in here had to explain to me what the Republican platform is,
I’d defy you to do it.   
   
And — but guess what?  The person — and that’s — (cellphone rings) — if
that’s Trump calling me again, tell him  
I’m — (laughter) — I’m busy.   
   
But — but look, all kidding aside, you know, one of the things that, you
know, is at stake, they’ve made no bones about it: You have Johnson and
Scott — Scott is heading — Senator Scott is heading up — and it’s going
to affect governors.  Scott is heading up the Republican campaign
committee for the Senate.  He’s made it clear that Social Security and
Medicare should be on the chopping block every five years, that it has
to be reauthorized every five years.  If it’s not, it goes.  
   
And then along comes Johnson from — from the state of — of Wisconsin,
and he’s a senator.  And he’s saying, “No, not every five years, every —
every year.  Every year.”  But he also wants to include veterans’
benefits and a whole range of other issues.   
   
The point is, this is a different breed of cat.  This is not — this is
not your father’s Republican Party.  I’ve been here a long time.  And,
you know, there’s an awful lot of Republicans I admired and disagreed
with completely but worked with all the time — guys like Bob Dole and so
— so many others.   
   
But the point is, this is a different — this is — they’re just
different.  These are MAGA Republicans and a different breed.  And it’s
all about tearing down, not building up.   
   
We also find that, you know, we finally passed — I’m very proud of fact
we got the first major gun violence bill passed and beat the NRA, but it
took 30 years.  And guess what?  They took out assault weapons.  Assault
Weapons are still legal.  People walk around the streets.  Who the hell
needs an assault weapon?  And they’re ni- — they’re — they’re adequately
named.  They’re for killing people in wars.  That’s what they’re about. 
The bullets travel — they’re smaller — they travel five times as fast as
a high-powered weapon, penetrates vests.   
   
I mean, what is — as I pointed out to one person who was a member of the
— anyway.  That he — and he was saying to me, “Well, look, I hunt.”  And
I said, “How many deer are wearing Kevlar vests out there that you
need?”  (Laughter.)   
   
But all kidding aside, think about it.  The idea that — that the — you
know, assault weapons are being sold — and, by the way, it’s not just
these mass shootings.  And I’ve been to every single one of those
places, from Uvalde to Connecticut.  I’ve been to every single mass
shooting.  I stood — in Uvalde I spent — I spent four and a half hours —
almost four and a half hours — with every single parent and their
family.  And they don’t understand.  They don’t understand what the hell
is going on.   
   
Kids should be going to school, learning how to read and write, not duck
and cover.  And that’s what’s happening in many of the schools today. 
And you guys are keeping them open.  The govs are keeping them open. 
But it’s really — and more people are dying in the street every day that
don’t ever get mentioned in the equivalent of the — of a mass
shooting.   
   
So, you know, and — but it seems like there’s no willingness to take on
the NRA in any substantive way.  And then, you know, we come along, and
we talked about the very survival of the planet.  Gov, you and I talked
about this before.  I’ve been to every major catastrophe that’s happened
since I’ve been United — since I’ve been President of the United
States.  I’ve traveled over — all over the West and those fires and the
hurricanes and tornadoes, the flooding, the drought that — I mean, if
you’re going to go down the Colorado River, you better go now.  
   
But all kidding aside, things are really changing.  And I’ve noticed we
don’t have people talking any longer about there being — that there’s no
climate change problems.  They are few desi- — deniers now.  
   
You know more — more homes and properties have been burned to the ground
and forests have been burned to the ground than the entire state of New
Jersey — than the entire state of New Jersey, geographically.  That’s
how big it spans, from Oregon to Idaho to California to Arizona.   
   
And we’re finally — you know, and they still deny it exists; that’s the
problem.  Deny it exists — the problem — our MAGA Republican friends.   
   
And, you know, we’ve been talking about, you know, democracy itself is
on the ballot.   
   
So, you know, as I said, I think we’re at a real inflection point.  And
— and we were able to get lucky at the front end.  With the help of a
lot of you, we were able to get the American Rescue Plan passed.  And
that created 10 million jobs — 10 million new jobs.  (Applause.)  No,
for real.  It kept — it kept thousands of firefighters — the governor
can tell you — thousands of firefighters, police officers, first
responders on the job.  Because the — because of what we inherited,
there were not enough — states didn’t have enough money to do all
this.   
   
But it did a lot, and it made a big difference.  Among other thi- — I
won’t go through the whole thing.  But the point is that it’s — it’s
worked.   
   
And then we passed the Infrastructure Law.  We got some bipartisan
support for that.  A handful of Republi- — a couple handfuls of
Republicans who supported it.  But it’s the largest infrastructure
proposal in — you know, in history.  And it’s never been this large in
his- — bigger — it’s bigger than the Interstate Highway System. 
(Applause.)  
   
And what’s happened is that, you know, you find that a lot of — an awful
lot of governors, like the governor of New Jersey, has taken incredible
advantage of it and planning well as to what needs to be done with it. 
No, I’m serious.  It’s a gamechanger.  It’s not only providing access
to, you know, highways and bridges and ports, but it’s Internet, it’s a
whole — I mean, it’s — lead pipes.  All the things that, in fact, are a
real problem.  The money is there to do it, and making people healthier,
safer.   
   
And there’s — anyway, I won’t go into it all.  But the point is that,
you know, you have an awful lot of — an awful lot going on.   
   
And then, you know, I spent a lot of time necessarily overseas, trying
to — I was asked by — what my — what my objective was when I was with Xi
Jinping.  And I said to reestablish America’s relationships on
democracies.  And he was very upset about that, and he thought it was
all about China.  It’s not about China.  It’s about world peace.  It’s
about security.  So I spent an awful lot of time, and I’ll be doing it
tomorrow with the ASEAN countries, the Pacific Islanders, making sure
that we’re dealing in the Middle East, as well as in Africa and South
America, et cetera.  All these.   
   
But here’s the deal: What we came away with was the idea that how — why
are people investing — a lot of you are very successful businesswomen
and businessmen.  Why are so many people around the world investing in
the United States?  The CHIPS Act — we’re offering tens of billions of
dollars being invested.   
   
I asked (inaudible), the outfit from South Korea, why they’re investing
so much money in the United States for the — for computer chips.  He
said, “You’re the safest — you’re the most secure nation in the world. 
You have the best employees.  And I can count on it being secure.”  And
why — so much —  there’s going to be hundreds of billions of dollars
invested in this CHIPS legislation — not only what’s happened in the
breaking ground in Ohio, but all across the country, including in New
York City.  There’s a lot going on.   
   
But the point is, we have an opportunity.  We have an opportunity,
because if we — particularly if we have governors — Democratic governors
and legislators to take all this initiative and turn it into something
really positive.   
   
We’re the only nation in the world, in my view, that has come out of
crises better off than we went in.  If you notice, we don’t want to
build back, we’re going to build back better than we had it before.  And
I’m really optimistic we can do that.   
   
But it really gets down to what’s going to happen in the states — in
state legislative bodies as well.  It really, really, really matters.   
   
And so, you know, when we talk about — as I said, much of what we —
what’s out there right now, there’s a hell of a lot at stake, and a lot
at stake in terms of whether or not we are able to take what we’ve done
and make the best of it and cra- — and — let me put it another way.  I’m
keeping you standing too long in this brick.  (Laughter.)  
   
Look, think about — think about the average person turning on the
television every morning.  We talk about inflation, and it’s real.  But
think about the average person turning on the television every morning. 
And what do they see?  What do they see out there that really uplifts
them, where they go, “God, I feel good about being American.  I feel
really proud”?   
   
What they see is, crisis after crisis, they see people getting shot;
they see people, in fact, being in positions where they’re having to
deal with real prejudice; they’re seeing people — I mean, it’s just —  
   
And part of what I think is happening here is I think that we’ve gotten
to the point where Americans, for the first time in a long time, have
wondered whether we can still do big things — whether we can still do
big things.   
   
You know, one of the reasons why I believe that we were referred by some
as the “ugly Americans,” they had — again, to quote Xi Jinping’s
conversation with me, he asked me, when at the Tibetan Plateau — he
said, “Can you define America for me?”  And I said, “Yeah, I can, in one
word.  And I mean, it sincerely: possibilities.”  We think anything is
possible.  But I’m not sure the American people are there now thinking
anything is still possible.   
   
If I could do one thing to demonstrate there’s nothing beyond our
capacity, I’d wave a wand and cure cancer, not because it’s the most
consequential — more people die of heart disease.  But think about it
for a minute.  If we can demonstrate again that there’s nothing beyond
our capacity — we’ve always been there, we’ve always thought that, we’ve
always believed it — but the impact of the incompetence of the previous
four years; the impact of COVID and a million more — more than a million
deaths; the psychological impact that we had in terms of how we respond
to the qui- — the crises we face has gotten people just sort of down. 
But they’re starting to come back.  They’re starting to feel some sense
of optimism, some sense of ability.   
   
And when I — when I pushed and we passed the — the legislation that —
dealing with the Inflation Act that we called it, I — the purpose of it
was to let people know there’s really nothing we can’t do.  
   
For example, we were able to, as a consequence of passing that
legislation, we are — you know, there’s more than one — I’ll conclude
with this: My dad used to have an expression.  He said, “Joey, everybody
needs just to be treated with respect and just a little bit of breathing
room.”   
   
You talk about inflation.  Think about the inflation for the average
family making somewhere between — a family making somewhere between 70
and 150 thousand bucks a year.  What inflation means to them is, at the
end of the month, at that kitchen table, when they’ve paid all their
bills, do they have anything left?  Is there anything left?  There’s
more than one way to save for them.   
   
And one of the best ways we’ve done — the reason I call it the Inflation
Reduction Act — is that — think about it: If you want to affect the
average person’s bottom line, the average guy out there, lower drug
prices for them, prescription drugs.  We pay the highest prescription
drug rate of any country in the world.  So what did we do?  We changed
the law.  We changed the law to say that: Guess what? It’s going to
phase in, but nobody — nobody who needs job prescription drugs by the
next several years is going to have to pay more than $2,000 a year on
Medicare no matter how much their drug pri- — their drug costs are. 
(Applause.)  
   
And as you know, if you’re dealing with certain cancer drugs, you’re
paying 45, 50 thousand dollars a year.  I go on the list.  It’s real. 
And it changes people’s lives.   
   
We also — you know, any of you have any — have Type 2 diabetes or have a
child that has it, or you know how to deal with that, well, you’re
paying somewhere — somewhere between, in terms of what they’re paying on
a monthly basis — the average is between $460 and five- — excuse me,
$680, depending where you are.  That’s a lot of money.   
   
I was in Virginia, at — in Northern Virginia doing a function for a
community.  And a woman stood up and said, “I have a son who has Type 2
diabetes, and I pay…” — and I think she said 600 bucks a month.  She
said, “And I have no insurance.”  She started crying.  Imagine being the
parent looking at your child, needing something that cost the drug
company 15 bucks to make and package, and not having enough money to
make sure your child was going to be okay.  Imagine.  Imagine.   
   
Well, guess what?  We got that passed for anybody on Medicare, but our
Republican friends said, “No, we’re not going to do it for other
people.”  Nothing has changed.   
   
I guess what I’m trying to say to you is: There’s so many things — so
many things we can do.  So many things that were in our capacity.  
   
You know — and I talked about climate.  I just got off the phone —
anyway, dealing with some of our foreign colleagues, and I got a meeting
tomorrow with the Pacific Islanders.  You know what they’re worried
about?  They’re worried about their island sinking.  Not a joke.  Not a
joke.  Well, guess what?  We finally figured and convinced people that —
almost everybody — that there is global warming.  So we passed the
legislation with 600 and — no, excuse me, $369 billion for global
warming.  It’s going to make a gigantic difference in people’s lives. 
(Applause.)  
   
And, you know — and, by the way, I come from the corporate state of the
world, Delaware.  More of you are incorporated in my state — (laughter)
— oh, I’m not joking — than every other state in the nation combined. 
Combined.  And I have great respect for corporate America, but you got
to pay a little bit, you know.  You got to pay your fair share.   
   
And so we found out — you know, you had — you had 55 of the Fortune 500
companies not paying a single penny in tax, making $40 billion.  Well,
we got it changed.  We got it changed in this act.  And guess what?  You
pay an astounding 15 percent, God love you.  What a — what a killer. 
Fifteen percent.  
   
But the end result of all of this is that for all we’re talking about
having done and all the resources and help that we’re able to give
governors and state legislative bodies, you know what?  Their federal
deficit is down.  Since I became President — the last guy, they voted a
$2 trillion tax cut, not a penny of which was paid for.  All debt. 
Well, guess what?  In my first year, we reduced the federal debt by $356
billion.  (Applause.)  And this year, by over a trillion dollars, even
with the student loan forgiveness.  A trillion dollars in deficit
savings.   
   
So I don’t want to hear it from our Republican friends.  And that’s why
we’re able to continue to do things we’re doing.   
   
And, look, as I said, you know, there is — the idea — if you had to —
I’m not joking.  If you had to say what is the Republican platform, what
will they do if, in fact, they win — first thing they said they’re going
to do, the Minority Leader in the House, is repeal — repeal the
Inflation Reduction Act, increase drug prices, increase — and just go
down the list.   
   
So we got stark choices.  And the choices are most — that are going to
be implemented are not by governors; they’re state legislative bodies. 
And the last thing we need is to be in a position we’re arguing about
who won the vote.  
   
You know, I got criticized in the past — if you noticed, they’re not
doing it anymore, even on Fox — for saying that democracy was literally
at stake.  Well, guess what?  It is.  All of a sudden, they’ve had an
epiphany.  All of a sudden, (inaudible) it literally is.   
   
How can you say you support democracy when you have hundreds of people —
hundreds of people storming the Capitol, breaking down the doors,
breaking the windows, going in, ultimately several police officers dying
as a consequence of what’s happened, and say, quote, “They are patriots
— patriots”?   
   
How can you say you’re — support democracy when you will not acknowledge
that you lost the vote?  I got 80-some — 80-some million votes.  We
won.  Not a single Republican judge out there has said we hadn’t won all
the appeals.   
   
How do you say you’re a democracy when you don’t accept the outcome —
the outcome of an election?  And you know all that talk about my saying
that the way some of them talk, there’s a tint of fascism in what
they’re doing?  Well, guess what?  You hear everybody talk about that
now — all the scholars.  
   
We’ve got to win.  We have got to win.  (Applause.)  There’s a lot of
incredibly good Republicans.  But this MAGA crowd — think about it.   
   
I’ll end with this.  Think about it: You have Republican candidates for
governor, for state rep- — statehouses that said — continue to repeat
the Big Lie, continue to buy on to the MAGA philosophy.  Now that they
got their nomination, they’re walking away from it.  They say, “No, I
don’t support that.  I don’t support that.”   
   
This is not your father’s Republican Party.  And if anybody can control
the way in which these nominees are determined — I’ve had six serious
Republicans — and I’m not going to — senators I worked with in the past
— say to me — and I promised I’d never mention their names either — to
either — to even to one another — that say to me, “Joe, I know you’re
right.  But I can’t vote with you because I’ll be primaried and I’ll be
out of office.”  Not a very courageous position.  But nonetheless —
nonetheless, it reflects where we are.   
   
So, folks, if I were running his time and you were choosing between
whether you reelect Governor Carney or me, I’d have to tell you, it’s
more important you elect Carney.  (Laughter.)  No, no, I mean it.  More
important for the — that the state — that the state is able to guarantee
they have an election process that functions, that it cannot be
manipulated.  They’re going to stick with it.  Because there’s so much —
so much we can do.  So much we can do.   
   
And I — I just want to thank you all for being willing to support the
DGA.  And, you know, I ran for the Senate because I didn’t want to be
governor.  (Laughter.)  Oh, you all think I’m kidding.  (Laughter.) 
When I ran in 1972, as a 29-year-old kid, they showed I had no chance of
winning the Senate seat, and I could win the governor’s seat.  I still
ran for the Senate, because being governor is too hard.   
   
But really and truly, thank you for helping.  It really makes a
difference.  And if there’s ever a time your help mattered, I can’t
think of an election more important this one.  No, I really can’t.  I
really can’t.   
   
And so thanks for helping the Democratic governors and the candidates. 
And with — as my grandfather would say, with the grace of God, the
goodwill of the neighbors, and the crick not rising, we’re going to —
we’re going to win.   
   
And, by the way, every time I’d walk out of my Grandpa Finnegan’s house
up in Scranton, he’d yell, “Joey, keep the faith.”  And my grandmother
would go, “No, Joey, spread it.”  Go spread the faith.  Thank you for
the help.  (Applause.)
