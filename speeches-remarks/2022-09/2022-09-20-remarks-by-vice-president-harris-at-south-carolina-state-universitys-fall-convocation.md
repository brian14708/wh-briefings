*South Carolina State University  
Orangeburg, South Carolina*

1:55 P.M. EDT  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon!  (Applause.)  Good afternoon. 
Please have a seat.  Please have a seat.  (Laughs.)  
  
Oh, it’s so good to be back.  Madam President, thank you for that
introduction and for your leadership.  Thank you.   
  
Well, good afternoon, Bulldogs!  How’s everybody doing?  (Applause.)  It
is so good to be back in South Carolina.  I really do love this state. 
And it is so good to be back at South Carolina State University. 
(Applause.)   
  
So, before I begin my comments, let me thank the Marching 101, because
you all are — (applause) — are doing your thing!  (Laughs.)  They do not
disappoint.  (Laughs.)   
  
So, today of course, we are also joined by Secretary Cardona, who is one
of the champions of our nation’s students.  Secretary Cardona, I thank
you for your leadership and your work.  
  
And to Mayor Butler for welc- — welcoming us back to Orangeburg, I thank
you.   
  
To President Conyers, always, for your leadership and for welcoming us
to campus.  
  
Students, it is an honor to join you at convocation.  And to all of the
freshmen — can I see — where are the freshmen?  (Applause.)  
  
So, to the freshmen here today, I will say to you specifically for a
moment: This is the beginning of a great journey for you.  It’s a great
journey.  For the next four years, you are going to have an experience
that will shape the rest of your life.  The lessons that you will learn
here at SC State, both inside and outside the classroom, will guide you
for years to come.  And, of course, during your time here, you’ll face
challenges.  And through those challenges, you will learn that you are
strong enough, resilient enough, and brave enough to overcome any
obstacle.  
  
And, you know, joining you this afternoon, it takes me back to when I
was 17 and flew from California to Washington, D.C., to start my first
year at Howard University.  And I will always remember walking into
freshman orientation to a room very much like this one.  And very much
like this one, the seats were packed with students and faculty and
alumni who just, like for you, all looked like us.  
  
And it was exhilarating.  I don’t think at the time I understood how
special that moment was where you were surrounded and you are surrounded
by people from different places and different backgrounds, who are
joined together in community, where you are surrounded by people who, I
promise you, some will ask you to be in their wedding; others will ask
you to be godparent to their child; some of them will ask you, “Please
do come to my inauguration.”  (Laughter.)   
  
You are students united by the pursuit of excellence.  And I remember
back in that day what I believe you must be feeling today, which is to
feel the possibility of great opportunity, to feel the vigorous welcome
that you are being given for you to lead.  
  
So, to all the students here today, I say: There is no limit to your
capacity for greatness.  There is no obstacle that you cannot overcome. 
And believe me, there is no barrier that you cannot break.  And so, as
Vice President of the United States, I urge you to seize on that —
because in this moment, our nation needs your leadership.   
  
Today, we live in unsettled times.  The ideals that we thought were long
established — such as overseas, what we’re seeing, the sovereignty of
democratic nations we thought was long settled; domestically, we thought
long settled would be the freedom of voters to decide elections; long
settled we thought would be the freedom of women to make decisions about
their own future.  We thought we could take for granted what constitutes
the truth.  But these ideals now hang in the balance.  
  
And in moments of great crisis, our nation has almost every time turned
to our young leaders to help guide us forward.  
  
Just remember, John Lewis was only 23 when he spoke during the March on
Washington.  Twenty-three.  Diane Nash was just 21 years old when she
led the Nashville sit-ins to protest racial segregation.  And the great
Jim Clyburn was in his early 20s when he was jailed for protesting for
civil rights.  In fact, it was in that jail where he met his beloved
wife, the late Dr. Emily England Clyburn.  And as you guys know, I
think, they were both proud graduates of this very institution. 
(Applause.)  
  
So that to say, students, we turn to you once again.  Your nation turns
to you.  Because to move America forward, we need you.  We need your
passion, your purpose, and your excellence.  We need your leadership. 
For so many reasons and on so many issues, we need your leadership to
help grow our economy.  We need your leadership to protect our planet,
to drive innovation, and to fight for equity and justice.  
  
We need your leadership to build on an economy that works for everyone. 
Far too many people on that point and far too many communities in our
country are being left behind.  
  
So we have invested $12 billion in community banks, which specialize in
lending to minority and rural communities.  But we need you to then
access that capital, to build a business, to be invested in your
community, to allow you to buy a home and be part of the leadership of
neighborhoods and society.  
  
We need your leadership on the climate crisis.  Just think: In your
lifetime — in your lifetime — your generation has experienced the 10
hottest summers on record.  You all have.  You have seen communities
decimated by wildfires, flooded by hurricanes, and choked by drought.  
  
And you know, then, we must treat the climate crisis like the crisis it
is.  And we’re doing our part in terms of our administration to make the
largest investment in history and fighting that crisis.  But to
implement that vision, we need you.   
  
We need chemical engineers to help us design more efficient solar
panels.  We need architects to help us build more sustainable homes and
communities.  We need climate scientists to help us model the impact of
rising seas and warming temperatures.  And we need you in those
positions to also do the work of helping us to fight for environmental
justice and equity.  We need you.  
  
As Vice President, I’m the chair of the National Space Council.  So, for
generations, we say with pride, America has led the world in the
exploration and use of space.  Well, to continue America’s leadership,
our nation needs more engineers, scientists, mathematicians, and
programmers.  We also need more welders, and machinists, and
electricians.   
  
So we are investing, as an administration, increasing apprenticeship
programs so that students like you — and I want you to, if you have the
interest or the passion, take advantage of those opportunities so you
can continue to lead our nation on issues like space exploration.   
  
Students, to help us build a better future for America, we must also
make sure you have the resources you need to achieve academic success
without the distraction of worrying about making ends meet.   
   
So, we have increased Pell Grants by $400 per student per year.  It’s
the largest increase in more than a decade and money that you can then
use for food and textbooks and tuition and rent.  But we’ve got to do
more.  As a proud HBCU graduate, I am fully aware that 75 percent of
HBCU students rely on Pell Grants.  We need your advocacy to continue to
push forward on very substantial issues like that, because it makes a
difference, and the details matter.  
   
Speaking of HBCUs, I’m proud that we have invested nearly $6 billion in
our HBCUs, knowing that they are the centers — that this is a center of
academic excellence.  This is where we train the next generation of
leaders like those who serve on our federal courts.  Places like this
give us the vision and, dare I say, the ambition to know what’s possible
even when we’ve not seen it before.   
   
So, in addition to knowing that we should have and we have now confirmed
more women of color to the federal courts than ever before at this point
in a presidency, it means that because of the inspiration of places like
this, we knew we also needed to deal with that at the highest court in
our land.  And that happened.  And her name is Justice Ketanji Brown
Jackson.  (Applause.)  
   
The President and I also know that you cannot help us build a better
future if you are buried under a mountain of student debt after you
leave here.  And that is why we have announced that we will cancel
$10,000 of federal student loan debt — (applause) — right — for all
borrowers making less than $125,000 a year.   
   
And we will also cancel — and this is of particular relevance to HBCU
students — $20,000 of debt for Pell Grant recipients.  (Applause.)   
   
And it’s important for you know — to know that this loan forgiveness
does not just apply to graduates, it also may apply to many of you
sitting here right now.  So if you receive — please take note of this —
if you received a federal loan before July 1st of this year, you are
eligible.  If you have a friend or a sibling or a cousin who acquired
that student loan debt to the point that they may have had to leave
before graduation, you needn’t have graduated to apply for the debt
relief.  So, please help me get the word out so folks can take advantage
of that.  
   
And all of this to say that since we took office, we have made real
progress.  And Madam President mentioned the path leading to us taking
office came right through this beautiful university.  
   
So let me be clear, then.  We have seen great accomplishments, but we
still have a lot more work to do.  We still need to make, for example,
community college free for all people.  We know that access to quality
education should not be determined by whether or not you can afford it. 
We still need to make sure all people can access the healthcare that
they need, especially mental healthcare.  (Applause.)   
   
I was discussing with some students earlier — access to mental
healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can
afford it.  And let’s be clear about it: That’s healthcare.  
   
For too long, we have failed to understand.  When we talk about
healthcare, people act as though the body just starts from the neck
down.  What about the neck up?  That’s healthcare.  So let’s address
it.   
   
When we look at the work that we still need to do, we need to pass a law
to protect a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body —
(applause) — without government interference.   
   
We need to pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights
Advancement Act — (applause) — to protect voting rights in every state,
especially in those states that have passed laws that intentionally make
it more difficult for people to vote — laws that not far from here ban
drop boxes and restrict early voting; laws that states are passing
making it illegal to give folks, who stand in line to vote, food and
water.  Undemocratic laws.  Un-American laws.   
   
And on that topic, I’ll tell you — so, as Vice President, I’m also the
president of the United States Senate.  And in that role, I broke John —
this is for the historians here — I broke John Adams’s record of casting
the most tie-breaking votes in a single term.  (Applause.)  So, for
context, this kid who was born in Oakland, California, and graduated
from an HBCU just broke the record of John Adams.  I think we should all
fully appreciate how history can take a turn.   (Applause.)  
   
And I’ll tell you, in that capacity then, I cannot wait to cast the
deciding vote to protect voting rights and women’s health.  (Applause.)
 Yes.   
   
So there is more work to be done.  And the work includes something that
affects the students here and young people across our country.  We still
have to address the epidemic of gun violence in our nation, because all
communities have a right and should be able to live free from the fear
and the terror of gun violence.  And to accomplish those goals, we need
you.  
   
I have talked, as Vice President, directly with 100 world leaders, in
person or by phone — presidents, prime ministers, chancellors, and
kings.  And they have asked me in those conversations, in this moment of
great uncertainty, “How will our nation, how will you as Americans
respond?”   
   
Well, I think that is a question we all have to answer together.  And
that is a question, undoubtedly and invariably, you will answer.   
   
Today as students, tomorrow as graduates, and for the rest of your lives
as Americans, you will help to determine our nation’s future by
excelling when required by marching, by advocating, by organizing, and
by leading, and by voting.   
   
In our democracy, your vote is one of your most powerful tools for
driving change.  So, given that today is National Voter Registration
Day, please make sure that you each are registered to vote — here’s the
website: Vote.gov — because there is an important election happening in
49 days, and so much of what we discussed here is on the line.  
   
Your vote is your voice, and we need your voice.  We need you to lead
America forward.  And President Biden and I will be with you every step
of the way.   
   
May God bless you.  And may God bless America.  Thank you. (Applause.)
