THE PRESIDENT:  We’re finally going to make infrastructure begin to
work.  We’re making a major investment, as you know, up in a great city
with an airport that’s really behind the times, as most are.   
   
And we’re going to be spending a lot of money, and we’re going to get it
done quickly.  And we’re going to go all through America, making our
airports the best in the world again.  That’s what this is about.  
   
And then I’m going to be going up to Kennedy Library.  And at the
library, we’re going to be talking about my commitment to defeating
cancer.   
   
This is a — you know, all the way back in ’62, the Moonshot was
announced.  We’re going to have a Moonshot for cancer, for real.  We’re
going to cure cancer over time.  I’m going to lay out how we’re going to
do that.  
   
So, anyway, thank you very much.
