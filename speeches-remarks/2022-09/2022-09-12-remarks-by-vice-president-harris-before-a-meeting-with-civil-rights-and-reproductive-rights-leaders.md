*Diplomatic Reception Room  
*Eisenhower Executive Office Building**

5:10 P.M. EDT  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, good afternoon, everyone.  I want to thank
the leaders who are here at the table and virtually at the table for all
the work that you do and have been doing for such a long time.  
  
I thank you for the outreach that you provided to me and the President
to bring everyone together to have this conversation and to join leaders
in civil rights with leaders in reproductive rights and justice, to come
together in the spirit of partnership, collaboration, community
building, coalition building, and to build on a movement.  
  
Because certainly we know that with the Supreme Court having made the
decision in Dobbs to take a constitutional right, that had been
recognized, from the people of America, from the women of America — has
created a healthcare crisis in America and has highlighted the fact
that, as we all know, we must be vigilant and we must stand
shoulder-to-shoulder to ensure that every voice is represented in a way
that allows them equal access to all that they need to thrive.  And this
moment post-Dobbs highlights the fact that we still have a lot of work
to do.  
  
So we have come together, understanding our common principles and
purpose based on the history of the work and the continuing work that
each of you does every day.  And so I want to thank you for that.  
  
And — and I will say that when we think of the intersection between the
civil rights movement and the reproductive health and justice movement,
there is an extraordinary intersection of interest, priorities, and
spirit around what it means to stand for all people and ensure that all
people have equal access to what they need.  
  
I also want to mention that it is certainly, we think, not by accident,
but probably by design, that we are seeing, from some of the same
sources, attacks on women’s health rights, voting rights, LGBTQ
rights.  
  
And so we stand here in full acknowledgement of what is taking place in
our country and the need then to bring people together who seemingly
sometimes have nothing in common but who, in fact, have everything in
common.  
  
So, with that, I thank you again.  This is a movement that I do believe
is about freedom, it is about justice, and it is about some of the core
values that our country was founded on that we must stand for.  
  
So, with that, I thank you.  I’m going to turn now to Emmy Ruiz, who is
the head of Political Strategy and Outreach for the White House and for
our administration, to moderate our discussion.  Emmy.
