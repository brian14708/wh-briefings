*Columbia Metropolitan Airport  
*West Columbia, South Carolina**

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  It’s good to be back in South Carolina.  And I
spent a lot of time today with young leaders and students — college
students — who talked about their priorities, wanting to know that their
leaders, their elected leaders are going to focus and are focusing on
the biggest and most pressing issues they face.  
  
We talked extensively about the leadership that our administration has
been providing on the climate crisis — $370 billion — and what that
means in terms of not only addressing the crisis but creating the jobs
that will do the work of mitigation, doing the work of doing the
research so that farmers and families are not so burdened and, frankly,
devastated by the extreme weather that we’ve been seeing.  
  
We talked about what our administration has been doing to lower costs,
be that bringing down the cost of insulin by capping it at $35 a month,
to what we need to do and what we are doing to bring down energy
costs.  
  
So, all of this conversation is an important conversation about the
issues that Americans really care about.  
  
Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., you have senators who are attempting to
pass a national ban on abortion, attempting to criminalize healthcare
providers, doctors for simply doing the job that they were trained and
want to do, which is to deliver healthcare, including reproductive
healthcare.  
  
So there’s a clear disconnect between the priorities of everyday
Americans and a push to attempt to put a national ban on abortion.  And
we’re going to have to keep doing what we know is responsible and right,
which is addressing the everyday needs of folks but also respecting a
woman’s right to make decisions about her own body.  
  
Thank you all.
