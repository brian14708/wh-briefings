title: Remarks by Vice President Harris Before Roundtable Discussion With Union Members
  and Organizers
---
 
*Boston Park Plaza Hotel  
*Boston, Massachusetts**

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, good morning, everyone.  I’m very much
looking forward to our conversation.   
   
I want to thank Senator Markey for all that you do in the United States
Senate.  We were colleagues for four years there, and I’ve seen how you
always fight for working people.  
   
Congresswoman Pressley — just a force and always a voice for those who —
who must be seen and treated with dignity.  So, thank you.  
   
Maura Healey — we served together, overlapped when I was Attorney
General of California.  I have seen you just be such a fighter on all of
these issues, always fighting for working people.  I’m so honored to be
with you today.  I also know that you have been a leader nationally
around fighting for what we need to do in terms of wage theft and making
sure that workers recover their pay and what they are due because of
their hard work.  So, thank you for being a part of this panel as
well.  
   
So, on Labor Day, as it is every day — certainly for those of us at this
table — we celebrate and thank the workers of America for what they do
to keep our country moving, to strengthen our country, to build our
country, to take care of those things that must be addressed if we are
to be competitive around the globe, whether it be as a home healthcare
worker or as a member of the building trades, the work that — that these
union members do is critical to our strength and our success and our
prosperity.  
   
So, I have asked these workers from a variety of sectors — some new to
organizing and some who have established the traditions of organizing
and the strength of it — to have a conversation with us about what we
can do through our administration — the Biden-Harris administration — to
continue to support workers and their ability to organize and to
advocate for safe working conditions and wages and benefits that meet
and recognize the value and the dignity of their work.  
   
So, that’s the conversation we are having today and that is on top of
all of the work that we have done together over the last 18-plus months
and before to coordinate and collaborate around how our administration
can best be supportive of the working people of America.  
   
So, with that, I thank you all, each of you, for being here, and I look
forward to our discussion.  And again, I thank you for your
leadership.  
   
And so, with that, I’m going to turn it back to Brian, and I think
you’re going to then moderate this discussion.  
   
Thank you.  
   
(The roundtable discussion commences.)
