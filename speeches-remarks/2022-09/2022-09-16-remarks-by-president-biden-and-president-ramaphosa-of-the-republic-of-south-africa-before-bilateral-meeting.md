2:35 P.M. EDT  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, Mr. President, it’s great to have you here as I
— we were talking before you came in about how magnificent I think your
country is.  I spent some time in my campaign, which lasted for years,
against apartheid to visit your country.  And it’s magnificent.   
   
And, you know, it’s an honor to welcome you to the White House.  I’ve
been looking forward to this for a while.  The United States and South
Africa and your government have the same value set.  
   
And, you know, I’ve long been inspired by the long struggle of freedom
and justice.  And one of the great moments of my career was when — the
first time Nelson Mandela came to the United States.  And we — we were
in — I was a senator at the time, and we met in the Senate Foreign
Relations executive committee room.  
   
And he came in, and we all stood there and said hello to him and the
like.  And afterwards, he asked me to come by my office.  And he came by
to say thank you, because he heard I had been stopped trying to get to —
to visit him, to see him in prison.  
   
And I had said once — I said I got arrested.  I wasn’t arrested; I got
stopped.   
   
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  You got stopped.  Yeah.  Yeah.   
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Prevented from — from moving.  But — and he was
extremely gracious.   
   
And, you know, we’ve ended up with two great democracies, and a lot to
do.  And you’ve become — you personally and your country are such a
critical part of what happens in a continent of 100 million people —
billion people, almost.  
   
And — and we — we really need to make sure we’re — fully understand one
another.  And, you know, our trade relations with South Africa — we have
600 American companies doing business in South Africa.   
   
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  True.   
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  And you’re a leader on climate and health and
COVID-19.  I’d like to talk to you about that, because we want to see
you be able to produce COVID insulin on the continent, in your country,
et cetera.  And you — you were one of the international leaders that
agreed with my effort to try to do away with a patent listing on these
drugs.  
   
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  That’s right.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  So — but we can still get a lot done, I think.  
   
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  (Laughs.)  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Look, our partnership is essential in addressing many
of the world’s pressing challenges, from the food security crisis to —  
   
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  That’s right.  Yes.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  And South Africa is a vital voice on the global stage
and a leader in the international order.   
   
We have a lot to talk about.  There’s a lot that’s happening around the
world — not only on the continent of Africa, but around the world that
you’re engaged in as well.   
   
So, welcome.  I’m looking forward to our conversation.  And thanks for
taking the time to be here.   
   
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Well, thank you very much, Mr. President.  Thank
you for welcoming me and my delegation to the White House.  It’s always
a joy to meet you and to exchange views and thoughts with you.  
   
We are really delighted that we can come on a working visit to meet
you.  There are a whole host of issues we would like to discuss.   
   
And, of course, our relations really are historic.  They date from far
back.  The United States is an important partner to South Africa from a
trade and investment point of view.   
   
As you correctly say, you’ve got 600 or so companies that invest and
operate in South Africa.  And a number of them are already making huge
investments, and we’ll be meeting some of them.  And we really welcome
the opportunity to be here so that we can extend those relations and we
can get more companies to invest in South Africa to create jobs.  
   
We’re also here to say thank you for the support that the United States
gave to South Africa and to the African continent with regards to
fighting COVID-19, the vaccines that you made available, as well as the
support that you gave us when we were advocating for a TRIPS waiver at
the World Trade Organization, and we are grateful for that.   
   
But we also want to cover a number of areas related to COVID-19 and the
vaccines, particularly to finish the negotiations with regard to
therapeutics and diagnostics, which — the matter is due for finalization
before the end of the year.  
   
And of course, we want to discuss what I would call global stability and
security, particularly in relation to our region where we’ve had
insurgents targeting one of our neighboring countries, Mozambique —  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Yes.  
   
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  — so that we can discuss that as well.  Of course,
for us, that’s very important.  
   
And indeed, this morning, we had wonderful discussions with the Vice
President.  We covered a whole range of issues, including gender
empowerment.  Because for us, the empowerment of women is also very
important.   
   
And of course, climate change is a matter that we should discuss in a
little while, particularly in relation to a just transition, as many of
our people are a bit fearful of what a just transition could mean.  
   
So, thank you very much.  There’s a lot of issues that we have to cover,
and we really welcome this opportunity.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, thank you for taking — making the effort.  And
we have a lot to discuss, so thank you.
