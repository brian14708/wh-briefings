PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, Mr. President, welcome to you and your
delegation.  I — I think I woke you up election night.  I called you so
late to congratulate you.  (Laughter.)  But it’s a great victory, and I
— and my best to your wife as well.  
   
The relationship between the United States and the Philippines, to state
the obvious, has very deep roots.  We’ve had some rocky times, but the
fact is it’s a critical, critical relationship, from our perspective.  I
hope you feel the same way.   
   
And we have strong ties, including millions of Filipino Americans who
are very proud of their ancestry and desperately want us to continue to
have a strong relationship.  And our foundations are strong in the
U.S.-Philippine alliance, which is of critical importance.  
   
For decades, the alliance has strengthened both of us, I believe.  And
one of the things I want to talk about today is how we continue to
strengthen that and work together on the things that are of greatest
concern to you.   
   
Today, I look forward to discussing the opportunities for a wi- — wide
range of issues, including COVID-19 recovery, energy security, and
renewable energy.  I — I was impressed with the work you did on
windmills and a whole range of other things.  You and I both think
that’s the future; we can do a lot.  We — how we can do a lot together. 
I’m desperately interested in making sure we do.   
   
In addition, I expect we’ll discuss the South China Sea and disputes in
a critical global through- — throughway.  I’ve spent a lot of time with
— with not only the President of China but others about the
international waters and how they have to be respected.  And we should
talk about that a little bit, I hope.  
   
And we’re also — thank you for your position on the war against Ukraine
and — by Russia — and how it’s impacting energy prices and — and food
prices.  And we — we’re working very hard to be able to do something
about that.   
   
And — and so, we want to talk about human rights, talk about a whole
range of things.  But I’m mainly interested to know what’s on your mind
and how we can continue to strengthen this relationship.  
   
And again, congratulations.  
   
PRESIDENT MARCOS:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you. 
We’re very happy for the opportunity to meet with you despite the
schedules that we both have to deal with.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  You came a little further than I did.  
   
PRESIDENT MARCOS:  (Laughs.)  Well, the — the relationship — the
100-plus-year-old relationship between the Philippines and the U.S.
continues to evolve as we face the challenges of this new century and
the events that we have been watching over the past few months, really. 
So, we have very much to discuss in terms of redefining, I suppose, in
many ways.   
   
But the role of the United States in maintaining the peace in our region
is something that is much appreciated by all the countries in the
regions and the Philippines especially.  
   
We feel that we are especially fortunate because we have very strong
foundation of a very long relationship and the stren- — strong
relationships on various facets not only political, not only diplomatic,
but also economic.  And, of course, there is the very large Filipino
population that have chosen to live and make their lives here in the
United States and have been very successful.   
   
Again, we would like to thank the United States for the massive help
that we received during the pandemic.  We had the provision of up to 35
— almost 36 million doses of vaccines very early on, ahead of some of
the other countries.  And for that we are very, very grateful.  
   
We continue to look to the United States for that continuing partnership
and the maintenance of peace in our region.   
   
In terms of the geopolitical issues that we face in this day and age,
the primary consideration of the Philippines and the guiding principle
of the Philippine foreign policy is to encourage peace.   
   
And I hope that we will be able to discuss further the roles that our
two countries will play together and individually as we continue down
that road, maintaining peace despite all of the complexities that have
arisen in the past few months, I suppose.   
   
So, thank you again, Mr. President, for making time to see us.  We are
your partners.  We are your allies.  We are your friends.  And in like
fashion, we have always considered the United States our partner, our
ally, and our friend.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you.  It’s mutual.  
   
(Cross-talk by reporters.)  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN: I wouldn’t bother answering.
