*East Room*

10:18 A.M. EDT  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good morning, everyone.  Good morning.   
   
Brandon, I want to say to you publicly what I said to you privately:
Your courage, born out of such a violent tragedy, has been consistent
and enduring.  Long after the cameras left the scene of that horrific
crime, you have used your voice to represent the voices of so many. 
Consistently you have been doing this work.  You inspire so many of us,
and I thank you for your leadership.  You are a national leader.  Thank
you.  (Applause.)   
   
So, friends and family members of those we lost, civic and community
leaders, and members of the clergy: Your collective resilience, your
compassion, and your commitment to action inspires me, inspires our
administration, and inspires our entire nation.  So it is a deep honor
to be with you today.  
   
On this day 59 years ago, four white supremacists planted dynamite in
the basement of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama.  
   
The blast took the lives of four beautiful little girls and injured over
a dozen more people, including Sarah Collins Rudolph, who is here with
us today.  (Applause.)  
   
The bombing of 16th Street Baptist Church was a horrific act of violence
meant to instill fear and terror in the people of Birmingham and in the
people of our nation; meant to warn them against continuing in the fight
for civil rights.  
   
Instead, however, people across America of all races, all ages, all
backgrounds joined in response and refused to yield in the face of this
injustice.  They refused to yield to violence and to hate, as we do
now.  
   
Less than a year later, President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of
1964 — signed it into law.   
   
Today, America is again looking at and confronting the epidemic of
hate-fueled violence — in Oak Creek, Orlando, Victoria, Pittsburgh, El
Paso, Atlanta, Buffalo, and in so many other communities.  
   
We have seen our neighbors, our friends, our loved ones attacked simply
because of who they are or where they pray.   
   
In 2020, hate crimes in the United States surged to the highest rate in
over a decade.  
   
As you have heard — as a former prosecutor, as former United States
Senator, and now as Vice President of the United States — I know the
horror and the pain that these attacks cause.   
   
Earlier this year, I visited Buffalo to attend the memorial service of
Mrs. Ruth Whitfield.  And yesterday, I returned there to meet again with
the families — those families who lost loved ones in that tragedy.  
   
During both of my visits to Buffalo, I saw heartbreak and pain, and I
also saw incredible determination — the determination to find hope in
the midst of despair; the determination to meet darkness with light, to
meet division with unity.  
   
It is a spirit that is shared by so many in this room, and it is the
spirit our nation must summon today.  
   
Today, we must rededicate to joining together to help our communities
prevent, respond, and recover from acts of hateful violence.  And our
administration is committed to lead in this effort by investing
resources in violence prevention programs to stop these horrific acts
and by strengthening how we support communities after the unimaginable
has happened.  
   
Earlier this year, after speaking with families in Buffalo, I began
working with leaders in our administration to identify ways the federal
government can better provide coordinated and on-the-ground support in
the wake of these tragedies.  
   
Later today, our President will announce our work to develop and
strengthen our coordinated federal response to support communities that
have been touched, that have been hurt by this violence.  
   
As we will discuss during the day, this federal support must be just one
piece of a whole-of-society effort to address hate-fueled violence.  
   
I strongly believe no one should ever be made to fight alone — not on
this.  
   
We must stand together — students, parents, educators, faith leaders,
business leaders, and law enforcement officials.  And we must clearly
say that a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us.   
   
We are at an inflection point in our history and, indeed, in our
democracy.  
   
Years from now, our children and our grandchildren, they’re going to us
ask, “What did you do at that moment?”  “What did you do to help protect
our communities, to fight hate-fueled violence, and to build a better
nation?”   
   
Well, I have confidence in what we’re going to be able to say.  We will
tell them we were all here together today.  And we will tell that, in
this moment, we stood united.  We stood firm in our belief that we all
have so much more in common than what separates us.  We stood firm in
our belief that out of many, we are one.  
   
May God bless you, and may God bless America.  Thank you.  (Applause.)
