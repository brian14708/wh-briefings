THE PRESIDENT:  Jimmieka, she — please, sit down.  Sit down. 
(Laughter.)  She’s awful good, isn’t she?  She was really good. 
Jimmieka, thank you for joining us and — for this historic Conference on
Hunger, Nutrition, and Health.  
   
Before I begin, though, I — speaking of health, you all have been
reading and hearing about the hurricane and — Hurricane Ian and its
impact it’s going to have on our fellow Americans down in Florida.   
   
Yesterday, I spoke with Governor DeSantis for some time — my team has
been in constant contact with him from the very beginning — and the
mayors of Tampa, St. Pete’s, and Clearwater.  
   
And my message has been absolutely clear — is that we are on alert and
in action.  We’ve approved every request Florida has made for temporary
assistance, emergency assistance, long-term assistance that I’ve
received.   
   
We discussed what we have done to prepare for the hurricane.  That
includes dispatching hundreds of FEMA personnel and activating thousands
of National Guard members.  I have also developed the search and rescue
teams — and deployed them from multiple federal agencies.  And they’re
already on the ground and ready to help as we speak.  
   
FEMA pre-positioned millions of — literally millions of liters of water,
millions of meals, and hundreds of generators.  We have scheduled
everything we can possibly do. And we think, and so do the mayors and
the governor, that — and we’ve had — put up shelters — they’re ready.  
   
We’re not sure exactly where it’s going to hit, but we’ve — pretty —
it’s getting pretty clear exactly where it’s going to hit.  
   
I made it clear to the governor and the mayors that the federal
government is ready to help in every single way possible.   
   
And I want to repeat what I said yesterday to the people of Florida:
This storm is incredibly dangerous, to state the obvious.  It’s life
threatening.  You should obey all warnings and directions from emergency
officials.  Don’t take anything for granted.  Use their judgment, not
yours.  Evacuate when ordered.  Be prepared.  The storm warnings are
real.  The evacuation notices are real.  The danger is real.   
   
And when the storm passes, the federal government is going to be there
to help you recover.  We’ll be there to help you clean up and rebuild,
to help you get — Florida get moving again.  And we’ll be there at every
step of the way.  That’s my absolute commitment to the people of the
state of Florida.  (Applause.)   
   
And if you’ll forgive me, I want to add one more warning.  That’s a
warning to the oil and gas industry executives: Do not — let me repeat —
do not — do not use this as an excuse to raise gasoline prices or gouge
the American people.  (Applause.)   
   
The price of oil has stayed relatively low.  It kept going down.  The
price of gas should be going down as well.  
   
My experts inform me that production of only about 190,000 barrels a day
has been impacted by this storm thus far.  That’s less than 2 percent of
the United States’ daily production impacted for a very short period of
time.  
   
This small, temporary storm impact on oil production provides no excuse
— no excuse for price increases at the pump.  None.  
   
If gas companies try to use this storm to raise prices at the pump, I
will ask officials to look into whether price gouging is going on. 
America is watching.  The industry should do the right thing.  As a
matter of fact, they should move more quickly now to bring down the
price at the pump because gasoline is down — the price of gasoline is
down a great deal.  There’s too much of a delay between the price of
barrel of ga- — of gas being pro- — oil and the price of gasoline at the
pump.  
   
Now to why we’re all here for this — on this historic day: The Secretary
of Agriculture said everything, so I’m leaving.  (Laughter.)  You really
did.  So I apologize to you for any repetition that may occur here.   
   
But all kidding aside, you know, it’s been over 50 years, to state the
obvious — you all know it well — since President Nixon convened the
original White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health.  
   
And the single — that single conference and the laws that inspired it —
it inspired led a transformational change that has helped millions of
Americans live healthier lives for generations.   
   
Since that time, advances in research and medicine have taught us so
much more about nutrition and health.  
   
And today, I’m convening this conference again because I believe we can
use these advances to do even more to make America stronger and a
healthier nation.  And so many of you know so much about this as well,
and you’re committed.  
   
And I want to thank all of you here, including bipartisan elected
officials like Representative McGovern, Senator Braun, Senator Booker,
Representative — Jackie, are you here?  Where’s Jackie?  I didn’t think
she was — she wasn’t going to be here — to help make this a reality. 
And thanks to Senator Stabenow, Representative DeLauro for their
leadership.   
   
And here today we have advocates and activists — José Andrés — you’ve
heard of him, haven’t you?  (Applause.)  La- — last time we hung out on
the Ukrainian border in Poland.  And leaders of business, labor,
agriculture, faith, and philanthropy and — to achieve ambitious goals
that I know we can do if we work together — I really do know we can do
this: End hunger in this country by the year 2030 and lower the toll —
(applause) — lower the toll that diet-related diseases takes on for too
many Americans.  
   
This goal is within our reach.  Just look at how far we’ve come on child
poverty.  
   
Thirty years ago, as was referenced, 1 in 4 children lived below the
poverty line.  Today, 1 in 20 live below the poverty line.  So I know we
can take — tackle hunger as well.  And I’ve released a national strategy
to meet that bold goal.  The strategy that — has three key — three key
principles.  
   
First, help more Americans — I’ll say this again — help more Americans
access the food that will keep their families nourished and healthy.  A
lot of food deserts out there.  
   
Second, give folks the option and information they need to make healthy
dietary choices.  
   
Thirdly, help more Americans be physically active.  People want to be;
lots of times of times there’s no places to go to be active from where
they live.  
   
The good news is that we’ve already been laying a strong foundation for
this work.  
   
Soon after I came to office, I signed what was called the American
Rescue Plan into law.  It helped put food on the table and keep a roof
over the heads of millions of American families.  It helped our economy
create nearly 10 million new jobs — most jobs created in that timeframe
in American history.  We kept a pri- — a key price of — of the — a piece
of the American Rescue Plan is the expanded Childcare Tax Credit. 
(Applause.)

Where is she?  The gentlewoman from Connecticut, I —  
   
Overwhelmingly, working families used the Child Tax Credit to buy food
and other basic needs for their families.  And it helped cut child
poverty by nearly 50 percent in the United States — 50 percent. 
(Applause.)  And it cut food insecurity for families by 26 percent. 
(Applause.)  
   
Look, folks, people are constantly looking at federal programs to see
which ones are working and which ones are ineffective.  
   
Well, during the pandemic, we had a real-world example right in front of
us.  
   
The expanded Childcare Tax Credit is one of the most effective programs
we’ve ever seen.  And that’s why my national strategy calls on Congress
to expand the Child Credit permanently.  (Applause.)  Permanently. 

We got to do it.  (Applause.)  We tried.  We couldn’t get it done the
first time.  We’ll get it done this time.  (Applause.)  
   
At the same time, I remain committed to protecting workers’ rights and
fair wages and collective bargaining, including workers who grow,
produce, and process our food; who transport it to grocery stores —
(applause) — who stock the grocery shelves and — so they too can afford
to feed their families.  
   
Look, folks, my strategy would also make permanent the Ameri- — an
American Rescue Plan program that has made sure families, including over
30 million children, had money to buy groceries into the summer months
so kids don’t go hungry when school isn’t in session.

It sounds silly for a person to hear that who doesn’t have a child, but
full school programs — food programs do a lot.  During the summer
months, things change.  
   
Within the next 10 years, my plan, as was already referenced, would make
at least 9 million more children eligible for free school meals — a
major first step for free meals for every single student.  (Applause.)  
   
And we’re also supporting schools so they can cook more meals from
scratch, purchase more food from local farmers and ranchers. 
(Applause.)  And this will mean kids will have healthier meals, and
we’ll strengthen rural economies at the same time.  
   
You heard from Senator — from Secretary Vilsack.  “Senator.”  Excuse me,
I demoted you.  (Laughter.)  All kidding aside, he’s doing a hell of a
job.  Earlier — (applause) — I not only thank him for leading on this
iss- — he knows a great deal about it and he cares passionately about
this issue.  
   
The national strategy recognizes the critical role that nutrition plays
in our health and our healthcare system, and it acknowledges that we
give — we have to give families the tools to keep them healthy.  
   
How many of you here are — are medical people involved in research?  You
know, almost every single — almost every single discipline, from cancer
to heart disease on down the line, are finding out it’s affected by diet
and exercise.  (Applause.)  I mean, things we — you all knew, but we —
it wasn’t proved before.

And so, example: Heart disease is the leading cause of death in
America.  
   
Nineteen states — in 19 states, more than 35 percent of adults are
obese.  In 19 states.  Nineteen.  
   
For seniors and millions of folks on Medicaid, our national strategy
would expand access to nutrition and obesity counseling so they can get
the guidance they need to stay healthy.  It has only — not only do
people need to know what they should be eating — what they should be
eating.

Our national strategy also calls for doctors, nurses, dentists to be
trained to spot the signs of hunger.   
   
And the Food and Drug Administration is already using its authority
around labeling so you know which food is high on trans-fats and sodium
so you can figure out which food is actually good for you and what isn’t
good for you.  And that only is going to increase informing people. 

Both in too many underserved communities — urban, rural, and Tribal —
there’s nowhere to buy fresh food for miles or safe places for kids to
play or adults to exercise.

I’ve signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  It creates space to
live, work, and play safely.  It doesn’t just build highways and build
new ports and airports and the like; it also has the ability to
transform systems that are already over- — overworked right now — where
families can drink clean water, breathe clean air, use public transit so
they can shop at nearby grocery stores that stock fresh and healthy
foods.  
   
We also know that, too often, healthier food cost more.  That’s why —
that’s why my strategy calls for Congress to expand incentives to
purchase fruits and vegetables for low-income families — (applause) —
who rely on — who rely on SNAP benefits to buy groceries so it’ll be
easier to afford the food that’s good for you.  
   
You know, until recently, the way SNAP benefits were calculated hadn’t
been — I think this was referenced already — hadn’t been updated for
nearly 45 years — actually, over 45 years.

So, last year, my administration changed the formula, and now folks are
getting an average of 36 extra dollars in their pockets per month.  
   
Physical activity is part of living a healthy lifestyle and avoiding
diet-related diseases.  
   
We’re going to work with Congress to increase access to county — the
country’s parks — county, city, national — especially for Americans in
low-income communities who need public transit to get there.  
   
It will also give more families the chance to hike, to bike, to breathe
fresh air.  
   
Through the Inflation Reduction Act, we’re making historic investments
in climate and public health so families can get outside and be
physically active in the air that’s clean, not polluted with dirty
diesel from buses and trucks and school buses as well.  
   
The Department of Education and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention — the CDC — are going to help schools expand physical
education classes into the summer schools and summer programs so kids
get off to a healthy start in life.  If they’re in summer school,
they’re also going to be — have physical capacity.  They have gym — the
equivalent of gym.  And after-school programs so we get kids off to a
healthy start.  Not just — so we should take advantage of the
opportunities when we have these children.   
   
There’s so much more in our strategy and so much more in our
imagination.  But one thing is clear: Meeting our bold goals requires a
whole-of-government approach — a whole-of-government approach — and a
whole-of-society effort.  That’s why I’m so excited to see all of you
here.  You represent society in a way that is — touches every aspect of
society, every — every part of the country.  And when I look out at all
of you and the work you’re doing in your communities, I know — I just
know we — we can do this.

People are becoming more aware.  I mean, people who are — who are
getting hurt by the failure to know — to have the access, they’re
beginning to be aware.  And they’re beginning to think in ways they
didn’t think before, that — as — what their dietary habits should be and
how they — how they should fe- — be feeding their children if they can
feed them.

Well before, we — especially during the pandemic, so many of you were
there to help your fellow Americans.  They lost their jobs; closed their
businesses; faced eviction, homelessness, hunger; lost control; and
maybe the worst of all, lost hope and dignity.  
   
But whether it’s been your life’s work or you’re just getting started,
all of you are stepping up.  You collected food donations.  You served
and saved baskets and lunches and breakfast foods and — I mean, just
across the board, you did everything in school — school programs and
summer school programs.  You found new ways to get food from farms to
restaurants to dinner tables.  You gave other families hope.  
   
In my church, we have an expression when someone’s doing something. 
They say, “You’re doing the Lord’s work.”  A lot of people been doing
the Lord’s work.  That’s why each of you — what each of you are doing. 
And we’re on our way in a way that I don’t think that we have for a
while.

And again, you know, science changes things.  And people are realizing
not only whether or not they’re overweight or obese or not “healthy” —
quote, unquote — but certain diseases are affected by what they eat,
what they intake.  And people are beginning — the more we can — the more
we can spread that word and educate people of what’s at stake, the more
we’re going to see change.  But we have to be ready — as a government,
as a people — to provide the elements of change that are going to change
things for them.  
   
So thanks to the American Rescue Plan and the fact that the economy is
turning around, a high level of food insecurity we saw at the height of
the pandemic is down.  
   
But despite the progress, 1 in 10 American households still do not have
access to enough food.  One in ten.  
   
We’re working to deliver an economy that finally works for working
families.  Jobs are up.  People are back to work.  We’re taking on
inflation seriously, enacting policies to bring down cost.  But there’s
always significantly more we can do.  
   
That’s why we’re here today: to harness our greatest resource — our
fellow Americans.  
   
Everyone — everyone has an important role to play — local, state,
territory, and Tribal governments and the federal government as well;
the private sector; civil society; agriculture; philanthropy;
academia.  
   
You know, for example, the Rockefeller Foundation and the American Heart
Association are expanding research into the relationship between food
health and health equity.   
   
And the Food, Nutrition, and Investor Coalition is investing $2.5
billion into proven technologies and startup companies, pioneering new
ways for reducing hunger and improving nutrition.  
   
Today, we’re announcing over $8 billion in commitments from over 100
different organizations to help reach our goals.  (Applause.)  Eight
billion.  
   
And I also firmly believe the work ahead should be bipartisan.  There
shouldn’t be anything partisan about any of this.  (Applause.)   
   
Just as it was when President Nixon first convened this conference or
when Senator George McGovern and Bob Dole transformed America’s role in
reducing hunger in America and around the world.  
   
And this — and this work on hunger and nutrition and physical health is
critical to addressing our mental health and wellness as well, which is
a key pillar to my unity agenda that I called for in my State of the
Union Address.  Again, bipartisan.   
   
This is something that should — we should be all rallying the country to
work on together.   
   
And thinking internationally, global inflation and Putin’s war in
Ukraine have sparked a global food crisis.  
   
So just last week at the United Nations, I talked about the commitments
we’re making to tackle food insecurity worldwide.  Because in every
country in the world and in every state in this country, no matter what
else divides us, if a parent cannot feed a child, there’s nothing else
that matters for that parent.  If you look at your child and you can’t
feed your child, what the hell else matters?  (Applause.)  I really mean
it.  Worldwide.   
   
So, folks, let me close with this.  I believe America — and you’re tired
of hearing me say it, I’m sure — is at an inflection point.  It happens
every six or eight generations, where thi- — so much changes in the
world that everything that comes after it is different than it was
before.  
   
You’ve also heard me talk about the need to — for us to restore the soul
of America.  All I’m talking about is just restore, say, the decency —
treating people with respect, treating people in a way that you’d expect
— you’d want to be treated.  And by the way, some of you have been
around long enough to remember we used to be that way in politics.  We
fought like hell — (applause) — no, I’m serious.  We fought like hell,
but ultimately the vast majority were decent.  
   
One of my best friends was a guy who was like a brother I always fought
with.  We’d shout at each other on the floor of the Senate, and then go
have lunch together.  His name was John McCain.  (Applause.)   
   
The point is, every senator can mention — can acknowledge that.  This
should be an organizing element of how we start to talk to one another
again, dealing with food insecurity.   
   
The task before us at this conference is the important work that follows
and meeting this inflection point by nourishing the soul of America.  
   
America — in America, no child — no child should go to bed hungry.  No
parent — (applause) — no parent should die of a disease that can be
prevented.  (Applause.)  
   
This has always been a country, at our best — when we’re at our best, we
think big.  It’s almost like we don’t think anymore that we can do big
things.  No, I mean it sincerely.  Think about it.   
   
I realize this is not directly related, but one of the things that I say
to my team, my friends: If I could wave a wand and change one thing that
would change America’s attitude about all we’re able to do, remember who
we were — I’d wave a wand and say, “Cure cancer.”  Why cancer? 
Everybody is scared to death of cancer, and most people don’t think we
can do much about it.  We can.   
   
But imagine if we did that.  People would say, “My God.  We’re back.” 
Well, this could be a gigantic step — a gigantic step and remind us who
the hell we are.   
   
This is the United States of America.  (Applause.)  There is nothing —
nothing, nothing — (applause) — I really mean it — there’s nothing
beyond our capacity when we work together, so let’s work together.  
   
God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops.  Thank you, thank
you, thank you.  (Applause.)
