8:18 P.M. EDT  
   
THE FIRST LADY:  Hello!  Good evening.  Thank you, Athen.  It’s leaders
like you, those helping the next generation live authentically and find
their voice, who make me so hopeful for our future.  
   
And thank you to Paul Buccieri and A&E — (applause) — for helping us put
this event together.  
   
Isn’t this incredible?  (Applause.)    
   
First Lady Laura Bush is with us tonight.  (Applause.)  And, Laura, it’s
such an honor to welcome you and your family back to the White House. 
(Applause.)   
   
And finally, I want to say what a joy it is to be here with the man who
has inspired, supported, and loved Sir Elton John for so many years: his
husband, David.  (Applause.)  
   
Few things have the power to bring us together like music.  It can
compel us to move as one on the dance floor, to sing along with
strangers when we hear that familiar tune.  It’s a voice for the
feelings we can’t always define.   
   
When the piano plays, the strings swell, the drums beat in time with our
hearts, we find joy or a balm for our sorrows or the harmonies that tell
us we aren’t alone.   
   
And in that spirit, as we celebrate Elton John’s music, we also
celebrate you — everyday history-makers.  (Applause.)  
   
Many of you are my colleagues — fellow teachers, like Leah Michael
Dillard.  (Applause.)  Love the teachers!  So, Leah has taught 7th grade
English for 20 years.  And, Leah, your students are better thinkers and
more engaged citizens because of you.  (Applause.)  
   
We also have first responders and healthcare heroes like — (applause) —
like Dr. Amber Pearson.  Amber was the first person in her family to go
to college.  And it wasn’t easy.  She worked multiple jobs, took out
loan, and when she finally reached her dream, she gave back to others,
as an audiologist for veterans and their families, serving the women and
men who serve us so well.  (Applause.)   
   
And in this crowd are leaders of the beautiful, bold, and diverse future
we are building together, like Javier Gomez, a student from Miami.  When
his governor passed a law targeting the LGBTQ community, he didn’t sit
back.   
   
Javier, you remind us of the power of one person who is willing to speak
up for what is right, and that’s what this night is all about. 
(Applause.)  Coming together, using our voices, celebrating that, here
in America, our differences are precious and our similarities
infinite.  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Yes, (inaudible).  (Applause.)  
   
THE FIRST LADY:  (Laughs.)  Elton once said, “Music has healing power. 
It has the ability to take people out of themselves for just a few
hours.”  
   
We’re here tonight to once again lose ourselves and be brought together
— perhaps even healed — by the power of music.  (Applause.)  
   
And now, I get to introduce another huge fan, who also happens to be the
President of the United States and my husband, Joe Biden. 
(Applause.)   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  You had to stand for Jill, but you can sit for me. 
(Laughter.)  Please, all have a seat.  Please, have a seat.

Thank you, Jill.  Thank you all for being here — (applause) — on such a
special evening.  
   
And, Athen, leaders like you are helping the next generation live an
authentic voice.  And I want to thank you very much for introducing me.

Look, I — as my colleagues — many of whom from the Senate are still
here, came tonight — they always used to kid me because I — I was
quoting Irish poets on the floor of the Senate.

The think I did it because I’m Irish.  That’s not the reason; I did it
because they’re the best poets in the world.  (Laughter and applause.)

One who we lost not too long ago, Seamus Heaney, once wrote, and I
quote, “Once in a lifetime, the longed-for tidal wave of justice rises
up, and hope and history rhyme.”  
   
Throughout this incre- — his incredible career, Sir Elton John has been
that tidal wave — a tidal wave to help people rise up and make hope and
history rhyme.  Three hundred million records sold.  (Applause.) 
Seventy-one billboard hits, nearly half in the top ten.  Six Grammy
Awards.  Two Oscars.  One Tony, among the multiple, multiple nominations
across the board.  Four thousand performances around the world.  A
singer, songwriter of our time, for all time.  
   
On his final tour in Washington, Jill and I invited Elton to the White
House to thank him on behalf of the American people.  
   
So, like so many Americans, our family loves his music.  His songs take
us — take us back to a time, a place, a memory.  Songs that make every
day exceptional, help us connect and come alive.  And songs that reflect
the artist’s gift, that sixth sense to imagine what no one else can, and
then sing and play and dream until he sets that feeling free.  
   
As Jill just mentioned, we’re joined by so many people that it’s — he’s
set free to be themselves, to be treated with the dignity and respect
they deserve.  (Applause.)

Families and advocates in the fight against HIV/AIDS — (applause) — a
fight — a fight that he has led with sheer will, and fight for those
lives lost and those lives that we can save.

Leaders standing up for equality of all people, no matter who you are or
who you love.  
   
Every day — (applause) — every day Americans of every generation, of
every background who know that life can be cruel and full of struggle,
but it can also be full of joy and purpose.  
   
And we’re joined tonight by the UK Ambassador to the United States,
Karen Pierce, during a difficult time.  (Applause.)  Karen, where are
you?  Karen, thank you.  Thank you for being here, Karen.  
   
Jill and I travelled to London to pay our respects to the Royal Family
on the Queen’s passing.  
   
Our hopes tonight — our hope is that Sir Elton John’s music heals the
sorrow, as it often has in the past.

Throughout his career, Elton found his voice — not only his voice, but
his voice to help others and help them find their voice.  
   
With his hope, he made history rhyme for countless people in our
nation.  That’s what tonight is all about.  
   
Elton often talked about how American music changed his life and how the
different genres and sounds influenced his own music and imagination. 
It’s clear Elton John’s music has changed our lives.  
   
To David and the boys, thank you for sharing your husband and dad with
us tonight.  (Applause.)  And to Elton, on behalf of the American
people, thank you — and I sincerely mean this — thank you for moving the
soul of our nation.  (Applause.)

Ladies and gentlemen, if my mom were here, she’d say, “God bless you
son.  Let’s hear your music.”  Thank you.  (Applause.)

(The event begins.)  
   
(The event concludes.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, tonight it’s my great honor — and I mean this
sincerely — to present the National Humanities Medal to Sir Elton John. 
(Applause.)   
   
Major Yang, please read the citation.  
   
MILITARY AIDE:  Honored, sir.  
   
Good evening, everyone.  The President of the United States awards this
National Humanities Medal to Sir Elton John for moving our souls with
his powerful voice in one of the defining songbooks of all time.  An
enduring icon and advocate with absolutely courage, who found purpose to
challenge convention, shatter stigma, and advance the simple truth that
everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.  (Applause.)  
   
(President Biden presents the National Humanities Medal to Sir Elton
John.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I think we surprised him.   
   
SIR ELTON JOHN:  I just said to the First Lady: I’m never flabbergasted,
but I’m flabbergasted — (laughter) — and humbled and honored by this
incredible award from the United States of America.  I will treasure
this so much — (applause) — and it will make me double my efforts to
make sure this disease goes away.  
   
Your kindness — America’s kindness to me as a musician is second to
none.  But in the war against AIDS and HIV, it’s even bigger.  And I
can’t thank you enough.  I’m really — I’m really emotional about this. 
(Applause.)  And thank you.  (Applause.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  And, by the way, it’s all his fault that we’re spending
$6 billion in taxpayer money this month to help AIDS — fight HIV/AIDS. 
(Applause.)
