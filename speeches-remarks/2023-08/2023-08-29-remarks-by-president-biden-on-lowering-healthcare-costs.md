East Room

2:24 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Please — (applause) — sit down.  I look around the room,
and this is a long time in coming.  (Laughter.)  
   
Bill, we started doing this 25, 30 years ago, seeing if we could do
something about these outrageous prices, give people a fighting chance. 
Unless you needed the drugs yourself or knew someone who did, it wasn’t
as real.  But, boy, we’ve been fighting Big Pharma for a long time — a
long, long time.   
   
And, Steven, as my mother would say, “God love you, son.”  You’ve been
through one hell of an ordeal.  Your story is a familiar one for too
many Americans.  Instead of using all your energy to fight the disease,
you’re fighting insurance or drug companies for medicines that literally
keep you alive.  Without them, you’re not going to be here.  
   
On too many nights, too many Americans lay in bed staring at the
ceiling, worrying what will happen if their spouse gets sick, if their
child gets sick, or if something else happens to them.  
   
And I should have said at the outset: When I look out in the audience,
there’s a lot of people who are in this fight, some even before me, that
— it just is amazing.  I want to thank you — you, the people sitting in
front of me, the members of Congress, the organizations you belong to —
for making this happen.  It wouldn’t happen without you.  And that’s not
hyperbole.  
   
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)  
   
I’m serious.  I’m deadly earnest about it.  I really am.  So, thank
you.  
   
You know, questions you lie in bed wondering about — I remember we lived
in a three-bedroom, split-level home with four — we weren’t poor; just a
normal, middle-class — I guess technically lower-middle-class family,
but in a development of homes in my — the bulk of my childhood.  That
was a three-bedroom, split-level home that had four kids and a grandpop
living with us.  And you could hear everything in the house.   
   
I remember one night — this is the God’s truth.  I remember one night —
I guess I was a sophomore or junior in high school — and hearing my —
the headboard of my dad’s bed.  I could tell my dad was restless in the
next room.  The next morning, I get up and asked my mom — I said,
“What’s the matter with Dad?”  “He said the company just said they’re
not going to pay insurance anymore — health insurance.”   
   
Well, you know, that’s tough enough.  But imagine when you have
lifesaving drugs you need to keep you alive.  Do you have enough
insurance?  Can you afford your medical bills?  Do you have to sell the
house in order to pay for everything?  
   
For all of you out there, I get it and millions of Americans get it. 
And I promise you: I’m going to have your back, and I’ll never stop
fighting for you on this issue, nor will Kamala.  Nor will Kamala. 
(Applause.)  
   
But, again, I’m not being solicitous when I say: For all of you sitting
in the audience, this would — this would never happen without you —
never would’ve happened without you.  I’m not going to start naming
names because I’m going to get in real trouble if I do that. 
(Laughter.)  But thank you.  
   
Two weeks ago, we celebrated the first anniversary of the Inflation
Reduction Act, which, in a sense, is misnamed.  We did lower inflation,
but there are many other things in that legislation.  
   
One of the most significant laws ever enacted, especially when it comes
to reducing the cost of prescription drugs.  We pay more for
prescription drugs than any other major economy in the world — than any
other major economy in the world.  
   
You can walk in a local drugstore across the country; you’re paying two
to three times more for the exact same prescription manufactured by the
exact same company than it would cost you in Canada or France or
anywhere else around the world.   
   
Think about that: A drug company that makes a drug here in America, if
it’s sold in Chicago, you can buy the same drug in Toronto or Paris
cheaper than you can buy it in Toronto — I mean, excuse me, in — in
Chicago.   
   
And unlike other parts of the healthcare system, Big Pharma got a
special carveout that stopped Medicare from negotiating prices of drugs
though Medicare.  
   
For years, advocates, like many of you in this room, have worked
tirelessly to change that and give Medicare the power to negotiate lower
prescription drug prices, just like the Department of Veterans Affairs
has done — does right now.  It matters.  
   
VA pays 50 per- — 50 percent less than Medicare can for — in negotiating
the same lower prices.  
   
For years, Big Pharma blocked this.  They kept prescription drug prices
high to increase their profits.  They extended patents on existing drugs
to suppress fair competition instead of innovating, playing games with
pricing so they could charge whatever they can.  
   
But this is — finally, finally, finally, we had enough votes, by a
matter of one, to beat Big Pharma.  Well, we did it.  (Applause.)  
   
We passed the Inflation Reduction Act with no help from the other team. 
Every single person on the other team in the Congress voted against it —
every single one.  
   
And we’re in a situation here where the law finally gave Medicare the
power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices.  And by the way,
negotiating drug prices, alongside other provisions of this law, isn’t
just going to put more money back in the pockets of millions of
Americans across the country.  It’s also going to lower the federal
deficit.  (Applause.)  
   
According to the Congressional Budget Office, it will save the federal
government $160 billion over the next 10 years because Medicare will be
paying less for the pres- — prescription drugs they’re making available
to seniors.  
   
The Inflation Reduction Act is already making a huge difference.  Take
insulin, as referenced by Steven.  It costs — that drug costs $10 to
make.  The guy who invented the drug — who came up with it didn’t patent
it because he wanted it available for everybody.  But drug companies are
charging 30 times that $10 or more than that.  
   
Now, because of the Inflation Reduction Act, seniors on Medicare, like
Steve, are paying $35 a month instead of $400 a month.  (Applause.)  It
matters.  
   
Three months after the Inflation Reduction Act went into effect, all
three of the major insulin manufacturers lowered their prices for
insulin for everyone — for everyone.  Not just seniors — everyone. 
That’s originally what I had proposed: everyone.  We lost on getting
everyone, but we kept seniors.  
   
When we act, change happens.  
   
You know, and today I’m proud to announce that Medicare has selected the
first 10 additional drugs for negotiation under the Inflation Reduction
Act — 10 additional.  Drugs that treat everything from heart failure,
blood clots, diabetes, kidney disease, arthritis, blood cancers, Crohn’s
disease, and so much more.  
   
Medicare spends $50 billion a year on these 10 drugs.  And American
seniors are spending $3.4 billion on out-of-pocket costs.  
   
Look, if your company — if you compare the total globe — drug price
globally, the United States is clearly an outlier.  For example, one of
the selected drugs that treats blood clots costs about $80 for a monthly
prescription in Canada.  The same exact drug in the United States made
by the same exact company costs over $270 a month — made by the same
company here in the United — sold in the United States of America —
triple the cost, just crossing the border.  
   
Think about that.  
   
Big Pharma — Big Pharma has been charging Americans more than three
times what they charge other countries simply because they could.  I
think it’s outrageous.  
   
That’s why these negotiations matter.  Reducing the cost of these 10
additional drugs alone will help more than 9 million Americans.  
   
And by September 2024, HHS — Health and Human Services –is going to
publish the prices it negotiated.  In January of 2026, the new prices
will go into effect.  But we’re not stopping there.  
   
Next year, Medicare will select more drugs for negotiation so more
Americans can get more savings on lifesaving medications they need and
deserve.  
   
But guess what?  Big Pharma doesn’t want us — this to happen, as you
might expect.  
   
Last year, the industry spent $400 million in lobbying fees to try to
stop the Inflation Reduction Act and block the ability of the federal
government to lower drug prices.  And when they failed, they went to
federal court to sue the government in an attempt to maintain their
exorbitant prices.  They are hoping the courts will do what Democrats in
Congress wouldn’t do: protect the exorbitant profits and keep
negotiations from happening.    
   
But we’re going to see this through.  We’re going to keep standing up to
Big Pharma, and we’re not going to back down.  (Applause.)  
   
And, folks, there’s a lot of really great Republicans out there.  And I
mean that sincerely.  But we’ll stand up to the MAGA Republicans who
voted against the Inflation Reduction Act and now are attempting to
still repeal it.  And the name — and the MAGA Republicans who have been
trying for years to get rid of the Affordable Care Act deny tens of
millions of Americans access to quality, affordable healthcare.   
   
Today is the start of a new deal for patients where Big Pharma doesn’t
just ha- — get a blank check at your expense and the expense of the
American people.  On my watch, healthcare should be a right not a
privilege in this country.  (Applause.)  
   
And there are ways — there are other ways the Inflation Reduction Act is
lowering healthcare costs as well.  As mentioned, beginning in 2025, the
Inflation Reduction Act caps total — total out-of-pocket drug costs for
seniors on Medicare at $2,000 a year total, even if their expenses —
(applause) — even for expensive cancer drugs that could cost $10-, $12-,
$14,000 a year — max, cumulative $2,000.   
   
The law already is requiring that drug companies that raise prices
faster than inflation have to pay the difference to the government
between what they charge and the rate of inflation.   This quarter,
seniors are paying up to $449 less per dose for drugs that hike their
prices faster than inflation.   
   
In addition to the — to the law, my administration is cracking down on
junk health insurance plans that look like they’re inexpensive but too
often stick consumers with big hidden fees.  No one likes to be taken
advantage of.   
   
We’re also cracking down on surprise medical bills.  You’ve all heard of
the stories of people who choose a hospital that’s in their insurance
network, then get a surprise bill of thousands of dollars because the
hospital assigned an anesthesiologist, for example, who wasn’t in their
network.   
   
Well, not anymore.  Preventing $1 million in surprise medical bills
every single month if we — when we have changed this law.   
   
Lowering prescription drug costs is part of a much broader vision for
the country — growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up,
not from the top down. Because when the middle class does well, everyone
does well.  
   
I’m a capitalist.  If you make a billion dollars, fine.  Just pay little
bit of them in taxes.  Everyone does well when we do it this way.   
   
The Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal — I don’t think they
meant it as a compliment, but they started referring to my economic
policies as “Bidenomics.”  Well, guess what?  It’s working. 
(Applause.)  
   
Since we were sworn in in January 2021, the economy has created more
than 13 million new jobs since I took office on that day.  We’ve created
more jobs in two years than any president has in a single four-year
term.  (Applause.)   
   
Unemployment — unemployment has been below 40 percent — 4 percent for
the longest stretch in 50 years.  And now we have more jobs than we did
before the pandemic.  
   
Workers aren’t just finding more jobs.  They’re finding better jobs,
higher-paid jobs, and job satisfaction.  The rate of Americans — the
rate of Americans without health insurance is at an all-time low. 
Premiums for coverage for millions of Americans under the Affordable
Care Act are $800 lower per person than before I took office. 
(Applause.)  
   
And while we have more to do, inflation is down by two thirds. 
Inflation is now down close to 3 percent, the lowest among the world’s
leading economies, with wages growing faster than inflation.  This
matters to ordinary people.  
   
The way I think about inflation is the way my dad talked about it around
the kitchen table.  He’d say, “The real issue is how much do you have
after you pay all your monthly bills?”  What’s left?  What’s left?  How
much do you have left over to pay for the necessities?  Will there be
enough room at the end of the month just to have a little bit of
breathing room — just a little bit of breathing room?  
   
Well, the Inflation Reduction Act is giving more — it’s giving more
breathing room, especially when it comes to healthcare costs.  
   
The way I look at it, Bidenomics is just another way of saying restoring
the American Dream.  
   
I believe every American willing to work hard should be able to get a
job no matter where they live, raise their kids on a good paycheck, take
care of their healthcare for their families.  
   
My dad used to have another expression, for real, and the kids I grew up
— the guys I grew up with remember it.  He’d say, “Joey, a job is about
a lot more than a paycheck.  It’s about your dignity.  It’s about
respect.  It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say,
‘Honey, it’s going to be okay,’ and mean it.”  
   
That’s part of the American Dream.  
   
Let me conclude with this.  I’m proud of the historic laws my
administration has passed.  They are the right steps not only to get our
economy moving again, but to build a future better than the past.  I’m
not trying to return to the past; I’m trying to better the future that
we have.  
   
And it’s not about me.  It’s about you, the American people.   
   
We were faced with pretty tough times in recent years, but the American
people didn’t give up.  They never give up.  
   
You’re the ones getting up every single day, doing the work.  You’re the
real heroes in this story.   
   
We all hear from our friends on other side of the aisle about what they
claim is wrong with America.  They tell you we’re failing — that America
is failing.   
   
Well, they’re wrong.  America isn’t failing.  America is winning.  
   
As I’ve said a thousand times: There is no quit in America — none. 
(Applause.)  
   
And I’ve said more than a thousand times: It has never been a good bet
to bet against America.  This is still a country that believes in
honesty, decency, and integrity.  
   
And we’re still a country that believes in hard work.  We’re still a
country that believes that each and every one of us is created equal and
deserves an equal chance.  And we’re still the beacon for the entire
world.   
   
Every day, ordinary people do extraordinary things.  That’s who we
are.  
   
So, let me tell you: America’s best days are ahead of us.  They’re ahead
of us; they’re not in the past.  They’re ahead of us.  And this — this
is all about the future.  This is about each of us writing the next
chapter in American history.  
   
That’s why I’ve never been — I mean this, and I’ve been saying this for
a long time — I’ve never been more optimistic about America’s future.  
   
We just have to remember who we are.  We’re the United States of
America.  There is nothing — nothing beyond our capacity when we work
together.  Nothing.  (Applause.)  
   
I’m not joking.  Think about it.  No goal we’ve ever set have we failed
to meet when we’ve worked together.  
   
So, God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops.  
   
Better days are coming.  (Applause.)  
   
Thank you.  (Applause.)
