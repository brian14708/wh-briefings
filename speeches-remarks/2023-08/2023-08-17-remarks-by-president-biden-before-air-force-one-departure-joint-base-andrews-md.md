Joint Base Andrews  
Prince George’s County, Maryland

THE PRESIDENT:  I’ll speak about one thing: Mrs. Casey.  Nothing else.  
   
Q    Okay.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Do you have a question about Casey?  
   
Q    Yes.  What was her role in — in your life?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  She played an enormous role, not just in my life but
everyone’s.   
   
You know, there’s a quote my sister always uses about Michelangelo.  It
says: He saw the angel in the marble, and he carved and he set it free. 
That’s who she was.  She was an incredible woman — decent, honorable. 
Her values were amazing.   
   
And every time I would go to Scranton over the years, I would stop and
see her.  She was a friend.  
   
Anyway, I’m going up or I’m going to be late for Bobby.  
   
Q    Will you come talk to us about Hawaii?  
   
Q    On the Camp David summit, are you willing to share what your goals
are for the summit, sir?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Not until I meet with them.  
   
Q    Okay.  Thank you.
