Wilkes-Barre Scranton International Airport  
Avoca, Pennsylvania

12:49 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m just going to make a brief comment about my friend,
Ellen Casey.  You know, she — I don’t know if — some of you Scrantonians
may have known her.  But she loved with a fierceness and a tenderness
that was incredible.  And it was the Irish of her.  She just was
incredible.  
   
And I was saying earlier that — my sister and I were talking about her. 
And my sister reminded me of a quote about Michelangelo.  It said: He
saw the angel in the marble and carved until he set it free.  That’s
what she did with everybody.  I mean, she really did, if you’re knew
her.  
   
I know this sounds like an exaggeration, but I’ve been coming back home
since — I’ve never left, actually.  And I’ve known the Caseys for the
bulk of my life.  I don’t remember when I didn’t know the Ca- — the
Caseys.   
   
And Bobby’s dad was older than me, then I am older than Bobby.  And we
lived not far from one another.  He was on Wyoming Avenue, and I lived
on North Washington Avenue.  We went to the same parish, St. Paul’s.   
   
And anyway, just a — she’s an incredible woman.  And she raised an
enormously successful and decent family.  All the values I learned, I
learned them here in Scranton.  And she was an embodiment of them.   
   
So, I — the reason I am not going to the funeral tomorrow is everyone
would have to be wanded to go in — that I’d — I’d mess everything up if
I went.   
   
But in addition to that, I have to meet with — at Camp David with two
world leaders tomorrow morning.   
   
But in addition, I didn’t come — I’m not going to stay at the viewing
when the people are coming in.  But, again, they have to be wanded; I
just become an impediment.   
   
I just want to show my respect to the family.  So —  
   
Q    Can you tell us about your Hawaii trip, sir?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, not now.  I’m going to be leaving, and I’ll be there
on Monday.   
   
Q    Why is it important that you go?  
   
Q    Sir, do you think —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
