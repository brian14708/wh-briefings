Commanding Officers Loop  
Camp David, Maryland

3:14 P.M. EDT  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Camp David.  
   
If I seem like I’m happy, it’s because I am.  (Laughter.)  This has been
a great, great meeting.  
   
Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, I — we meet in this historic place to
make a historic moment.  And I believe that to be true.  The — this is a
new era in partnership between Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the
United States — our new Camp David trilat.  (Laughs.)  That’s what we
have here.  
   
And — but before we dive into the progress we’ve made today — if you
excuse, we used to say in the Senate, “a point of personal privilege” —
I want to start by expressing my appreciation for the contribution that
your countries have made toward the relief following the devastating
wildfires in Hawaii.  I want to thank you both on behalf of the American
people.  
   
I also want to note that my team is closely monitoring Hurricane Hilary,
which is — has the potential to bring significant rain and flooding to
southern California.  FEMA has pre-positioned personnel and supplies in
the region, and they’re ready to respond as needed.  I urge everyone —
everyone in the path of this storm to take precautions and listen to the
guidance from state and local officials.   
   
And you’ve heard me say it before: The Republic of Korea and Japan are
capable and indispensable allies.   
   
Now, to the purpose of why we’re here.  
   
America’s commitment to both countries is ironclad, and my personal
commitment to bringing these three nations together was real from the
very beginning.    
   
Since last summer, we’ve met on the margins of the NATO Summit in Spain,
the ASEAN Summit in Cambodia, and the G7 Summit in Japan.  And today,
we’ve made history with the first-ever standalone summit between the
leaders of our three countries, as well as our commitment to meet
together on the leader level annually and to have all of our relative
Cabinet-member people meet on a regular basis for — from this point on;
not just this year, not next year — forever.  That’s the i- — that’s the
intention.  
   
And so, I want to recognize the important work that both of you have
done and the political courage — and I mean this sincerely — the
political courage that you’ve both demonstrated to resolve difficult
issues that would’ve stood in the way for a long time of a close
relationship between Japan and Korea and with the United States.   
   
Your leadership, with the full support of the United States, has brought
us here, because each of you understands that our world stands at an
inflection point — a point where we’re called to lead in new ways: to
work together, to stand together.  And today, I’m proud to say our
nations are answering that call.    
   
First, we’re elevating our trilateral defense collaboration to deliver
in the Indo-Pacific region.  That includes launching annual multidomain
military exercises, bringing our trilateral defense cooperation to an
unprecedented levels.   
   
We’re doubling down on information sharing, including on the DPRK’s
missile launches and cyber activities, strengthening our ballistic
missile defense cooperation.   
   
And, critically — critically, we’ve all committed to swiftly consult
with each other in response to threats to any one of our countries from
whatever source it occurs.  That means we’ll have a hotline to share
information and coordinate our responses whenever there is a crisis in
the region or affecting any one of our countries.  
   
And today, we’ve reaffirmed — all reaffirmed our shared commitment to
maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and addressing ec-
— and addressing economic coercion.    
   
We’re going to continue to counter threats from the DPRK, including
cryptocurrency money laundering to the tune of billions of dollars;
potential arms transfer in support of Russia’s brutal war against
Ukraine.  
   
And together — together, we’re going to stand up for international law,
freedom of navigation, and the peaceful resolution of disputes in the
South China Sea.    
   
Second, we’re expanding our economic cooperation to build an Ino — an
Indo-Pacific that is peaceful and prosperous.   
   
Today, we’ve committed to launch a new — what we call a “Supply Chain
Early Warning System” — excuse me, a Supply Chain Early Warning System
Pilot and — which will alert our nations to disruptions of certain
products and materials, like critical minerals or batteries, so we can
get ahead of the issues as we — they appear with the experience — that
we’ve experienced in — during the pandemic.   
   
(Referring to a piece of audio equipment.)  Excuse me, this is falling
off.  There you go.  
   
And — and building on the G7-led Partnership for Global Infrastructure
and Investment, we’re deepening cooperation between our development
finance institutions to mobilize more financing for quality
infrastructure and secure communications technology to help low-income
and middle-income countries throughout the region take on the challenges
that matter most to their people.    
   
And finally, our partnership is about building a better future for our
people.  That’s why we’re deepening our cooperation on global health and
launching a trilateral expert exchange in support of the U.S. Cancer
Moonshot initiative.  That’s going to, I believe, change cancer as we
know it.  
   
It matters a great deal to me and to families all across our three
countries.  In the United States, we are revolutionizing the way we do
cancer research.  And together, the three of us, I am confident we can
harness our shared spirit of innovation and end cancer as we know it.   
   
We’re also launching a new collaboration between our National
Laboratories and advance our science knowledge and technological
capabilities together.  As we do, we’ll work in lockstep to set the
standards for safe, secure, and trustworthy emerging technology,
including artificial intelligence, which a lot of work has to be done
on.    
   
Let me close with this.  Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, this is the
first summit I’ve hosted at Camp David as President.  I can think of no
more fitting location to begin the next era — our next era of
cooperation — a place that has long symbolized the power of new
beginnings and new possibilities.   
   
In the months and years ahead, we’re going to continue to seize those
possibilities together — unwavering in our unity and unmatched in our
resolve.  This is not about a day, a week, or month.  This is about
decades and decades of relationships that we’re building.  
   
Mr. Prime Minister and Mr. President, I want to thank you for your
leader, and I — leadership — and I say it again — for your courage that
brought us together.  And I look forward to working with you both of you
ahead.  
   
Now I yield to — who am I yielding to?    
   
MODERATOR:  Distinguished guests —  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  There you go.  
   
MODERATOR:  — the President of the Republic of Korea.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  We needed the voice of God to tell us that. 
(Laughter.)  
   
PRESIDENT YOON:  (As interpreted.)  First of all, I’d like to thank
President Biden for his warm hospitality.  It is a great pleasure to
visit Camp David along with Prime Minister Kishida.  Camp David is a
site that bears historical significance where important diplomatic
decisions were made at critical junctures of modern history.   
   
In order to respond to today’s unprecedented polycrisis, the ties
between our three countries, which are the most advanced liberal
democracies in the region and major economies leading advanced
technology and scientific innovation, are more important than ever.   
   
From this moment on, Camp David will be remembered as a historic place
where the Republic of Korea, the United States, and Japan proclaimed
that we will bolster the rules-based international order and play key
roles to enhance regional security and prosperity based on our shared
values of freedom, human rights, and rule of law.   
   
Today, we, the three leaders, held the very first standalone trilateral
summit marking a new chapter in our trilateral cooperation.  Today, we
have agreed on the Camp David principles that will function as the
enduring guidelines for our trilateral cooperation.  In addition, we
have developed the Spirit of Camp David, which is a document embodying
the vision of our trilateral cooperation and ways to translate our will
to cooperate into action.   
   
First of all, to facilitate the stable development of our trilateral
cooperation, we have built the institutional basis for the trilateral
cooperation at multiple levels and sectors.  In addition to making our
trilateral summit regular, we have agreed to have our governments’
personnel at all levels — including foreign ministers, defense
ministers, and national security advisors — meet every year to closely
coordinate our trilateral cooperation.   
   
In particular, we, the three leaders, have agreed to establish a
communication channel so we can swiftly coordinate and respond together
in case an urgent issue occurs in the region.   
   
Furthermore, to bolster our trilateral strategic cooperation in the
Indo-Pacific, our three countries will establish the ROK, U.S., Japan
Indo-Pacific dialogue, which will discover new areas of cooperation. 
Also, along with the economic security dialogue led by our three
countries’ NSCs, we have agreed to found a consultative body for
development policy coordination and also build cooperation frameworks in
various sectors including global health and women empowerment.   
   
We have also decided to hold our ROK, U.S., and Japan Global Leadership
Youth Summit to strengthen ties between our future generations.   
   
Second, we have agreed to step up our security cooperation to ensure our
people’s safety and peace in the region based on the now
institutionalized Cooperation Framework.   
   
First of all, to this end, we have consulted on practical ways to
cooperate, aimed at improving our joint response capabilities to North
Korea’s nuclear and missile threats, which have become sophisticated
more than ever.  The real-time sharing of DPRK missile warning data,
which was agreed upon during the Phnom Penh summit last November, will
be activated within this year.  And this will make a significant
progress in strengthening our three nations’ capabilities to detect and
track North Korea’s missiles.   
   
In countering the DPRK’s nuclear and missile threats, we concurred the
trilateral defense exercises were crucial.  As such, annual plans will
be established for the ROK, U.S., Japan drills we committed to.   
   
In the meantime, as North Korea funds its nuclear and missile programs
by exploiting labor and human rights, efforts to monitor and stem such
activities will be redoubled.  To deter the DPRK’s illicit funding
activities, a new trilateral working group on DPRK cyber activities will
be established.   
   
Moreover, Korea, the U.S., and Japan, in their pursuit of Indo-Pacific
strategies, oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by
force.  
   
Respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, the peaceful settlement
of disputes, among others, undergird a rules-based international order
that we resolve to safeguard by intensifying our collaboration.   
   
As part of such endeavors, our three nations agreed to support ASEAN and
Pacific Island countries with their maritime security capacity-building
efforts.   
   
Furthermore, to help Ukrainians regain freedom and pursue
reconstruction, we are determined to increase our three-way
coordination.   
   
Next, we, the three leaders, discussed how to work together to promote
shared prosperity and future growth.  First of all, in the field of
economic security directly linked to our national economies of the three
countries, we will work to expand our strategic partnership.   
   
To ensure global supply chain resilience and energy security, we pledged
to bolster our trilateral cooperation.  To manage global supply chain
risks, an early warning system will be established together.   
   
In addition, we decided to broaden our collaboration in the field of
cutting-edge technologies to secure future growth engines. 
Specifically, in AI, quantum, bio, and next-generation
telecommunications and space sectors, cooperation among our three
countries will deliver powerful synergies.   
   
Korea, the U.S., and Japan committed to have their national laboratories
expand joint R&D and personnel exchanges, providing a cornerstone for
the three countries’ leadership in science and technology innovation.   
   
Moreover, for the sake of shared prosperity in the Asia Pacific, in line
with the needs of ASEAN and Pacific Island countries, effective support
measures will be sought and implemented collectively.   
   
Today, we, the three leaders, affirmed our commitment to the trilateral
partnership towards a new era and possibilities thereof.  
   
Grounded in the core values of freedom, human rights, and the rule of
law, a strong alliance of values among Korea, the U.S., and Japan will
help build a world that’s more peaceful and prosperous by serving as a
sturdy foundation.   
   
Mr. President, I thank you once again for your hospitality.  Next time,
I hope that we will be reunited in the Republic of Korea.   
   
Thank you.  (Applause.)  
   
MODERATOR:  Distinguished guests, the Prime Minister of Japan.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  President.  
   
PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:  (As interpreted.)  Thank you.  First of all, in
Maui, Hawaii, wildfires caused devastating damage.  I express my
sympathy, and I really pray for the peace of those who have lost their
lives.   
   
In order to offer support, a total of $2 million worth of support by our
country has been decided.  And the full — the relief for the affected
people and for the earliest recovery of the affected areas, Japan will
proactively do our contribution.   
   
Today, I have visited Camp David, and the three of us have spent a truly
meaningful time.  I expressed my heartfelt gratitude to Joe for the kind
invitation.   
   
Together with Joe and President Yoon, this has been a precious
opportunity for myself to further deepen the relationship of trust and
confidence.  For the first time ever, instead of in the sidelines of
multilateral conferences, we have held the trilateral summit on a
standalone basis.   
   
Here at Camp David, numerous historical meetings have taken place.  And
it is a huge honor to have printed a fresh page in its history with this
meeting.   
   
The foundation of the trilateral collaboration are the solid, firm,
bilateral relationships.  The three of us have understood this more than
anyone else and have executed our understanding in practice.   
   
In January of this year, I visited the United States, and later,
President Yoon visited Japan in March and then to the U.S. in April. 
And in May, I myself traveled to South Korea, and we have bolstered our
mutual relationship.  
   
At the moment, the free and open international order, based on the rule
of law, is in crisis.  Due to Russia’s aggression of Ukraine, the
international order is shaken from its foundation.  The unilateral
attempt to change the status quo by force in the East and South China
Seas are continuing.  And the nuclear and missile threat of North Korea
is only becoming ever larger.  
   
Under such circumstances, to make our trilateral strategic collaboration
blossom and bloom is only logical and almost inevitable and is required
in this era.   
   
The three of us here today declare our determination to pioneer the new
era of Japan, U.S., ROK partnership.   
   
How we will advance the cooperation of our three countries going
forward, I will discuss from three perspectives.  
   
Firstly, the coordination between the Japan-U.S. and the U.S.-ROK
alliances will be reinforced, and trilateral security cooperation will
be brought to a new height.   
   
At this meeting, we agreed to hold the Japan-U.S.-ROK multidomain joint
exercises on an annual basis.  Furthermore, regarding the real-time
sharing of North Korea’s missile warning information that we agreed last
November, the initial steps have been implemented and an important first
step has been advanced towards the launch of the mechanism by the end of
the year.   
   
We also agreed on the establishment of the working group on North Korea
cyber activities, considered to be the source of finance for nuclear and
missile development and on other matters.   
   
The second point is the promotion of cooperation between the United
States, Japan, and South Korea and the expansion of their areas of
cooperation regarding the response to North Korea.   
   
In addition to strengthening regional deterrence and response
capabilities, the three countries agreed to strengthen cooperation for
the full implementation of sanctions and to work closely together in the
U.N. Security Council, where all three countries will be members in
2024.   
   
At the same time, we shared our recognition that the way is open for
dialogue with North Korea.  I then stated that the abduction issue is a
humanitarian issue with time constraints and once again received the
strong support of Joe and President Yoon for the immediate resolution of
this matter.   
   
We also agreed to work together through the Indo-Pacific dialogue and
the development cooperation to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific and,
in particular, to coordinate capacity-building support in the domain of
maritime security, particularly with regard to ASEAN and Pacific Island
countries.   
   
Furthermore, we agreed to promote cooperation in the field of economic
security, including critical and emerging technologies and supply chain
resilience.   
   
Third, developing a framework for trilateral cooperation.  This will
create a foundation for continuous and stable enhancement of
coordination among the three countries.   
   
After confirming that the three countries will promote multi-layered
cooperation at all levels, it was agreed that the trilateral summit
meeting will be held at least once a year.   
   
And likewise, the ministers of foreign affairs, defense, and national
security advisors will each also meet at least once a year.  And the
financial minister, as well as the industry and commerce ministers, will
be meeting.   
   
We will consider the Camp David principles issued today at a historic
turning point for the international community to be a new compass for
trilateral cooperation, and we will vigorously implement the concrete
cooperation outlined in the Camp David statement of Japan, ROK, and U.S.
on our partnership.   
   
Together with Joe and President Yoon, we will continue to work to
further strengthen the strategic partnership between the three countries
in order to safeguard a free and open international order based on the
rule of law.   
   
Thank you.  (Applause.)  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Thank you.  Now we have time for questions.  President
Biden, please select your reporter first.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Aamer, with the AP.  
   
Q Thank you, Mr. President.  I have a question for each of the leaders. 
They will be brief and — but related.   
   
President Biden, first for you: How confident should Asia be about a
robust American commitment to a nuclear umbrella when the Compa- —
Commander-in-Chief who preceded you and is looking to succeed you spoke
openly about reducing the U.S. footprint in the Korean Peninsula?  
   
President Yoon, how much confidence can Japan and the U.S. have about
Seoul’s long-term commitment to rapprochement when polls show the solid
majority of Korea disapproves of your handling and mending of the forced
labor issue?  
   
And, Prime Minister Kishida, what assurances can you give to your
country’s citizens who fear bolstering your security cooperation in this
matter could lead to — the country into an economic cold war with
China?  
   
And if you’ll indulge me, Mr. President, on a domestic matter: What is
your reaction to the Special Counsel appointment last week into your
son?  
   
Thank you.   
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  (Laughs.)  Well, first of all, look, there’s not much,
if anything, I agree on with my predecessor on foreign policy.  His
America First policy, walking away from the rest of the world, has made
us weaker, not stronger.  
   
America is strong with our allies and our alliances, and that’s why we
will endure.  And it’s a strength that — quite frankly, that increases
all the — three of our strengths.  
   
This is just about one summit.  What makes today different is it
actually launches a series of initiatives that are actually
institutional changes in how we deal with one another — in security
cooperation, economic cooperation, technology cooperation, development
cooperation, consultation exercises.  And all of this will create
(inaudible) momentum, I believe, year by year, month by month, to make
the relationship stronger and more certain to remain to be in place.   
   
And with regard — on these esult- — results, I think you’re going to
keep it going.  And I think you’re going to benefit all our
countries.   
   
And with regard to the second question, I make — I have no comment on
any investigation that’s going on.  That’s up to the Justice Department,
and that’s all I have to say.   
   
PRESIDENT YOON:  (As interpreted.)  To the question that was directed to
me, I would like to say that the treaty made between Korea and Japan
that was made in 1965 and the following measures by the government and
the Supreme Court’s ruling in 2015 have some differences.  But we have
already implemented measures to bridge the gaps among them.   
   
And in South Korea, of course, there is public opinion that is opposed
to the government’s measures like that.  However, from a perspective
that’s forward-looking, strengthening ties and improving relationships
between Korea and Japan are important and there is a shared
understanding that this matters to our bilateral relationship, as well
as our future.  And this is something we need to continue working on.   
   
PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:  (As interpreted.)  Thank you for the question. 
First of all, at today’s meeting, the rules-based international order
and activities inconsistent to such rule-based international order and
activities. Other concerns have been shared, and the rule-based, free
and open international order must be defended.  And going forward, the
U.S., Japan, ROK strategic collaboration will be reinforced even
further.  Such endeavors will continue going forward.  
   
Our country and for the surrounding countries, the response
capabilities, as well as defense capabilities, will be bolstered.  And
by doing so, the lives and livelihood of our population will be
protected and the sense of assurance must be raised.  These are the
important activities.   
   
Having said that, with regard to China, last year, in November, there
was the Japan-China Leaders Summit, and there was a positive momentum. 
By maintaining the positive momentum, what has to be asserted will be
asserted.  And we shall strongly request responsible conduct.  And we
will continue an accumulative conversation about multiple issues.  We
will cooperate with regard to common challenges.  Such constructive and
stable relationship will be established by mutual effort.   
   
That is my administration’s consistent policy.  Based on this perception
towards regional stability, our efforts will continue.   
   
Thank you.   
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  President Yoon, next question, please.   
   
PRESIDENT YOON:  (As interpreted.)  Please go ahead and ask a question. 
The reporter from Money Today — reporter named Jongjin Park.  Please go
ahead with your question.  
   
Q    (As interpreted.)  Hi, I’m Jongjin Park of Money Today.  First of
all, I would like to ask a question to President Yoon Suk Yeol of the
Republic of Korea.  I heard that you said that a new chapter has opened
in our trilateral cooperation with the two countries.  Compared to the
previous summits, what would be the most significant outcome that you
gained through this summit?  
   
And also, from the perspective of our people, what would be the benefit
that the people of Korea would feel from these strengthening of ties?  
   
And now my question goes to President Biden.  During this summit, the
issues of detainees or prisoners of wars — and you mentioned that there
will be further cooperation in these human rights issues.  And you also
said you will support the free and peaceful Korean Peninsula in the
region.  And what kind of shift would there be in your policy?  And what
kind of specific solutions do you have in this regard?  
   
Lastly, I would like to direct my question to Prime Minister Kishida. 
Today, we had a historic trilateral summit.  However, there was much
backlash and many concerns in Korea.  However, President Yoon showed his
political courage to do so.  That’s the international community’s
evaluation.   
   
However, there are still concerns that Japan is making very passive
efforts to resolve our issues that still remain.  And also, how would
you be able to show your truthful willingness to resolve and improve our
bilateral relations going forward?  
   
PRESIDENT YOON:  (As interpreted.)  First of all, this trilateral
cooperation amongst our three countries has opened a new chapter, and we
made that announcement today to talk about the differences from the past
cooperation.   
   
For instance, in the past, it was about individual issues that we sought
cooperation among ourselves.  But now, as we have opened a new chapter
in our cooperation for security, economy, science and technology, and
development cooperation for the Global South, health, and women — across
all of these issues, our three countries decided to closely work
together.  So it’s much more comprehensive in nature.   
   
Such comprehensive cooperation has been launched by us today because
currently we face complicated crisis and the threat from the DPRK.  And
across the world, we believe that we can together make a contribution to
freedom and peace around the world.   
   
So that is our foundational understanding and our common and shared
interests of the three countries.  And not just for exclusionary
interests of ourselves.  Our interests are well aligned with the
universal interests of the members of the global community.  That’s
where we find our shared interests lie.   
   
And at the same time, this framework of comprehensive cooperation among
our three countries will contribute to global supply chain resilience,
global financial market stability, cooperation in the frontier
technology sectors and science.   
   
Our three countries together have the best-in-class expertise in science
and technology.  And we are the ones who are implementing liberal
democracies.   
   
Naturally, progress in science and technologies will bring benefits —
tangible benefits to our people, not just in terms of security, but also
in terms of economy and science and technology.   
   
But what is most important here is not about our own interests only. 
When we put our forces together, I believe that we can make a
contribution to the advancement of freedom and peace in the world.  And
that’s exactly where our interests are aligned.   
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  I — look, back in May of 2022, I met with the families
of the Japanese abductees during my visit, heard their stories, and
empathized with them and got a sense of the pain they’re feeling.  It’s
real.   
   
We know there are many families out there who still wait and worry and
wonder.  We’re not going to forget about them or their loved ones.   
   
And there’s clear language on this on our joint statement.  The bottom
line is this: that we share a common position.  We’re committed to
working together to see the return of all prisoners of war and — and
those who’ve been abducted and detained.   
   
And by the way, one of the things we get asked many times — and it
wasn’t directly asked, but implied — is what makes us think any of this
is positive.   
   
Success brings success.  When other nations see cooperation in the
region, they make judgments about: Would they be better off if they made
commitments?  Will they move?  
   
Think about — as students of history, all of you — and you are — think
about how many times successes have generated other successes when you
don’t anticipate it.   
   
And so, I — I just think this is a — we’re not going to forget, we’re
not giving up, and we’re going to continue to make the case for the
freedom of all of those detainees.   
   
PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:  (As interpreted.)  With regard to your question
for me, first of all, I have strong feelings about strengthening
bilateral relationships between the ROK and Japan.  I share that with
President Yoon.  The two countries, in dealing with international
challenges, should cooperate.  We’re both important neighboring
countries.  And so, friendship with President Yoon and a relationship of
trust, based on this, both countries as partners should open up a new
era.  And that is my thinking.   
   
This year, President Yoon came to Japan, and I visited the ROK.  At
international fora, we have repeated meetings — we have had repeated
meetings.  And between our two countries, including the economy and
security, we’ve had forward-looking and concrete approaches which were
started.  It’s already in motion, dynamically.   
   
Economic security dialogue was started — or it has been decided on.  In
the area of export control, there have been progress.  And also
financial ministers and defense ministers have had meetings.   
   
And so, we’ve had this very positive, forward-looking developments.  And
these are seen not only in the public sector.  Also in the private
sector, we see a slate of developments, human exchanges, and exchanges
between business circles.  We’re seeing very active developments in all
of these areas, and that is a reality.  
   
Going forward, we hope to accumulate these approaches along with
President Yoon to strengthen our bilateral relations even further.  By
generating results, we hope that people will understand Japan’s feelings
towards our bilateral relations.  And we’d like to continue such
efforts.   
   
Thank you.   
   
Thank you very much.  Then, let me see.  From Kyodo — Tajiri-san, Kyodo

Q    (As interpreted.)  Tajiri, Kyodo News.  At Camp David with
history.  I do have a question to each of the leaders.  
   
President Biden, it was mentioned at this summit meeting that Russia’s
aggression of Ukraine is continuing.  So, what role do you expect of
Japan?   
   
Prime Minister Kishida has mentioned that as China’s threat in Asia is
rising, Ukraine may be East Asia tomorrow.  What do you think about this
comment, President Biden?  
   
And the situation in Asia, where China’s threat is rising — what is the
meaning and significance of the trilateral relationship with Japan,
U.S., ROK becoming stronger in multiple layers?  
   
President Yoon Suk Yeol, I have a question to Your Excellency.  North
Korea’s nuclear missile development is a major security threat to Japan,
South Korea, and the U.S.  As North Korea’s provocations continue to
escalate, what is the meaning and significance of the three countries
declaring a new era of partnership?  
   
Regarding the release of treated water at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear
power plant, did Prime Minister Kishida explain the matter at the
trilateral or the bilateral summit today?  
   
To the recent Japan-ROK summit meeting, Your Excellency, you expressed
your intent to respect the IAEA report despite the strong domestic
opposition.  Why do you demonstrate your understanding for the policy of
Kishida administration?  I ask for that reason.  
   
And to Prime Minister Kishida, this is the first time that a trilateral
summit is held on a standalone basis rather than on the sidelines of
international meetings.  You have said that the trilateral cooperation
will be raised to new heights for the security environment in East
Asia.  And without the resolution of abduction, North Korea is
continuing nuclear missile development.  What is the meaning for North
Korea?  
   
And in eastern South China Seas, by maritime advancement, China is
continuing unilateral attempts to change the status quo.  What is the
meaning for China?  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  And you have a great imagination.  One question ends
up being six.  But, thank you.  I’ll try to answer all of it. 
(Laughter.)  I’m glad I didn’t have you as my law professor when he said
“one question.”  (Laughs.)  At any rate, they’re all legitimate
questions.   
   
Look, on Ukraine, I and my country and the leadership of my country in
both parties are very grateful for everything Japan is helping to deal
with in Ukraine.  And I mean that sincerely.  You’ve showed strong
leadership through the G7 as well and contributed to a significant
amount of financial and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, as well as
nonlethal military equipment.   
   
And, you know — and they joined so many other nations in holding Russia
accountable through their international sanctions.   
   
If my memory serves me well — and I think it does, Mr.  Prime Minister —
we found ourselves in a circumstance where, when I called you about
Ukraine, I didn’t have to convince you of anything.  I started off to
make the case that Ukraine was a circumstance where — to think, in the
first quarter of the 20th century, another country would amass over
150,000 forces on the border of another country — or 150,000 forces and
invade that country — invade that country without any rationale other
than — if you read Putin’s speech after he invaded, he talked about Kyiv
being the motherland.  You know, I mean, it just was ridiculous, I
think.  And he talked about being Peter the Great.  It was —  
   
Just imagine if we had done nothing.  Imagine if we had done nothing.   
   
And the point was immediately recognized, if I’m not mistaken, by you,
Mr. Prime Minister, that we’re  
in a situation where it could happen anywhere.  If we stand — if we had
stood still, what signal would that send to China about Taiwan?  What
signal would that send around the world if nations weren’t powerful on
borders?  
   
But here’s the deal.  You contributed significantly to what, I think, is
already the —  
   
Let me put it this way.  Russia has already lost.  It cannot meet its
original objective which it stated.  It’s not possible.   
   
But — and they’ve joined so many other nations in holding Russia
accountable for international sanctions.  But Japan’s leadership, from
day one, it has been critical for making it clear that the consequences
for war extend well beyond Europe — well beyond Europe.  
   
I say it in reverse.  What would happen if an Asian country with 150,000
troops invaded another?  You think that would not affect the interests,
the economy, and — and the foreign policy of nations in Europe and Latin
America all across the world?  It would have profound impact.  
   
And with Japan’s leadership, from day one, it has been critical to
making clear the consequences of this will extend well beyond Europe —
well beyond Europe.  It’s a global issue that has impacts everywhere. 
And the Prime Minister’s comments at Shangri La capture that.   
   
And by the way, you know, we talked about this being an inflection
point.  The world is changing.  The world is changing.  And about every
six or seven generations, it makes significant change.  And there’s a
lot happening.   
   
And the idea that we’re going to sit down, the rest of the world, and
say, “Well, that’s only a European problem.”  There hasn’t been that
kind of invasion since World War Two.   
   
And so — as for peace, we all want that, of course.  Ukrainians want it
most of all.  And my team has been working very closely with the —
President Zelenskyy’s team and further peace formula, noting that
“nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.”  
   
But nonetheless, we’re meeting with them constantly — constantly.   
   
And your other two questions about China — I’ll just say this: This
summit was not about China.  That was not the purpose of the meeting. 
But it did come — China obviously came up.  Not to say we don’t share
concerns about the economic coercion or heightened tensions caused by
China, but this summit was really about our relationship with each other
and deepening cooperation across an entire range of issues that went
well beyond just the immediate issues we raised.   
   
It was about more peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific — a region, quite
frankly, that would benefit everyone living there and around the world
if we get it right.  It’s not just here.  It has a phenomenal impact.   
   
Think about what’s — at any rate, I won’t get going.  I’ll take too
long.   
   
But as you’ve seen from the initiatives we’re announcing here, today is
just how committed we are to see this vision take place.  And I think
this relationship that we put together and I think we’re going to —
you’re going to see it expand.  It’s not merely what we did today.  This
is a historic meeting.   
   
But we’re about to — we’ve laid in place a long-term structure for a
relationship that will last and have a phenomenal impact not just in
Asia, but around the world.   
   
Someone once said in a different context that — about a health- — a
healthcare provision in my country a while ago: This is a big deal. 
This is a big deal.   
   
Thank you.   
   
Q    President Biden, how soon do you anticipate meeting with President
Xi —  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  They have to answer their questions.  
   
PRESIDENT YOON:  (As interpreted.)  Yes, let me address the questions
directed to me.   
   
First, as to North Korea’s nuclear and missile provocations and the
threats that are posed and how we plan to counter those threats together
among our three countries, let me address that question.   
   
Of the cooperative frameworks among our three countries is the most —
what is most symbolic out of those is our cooperation in defense area. 
Any provocations or attacks against any one of our three countries will
trigger a decision-making process of this trilateral framework, and our
solidarity will become even stronger and harder.   
   
And at the same time, missile information will be shared in a real-time
basis, and systematic training and drills will be implemented in
accordance with systematic annual schedules, regular schedules, and
regular trainings that we plan to carry out together against the DPRK’s
missile provocations.  That will be our response.   
   
And at the same time, regarding your question concerning the water
release from the Fukushima plant, as a matter of fact, that issue was
not addressed during our summit because it was not on the agenda.   
   
But still, let me try to address that question.  The Fukushima plant’s
treated water, if it’s going to have some type of impact, it would flow
through the entire Pacific Ocean having an impact not just on our three
countries, but all countries around the world.   
   
As such, for the sake of safety and health of the people of our three
countries and all members of the international community, that should be
something that we need to place the highest priority on.   
   
Regarding this treated water, based on scientific principles, all of the
processing should be carried out accordingly.  And at the same time,
internationally recognized and reliable IAEA’s investigation results are
something that we can trust.   
   
And I would like to make sure that everything is conducted and carried
out in accordance with the procedures established by the IAEA.  Together
with the international community and also together with the Koreans,
transparent data disclosure would be necessary, in my opinion.   
   
PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:  (As interpreted.)  Thank you.  The question to
myself.  As you mentioned, nuclear and missile development by North
Korea or unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the East and
South China Seas are ongoing.  And the security environment surrounding
our three countries, it has becoming increasingly harsh day after
day.   
   
Under this backdrop, on this occasion, we agreed to enhance the
coordination between the U.S.-Japan and the U.S.-ROK alliances and to
bring the trilateral security cooperation to new heights.   
   
This is indeed the requirement of this era.  And by this summit, I am
sure that the trilateral security cooperation will further advance and
reinforce the regional peace and stability.  
   
In particular, with regard to North Korea, we were able to put forward
concrete results, such as the implementation of annual Japan, U.S, ROK
multidomain and joint exercises and the establishment of a working group
to address North Korea’s cyber activities.   
   
I also stated that the abduction issue is a humanitarian issue with time
constraints.  And Joe and President Yoon reiterated their strong support
for the immediate resolution of this matter.   
   
We also shared our recognition that the path to dialogue with North
Korea is open.   
   
Furthermore, once again, the presidents of both countries aligned with
me in strongly opposing unilateral changes to the status quo through the
use of force.  
   
We will continue our efforts to further strengthen the strategic
partnership among the three countries in order to defend the free, open,
and international order based on the rule of law.  
   
That is all.  Thank you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  This concludes —  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  To answer your question, I expect and hope to follow
up on our conversation on Bali this fall.  That’s my expectation.  Thank
you.  
   
MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  This concludes our press conference. Please — please
stay seated as the — the leaders depart, please.  Please stay seated.  
   
Q    Mr. President, are you winning the competition with China?  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  We’re winning all the competition.
