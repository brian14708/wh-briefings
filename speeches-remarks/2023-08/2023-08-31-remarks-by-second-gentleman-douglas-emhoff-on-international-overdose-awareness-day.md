SECOND GENTLEMAN DOUGLAS EMHOFF: Thank you, Justin for that
introduction.  
   
We had the chance to connect earlier and previously. You told me all
about your son Aaron. And how you turned the pain of his loss into
advocacy.  
   
The work that you and your family are doing today in Indiana, and across
the country, is making such a difference.  
   
I also want to thank Dr. Gupta for his leadership and bringing us all
together. And a big thanks to your team for your important work.  
   
And to Dr. Cohen for your work on this issue.  
   
Last year, I sat with some of you and heard your stories. You told me
about your family members and loved ones who you had lost to this
overdose epidemic.  
   
I see a number of new faces too. I look forward to hearing from you.  
   
We talked about eliminating the stigma associated with overdoses and how
we need to approach those impacted with compassion.  
   
We also spoke about investing in mental health resources.  
  
I want you to know that your stories matter. The Biden-Harris
Administration is listening and taking action.  
   
The opioid crisis impacts everyone. All of you here are representative
of just how many different people this crisis touches.  
   
It impacts those who have never interacted with drugs before or someone
who has been struggling with substance use disorder for a long time.  
   
It doesn’t matter if you live in a red state or a blue state, families
across the country continue to be affected in devastating ways.  
   
As a father, I know how much we worry about our young people and their
exposure to dangerous substances.  
   
And with the growth of social media, it’s even harder to protect our
children from these harmful drugs.  
   
That’s why the work each of you are doing to raise awareness is so
critical.  
   
You are bringing the conversation to the forefront.  
   
You are leading information campaigns in communities to bolster
prevention. And you are helping families access the critical treatment
and recovery services they need.  
   
Your work is saving lives.  
  
I want you to know that the Biden-Harris Administration has your back.
Since day one, President Biden and Vice President Harris have made
defeating this epidemic a priority.  
   
Through the National Drug Control strategy, the Biden-Harris
Administration is investing billions to address addiction and the
overdose epidemic, and keep communities healthy and safe.  
   
And look at the results.  
   
Overdoses flattened last year for the first time after sharp increases
between 2019 and 2021.  
   
This flattening is estimated to have prevented 19,000 deaths last
year.  
   
More people are buying naloxone and are able to take critical steps to
heal and restart their life. Thanks also to the increased availability
of naloxone, people are able to save the lives of those they love
too.   
   
The Biden-Harris Administration partnered with the Ad Council on the
“Real Deal on Fentanyl” campaign, which educates young people on the
dangers of illicit fentanyl.  
   
The campaign has reached hundreds of millions of young people.  
   
Throughout her career, the vice president has been working to protect
our communities from dangerous substances.   
   
As attorney general, the vice president worked closely with those who
had lost children to this overdose epidemic. And she successfully went
after transnational organizations and held them accountable for their
role in drug trafficking.  
   
She has brought that expertise to the White House.  
   
President Biden and Vice President Harris are leading efforts to counter
this crisis.  
  
They have convened attorneys general, leaders in the medical and
business communities, and advocates to disrupt illicit fentanyl supply
chains and expand access to care for individuals at risk of an
overdose.  
   
The Biden-Harris Administration has made historic progress.  
   
But there is more work to be done.  
   
That’s why today, I am proud to announce that the Biden-Harris
Administration is investing an additional $450 million that will go
directly into local, state, and rural communities to strengthen
prevention, harm reduction, treatment, and recovery support services, as
well as supply reduction.  
   
This funding will support 164 community prevention coalitions to help
prevent youth drug use before it begins.  
   
This funding will also fortify our local law enforcement and improve our
efforts to keep these dangerous drugs out of our communities.  
   
And this investment will strengthen the Biden-Harris Administration’s
Real Deal on Fentanyl campaign.  
   
President Biden and Vice President Harris are committed to ending this
overdose epidemic.  
   
We have seen progress these past couple years, and we know it’s because
of people like you coming forward and calling for action.  
   
But there is more to do and you are doing it.  
   
Each one of you here has taken your pain and turned it into purpose. And
our communities and our children are safer for it.  
   
So, thank you again for your leadership and inspiring all of us to
action.  
   
I look forward to hearing more about your experiences and how we can
continue to work together to build safer, healthier communities.  
   
Now, I want to turn it over to someone who is helping us lead this
fight, the Director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Dr. Mandy Cohen.  
   
Thank you.
