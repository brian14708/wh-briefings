Q    Mr. President, are you concerned about a potential UAW strike, sir?

Q    Mr. President —

THE PRESIDENT:  I’ve been talking to the UAW.  Obviously, I’m
concerned.  I think that there should be a circumstance where the jobs
that are being displaced and replaced with new jobs, they should go to
the — the first choice should go to the UAW members that have had the
job and the salary should be commensurate.

Q    Mr. President —

Q    Have you seen Donald Trump’s mugshot yet?

THE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)

Q    Mr. President, are you worried at all about the —

THE PRESIDENT:  I — I did see it on television.

Q    What did you think?

THE PRESIDENT:  Handsome guy.  Won- — wonderful guy.

Q    With Prigozhin, what — what brought down his airplane?  Have you
gotten any solid information about that?

THE PRESIDENT:  I’m not at liberty to speak to that precisely.  But as
you know, because you and I have talked about this —

Q    Yes, sir.

THE PRESIDENT:  — I find no surprise in what happened.  But we’re trying
to nail down precisely.  I don’t have anything to say to you about that
right now.

Q    Okay.

Q    Mr. President, can you say anything about the uptick of COVID cases
and the new variant?

THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, I can. As a matter of fact, I signed off this
morning on a proposal we have to present to the Congress a request for
additional funding for a new vaccine that is ne- — necessary — that
works.  And tentatively — not decided finally yet — tentatively, it is
recommended that — it will likely be recommended that everybody get it
no matter whether they’ve gotten it before or not.

Q    What was your take of the Republican debate on Wednesday night?

THE PRESIDENT:  Let me choose my words.  I — I don’t — I don’t remember
them speaking to any of the issues.  I mean, there was a lot of talk,
but what are they going to do to deal with economic growth?  What are
they going to do to deal with the notion that — maintaining the job pace
that we have now?  What are they going to do deal with education?  They
talk about education like it was a — I mean, (inaudible) getting rid of
the Department of Education, cut 100,000 teachers.  I mean, I don’t — I
don’t quite get where they’re going.

I kept trying to figure out — I didn’t watch the whole debate.  I was on
a phone call for part of it.  But I — I didn’t learn much.

Q    Did you watch Trump’s speech with Tucker Carlson?

THE PRESIDENT:  No, I didn’t.  I didn’t have — (laughs) — I didn’t have
an interest or an inclination.

Q    Mr. President, on your — on your supplemental request to Congress,
there are some Republicans who want to split up the disaster aid and
Ukraine aid.  Is that a possibility to you at all to make sure some sort
of money passes Congress?  Because they have a concern with the Ukraine
aid.

THE PRESIDENT:  None.

Q    Mr. President, are you planning to sit for an interview with the
special counsel looking into the documents matter?

THE PRESIDENT:  I have — there’s no such request and no such interest.

MS. DALTON:  Thanks, guys.

Q    Thank you.

THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.

Q    How much of the debate did you see, Mr. President?

THE PRESIDENT:  I probably di- —

Q    An hour or so?

THE PRESIDENT:  I mean, I was in and out, getting a call.  But probably
what I saw consecutively — I probably saw at least an hour and 20
minutes of it.

Q    Well, that’s about most of it.  You got the gist of it.

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you know what I mean.  You know — no, I got the
gist.  (Laughter.)

MS. DALTON:  Thanks, guys.

Q    How are you liking Tahoe, sir?  How are you liking Tahoe?

THE PRESIDENT:  I tell you: If I had your biceps, I would feel better. 
(Laughter.)

MS. DALTON:  Okay.  Truly, thank you.

THE PRESIDENT:  I’ve been to Tahoe before.  Not here, but I’ve been out
here a number of times when Harry Reid was the Leader and a senator
campaigning for a lot of the candidates.

It’s magnificent.  It’s magnificent.

Thank you all so very much.

Q    Thank you.
