Oval Office

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, Mr. President, it’s great to welcome you back to
the White House.  It’s great to be by your side again.   
   
And I — just over a year ago, in California, we stood together with
partners across the region for the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration
and Protection, and you’ve done an incredible job since then.  You’ve
been a great partner.  
   
I want to thank you on the — for making that declaration possible and
for your leadership on the migration challenges that — that we face
every single day.  
   
But today, I also want to thank you for deepening our security
cooperation.  That’s one of my objectives today and, I hope, yours —
including dealing with organized crime.   
   
And as we discussed, our work through the Americas Partnership for
Economic Prosperity to help grow our economies from the bottom up and
the middle out, not just the top down.   
   
And — because our nations are not only united by the challenges we face,
but we’re united — what I’ve found with you, Mr. President, is we’re
united by the vision we share — by the vision we share.  A vision for a
future of greater opportunity and freedom and equality and, quite
frankly, dignity — dignity for all our people.  
   
So, Mr. President, thank you again for being here.  Looking forward to
our conversation today.  We’ve got a lot to talk about.  And I think
things are going to — nothing but better.  
   
PRESIDENT CHAVES:  May I, Mr. President?    
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Please.  
   
PRESIDENT CHAVES:  Thank you very much, President Biden, for the people
of Costa Rica.  It’s a great honor to be discussing with the leader of
the United States of America.   
   
I agree fully with your vision — the vision of the people of this great
country, where prosperity should be shared widely — generated and shared
widely.  And that we have challenges to the generation of that
prosperity and the quality of life of our people, including security.   
   
And the moves that the United States is making to make the supply chains
safe to keep your economic prosperity going, uninterrupted by other
outside events, I think, is something that Costa Rica is proud to be
part of.  Thank you for being — making us part of the CHIPS Act
arrangements.  
   
And I can affirm you, Mr. President, that Costa Rica has been and shall
remain one of the strongest allies in the world regarding your economic
and security interests that are our own.   
   
So, it’s a great pleasure to be here, sir.   
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  I’m looking forward to our discussion.  
   
PRESIDENT CHAVES:  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  
   
Q    Mr. President, your message to the people in Florida about the
hurricane — the hurricane in Florida, Mr. President?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I spoke with the governor last night.  We’re providing
everything that he possibly needs.  We’re in constant contact.   
   
I had the director of FEMA in here today earlier talking about it.  It’s
— there is going to be — I think we’re worried about the — the surge —
the ocean surge.  We don’t know exactly yet.  It’s hour-to-hour we’re
watching this.   
   
And — but I told the governor that — and the mayor and — the regions
that are likely to be hit first — that we’re there as long as it takes. 
We’re going to make sure they have everything they need.   
   
Thank you.
