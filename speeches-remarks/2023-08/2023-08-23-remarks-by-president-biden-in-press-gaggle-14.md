     Q    Mr. President, do you have a reaction to the plane crash in
Russia?

THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, but I’m going to be a little —

     Q    Say again?  What the — Prigozhin apparently killed.

THE PRESIDENT:  You may recall when I was asked about this by you, I
said I’d be careful what I drink and what I rode in.  And I — I don’t
know for a fact what happened, but I am not surprised.

Q    Do you think Putin is behind this, sir?

THE PRESIDENT:  There’s not much that happens in Russia that Putin is
not behind, but I don’t know enough to know the answer.  I’ve been
working out for the last hour and a half.

Q    Will you watch the debates later?

THE PRESIDENT:  I’m going to try to see — get as much as I can, yes.

Q    What’s your expectation for the GOP debate tonight?

THE PRESIDENT:  I have none.  (Laughs.) 

Thank you all.
