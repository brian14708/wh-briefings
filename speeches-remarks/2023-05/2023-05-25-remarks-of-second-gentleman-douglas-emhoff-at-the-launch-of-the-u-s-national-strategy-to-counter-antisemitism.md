SECOND GENTLEMAN DOUGLAS EMHOFF: Good morning.  
   
I want to thank President Biden, and my wife, Vice President Harris the
comprehensive actions that they are taking to confront antisemitism,
bigotry, and hate in all its forms. That is true leadership.  
   
Right now, antisemitic hate crimes in the United States are occurring at
the highest rates on record.  
   
Hate crimes against Jews account for 63 percent of all religiously
motivated hate crimes in the United States, even though we make up just
over two percent of the overall population.  
   
At its core, antisemitism divides us, erodes our trust in government,
institutions, and one another. It threatens our democracy while
undermining our American values of freedom, community, and decency.  
   
Antisemitism delivers simplistic, false, and dangerous narratives that
have led to extremists perpetrating deadly violence against Jews.  
  
I know the fear, the pain, the anger that Jews are living with because
of this epidemic of hate.  
   
We’ve all heard the stories. And we know what they are:  
   
The students who’ve had Swastikas drawn on their desks at school.  
   
The parents who faced slurs and obscenities as they dropped their
toddlers off at preschool.  
   
The murder of eleven human beings at the Tree of Life in Pittsburgh.  
   
No one should have to live in fear because of who they are.  
   
And as the first Jewish spouse of a United States President or Vice
President, let me say this: we cannot stay silent. I will not remain
silent. I will not stand idly by and allow antisemitism to poison our
society.  
   
Last December, I hosted a roundtable at the White House with Jewish
community leaders to discuss the rise of antisemitism across our nation
and what we can do to counteract it.  
   
A few days later, President Biden established an all-of-government group
to combat hate and develop a national strategy to counter
antisemitism.  
   
Then, in January, I traveled to Poland with Ambassador Lipstadt to
commemorate International Holocaust Remembrance Day. We also traveled to
Germany to meet with special envoys from across Europe to learn about
their plans to safeguard Jewish heritage and combat hatred of Jews.  
   
The trip was also personal to me. My great grandparents escaped
persecution from what is now Poland around 120 years ago. I got to see
the home of where my family once resided before fleeing to the United
States.  
   
And while they were lucky to escape, there were so many others who
weren’t.  
   
My work continued after that trip. I spoke at the United Nations about
the scourge of antisemitism.  
   
I hosted conversations with many different groups: college students,
interfaith leaders, executives in the sports and entertainment
industries, and members of Congress. I also convened special envoys from
European countries here at the White House.  
  
I never would have thought that working on the safety and security for
Jewish Americans and Jews around the world would be my cause.  
   
But now more than ever, we must rise to the challenge, and meet this
moment.  
   
Today, I am proud to join my colleagues: Ambassador Susan Rice,
Ambassador Deborah Lipstadt, and Homeland Security Advisor Liz
Sherwood-Randall to release the National Strategy to Counter
Antisemitism.  
   
The strategy is rooted in President Biden and Vice President Harris’s
agenda to fight hate more broadly, strengthen our democracy, and protect
religious freedom.  
   
President Biden, Vice President Harris, and our entire administration
are taking bold action to fight antisemitism and foster Jewish life.  
   
The interagency group has mobilized more than two dozen federal agencies
and conducted listening sessions with more than 1,000 Jewish leaders,
faith leaders, and civil rights leaders.  
   
Through a whole-of-society approach, we will build coalitions and work
with key partners – Congress, state and local governments, civil
society, schools and academic institutions, the private sector, and
diverse religious communities – to prevent and combat antisemitism at
every level of society.  
   
In sum, this plan will save lives.  
   
Our work to counter antisemitism will not stop with the release of this
national strategy. We are dedicated to its implementation.  
   
Antisemitism is a threat to Jewish communities and all Americans. And it
can only be combated with united efforts.  
   
We are committed to making sure that everyone can live openly, proudly,
and safely in their own communities.  
   
It is on all of us to put an end to the visceral hate that we are seeing
across our nation. We cannot normalize this.  
   
Lastly, we must not forget the joy that comes from celebrating our
faith, celebrating our cultures, and celebrating our contributions to
this great nation. There is more that unites us than divides us.  
   
With that, I will turn it over to my good friend, Ambassador Rice.  
   
Ambassador: thank you for all the work that you have done throughout
your time in this administration – especially in these last few months
–for your work on this plan, which is meaningful to me, and Jews across
the world. Thank you for your service.
