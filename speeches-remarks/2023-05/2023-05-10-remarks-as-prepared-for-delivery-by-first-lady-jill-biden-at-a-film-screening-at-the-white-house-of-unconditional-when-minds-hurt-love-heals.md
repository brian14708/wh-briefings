The White House

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you, Nikki, for sharing your story with all of us. It was so
wonderful to meet your son Noah when we helped launch the Hidden Helpers
Coalition in 2021, and it’s an honor to welcome you back to the White
House, along with the Dole Caregiver Fellows.    
   
Richard, without your passion and persistence, this documentary wouldn’t
have been possible. Thank you for shining a light on families like
yours, families like Amy’s and Shane’s, whose stories you tell so
movingly. And we’re honored to have them with us today.   
   
Elizabeth, we are all so grateful for your tireless leadership of the
Elizabeth Dole Foundation and your advocacy for those who have served
and their loved ones.   
   
Missions end, wars may come to a close, but the sacrifices that your
families make continue. And even though you are proud of your
service—and I know that you are—that doesn’t mean it’s easy, especially
for those who help care for our wounded, ill, and injured veterans.   
   
Caregivers, you do what you have to do for the person you love. But I
know that you get tired of always having to be strong. I know you get
tired of feeling like you have to carry the weight of the world
alone.   
   
We’re here today because you’re not alone. Your president and I see you
and we are working every day to get you the support that you deserve.  
   
That’s why we launched Joining Forces, my White House initiative to
support our military and veteran families, caregivers and survivors.
It’s why Joe recently signed an Executive Order to make it easier for
caregivers to get the mental health services they need and for families
to get financial help when they have to give up time at work to care for
a loved one.   
   
Our troops and their families need to know that if they ever face
injuries or illness, we’ll have their back. We have your back.  
   
So, I’m so glad we could host this screening at the White House. And I
hope you enjoy this beautiful documentary.   
   
May God bless you and your families.
