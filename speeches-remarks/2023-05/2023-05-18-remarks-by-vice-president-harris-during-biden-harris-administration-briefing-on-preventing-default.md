*Via Teleconference*

  

12:49 P.M. EDT  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mayor Steve Benjamin, for your
leadership and all that you do on behalf of our administration.  
  
Hello, everyone.  I want to thank you all for joining us today.  You —
you can hear I have a bit of a frog in my throat.  Please forgive me. 
I’ve been talking about this issue a lot recently.  (Laughs.)  
  
On this call, we have community leaders, labor leaders, state and local
elected officials representing all 50 states and the territories.  And
you all are on this call, so — obviously because you are leaders.  You
are leaders in your communities, and you stay informed about what is
happening.  And for that reason, people turn to you when they need to
understand and make sense of it all.  
  
So, today we have come together to address a subject that impacts the
life of every American — the debt ceiling — to make sure America does
not default on its debt.  
  
As you all know, Republicans in Congress have threatened to cause the
United States to default on paying its debt.  And default would be
unprecedented.  It has never happened before.   
  
It would mean, if it happens, that it would be the first time in history
that the United States government would not pay its bills.  
  
Now, congle- — congressional Republicans claim they are threatening
default because they want to lower our nation’s debt.  
  
Okay, so let’s be clear: For Republicans in Congress, this issue is not
really about lowering our nation’s debt, because if they really cared
about lowering our debt, they would not — they would not also fight to
protect trillions of dollars in Trump tax cuts for the wealthiest
Americans and the biggest corporations, tax cuts that would add three
and a half trillion dollars —  
  
(The Vice President’s phone line is disconnected.)  
  
(Briefing participants resume the call.)  
  
(The Vice President’s phone line is reconnected.)  
  
MAYOR BENJAMIN:  Madam Vice President, are you back on with us?  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yes, I’m here.  I am here.  
  
MAYOR BENJAMIN:  Yes, ma’am.  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And tha- — thank you, Mayor.  
So, to complete my point, I will say, where we left off, was to talk
about the real stakes and issues that are at play.   
  
A default could trigger a recession, stop mil- — military paychecks, and
raise interest rates for years to come, and turn mortgage rates into a
situation where they would actually go up, credit card payments would go
up, and small business loans would be more expensive.  
   
It would also reduce the amount of money in your retirement accounts. 
So, for an average American close to retirement, their 401- — 401(k)
could lose over 20,000 hard-earned dollars.  
   
And a default would also put at risk programs that millions of Americans
rely on, including Social Security and Medicare.  
   
So, I think everyone here understands that the reason we have convened
you as leaders is because this is really a critical issue; it is not
some abstract policy debate.  And you only need look back to 2011 to
remember what it can mean right now.  
   
Back in 2011, we saw that even coming close to a default — even coming
close — can hurt our nation’s economy and families.  By coming close to
a default back then, prices in the stock market fell almost 20 percent
for more than a year.  Millions of people lost money out of their
retirement accounts.  It became more difficult for both small and large
businesses to secure loans, fill orders, and hire new workers because
the financial system was no longer confident that our nation could pay
its bills.  
   
By some estimates, there would be 1 million more jobs today in our
nation had that not happened.   
   
But be clear: All of that did happen.  And that was without an actual
default.  It happened just because we came close.  
   
So, all of this is obviously unacceptable, I’m sure to all of you and
certainly to me and to President Biden.  And we believe it is absolutely
unnecessary.  This does not have to be a crisis.  
   
Our position is clear and simple: Congress must act to prevent default. 
That is what Congress has done more than 70 ti- — I said 70 — 7-0 —
times since 1960.  And that is what it did three times under the
previous administration.  
   
America must pay our bills, just like you and your family and other
hardworking Americans do every single day, and Congress must not create
this crisis, which is why President Biden and I met with our four
congressional leaders Tuesday here at the White House.   
  
We had a productive conversation.  We believe that it occurred in good
faith, with all the leaders in that meeting agreeing that America will
not default.  
   
During that meeting, the President and the Speaker of the House
designated senior members of our teams who will continue to negotiate. 
They met yesterday, and they will continue to meet.   
   
And right now, we just need you, the leaders on this call, to do what
you always do and make sure your voices are heard.  Make sure members of
Congress know a default would not be acceptable under any
circumstances.  Talk with your friends, your neighbors, your colleagues,
and make sure they understand the real consequences a default would have
on their lives — immediate consequences — and do what you all on this
call, in particular, do best.  
  
Let’s organize, activate our communities, and remind folks of what’s at
stake and get the word out about why this issue is so important and why
Congress must act.   
   
And I’ll close with this.  In the United States of America, we pay our
bills.  People have to pay their bills, and our government has to pay
its bills.  Our nation has never defaulted on its debt, and it never
will with the support and the leadership of all of you on this call.  
   
I thank you.  I’m turning it back over to you, Mayor Benjamin.  And I
thank you for your leadership as well.  
   
Thank you all.
