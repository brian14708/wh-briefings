THE PRESIDENT:  Hey, everybody.  Well, I’m about to take off in a few
minutes, if you hear the helicopter out there, to Japan — not in the
helicopter, but to Andrews.  Anyway — and to meet with the leaders of
G7.  
   
America’s role in the world is vital, especially right now as we work
together with other countries to support Ukraine and take on the
challenges that demand international cooperation, from tackling the
climate crisis to strengthening the — the global economy.  
   
And before I leave, I wanted to say a word about the status of
negotiations with the Congressional leaders.  We had a productive
meeting yesterday and — with all four leaders of the Congress.  
   
It was civil and respectful.  And everyone came to the meeting, I think,
in good faith.  
   
I’m confident that we’ll get the agreement on the budget, that America
will not default.  And every leader in the room understands the
consequences if we fail to pay our bills.  And it would be catastrophic
for the — for the American economy and the American people if we didn’t
pay our bills.  
   
And I’m confident everyone in the room agreed, with the Speaker — from
the Speaker to the Majority Leader to the — Majority Leader in the House
and the Senate — excuse me — the Majority Leader in the Senate, the
Minority Leader in the Senate, as well as the Leader — the Democratic
Leader in the House, that we’re going to come together, because there’s
no alternative to do the right thing for the country.  We have to move
on.

And to be clear, this negotiation is about the outlines of what the
budget will look like, not about whether or not we’re going to, in fact,
pay our debts.

The leaders have all agreed we will not default.  Every leader has said
that. 

And I’m proud of the progress my administration has made.  We’ve reduced
the deficit in the first two years by $1.7 trillion in the first two
years.  And I’ve proposed a budget that will reduce another $3 trillion
over the next decade.  That includes more revenue by asking the wealthy
and large corporations to begin to pay — pay their fair share and
cutting subsidies that exist in the law now to Big Oil and Big Pharma.  
   
Yesterday, we all agreed that both the Speaker McCarthy and I would
designate senior members that we would negotiate to give our authority
to make agreements and detail on what we wanted.   So we narrowed the
group.  We narrowed the group to meet and hammer out our differences.  
   
And we’ve done that.  In fact, they’ve met last night, and they’re going
to be meeting again today.  And — and I’ll be in constant contact with
my team while I’m at the G7.  And I’ll be in close touch with Speaker
McCarthy and other leaders as well.   
   
Now, what I have done in anticipation that we won’t get it all done
until I get back is I’ve cut my s- — trip short in order to be — for the
final negotiations and sign the deal with — with the Majority Leader.  
   
I made clear that — and I’ll say it again: America is not a deadbeat
nation.  We pay our bills.   
   
The nation has never defaulted on its debt, and it never will.  
   
And we’re going to continue these discussions with Congressional leaders
in the coming days until we reach an agreement.  And I’ll have more to
say about that on Sunday, when I’m going to have a press conference on
this issue.  
   
As it stands now, the intention is to go to the G7, be back here on
Sunday, hold a press conference.   
   
And in the meantime, I’m going — I’ve spoken to the Australian leader
Albanese, and I’ve spoken to — I’m going to be seeing him at the G7. 
He’ll be there as well, along with the Indian Prime Minister and along
with the Japanese as well.  So the Quad members will be there.  We’ll
get a chance to talk separately at the meeting, but it’s unlikely I’m
going to be going on to Australia.   
   
So, thank you very much.  
   
Q    Mr. President, what about work requirements specifically are you
still considering?  It sounds like it’s still on the table and you
haven’t ruled it out.  Which would you be willing to accept?   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’m not — they’re — I’m not going to accept any
work requirements that’s going to impact on medical health needs of
people.  I’m not going to accept any work requirements that go much
beyond what is already — what I — I voted years ago for the work
requirements that exist.  But it’s possible there could be a few others,
but not anything of any consequence.  
   
Thank you.  
   
Q    What message does this send —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  That we’re —  
   
Q    — to PNG and Australia?  I know that it was important to you to
focus on Asia on this trip, but this is having to be put aside.  Does
this — is this almost a win for China?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No.  No, because we’re still meeting.  We still have
four good allies.   
   
Q    Mr. President, do you intend to speak with President Xi soon,
sir?   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s my — whether it’s soon or not, but we will be
meeting.
