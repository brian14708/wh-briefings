  \ Uvalde,\_Texas"

THE PRESIDENT:  Before I begin — well, I’m beginning, but — I realize
this is a really tough day for all the families.  Remembering is
important, but it’s also painful.  
   
One year ago today, Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, turned into
another killing field in America.   
   
A few days later, Jill and I traveled there and stood before those 21
crosses that were outside the school.  On each cross, a name — like in
these candles behind us — of 19 children — 9, 10, 11 years old — and 2
devoted educators, and 17 more injured.  We spent hours with the
grieving families who were broken and never, ever will quite be the
same.     
   
To the families of the children and to the educators who — we know that,
one year later, it’s still so raw for you.  A year of missed birthdays
and holidays, school plays, soccer games, just that smile.  A year of
everyday joys gone forever.  The bend in his smile.  The perfect pitch
of her laugh.   
   
At a vigil a few months later, one of the moms said, “When I lay in bed
and turn on my side, envisioning her staring back at me, I want so badly
to be part of an alternative reality that just doesn’t exist.  This is
my reality, because my 10-year-old daughter was murdered in her
fourth-grade classroom.”  
   
Standing there in Uvalde, Jill and I couldn’t help but think that too
many schools, too many everyday places have become killing fields in
communities all across — every part of America.   
   
And in each place, we hear the same message: Do something.  For God’s
sake, please do something.   
   
We did something afterwards, but not nearly enough.  We still need to
ban, in my view, AR-15 firearms and assault weapons once again.  You
know, they’ve been used time and again in mass killings of innocent
children and peoples.   
   
We need to ban high-capacity magazines — the ability to shoot 20, 30,
40, 60 bullets without reloading.  Because today, guns remain the
number-one killer — the number-one killer of children in America. 
Guns.   
   
And over the last year since Uvalde, our country has experienced a
staggering 650 mass shootings and well over — it’s hard to say — well
over 4- — 40,000 deaths due to gun violence.   
   
We can’t end this epidemic until Congress passes some commonsense gun
safety laws that keep weapons of war off our streets and out of the
hands of dangerous people, until states do the same thing.     
   
How many more parents will live their worst nightmare before we stand up
to the gun lobby to establish universal background checks, establish
national red-flag laws, require safe storage of storage of firearms, and
end immunity from liability for gun manufacturers?  The only — the only
major corporate entities that doesn’t have — that’s immune to
liability.   
   
Even a majority of responsible gun owners support these commonsense
actions to save lives and keep our communities safe.   
   
So it’s time to act.  It’s time to act.  It’s time to make our voices
heard — not as Democrats or as Republicans, but as friends, as
neighbors, as parents, as fellow Americans.  And I’m being deadly
earnest when I say that.  
   
You know, I know, for a long time it’s been hard to make progress.  But
there will come a point where our voices are so loud, our determination
so clear that we can no longer be stopped.  We will act.   
   
You know, a year ago, after visiting the school, that same day, we
attended mass at Sacred Heart Catholic Church.  In the pews, families
and friends held each other tightly.  As the Archbishop spoke, he asked
the children in attendance to come up on the altar and sit with him as
he spoke on the altar.   
   
And there wasn’t enough room for everybody to go up on the altar, so a
mom and her young son sat next to us.  They had us in the first pew;
they sat next to us.   
   
As we left the church, a grandmother, who had just lost her
granddaughter, came up to us and quietly passed us a note — a
handwritten letter.   
   
And here’s what it read.  “Erase the invisible line that is dividing our
nation.  Come up with a solution and fix what’s broken and make the
changes that are necessary to prevent this from happening again.”  
   
My fellow Americans, you know — you’ve — you can — you can almost feel
the pain, for we’ve lost — we’ve lost children.  We have to do this to
save our children.  For the nation we love, to erase that invisi- —
invisible line.   
   
Jill and I stand here today as, earlier this morning, we were talking
about planning a memorial service this weekend celebrating the
anniversary of the death of our son, Beau.   
   
Well, guess what?  Everyone’s pain is different.  We, like many of you,
have some understanding what it’s like to lose a child on more than one
occasion.   
   
For those who have lost a loved one in Uvalde — to the moms, the dads,
the brothers, the sisters, and grandmoms, the grandpops, this is what I
know: One, they’ll never be gone from your heart.  They’ll always be
part of you.   
   
And I know this as well, as unbelievable as it sounds, I promise you a
day will come when you pass that ice cream store or you pass that park,
you pass that thing that brings back the memory of your son or
daughter.  It’s going to bring a smile to your lips when you think of
them before it brings a tear to your eye.    
   
That’s when you know you’re going to make it.   
   
And our prayer for you, from the bottom of our heart, is that day come
sooner than later — sooner than later.  But God willing, it will come. 
As I said, that’s when you know you’re going to make it.   
   
God bless those 21 blessed souls lost on this day in Uvalde.  And may
God bless their families.  We’re thinking of you.
