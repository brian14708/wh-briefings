Bethel, AK

  
Thank you, Mary. You’ve dedicated your life to lifting up the voices we
all need to hear. From Bethel to Washington D.C., you’ve never stopped
fighting for all Alaskans.  
  
First Lady Dunleavy, I am honored to be here with you. Thank you for
welcoming me back to your beautiful state and to Bethel.   
  
Secretary Haaland, you work every day to protect our environment,
support our families, and work with tribes across the country.   
  
I’d also like to thank Mayor Henderson, Ana, Vivian, and Walter for the
work you do to lift up communities in the Y-K Delta.  
  
And congratulations to the Bethel High School seniors graduating this
week!   
  
Two years ago, I had the opportunity to visit the Alaska Native Tribal
Health Consortium in Anchorage, where I met Valerie Davidson—the
president of the consortium and a daughter of Bethel. And through
Valerie and her team, I got to know this incredible state a bit
better.   
  
I saw how the connections here run deep—the bonds of family and
friendship, of tribes and traditions. I saw how acutely you are
connected to the natural world around you—from the migration of salmon
to the cycles of the sun. And yet, I also learned about the challenges
you face—and how communities in rural areas like this one often feel
unseen and unappreciated for their unique contributions to our
country.   
  
I took those stories home with me. I told them to my husband, Joe. And
he listened.    
  
That’s why he and his administration worked with your representatives in
Congress to invest over 100 million dollars in the Y-K Delta, and even
more statewide, so you can bring affordable, faster, more reliable
internet to Alaska. It’s a part of his Investing in America agenda and
how he’s rebuilding our country from the bottom up and the middle
out.   
  
This is one of the largest tribal broadband expansions in the country.
With high-speed internet, you’ll have better access to critical health
care, new educational tools, and remote job opportunities. It will
change lives. It will save lives.   
  
And it will help make our world a little brighter, a little more
beautiful.   
  
Because it’s not just about what you get from this, it’s also about what
you are able to give. To Alaska. To the United States. To the people
around the globe. As much as you need broadband, we need your wisdom,
your knowledge, your experiences. And because of this project you will
be able to share them.  
  
The funding is going directly to Bethel Native Corporation because you
know what your communities need.   
  
And I love the name that you’ve chosen for it.   
  
An Airraq isn’t the story itself. It’s a tool that helps us tell it. A
simple string that becomes a thing of beauty with the creativity and joy
and hope we bring to it. The connections of this community are already
deep. But with Airraq, you will be able to bring them to life in new
ways.    
  
During my last visit to this great state, Valerie gave me a Yupik
name—the name of her grandmother. It meant so much to me. And she told
me of something her grandmother used to say: “When you lead with love,
you never stand alone.”   
  
I feel so much love in this community today. Love for Bethel and the
people who make it home—for the language and heritage that has shaped
you— for the generations who stand behind you and live on in your
hearts— for the young people who are dreaming a brighter future for us
all.    
  
And you are not alone in this work. Joe, Secretary Haaland, and I—along
with the rest of the Biden-Harris administration—stand beside you,
today, tomorrow, and always.   
  
Quyana. Thank you.
