Capital One Arena  
Washington, D.C.

11:34 A.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you, Mr. President, for that introduction. 
Dr. Morse, thank you for the incredible honorary degree.  
   
And thank you, President Frederick, for the invitation and for your
leadership of your alma mater.  
   
Serena — Student Body President, College of Pharmacy, the class
speaker.  (Applause.)  And just remember, when you’re President of the
United States and they say, “Joe Biden is out in the waiting room to say
hello,” promise me you will not say, “Joe who?”  All right? 
(Laughter.)  You all think I’m kidding.  (Laughter.)  
   
To the distinguished faculty and staff, thank you for having me.   
   
And to the parents and families and the Class of ’23 — 2023:
Congratulations.   
   
And, by the way — (applause) — and, by the way, we will get to giving
you your degrees.  I promise that’s coming.   
   
You are here with the heart and through the heartache, through blood,
sweat, and tears of everything that’s came before, for everything yet to
come.  You are here at a new moment of hope and possibilities.  
   
But, graduates, before we begin, as mentioned many times, tomorrow is
Mother’s Day.  Stand for your mothers and grandmothers.  Stand and thank
them.  (Applause.)  
   
Where I come from, moms rule.  (Applause.)  
   
To my friend — and he is my friend — Congressman Jim Clyburn, the thing
that I admire most about you, Jim, is your absolute integrity in
everything you do — in everything you do.  This is a man of honor. 
(Applause.)  
   
I attended South Carolina State University’s commencement as Jim
received his degree he earned 60 years ago but never got a chance to
receive it in person.  
   
Jim, it’s an honor to join you here today and receive an honorary degree
from this great university.  
   
And it’s truly special — special to join fellow honorees.  Prime
Minister Rowley of — (laughs) — Prime Minister — Prime Minister, I
didn’t know you were so talented.  (Laughter.)  I just thought you were
foreign policies — you know, Latin American guy.  I — you know, I — we
got to talk.  (Laughter.)   
   
All kidding aside, thank you for being a strong partner in the Caribbean
and for addressing climate change and supporting democracies across the
Western Hemisphere.  
   
I’m also honored that — there’s a person here today, Dr. Tony Allen.  He
is President of my home state \[H\]BCU, Delaware State University, where
I got politically started.  (Applause.)   
   
I was fortunate to have Tony as a Senate staffer for a long time.  Then
he got his PhD, had a distinguished career in business, and became
president of an HBCU.  Now Tony chairs my White House Board of Advisors
on HBCUs, which is designed to support and advance HBCU excellence with
a lot more money.  (Applause.)  
   
I’m also proud to say that we’re the first White House to formally
convene where the real power is: the Divine Nine.  (Applause.)  Oh, you
all — you all think I’m kidding?  Not a joke.   
   
The Divine Nine not only has a seat at the table, we definitely hear you
at the table.  And they’re, first time ever, at the White House
permanently.   
   
So, folks, in 2023, I’m truly honored to be here at Howard.  
   
Chartered 156 years ago by an act of Congress just after Emancipation
and the Civil War.  Founded — founded on a hilltop in Washington, D.C. 
The Mecca.  The Mecca.  (Applause.)   
   
Always promoting, excellence, leadership, and truth and service.  It
really has.  And a proving ground for future leaders of science,
medicine, education, business, faith, arts, entertainment, and public
service.  Trailblazing intellectuals, lawyers, doctors.  The first Black
— I might say — Vice President of the United States of America. 
(Applause.)  You can say that again.   
   
Kamala sends her love.  And she sent a clear message that today I have
the privilege, as she points out, of speaking at the real H-U. 
(Applause.)  Now you realize that’s going to cost me at home. 
(Laughter.)   
   
This — there’s enormous pride in this university founded in the verses
of the Howard anthem.  And I quote, “Reared against the eastern sky,
proudly there on hilltop high… There she stands for truth and right,
sending forth her rays of light.”  It matters.  It matters.  It
matters.    
   
We’re living through one of the most consequential moments in our
history with fundamental questions at stake for our nation.  Who are
we?  What do we stand for?  What do we believe?  Who will we be?  You’re
going to help answer those questions.  
   
Let me take you back to January of 2009.  I stood in Wilmington,
Delaware, on the train station of Amtrak, carrying my folder waiting to
be picked up by a guy named Barack Obama.  (Applause.)  The first Black
man elected President of the United States.   
   
I was there to join him as Vice President on the way to the historic
inauguration in Washington.  A moment of extraordinary hope, but also,
as I stood there — and this is the God’s truth — I couldn’t help think
about another day I stood there.  
   
I wasn’t much more than your age.  I’d just got out of law school.  I
was a public — I had gone to work for a big firm, but my state — because
when Dr. King was assassinated, parts of it were — my city — parts were
burned to the ground.  We had a very conservative governor.  He
stationed the National Guard on every corner with drawn bayonets for 10
months.  I quit and became a public defender.  (Applause.)   
   
And I used to have to introduce my clients — no, that’s not so noble — I
had to interview my clients down at the Wilmington train station when
they were arrested.  On the east side — that’s where they’d be taken in
the aftermath of the riots that burned Wilmington following his
assassination.  
   
In 2009, while waiting for Barack, I was both living history at the same
time I was reliving it.  A vivid demonstration: When it comes to race in
America, hope doesn’t travel alone.  It’s shadowed by fear, by violence,
and by hate.  
   
But after the election and the re-election of the first Black American
President, I had hoped that the fear of violence and hate was
significantly losing ground.  
   
After being — no longer being Vice President, I became a professor at
the University of Pennsylvania for four years.  But in 2017, in
Charlottesville, Virginia, crazed neo-Nazis with angry faces came out of
the fields with — literally with torches, carrying Nazi banners from the
woods and the fields chanting the same antisemitic bile heard across
Europe in the ‘30s.  Something that I never thought I would ever see in
America.  
   
Accompanied by Klansmen and white supremacists, emerging from dark rooms
and remote fields and the anonymity of the Internet, confronting decent
Americans of all backgrounds standing in their way, into the bright
light of day.  And a young woman objecting to their presence was
killed.   
   
And what did you hear?  That famous quote.  When asked about what
happened, that famous quote.  “There are very fine people on both
sides.”  
   
That’s when I knew — and I’m not joking — that’s when I knew I had to
stay engaged and get back into public life.  (Applause.)  No, I — I
don’t say it for that reason.  I say it for the journey.   
   
I don’t have to tell you that fearless pro- — progress towards justice
often meets ferocious pushback from the oldest and most sinister of
forces.  That’s because hate never goes away.   
   
I thought, when I graduated, we could defeat hate.  But it never goes
away.  It ju- — only hides under the rocks.  And when it’s given oxygen,
it comes out from under that rock.   
   
And that’s why we know this truth as well: Silence is complicity. 
(Applause.)  It cannot remain silent.  We are live through this battle
for the soul of the nation.  And it is still a battle for the soul of
the nation.   
   
What is the soul of a nation?  Well, I believe the soul is the breath,
the life, the essence of who we are.  The soul makes us, “us.”  
   
The soul of America is what makes us unique among all nations.  We’re
the only country founded on an idea — not geography, not religion, not
ethnicity, but an idea.  
   
The sacred proposition rooted in Scripture and enshrined in the
Declaration of Independence that we’re all created equal in the image of
God and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives.  While we’ve
never fully lived up to that promise, we never before fully walked away
from it.  
   
We know that American history has not always been a fairytale.  From the
start, it’s been a constant push and pull for more than 240 years
between the best of us, the American ideal that we’re all create equal —
and the worst of us, the harsh reality that racism has long torn us
apart.  It’s a battle that’s never really over.  
   
But on the best days, enough of us have the guts and the hearts to st- —
to stand up for the best in us.  To choose love over hate, unity over
disunion, progress over retreat.  To stand up against the poison of
white supremacy, as I did in my Inaugural Address — to single it out as
the most dangerous terrorist threat to our homeland is white supremacy. 
(Applause.)  
   
And I’m not saying this because I’m at a Black HBCU.  I say it wherever
I go.   
   
To stand up for truth over lies — lies told for power and profit.   
   
To confront the ongoing assault to subvert our elections and suppress
our right to vote.  That assault came just as you cast your first
ballots in ‘20 and ‘22.  Record turnouts.  You delivered historic
progress.  
   
I made it clear that America — Americans of all backgrounds have an
obligation to call out political violence that has been unleashed and
emboldened.  As was mentioned already, bomb threats to this very
university and HBCUs across the country.  
   
To put democracy on the ballot.  To reject political extremism and
reject political violence.   
   
Protect fundamental rights and freedoms for women to choose and for
transgender children to be free.  (Applause.)  
   
For affordable healthcare and housing.  (Applause.)   
   
For the right to raise your family and retire with dignity.  
   
To stand with leaders of your generation who give voice to the people,
demanding action on gun violence only to be expelled from state
legislative bodies.  (Applause.)  
   
To stand against books being banned and Black history being erased. 
(Applause.)  I’m serious.  Think about it.   
   
To stand up for the best in us.   
   
And today, I come here to Howard to continue the work to redeem the soul
of this nation, because it’s here where I see the future.  And I’m not —
that’s not hyperbole.   
   
We can finally resolve those ongoing questions about who we are as a
nation.  That puts strength of our diversity at the center of American
life.  A future that celebrates and learns from history.  A future for
all Americans.  A future I see you leading.  And I’m not, again,
exaggerating.  You are going to be leading it.    
   
Again, let’s be clear: There are those who don’t see you and don’t want
this future.  There are those who demonize and pit people against one
another.  And there are those who do anything and everything, no matter
how desperate or immoral, to hold onto power.  And that’s never going to
be an easy battle.  
   
But I know this: The oldest, most sinister forces may believe they’ll
determine America’s future, but they are wrong.   (Applause.)  We will
determine America’s future.  You will determine America’s future.  And
that’s not hyperbole.  
   
No graduating class gets to choose the world into which they graduate. 
Every class enters the history of a nation up to the point it has been
written by others.  
   
But few classes, once in every several generations, enters at a point in
our history where it actually has a chance to change the trajectory of
the country.  You face that inflection point today, and I know you will
meet the moment.  I — just think about the many ways you already have.  
   
With your voices and votes, I was able to fill my commitment to put the
first Black woman on the Supreme Court of the United States of America. 
(Applause.)  And, by the way, she’s brighter than the rest. 
(Laughter.)  She is one bright woman.    
   
Because of you, more Black women have been appointed to the federal
appellate courts under — than under every other President in American
history combined.  (Applause.)  
   
And, by the way, I mean it.  I mean it.  Because of you.  Because of
you.  You turned out.  You spoke up.  You knew.  You showed up, and the
votes counted.  And you made people say, “Whoa, wait a minute.  What
price will I pay if I don’t do the following?”   
   
You feel the promise and the peril of climate change.  Because of you,
we’re making the biggest investment ever in the history of the world in
climate change.  Don’t ever think your voice doesn’t matter.   
   
I’m keeping my promise that no one should be in jail merely because of
using or possessing marijuana.  Their records should be expunged — just
expunged.  (Applause.)  
   
My student debt relief plan would help — (applause) — tens of millions
of people, especially those on Pell Grants.  Seventy percent of Black
college students receive Pell Grants.  Many of you, the savings would be
significant and even wiping out student debt completely for some. 
(Applause.)  
   
But — this new Republican Party is dead set against it, suing my
administration to stop you from getting student debt relief.  The same
opposition who received relief loans, I might add, to keep their
businesses afloat during the pandemic — members of the Congress — worth
thousands, even millions of dollars — most of which didn’t have to be
paid back.  Yet, they say it’s okay for them but not for you.  I found
it outrag- — find it outrageous.  
   
To reduce your debt service payments when you graduate, we’re also
ensuring that no one — no one with an undergraduate loan today or in the
future will have to pay more than 5 percent of their discretionary
income to repay their loans, down from 10.  And in 20 years, it’s gone. 
(Applause.)   
   
Republican officials are fighting that as well.  But I will always keep
fighting for you.  And many others will — and many in the Republican
Party as well will fight for you.   
   
But we also know there is more to do.  Because of your power, we took
the most significant law on gun violence — we passed it — the most
significant law in 30 years.  
   
But we will not give up.  I got the Assault Weapons Ban passed 30 years
ago, and we’re going to pass it again.  (Applause.)  We must pass it.   
   
And there’s more to do on police reform and public safety.   
   
During the State of the Union, I asked the rest of the country to
imagine having to talk to their children and their families like your
families had to talk to you.   
   
It’s about your security.  It’s about your dignity.  It’s demeaning and
degrading and deadly when you just have to stand there and say, “When
you’re stopped, turn the interior light on, put both hands on the wheel,
don’t reach for your license.”  What in the hell is going on in
America?  (Applause.)  No, think about it.   
   
I ask all the parents of non-minority children to ask what they would
say, what they would do.   
   
I know you’re frustrated that there are so many elected officials who
refuse to pass a law that will do something.  
   
Kamala and I stood next to the family of George Floyd and civil rights
leaders and law enforcement officials to sign the executive order I came
up with requiring the key elements of the George Floyd bill be applied
to federal law enforcement: banning chokeholds, restricting no-knock
warrants, establishing a database for police misconduct, advancing
effective and accountable community policing that builds public trust. 
And we’ll keep fighting to pass the reforms nationwide.   
   
Equal justice is a covenant we have with each other.  It must not just
be an ideal; it has to be a reality.   
   
You’re leading the way on this and so much more.  That’s why Kamala and
I are so committed to investing in you and HBCUs.  HBCUs help produce 40
percent of Black engineers; 50 percent of Black lawyers — (applause); 70
percent of Black doctors and dentists — (applause); 80 percent of Black
judges.  (Applause.)  
   
Look, we see HBCU excellence in every day, with staff at every level of
the White House and the administration, because I decided when I was
elected, I promised I was going to have my administration would look
like America.  (Applause.)  
   
But we all know that HBCUs don’t have the same endowments and funding as
other major colleges and universities.  For example, denying the
opportunity to build and fund research labs that will lead to new
technologies and good-paying jobs.  
   
That’s why I asked and we’ve invested $6 billion and counting in HBCUs,
including to create new research and development labs that prepare
students for jobs of the future in high-income fields, from
cybersecurity, engineering, biochemistry, healthcare.  
   
Standing here, I think the last time I came to Howard with President
Frederick and others was in my final year as Vice President to host the
Cancer Moonshot on campus, because you are leading the way.  You’re the
scientists, the doctors, the advocates who will bring — do big things
like ending cancer as we know it and even curing some cancers, which
we’re on our way of doing.   
   
You’re the diplomats and global citizens making democracy work for
people around the world.  Lawyers defending our rights.  Artists shaping
our culture.  (Applause.)  Fearless journalists.  This is real, though. 
You’re — this is what you’re doing.  Fearless journal- — journalists and
intellectuals pursuing the truth and challenging convention.  
   
You’re the leaders of tomorrow, but it’s coming on you really
quickly.   
   
Because of you, I see a future we can finally move away from the
narrowed and cramped view that the promise of America is a zero-sum
game: “If you succeed, I fail.”  “If you get ahead, I fall behind.”  And
maybe worst of all, “If I can’t hold you down, I can’t lift myself
up.”  
   
Instead of what it should be, “If you do well, we all do well.” 
(Applause.)  That’s what I see in you.  That’s what I see in America. 
And more Americans are — a future of possibilities for all Americans.   
   
Look, no matter — that future — what it holds, my sincere hope is that
each of you find a sweet spot between happiness, success, and ambition. 
That — a good life.  A life of purpose.  
   
Because here’s the thing: You don’t know where or what fate will bring
you or when.  You just have to keep going.  You have to just keep the
faith.  You have to just get up.   
   
And you can find the balance between ambition and happiness and success
— that good life of purpose, of family, and, as you know here at Howard,
of excellence, leadership, and truth and service.  There is no quit in
you.  There is no quit in America.  
   
So, let me close with this.  In our lives and in the life of the nation,
we know that fear can shadow hope.  But it’s also true that hope can
defeat fear.  
   
In January of 2021, I stood at the U.S. Capitol to be inaugurated as
President of the United States.  Just days before, on that very spot, a
violent inter- — insurrection took place.  A dagger at the throat of
democracy.  For the first time in our history, an attempt to stop the
peaceful transfer of power in this country.  
   
And they failed.  Our democracy held.  Again, hope prevailed. 
(Applause.)  
   
And this time, I was standing with a Black woman about to take a
two-mile procession down Pennsylvania Avenue as President and Vice
President of the United States of America.  
   
And who was marching alongside her?  The Howard University Marching Band
in lockstep and solidarity.  (Applause.)  You were.  
   
I give you my word as a Biden: Class of 2023, you’re the reason I’m so
optimistic about the future.  And I give you my word, I really mean it. 
You’re part of the most gifted, tolerant, talented, best-educated
generation in American history.  That’s a fact.   
   
And it’s your generation, more than anyone else’s, who will answer the
questions for America: Who are we?  What do we stand for?  What do you
believe?  What do we believe?  What do we want to be?  
   
I’m not saying you have to share this burden all on your own.  The task
at hand ahead is the work of all of us.  
   
But what I am saying is: You represent the best of us.  And that’s the
God’s truth.  You represent the best of us.   
   
Your generation will not be ignored, will not be shunned, will not be
silenced.   
   
So on the hilltop high, keep standing for truth and right, and send your
rays of light.  
   
Congratulations to you all.  We need you.   
   
God bless you.  And may God protect our troops.
