The Anthem  
Washington, D.C.

8:42 P.M. EDT

THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, hello, hello.  (Applause.)  My name is Joe Biden
— (applause) — and I’ve been working for a long time for Nancy
Pelosi.   
   
Please sit down if you have a seat.  
   
Madam President, thanks for letting me — letting me show up and la- —
last minute here.   
   
And, Whip Katherine Clark, thanks for letting me interrupt.  You’re
doing a hell of a job, and you’ve been a great partner — a great partner
helping us get so much done in Congress.  
   
And I want to wish happy birthday to my friend Mignon Moore.  Mignon,
are you here?  Mignon, it’s hell turning 30, but you’ll get used to it. 
(Laughter.)  
   
And I heard my friend, Nancy Pelosi, is being honored and I knew I had
to be here.   
   
I couldn’t miss a chance to be with all of you either.  I want to say
thanks to EMILY’s List for everything you’re doing and letting me crash
— and allowing me to crash tonight’s party.  I’m not going to stay long,
I promise.   
   
I honestly believe that — Nancy, I’ve been saying this for a long time,
and I mean it from the bottom of my heart: Nancy Pelosi is going to go
down in history as one of the most consequential speakers in the history
of the United States — (applause) — not merely because she’s a woman —
because she’s so incredible.  She’s such a —  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Woo!  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, no — with Nancy leading the way, you never had to
worry about whether the bill would pass.   If she said she had the
votes, she had the votes every time.  (Applause.)  
   
And she had to vote so many lifechanging pieces of legislation.  She
helped rescue the economy in the Great Depression; pass the Affordable
Care Act; ended Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.  Just since I took office, she
led the fight to help us pass the American Rescue Plan, the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act. 
She defended democracy, and she defended democracy in the wake of
January the 6th.  (Applause.)  
   
Look, she’s been a steadfast defender of women’s rights.  I need not
even mention that — the right to choose.  But I want to thank every
single person in this room for leading the way in that fight.  It’s a
critical fight.  It’s about democracy.  It’s about freedom.  
   
And I also want to thank my buddy, Kamala, who I work for in — up in the
White House, for leading on this issue.  (Applause.)  
   
Look, I don’t have to tell you how much is at stake.  That’s why your
work is so important.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  
   
And with that, I want to say just one more thing.  You know, there is a
— there’s a famous quote that is one that says, “What we’ve done for
ourselves” died with u- — “dies with us.  What we’ve done for others and
the world remains immortal.”    
   
One of the reasons why Nancy is going to be so, so well thought of in
history as well is what she’s done for everyone.  I mean it.  She’s a
game changer.  
   
And with that, it’s my honor to introduce — bring to the floor my good
friend, Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  (Applause.)  
   
SPEAKER PELOSI:  Now, let’s say together, “We are EMILY.”  We are
EMILY!  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  We are EMILY!  (Applause.)  Hey!  
   
If you notice, I do whatever she tells me.  Thank you.  Nancy, the floor
is yours.  Thank you, everybody, for letting me crash.  (Applause.)
