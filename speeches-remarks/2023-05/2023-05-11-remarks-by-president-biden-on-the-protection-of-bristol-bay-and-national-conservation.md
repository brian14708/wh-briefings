THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I tell you what — looking at the guys up front
here, having to put on ties when you’re — on a school day — (laughter) —
that’s a hard thing to do.  And all you lovely young ladies — you’re not
hot, are you?   
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  Well, I will try to make this mercifully
short.  But I think it’s pretty important.  
   
Thank you, Alannah, for the introduction and for all the work you did on
behalf of Bristol Bay, and all of you here.  And thank everyone joining
us today.  
   
The Second Gentleman is here, along with his parents, Mike and Barbara. 
(Applause.)  As they say in southern Delaware, you done good raising
that boy.  And thank you.  
   
And Deb Haaland, who is the Secretary of Interior — (applause) — a true
champion of conservation.  
   
Michael Regan, who’s done a terrific job as Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency.  (Applause.)   
   
And just this morning, he ent- — he announced a new proposal to cut
carbon pollution from coal- and gas-fired power plants.  This
announcement kicks off a public commitment to engage with labor and
industry and environmentalists and other experts to make sure we make a
major step forward in the climate crisis, protecting public health. 
(Applause.)  
   
We’re also joined by Tribal leaders and conservation advocates and
representatives of the business community who worked together for
decades to achieve something momentous for the people of Alaska, for all
Americans: the protection of Bristol Bay.  (Applause.)  
   
And, folks, we’re here to celebrate that achievement as part of my
administration’s land and water conservation agenda, the most ambitious
in American history.  
   
Bristol Bay is an extraordinary place unlike anywhere in the world.  Six
rivers meet there, traveling through 40,000 miles of tundra, wetlands,
and lakes, collecting freshwater and sediment along the way from some of
the most pristine land on the entire planet.  And that’s not
hyperbole.  
   
That freshwater empties into Bristol Bay, where every year tens of
millions of salmon return, making this the largest sock-eye salmon
fishery on all the Earth.  (Applause.)   
   
Folks, even in this age of climate change, the fish runs at Bristol Bay
are breaking records.  It’s a marvel.  Oh, it really is, when you think
about it — at least I — I was worried about this 10 years ago.  
   
The Alaska Native people have rallied and relied on this fishery for
millennia.  
   
Today, Bristol Bay supplies nearly half of the world’s wild sock-eye
salmon.  And it supports 1,000 — or 15,000 jobs — American jobs in
fishing, processing, and tourism.   
   
The economic value is estimated to be — to be $2.2 billion.  
   
This amazing thing about resources like this: If you take care of it, it
can go on forever.  But it’s impossible to put an economic price on
that.  
   
And the — you know, the opposite is true as well.  Once a resource like
this is harmed or destroyed, it may be impossible to bring it back
again.  
   
That’s why, decades ago, when mining companies made plans to create one
of the largest open-pit gold and copper mines in North America right
near the headwaters of Bristol Bay, folks were alarmed, including me.  
   
The mine — that mine would have destroyed 100 miles of streams and
nearly 3,000 acres of wetlands and open water that are critical to the
salmon breeding.  And it would have created billions of tons of toxic
and dangerous waste.  
   
All that waste would have been stored behind a massive dam in
perpetuity, forever.  
   
But Bristol Bay is a region prone to earthquakes, which could destroy
that dam.  It gets tremendous amounts of rain and snow, which would
cause toxic waste to pour over the sides of the dam.  And if the dam
failed, the waste would be poured into the headwaters of Bristol Bay,
and that would be a true calamity.  
   
Other mines like this in other parts of America, which are built much —
in much drier climates where consequences of an engineering failure
would not have been as severe.  But not in Bristol Bay.  
   
So it was critical — critical to determine whether this mine could be
safely built in a way that guaranteed Bristol Bay would not be harmed.  
   
As the years went by, engineers and scientists worked on the problem. 
And it became clear that there was no way — no way to do this safely.  
   
And the Tribal leaders, commercial fishermen, hunters, anglers,
environmental advocates worked together to protect this ecosystem.  
   
Ultimately, the matter went to the federal government.  
   
As a candidate for President, I promised you that I would listen to the
scientists and concluded a rigorous, fas- — fact— fact-based review of
all of it; and to the Tribal leaders, whose firsthand knowledge had been
gathered over generations; and to the fishermen whose livelihood
depended on the bay.  
   
And that’s exactly what I did.  
   
In the end, we used our authority under the Clean Water Act to ban the
disposal of mine waste in Bristol Bay watershed.  Period.  That me- —
(applause) — and that means the mine will not be built.  (Applause.)  
   
And for many of you, this has been a — the fight of your lifetime.  
   
I’m sure along the way you were told this mine was inevitable, that you
should just accept it, that you should give up.  But you didn’t.  
   
And thanks to the priceless resource that is protected for future
generations who depends on it and is required and is a consequence of
all of you.  
   
To everyone who had a role in saving Bristol Bay: Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.  
   
Folks — (applause) — Bristol Bay is an example of my administration’s
commitment to conservation.  
   
In my first week in office, I issued an executive order establishing the
first-ever national conservation goal.  I called it “America the
Beautiful,” and it’s a nationwide campaign to protect and conserve, by
2030, at least 30 percent of the lands and waters that support and
sustain this nation.  
   
We’re making strong progress toward that goal.  
   
In fact, in just my first year in office, I protected more lands and
waters than any President since John F. Kennedy.  
   
I signed — (applause) — I signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and
the Inflation Reduction Act.  That’s the largest investments in climate,
environmental justice, and conservation ever anywhere, period.

And, look, with- — (applause) — it wouldn’t have happened without you.  
   
Over the past two years, these investments have helped protect our
iconic outdoor spaces, preserve historic sites, and make our nation more
resilient to the devastating impacts of climate change.  
   
In Alaska, we protected more than 9 million acres of the Tongass
National Forest, the largest temperate rainforest in the world. 
(Applause.)  I’ve visited it.  It’s incredible.  
   
We restored protections and status that previous administrations rolled
back for three national monuments: Bears Ears; Grand Staircase
Escalante; North East Canyon and the — and the Seamounts Marine National
Monument.  
   
And, by the way, I remember a little girl came up to me at a function
here, and she had drawn this bear with (inaudible).  She said, “Can you
take care of the Bears Ears?”  (Laughter.)  And I looked at her, I’m
thinking, “Umm.  Uhh, honey…”  She said, “You know, the Bears Ears.” 
(Laughter.)  I said, “Oh, you mean the park!”  She said, “Yeah, they’re
going to take away the Bears Ears.  You got to protect it.”  (Laughter.)

Well, it shows as every generation, man.

Last year, I used my authority under the Antiquisies \[sic\] Act —
Antiquities Act to add Camp Hale Continental Divide in Colorado to the
list of National Monuments.  And — (applause) — it’s magnificent.

And two months ago, I added two more:  
   
Spirit Mountain in Nevada — (applause) — which ties together one of the
longest and largest contiguous wildlife corridors in the United States
and sacred lands that are central to the creation story of so many
Tribes who have been there since time immemorial.  
   
And the Castner Range in Texas — (applause) — another place of
incredible beauty, which tells the story of Tribal Nations who lived
there and — and the numbers of Armed Forces who were trained there.

Look, folks, at my direction, the Secretary of Commerce has begun to
proceed on designating 770,000 square miles — square miles — of the
Pacific Ocean, southwest of Hawaii, as a new national marine sanctuary. 
That’s bigger than Alaska and California combined.  Combined. 
(Applause.)  
   
It would be the largest — (applause) — it would be the largest ocean
area on the planet with the highest level of protection.  
   
And I declared the entire U.S. Arctic Ocean off-limits to new oil and
gas development.  Period.  (Applause.)  And they  began the process to
protect more than 13 million area — 13 million acres of significant
natural and historic value in the Alaska National Petroleum Reserve.  
   
And I’ve protected the Bo- — the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness —
surrounding wetlands in Minnesota.  (Applause.)  Look, that’s the most
heavily visited wildlife area in the nation.  
   
All this matters.  When we conserve our country’s national gifts, we’re
not only protecting the livelihoods of people who depend on them, like
commercial fishermen, family farms, outdoor recreation businesses, rural
communities that welcome visitors across the country, we’re also
protecting what I consider to be — and I mean it sincerely — the heart
and the soul of our na- — national pride.   
   
Our country’s natural resources define our identity as a nation. 
They’re the bith- — birthright we pass down from generation to
generation.  They literally unite us.  That’s why our conservation work,
in my view, is so important.  
   
It provides a bridge to our past and to our future, not just for today
but for all ages.  
   
Folks, now, I wish I could say everyone agreed.  There was a time when
some of the nation’s most dedicated conservationists were on the other
party.  
   
But the extreme MAGA Republicans have taken control of the House of
Representatives.  
   
And they’re holding our economy hostage by threatening to default on our
national debt, a debt we’ve already incurred over 200 years, unless we
give into the threats and their demands.  
   
Here’s what the Speaker put forward in the Republican proposal.  He
wants to cut 22 percent of everything that isn’t defense spending,
Social Security, or Medicare, which I basically never thought would
happen — negotiated they wouldn’t touch in the State of the Union
message.  Anyway.  
   
Everything else gets cut 22 percent.  
   
That means thousands of wetla- — wildland firefighters would stop
getting paid at a time when wildfires are frequent and destructive.  
   
I’ve flown over more wildfires since I’ve been President than — and
burned to the ground — land burned to the ground than the entire state
of Maryland.  
   
It means thousands of National Parks employees, including park rangers,
would face losing their jobs.  
   
It means laying off hundreds of workers who regulate water quality
across our nation, making sure water — the water your kids drink is
safe.  
   
And it means slashing resources and — for monitoring pollution, which
would let polluters get away with and expose vulnerable communities to
dirty air and water.  
   
Folks, we can’t let that happen.  We can’t let that happen.  
   
Let me close with this.  In just a few weeks, on June the 1st, the
commercial salmon season will begin in Bristol Bay.  As one fisherman up
there said, “It’s like Christmas morning.”  (Laughter.)  It’s like
Christmas morning.   
   
They’ll — they’ll head out on the water at dawn, cast their nets, and
fish the most abundant wild salmon on the planet.  Just like fishermen
have done for generations.  Just like they will do for generations to
come thanks to all of you.  
   
I share with all of you an enduring reverence for the power and the
promise of this country’s extraordinary natural wonders.  
   
So, let’s keep it going.  Let’s keep the faith.  
   
Every time I walked out of my grandpop’s house, he’d yell, “Joey, keep
the faith.”  And my grandmother: “No, Joey.  Spread it.”  Let’s spread
the faith.   
   
We’re the United States of America.  (Applause.)  There’s nothing —
nothing beyond our capacity if we work together.  Nothing. 
(Applause.)  
   
So God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops.  Thank you, thank
you, thank you.  (Applause.)
