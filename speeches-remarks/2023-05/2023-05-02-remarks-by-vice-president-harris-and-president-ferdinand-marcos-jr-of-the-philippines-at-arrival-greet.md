*Vice President’s Residence

*Washington, D.C.**

VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Mr. President, welcome to our home.  Madam First
Lady, it is good to see you again.  Of course, you gave such a warm
welcome during my visit in November of last year.  And the Second
Gentleman was honored to be with you for your inauguration.   
   
And I know the President and you had a very —  
   
PRESIDENT MARCOS:  Yes.  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  — meaningful and good meeting yesterday, and I’m
looking forward to our time together this morning.   
   
But I want to thank you, because the strength of the alliance between
the United States and the Philippines is probably stronger than ever.   
   
Under your leadership, we have been able to continue to do the work that
we have that is a priority around our mutual prosperity and security.   
   
During my visit to the Philippines, we discussed many issues, including
the importance of a clean energy economy.  You and I share a passion for
that —  
   
PRESIDENT MARCOS:  That’s right.  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  — as well as issues that relate to food security
and what we must do around digital inclusion.   
   
And on the issue of security, of course, the work that our countries are
doing together as it relates to the South China Sea, as it relates to
what we must do in terms of continuing to work together through our
coast guards.   
   
I was honored to go to Palawan.  And I went there after you and I
met.   
   
PRESIDENT MARCOS:  That’s right.  Yes.    
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  And met with the fishers there and met with the
Coast Guard, which the U.S. and the Philippines — our coast guards are
working together —  
   
PRESIDENT MARCOS:  Are working together very closely.   
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  — in that region, very closely.  
   
So, again, welcome.  Welcome.  And it’s good to see you both.  
   
PRESIDENT MARCOS:  Thank you, Madam Vice President.  And I can say that
the — the visit — this visit of ours to the United States to see
President Biden and yourself — you laid the groundwork for it, really. 
Mr. Emhoff was also part of the process.  And I think that has given us
the very — very — very attractive opportunity to continue to strengthen
the relationship between our two countries in the face, in the context
of all of the difficulties and complexities, the rising tensions in our
region and the world.   
   
And, once again, we turn to our American partners.  You are our only
treaty partners —   
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Yes, of course.  
   
PRESIDENT MARCOS:  — in the world.    
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Yes.  Yes.    
   
PRESIDENT MARCOS:  It is natural, after all the different cycles of —
like as in any friendship is — but I was telling Secretary Blinken
yesterday that, like any friendship, they go through — you go through
many cycles.  And I think this is an upside in that cycle.   
   
And we’re very, very happy to be here to get this opportunity to speak
with you and to have spoken with your President.   
   
So, thank you very much.   
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Welcome.  Welcome.  Yes, please come in.  
   
Q    Mr. President, how concerned are you with the continued provocation
in the South China Sea — of China?  
   
PRESIDENT MARCOS:  I’m sorry?  
   
Q    How concerned are you with the continued provocation from China
(inaudible)?  
   
PRESIDENT MARCOS:  As concerned as you can possibly be.  It is one of
the major issues that we have to face back home.   
   
Q    And do you believe cooperation with the Vice President and
President Biden will get you closer to protecting the region?  
   
PRESIDENT MARCOS:  Well, cooperation with the United States certainly is
something that we are building upon.  That has been going on for many,
many, many decades.  And we just keep going.
