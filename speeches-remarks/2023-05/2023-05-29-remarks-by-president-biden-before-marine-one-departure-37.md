South Lawn

2:40 P.M. EDT  
   
Q    Mr. President, give us an update on the debt ceiling deal.  Are you
confident it’ll pass Congress?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Look, you know I never say I’m confident what the
Congress is going to do.  But I feel very good about it.  I’ve spoken
with a number of the members.  I spoke to McConnell.  I spoke to a whole
bunch of people.  And it feels good.  We’ll see when the vote starts.  
   
And, look, one of the things that I hear some of you guys saying is,
“Why doesn’t Biden say what a good deal it is?”  Why would Biden say
what a good deal it is before the vote?  You think that’s going to help
me get it passed?  No.  That’s why you guys don’t bargain very well.  
   
Anyway.  
   
Q    Mr. President, what’s your message to –  
   
Q    Mr. President –  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  So that’s number
one.  
   
Number two, I spoke to Erdoğan and congratulated Erdoğan.  And he — he
still wants to work on something on the F-16s.  I told him we wanted a
deal with Sweden, so let’s get that done.  And so we’ll be back in touch
with one another.  But I — it was basically a congratulatory call.  
And –  
   
Q    S- —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  
   
Q    Sir, what’s your message to House Democrats who have reservations
about this compromise bill?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  “Talk to me.”  
   
Q    And what would you tell them?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m not going to tell you.  
   
Q    Why not?

THE PRESIDENT:  Look, you guys all get on and say, “Tell them what a
good deal it is.”  How about — how about if this was 100 percent deal
for the Democrats?  Do you think it would help me get it passed?  
   
Q    Well, who got the better deal?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Wai- — do you think it’s going to help me get it
passed?  Come on.  
   
Q    Mr. President, who got the better deal?  
   
Q    What do you think of the way that the 2024 Republican field is
shaking out?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I haven’t been able to keep up with it.  (Laughs.)  It’s
moving so quickly.  And, you know, I’m not being facetious; I’m being
very serious.  I haven’t focused on it that much.  It seems to have a
lot of competent candidates who are trying to get the nomination.  So
we’ll see.  
   
Q    Will you whip votes yourself among Democrats and progressives? 
Will you make personal contact or leave that to the Hill?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, I’ve made some calls already.  
   
Q    To who, Mr. President?  Have you talked to Congresswoman Jayapal? 
And do you think you can get progressives on board?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  The answer is: I don’t know.  I have a good relationship
with Jayapal.  I haven’t had a chance to speak to her yet.  
   
Q    Who got the better deal?  Who got the better deal — Democrats or
Republicans?  
   
THE PRESDEINT:  It’s a bipartisan deal.  
   
Q    Will this be done by June 5th?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, yes.  
   
Q    No question?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well — you guys are — you guys — you realize you’re not
in the real world.  “No question.”  There is no reason why it shouldn’t
get done by the 5th.  I’m confident that we’ll get a vote in both
houses.  And we’ll see.  
   
Q    (Inaudible.)  Russia is doubling down its attacks on Kyiv. 

THE PRESIDENT:  I’m sorry, I’m not —

Q    Do you have any reaction as to (inaudible) attacks on Kyiv today? 
They attacked three times today.

THE PRESIDENT:  I’m sorry, I don’t understand the question.  I can’t — I
apologize.

Q    Russia is doubling down —

THE PRESIDENT:  Russia is doubling down —

Q    — on attacks on Kyiv.

THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.

Q    Do you have any reaction?

THE PRESIDENT:  It’s not unexpected.  And that’s — it’s just pure — it’s
not unexpected.  That’s why we got to continue to give Ukraine all that
it needs.

Q    Are you expecting any movement on Sweden’s membership in NATO on
Erdoğan’s part?

THE PRESIDENT:  I raised that issue with him.  We’re going to talk more
about it next week.

Q    Is it time for aid package for Ukraine?  Aid package for Ukraine.

THE PRESIDENT:  That’s still in play.  
   
Q    Mr. President, on defense spending, some of the — some Republicans
are saying that this deal does not raise — does not give the Pentagon
enough money.  Can you guarantee that America’s fighting force is going
to have what it needs for the next couple years?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Look, whatever the fighting force needs, if there’s
another — first of all, they passed my budget, what I asked for in
defense.  They passed that.  Obviously, if there’s any existential need
for additional funding, I have no doubt we’d be able to get it because
we’d jointly do it.  
   
All right, thanks, everyone.  
   
Q    Does the U.S. have any (inaudible) to Uganda?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m sorry, I’m having trouble hearing you.  
   
Q    On Uganda, sir — any message to the people of Uganda?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Not right now, no.  I think I heard the question.  
   
Don’t get your feet dirty, man.  
   
All right?  
   
Q    I got one.  Did you see that Ron DeSantis said that if he became
President, he would pardon Trump?  Where are you on the idea of
presidents pardoning Trump?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs and waves.)  (Inaudible.)  It’s a great
question.  Thank you.
