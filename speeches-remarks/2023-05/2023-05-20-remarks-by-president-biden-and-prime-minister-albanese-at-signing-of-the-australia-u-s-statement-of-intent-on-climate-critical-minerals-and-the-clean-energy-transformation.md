PRESIDENT BIDEN: This compact and statement of intent are a testament to
our close bilateral cooperation. And I mean that: close. We’re going to
establish climate and clean energy as the third pillar of the
Australia-U.S. alliance.

This compact is going to enable the expansion of and diversification of
clean energy supply chains, especially as it relates to critical
materials.

And I want to thank you for your leadership, Mr. Prime Minister. We’re
going to sign this, the Minister may have a statement, and then —

Well, you may want to say something now.

PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE: Yeah. Well, thank you, Mr. President. Thank you
for your leadership through the Inflation Reduction Act in the United
States, but also through your leadership internationally as well, and
for including Australia proudly in your Major Economies Forum that met
virtually just a few weeks ago.

And Australia is back around the table. And what we know is that action
on climate change, I say, is the entry fee to credibility in the
Indo-Pacific.

Many of our neighbors understand that climate change is an existential
threat. And what we understand is that it’s an important component of
our national security. And that’s why it is an important component — an
essential part — of our alliance.

I thank you for the work that you’re doing with us in cooperation. And
this is a further step forward today.

PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, you’re a great partner. We’re going to sign these
and then ask you to leave. And we’ll come — reset the room and come back
in, and we’ll have opening statements. And so, please don’t hurt each
other going out and in, okay?

All right.

PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE: Here we go.

(The statement is signed.)
