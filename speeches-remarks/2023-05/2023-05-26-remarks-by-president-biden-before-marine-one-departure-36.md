Q Mr. President, any update on the debt limit, sir?

THE PRESIDENT: With regard to the debt limit, things are looking good.
I’m very optimistic. I hope we’ll have some clear evidence tonight
before the clock strikes twelve that we have a deal. But it’s very
close, and I’m optimistic.

The reason I’m going to Camp David is they are working on the — the
Secret Service is working on my house — bulletproofing the house. So
there’s no place to go at home; they said I’d be out for five weeks. So
I’m going to Camp David because my granddaughter graduates on Sunday,
and it’s closest so I can get there to be at her graduation.

Q What did you say about tonight? What did you say about tonight?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, I said there’s a negotiation going on. I’m hopeful
we’ll know by tonight whether we are going to be able to have a deal.

Q What’s your reaction to — what’s your reaction to Russia moving
tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus?

THE PRESIDENT: Extremely negative, is my reaction.

Q Mr. President, what do you — what do you tell Democrats who say that
they don’t want you to bow on the work requirements? What’s your
position?

THE PRESIDENT: I don’t bow to anybody.
