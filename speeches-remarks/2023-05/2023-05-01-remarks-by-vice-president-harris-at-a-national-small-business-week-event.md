THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, everyone, please have a seat.  Good
afternoon.  
   
Well, happy Small Business Week to everyone.  (Applause.)  And
congratulations to all of you.  It is a great honor to be with these
extraordinary Americans who are our incredible small-business
leaders.   
   
And, of course, it is great to be with our Administrator, Isabel
Guzman.  And I thank you for your work.  
   
And a special thank you to our President, Joe Biden.  (Applause.)  
   
Our President has long been a leader on this and so many other issues. 
But he’s quite passionate about this one.  And I will tell you, working
with him and having the honor of doing that — no matter what room he is
in, when the cameras are on  
or when they are off, President Biden is always fighting  
for America’s small-business owners and entrepreneurs.  And so, we all
thank him, of course, for his leadership in that regard.  
   
Small-business owners are the backbone of America’s economy. 
(Applause.)  You are.  
   
Through your creativity, tenacity, and determination, you help create
prosperity and opportunity for millions of people in our country.  
   
Our small-business owners are business leaders.  And our small-business
owners are community leaders and civic leaders.  
   
You train young people and hire locally.  You support the local softball
team.  You are role models and mentors.  
      
And I’ll tell you, I have seen it my whole life.  Growing up, my mother
worked long hours and long days — and weekends from time to time.  And
when she did, my sister, Maya, and I would go a couple of doors over to
Ms. Shelton’s house.   
   
So, Ms. Shelton ran a nursery school.  And we actually lived in the
apartment above the nursery school.  And Ms. Shelton was our second
mother.  She was a small-business owner.  And I would not be here today
without her.  
  
Because, you see, Mrs. Shelton was a fixture in our community.  She gave
support and advice to the young parents in the neighborhood and folks
who were going through challenges.  Just as so many of you do.  
   
And as District Attorney of San Francisco, in my career as Attorney
General of California, as a United States senator, and now as Vice
President, I have worked with and met with thousands of small-business
owners — folks like you who are here who fight every day to build a
better future for the people you love, for the community you call home,
and for our country.  
   
You power the ambition and aspirations of our nation.  And that is why
we are fighting every day to make sure you have the resources and the
support that you need.  
   
For example, we know there are so many small businesses’ owners who hire
employees but want to hire more because your business is growing. 
Small-business owners who want to stock the shelves and make sure you
have enough in terms of the supply you need to do what you need to do in
your community.  Small-business owners who need more capital because you
want to design a new product or build a new store, but who cannot
because you don’t have access to capital.  
   
And so, building on work that I did as a United States senator, our
administration is investing billions of dollars in community banks,
which are the institutions that help provide capital and financial
support to small-business owners — in particular, those in overlooked
and underserved communities, including our rural communities.  
   
What’s more, last year we built an historic public-private partnership
to help address this issue.  We partnered with consumer banks,
investment firms, technology companies, and philanthropies to combine
the expertise and experience of the private sector with the reach and
capacity that can only be provided by the government.  
   
As a result, we have secured tens of billions of dollars in
private-sector investment for small businesses and communities across
our America.  And — (applause) — and we are just getting started.  
   
So, with your support, President Biden and I will continue to fight to
make sure every small-business owner in our nation and every aspiring
small-business owner has the opportunity to not only to survive but
thrive.  
   
And, with that, please join me to welcome to the microphone a leader who
exemplifies the excellence of all the small-business owners who are here
today, Jill Scarbro.  (Applause.)
