Hello NewsBash!  
  
Thank you, Laura. And thank you for all you do, year after year, to make
this event a success.   
  
I’m grateful to all of the DC newswomen who have put so much heart and
hard work into advocating for cancer patients for 17 years.  
  
You’re not just journalists and survivors and advocates: you’re warriors
in the fight against breast cancer! And I know that when you come
together for a cause, there’s nothing that can stand in your way.  
  
That’s why I’m so excited that this year’s funds are going to the Howard
University Cancer Center’s Patient Navigation Team.  
  
When you receive a cancer diagnosis, everything else seems to fall away.
The fear, the confusion, the way your world just stops while everyone
else keeps going. It can feel like you’re all alone.  
  
But with a patient navigator by your side, you’re never alone.  
  
Navigators steer patients through the complex and frightening world of
cancer: from appointment to appointment, test after test, from their
first mammogram to clinical trials to remission.  
  
They meet patients where they are, helping them find transportation and
childcare when they need it, ensuring they understand their treatment
options and how to manage side effects, regardless of language or
background.  
  
And that’s especially important when it comes to the deep disparities
that we know exist.  
  
We’ve heard the statistics: life-saving treatments are often out of
reach for neighborhoods of color, low-income areas, or rural places
where care is difficult to access.  
  
That’s what the Biden Cancer Moonshot is about. We’re bringing people
together to build a world where cancer is not a death sentence, no
matter your zip code.  
  
Where we help patients and their families navigate this journey. Where
we stop cancer before it starts. Where we catch it early and help people
live longer, healthier, happier lives.  
  
And I’m working every day to make sure that every family can get the
navigators they need. We’re making progress.  
  
Just last week, the US Preventive Services Task Force issued a new draft
recommendation that all women should begin screenings for breast cancer
at 40, ten years sooner than the previous recommendation.  
  
So many women will be able to catch cancer earlier and start fighting it
sooner. In fact, the task force estimates it could mean almost 20
percent more lives saved.  
  
And the National Cancer Institute is launching a first-of-its-kind
program to provide patient navigation for families who have children
with cancer.  
  
As so many of you already know, this is personal to Joe and me. To all
of us.  
  
Because in some way, cancer touches us all.   
  
We can’t afford to wait another minute for better care, better
solutions, better treatments.  
  
We have to act now: for every mother who has imagined all of the things
she might not be able to teach her daughters.  
  
For every husband who wonders how he will juggle chemotherapy
appointments with work and child care.  
  
For every daughter trying to be strong for the parents who could outlive
her.  
  
Together, through the Biden Cancer Moonshot, we can end cancer as we
know it.  
  
It’s ambitious. But it’s also within our reach.  
  
So, thank you for never giving up on this cause. This is the mission of
our lives, and we are proud to stand beside you.
