Hagerstown Regional Airport  
Hagerstown, Maryland

Q    Mr. President, how close are we to the ceasefire?   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  It’s in the hands of Hamas right now.  The — the
Israelis have been cooperating.  There’s an offer out there that’s
rational.  We don’t know what we’re — we’ll know in a couple days if
it’s going to happen.  But we need the ceasefire.  
   
Q    How close are we —  
   
Q    (Inaudible) to the hostage deal?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I was just saying that.  The hostage deal is in the
hands of Hamas right now —  
   
Q    Okay.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  — because there’s been an offer — a rational offer.  The
Israelis have agreed to it and — waiting to see what the — Hamas does.  
   
Q    Do you think there will be a deal by Ramadan?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I — there’s got to be a ceasefire because Ramadan
— if we get into a circumstance where this continues through Ramadan,
Israel and Jerusalem (inaudible) — it could be very, very dangerous. 
So, we’re looking — we’re trying hard for that ceasefire.  
   
Q    Mr. President, what’s your message to Democrats who are concerned
about your poll numbers?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  My poll numbers — the last five polls, you guys don’t
report, I’m winning.  Five — five in a row.  You guys only look at the
New York Times.  They’re a great paper.  
   
Q    Can you get the Israelis to allow more aid into Gaza?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Pardon me?  
   
Q    The Israelis, can you — are you pressuring them to get more aid
into Gaza?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m working with them very hard.  We’re going to get
more — we must get more aid into Gaza.  There’s no excuses.  None.  
   
Q    And how is your relationship Netanyahu these days?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Like it’s always been.  
   
Q    Sir?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Like it’s always been.  
   
Q    Mr. President, what are you preparing for your State of the Union
Address?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  You’ll hear me on Thursday.  (Laughs.) 

All right.  Thank you all so very much.
