Q    Mr. President, when do airdrops in Gaza start?  
   
Q    Do you think there will be a ceasefire deal by Ramadan?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m hoping so.  We’re still working real hard at it. 
We’re not there yet.  
   
Q    What is — what is the biggest hold-up right now?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m not going to tell you that because that would get
involved in the negotiations.  
   
Q    Mr. President, is it time to — is it time to have talks on Ukraine
— to speak to President Putin about Ukraine to maybe get the peace
talks?  Is it a good time —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Speak to Putin?  
   
Q    Yeah.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  About Ukraine?  
   
Q    Why are you waiting to take executive action on the border?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Because we need more forces on the border.  I don’t have
the authority to do that.  
   
(Cross-talk.)  
   
Q    Do you trust Israel to investigate what happened yesterday?  Do you
trust — do you trust Israel will investigate what happened yesterday?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  
   
Q    When will — when can we expect the first airdrops into Gaza?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m not positive.  I think very soon.  
   
Q    Will you be seeing Benny Gantz this weekend, sir?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No.  
   
Q    Are you still confident you can get a ceasefire by Monday?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, I was just saying: It looks like we’re still — it’s
not there yet.  I think — I think we’ll get there, but it’s not there
yet.  And I’m not — and it may not get there now.  
   
Q    Will you speak to Netanyahu about yesterday’s attack?  Will you
speak to Netanyahu about yesterday’s attack?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I will speak to yesterday’s attack.  
   
Q    Speaker — Speaker Johnson has accused you of lying repeatedly about
your interactions with your son and brother’s business partners.  What’s
your re- — response to him?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Tell him to read the record of every single witness. 
These guys got to stop this stuff.  
   
Q    But you did interact with their partners.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I did not interact with their partners.  
   
Q    You didn’t have dinner or lunch and coffee?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No.  
   
Q    Mr. President, so, you think there may never be a ceasefire
negotiation?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m still hoping for it.  You know, it’s not over until
it’s over.  
   
Q    What still needs to happen (inaudible)?  What still needs to happen
in negotiations?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  What has — there has to be an agreement on the timing. 
And they’re still far apart.  
   
Thank you.
