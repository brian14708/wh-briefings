Q    Madam Vice President, you have a meeting coming up this afternoon.

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yes, I do.

Q    What’s your message for Benny Gantz?

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re going to discuss a number of things in
terms of the priorities that, certainly, we have, which includes getting
a hostage deal done, getting aid in, and — and then getting that
six-week ceasefire.

You know, the President and I have been very clear that Israel has a
right to defend itself, that we have got to make sure that innocent
civilians aren’t being killed, and that we’ve got to get these hostages
out.  And that is one of the highest priorities right — that, right now,
we have.

And, I’ll tell you, the President has been an extraordinary leader in
getting us to this point that we have the six-week deal.  And so, Hamas
needs to do its thing, as I talked about yesterday in Selma.

Q    Your remarks yesterday got a lot of attention because they were
pretty sharp against Israel.  Is there any distance between you and
President Biden on this issue?

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  The President and I have been aligned and
consistent from the very beginning.  Israel has a right to defend
itself.  Far too many Palestinian civilians — innocent civilians have
been killed.  We need to get more aid in.  We need to get the hostages
out.  And that remains our position.

And I will tell you that it is important that we all understand that
there — we’re in a window of time right now where we can actually get a
hostage deal done.  We all want this conflict to end as soon as
possible, and how it does matters.

So, thank you all.  Thank you.
