11:20 A.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)  You’re
incredible. You’re — really, you’re incredible. (Applause.)  
   
Folks, please — please have a seat. Sit down.  
   
I’m not going to take much of your time. I came to say thank you, thank
you, thank you, thank you.   
   
You know, one of — a couple of us have been doing this more than a year
or two. (Laughter.) I don’t ever remember an event like last night. I’m
not joking. Any — I don’t mean for us. I mean for anybody.   
   
The enthusiasm, what you put together is just incredible —
incredible. And, Julie, you deserve a lot of the credit. (Applause.)   
   
Look, you know, it was good being with Barack and Bill. We’ve — I’ve
worked with them a long, long time.   
   
I was deeply involved in the Clinton administration all those years from
the Senate.   
   
And Barack — we — we sat together every morning at nine o’clock for
eight years.  And, look, I — I couldn’t — I thought the way they — I
thought — I was — I was impressed. (Laughter and applause.) I — I was.  
   
I’m supposed to be — I’m supposed to be the guy out there — I’m the —
I’m the president. I’m looking, “Holy God, they really mean
it.” (Laughter.)   
   
All kidding aside, let me — let me be clear. We’re here today because of
Chris. It’s Chris’s birthday today. Where are you,
Chris? (Applause.) Now, folks, Jill would — look at his glasses. 
(Laughter.) That’s my birthday gift to him.   
   
Let’s sing “Happy Birthday” to the man. (The President leads the
audience in singing “Happy Birthday” to Chris Korge.) (Applause.)  
   
Chris, it’s hell turning 40, but you’ll get over it. (Laughter.)   
   
Look, from the bottom of my heart: Thank you, thank you, thank you. 
Thank you for your support.  And, you know, it’s because of you I can
say that we’ve raised more money than any previous Democratic campaign
in history at this point. (Applause.)  
   
And last night showed our skeptics, as well as our supporters — it
showed the press; it showed everyone — that we are united. We’re a
united party.   
   
Your incredible enthusiasm — I’ve been seeing it all over the
country. On a much smaller scale — as I’ve been going to all the — I’ve
been to, I think, seven, eight, nine states in the last couple of
weeks. And that’s the enthusiasm on the ground. That’s how people have
been.   
   
And it’s hard to come home and say that, because people look — well, you
know, they read the polls, and they’re tight or they’re — we’re
behind.   
   
And, by the way, we’re ahead. (Applause.)  
   
But we traveled to Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin, New
Hampshire, Nevada, Arizona, North Carolina.  Jill, Kamala and Doug, and
I traveling as well. Look, it’s a — it’s just a lot of campaigning.  
   
And our grassroots organization is really kick- — kicking up. Support
keeps getting stronger.   
   
Here’s the number that blows my mind: 1.5 million contributors so far —
1.5 million. (Applause.) Five hundred and fifty thousand of them
brand-new contributors in the last couple of weeks —
550,000. (Applause.)  
   
And guess what? 97 percent of all that is under 200 bucks. 
(Applause.) I mean, if that ain’t grassroots, I don’t know what is.  And
you’re all thinking, “Why didn’t we just contribute 200
bucks?” (Laughter.) I know you contributed a few bucks more than 200
bucks. (Laughter.)   
   
But all kidding aside, what you’ve done is incredible.   
   
We’re ramping up campaign headquarters and field offices, hiring staff
all across the country before Trump and his MAGA Republicans have even
opened one single office.   
   
And, you know, while the press doesn’t write about it, we’ve been
several — we have several national polls — and we’re leading — since the
State of the Union Address. And I think you’re going to see a lot more
coming. We’ve got to just keep this going.   
   
But I know not everyone’s feeling the enthusiasm. Just the other day, a
defeated-looking guy came up to me and said,  
“Mr. President, I’m being crushed by debt. I’m completely wiped out.  I
need some help.” And I had to look at him and say, “Sorry, Donald, I
can’t help you.” (Laughter and applause.) It bro- — it broke my
heart. For Catholics, this is Holy Week. I should have had something
nicer to say. (Laughter.)   
   
He really ask- — he recently asked the — the infamous question: Are you
better off today than you were four years ago? Well, Donald, I’m glad
you asked the question.  (Laughter.)   
   
I hope everyone in this country takes a moment to think back to where
you were in March of 2020.  And, you know, COVID led — came to
America. Trump was president. He — he tried to downplay the whole
virus. He tried to — he told us that it will go away. “Just stay
calm. It will be gone by Easter.”  
   
And, of course, we know from Bob Woodward’s book that Trump knew all
along how dangerous it was. He just kept getting — and it kept getting
worse.   
   
He told Americans to inj- — remember he told them to inj- — just inject
bleach. Inject —  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT: I tell you what, man, I — and, you know, he told us just
get a hit of body — hit — just hit your body with UV light.   
   
Look, by the summer, Americans peacefully protested for justice in front
of the White House. He wanted to tear-gas them.   
   
And the guy who I can say, having worked with him a long time, is a
first-rate guy — he threatened a commander in the United States military
that he was — that he should be put in jail. And — no, I think — did he
use word “shot” somewhere along the line?   
   
Look, then after losing the 2020 election, he finished the presidency by
sending a mob to attack Capitol Hill. I don’t want to repeat it all. You
all know it as well as I do.   
   
Four years later, look at how far we’ve come.   
   
Donald Trump — Donald Trump is president in his mind.  (Laughter.) But
the fact of the matter is I’m president; Kamala is a historic vice
president — (applause) — because of you — because of you.  
   
And COVID no longer controls our lives. Our economy is strong and
getting stronger.   
   
Good news today. Did you hear the — the GDP, inflation?  We’re on track,
man. It has continuing to move.   
   
We’ve reestablished American leadership in the world after he decided to
walk away — I mean, literally, walk away from our responsibilities
around the world with his new best friends.  He talks about he has love
letters with Kim Jong Un, and talking about how Putin has — he’s a
strong man, talking about how Hitler did some good things. I mean — I
won’t even say it.  
   
Of course, we have a lot more to do.   
   
You know, but, folks, the problem isn’t just looking back where Trump
had the country. The problem is: Look ahead where MAGA extremists would
take the country if they win again.  
   
Trump and MAGA extremists want to, quote, “terminate” — I love the
phraseology he uses — “terminate” the ACA.  Hundreds of thousands of
people would lose their insurance — millions, actually. He wants to get
rid of savings that I just got put into law for prescription drug
prices. He wants to change that whole piece.   
   
We cannot — not allow Medicare to negotiate with the pharma for the drug
— the price they’ll pay for the drugs. Prices like $35 insulin instead
of $400 a month.  
   
Look, and the last time he explored — when he was president, he talked
about the national debt. He exploded the national debt at a greater
degree than any president in American history.   
   
And guess what? We’ve actually not done that. We’ve — have savings on
that since we’ve been president.   
   
Today, Trump recently said — he’s talked about cutting Social Security
and Medicare.   
   
You know, he brags about how he’s the reason why Roe v.  Wade was
(inaudible) and — and eliminated. And, you know, he’s right. He is the
reason, pushing as hard as he did to put — to change the Supreme
Court.   
   
And remember, at the time, we said, “What’s next: contraception,
IVF?” We talked about what was going to come.    
   
Well, it’s coming. It’s coming like a rainstorm.  And now he’s calling
for a national ban in every single state — in every state.    
   
Well, I tell you what, you guys elect me again and give me a little bit
— a little more help in the Senate, we’re going to restore Roe v. Wade
for the whole country. (Applause.)  
   
You know, and he wants to undo everything we’ve done on climate. This
guy doesn’t think climate change is real. We ought to put him right on
the edge of the water so he can stay there while the climate change —
changes.   
   
Look, the greatest threat he poses is to our — is to our democracy. I
don’t want to go on too long here. And it’s not hyperbole to use the
word twice today. It’s not hyperbole to suggest that — that he is — he’s
the most antidemocratic — with a small D — president in American
history, at least since Lincoln’s era when they — the Civil War.   
   
He embraces the violence of — of January the 6th. You know, and I — I
had to go back and look at it because Mike Donilon pulled it out for me
— the speech I made.   
   
I was so upset he was remaining silent on January the 6th.  And I was
president-elect, not president. But we had no president. He wasn’t
acting.   
   
And I went out and made a speech about — I was supposed to make a speech
on the economy.  I made a speech on — on what was happening and what —
what had to be done.  He did nothing. He sat in that little dining room
off the Oval Office where I eat my lunch, and he watched it all. Didn’t
do a damn thing. And now he’s running on it.   
   
You know, if you look — turn on — on one of those channels that has —
covers one of his — his rallies, he has the folks who are in jail
singing — singing and doing the National Anthem, and he’s doing — I
don’t know what the hell he’s doing. But he’s talking about how these
guys in prison — he calls them “patriots.” And he says, if he’s
reelected, he’s going to pardon them. He’s going to pardon them.   
   
And, look, you know, I — I think I told you before, one of the most
bracing moments I had as President of the United States so far was after
I was sworn in. Right after I was sworn in, a week after, there was the
G7. The leaders of the European — heads of European states met in London
— outside of London, in England. And I sat down, and I said, “America is
back.”   
   
And — and the French President looked at me, and he said, “For how
long?  For how long?” And the German Chancellor said, “Mr. President” —
he said, “What would you say if tomorrow morning you woke up and you
saw, in the London Times, headlines saying, ‘Thousands stormed the
British Parliament, break down the doors of the House of — the House, in
order to be able to stop the outcome of an election’?”  
   
What would you think? What would we all think? It put in perspective for
me how the rest of the world looks at what happened here.   
   
We are — like it or not, we are the country the rest of the world looks
to for stability. And that’s not hyperbole. That’s a fact.  That’s an
actual fact.   
   
And Trump says if he loses again — again in November, there will be a
“bloodbath.” What the hell is with this guy? No, I’m — I’m not — no, I’m
really serious. It concerns me the most.   
   
I told you I have — one of the reasons, as Barack said the other night,
that he asked me to be vice president was because I had a lot of
experience in foreign policy as chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee and I knew most of the heads of state.   
   
And — but whether it’s the G20 meeting in — in India or whatever the
meeting where there are other heads of state, I am not exaggerating when
I say — and I say it in front of the press without giving the names —
almost every one of the world leaders finds an excuse to get me alone
for a moment, put their hand on my arm, and say, “You can’t let him
win.”  “My” — meaning his country or her country — “my democracy is at
stake. My democracy is at stake.”   
   
And, again, it’s not an exaggeration. Think about it. This is a guy who
walked away from NATO. Th- — told Putin he could do whatever he wants if
they’re not paying their dues. As I said, he’s working — talks about —
anyway —  
   
Just — just look at what he’s done. The rest of the world is wondering
what in the hell is happening to us. And they’re relieved, not because
I’m so special but that I’m not Trump.  I’m serious. I wish it was
because they thought Biden was such a wonderful guy. (Laughter.)  
   
I think they respect me. I think they listen to me. But the point is,
it’s because they’re scared to death for their countries if he were to
win again.   
   
This “America First” stuff has really worked well, hasn’t it?    
   
Look, we have to say with one voice, as Americans — Democrats,
independents, Republicans — there is no place ever for political
violence, for physical violence in our political system. None. Never.   
   
And you can’t only — (applause) — and, folks, you can’t only be for your
country when you win. You know, we’ve lost, we’ve won, we’ve
lost. That’s the democratic process.   
   
Let me close with this. There’s a lot of focus these days on how old
Trump and I are. Well — (laughs) — I shouldn’t say — I won’t say
it. (Laughter.)  
   
But the real question is — is —  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Say it. Say it.  
   
THE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) Anyway, I — (laughter). Were it not for the
fact it’s Good Friday, I might say it. (Laughter.)  
   
Anyway, look, you know, the question is: How old are our ideas? How old
are our ideas? Donald Trump’s vision for America is based on a cont- — a
completely different value set than ours. His — he — his focus is on
anger and hate, revenge and retribution — some of the oldest ideas of
humankind.   
   
And, by the way, if I said that to you — if I said that a year ago, I’d
have been — even wonder whether that was an exaggeration.  But think of
all the Republicans you know that are decent members of the Senate and
the House who are caving.  Why? It doesn’t show any courage, but they
know there’s retribution. He’s convinced them all that if he somehow
wins, they’re going to be an object of his attention.   
   
I have a different vision for America, like all of you do, one that
focuses on the future and answers some really important questions. Will
we be better off four years from now? That’s our goal: Make it
better. We ma- — I think we made it a hell of a lot better than it was
four years ago, but we got to make it a hell of a lot better
still. (Applause.)  
   
Here’s the kind of future I see — summarize it real quickly. I see a
future where we defend democracy; we don’t dismiss it or diminish it.   
   
I see a future where the right to choose — where we protect our
freedoms, not take them away — is paramount to everything we’re
about.   
   
I see a future where the middle class finally has a fair shot and we
restore the Child Tax Credit and we provide health- — home
healthcare. Because guess what? That grows the economy.  That doesn’t
diminish the econ- — it grows the economy.   
   
You know, I know I got criticized because I’m so pro labor. I’m pro
labor because they’re the best workers in the world. (Applause.) No —   
   
And I asked the Treasury Department to do an analysis for me: what the
effect of more labor in the marketplace had on the economy. And they
said everyone, across the board — labor and non-labor — benefits.   
   
I met — I think — I know we talked a while ago, when we were talking,
you and I. We talked about how I met with the Business Roundtable, and
they asked me, you know, why — why was I pro labor. Why have I talked
about it so much? And I pointed out to them — I said, because, you know,
I met with — when I — the former Secretary of Commerce and I, when — in
the — in the Obama administration, we met and — with you guys, and we
went through the first 357 — well, not first — but 357 of the Fortune
500.  
   
And we asked, “What’s the thing you most need?” You know what they
said? They said they need a better — a better-trained workforce.   
   
And I pointed out — and, you know, (inaudible) I want you to go back to
think about this.   
   
They — what we talked about was: If, in fact, you had — you know,
everybody thinks, you know — you say, “I want to be an electrician.” 
“Okay, you’re an electrician.” Five years — five years of apprenticeship
— five — F-I-V-E.   
   
Any of these trades, they’re the best in the world. They’re the best in
the world. That’s how I was able to track back over $55 billion in — in
investment in infrastruct- — in the Intel stuff.   
   
You know, those little computer chips are the — about the size of the
end of my little finger. We invented them. We made them. And we lost —
we lost the whole market.   
   
Well, guess what?  They’re coming home. They’re coming home not just
because of us — (applause).   
   
And, by the way, I made a commitment early on — and some thought it was
too much — but I would make a point and a — and we don’t need to do
anything beyond this. I made a commitment, as long as I’m President, no
one making under $400,000 would pay an extra penny in taxes. And they
haven’t. (Applause.) We’ve actually — actually cut the taxes.  
   
And, folks, I see a future where there’s — you know, where we save the
planet from a climate crisis and from gun violence.  We have the
capacity to do both those things.   
   
And above all, I see a future for all Americans — a future that can —
that we can build together.   
   
Look, we badly need to win this.   
   
I’m going on too long. I’m sorry. You have a long day and evening, but,
you know — (applause) — I think it’s time for us to redouble our
efforts. And I know we can.   
   
I’ve never been more — and I mean this sincerely. Some of you know me
really well. And the bad news is no one now doubts what I — mean what I
say. The problem is I sometimes say all that I mean. (Laughter.) More
than once. (Laughter.)  
   
But I — I give you my word as a Biden, I’ve never been more optimistic
about our future. We have a chance. We have a chance to change the next
six decades.   
   
And we’re in one of those inflection points in human history. They occur
about every six or seven generations.   
   
We just went through the post-war period. It worked pretty damn well
until things began to change.   
   
When I met with Putin after I was elected, in Geneva, I looked at him,
and he talked about — he wanted to do something. I said, “What are you
going to do about methane?” I said, “You — you have — you’re in eight
time zones around the Arctic Circle, and methane is” — he had no
idea. He didn’t have the slightest notion what he could do, and he knows
there’s a problem.   
   
Well, we know the problems are out there, but we know how to solve them
if we work together. Not just —  
   
But everything is changing. I’ve never seen a time in my career — which
is short, I know, but — (laughter) — I’ve never seen a time where
there’s as much movement in the world.   
   
Think of all the nations that are reestablishing and reassessing where
they are, what they think, how they’re going to react, what they’re
going to do.   
   
And so, folks, we have to remember — we have to remember who we are. I
say this all the time, and I think — people think it’s hyperbole, but
it’s not. We’re the United States of America. We’re the only nation in
the world that I can — as a student of history — can find that’s come
out of every crisis we’ve met head on stronger than we went in– every
single time.   
   
There’s nothing beyond our capacity. I really mean it. There’s nothing
beyond our capacity when we do it together.   
   
So, folks, you know, when I ran the first time, I — you were all
gracious. You’re the — by the way, you — this room is the reason I’m
standing here. Not — that’s not hyperbole, either.  This room is the
reason I’m standing here.  Almost every one of you were with me from the
very beginning.   
   
And I said — when I said why I was running — they asked me why I was
running. I said, “For three reasons. One, to restore the soul of
America.” And I meant it. We can’t be a nation espousing a value set
that’s contrary to everything we believe.  Just decency.   
   
Did you ever think you’d ride down a street or in a rural area and see a
— a Trump flag with the middle of it saying, “F Biden,” and a little
kids standing there, giving you the middle finger, standing with their
parents? What are we — I don’t mi- — I believe — I don’t blame them for
being mad at me. That’s fine. They can — they can want to defeat me.   
   
But think how we’ve diminished the dialogue. What are we doing? What the
hell are we doing to our children?  
   
You know, the pandemic has extracted a big price from us, from this
society. One million people dead. Didn’t have to be that high. Didn’t
have to be that.   
   
We came in, we got to work, and finished it.   
   
But here’s the deal. I was speaking with Vivek Murthy, our Surgeon
General that I appointed. He talks about the mental health problems that
exist in the country as a consequence of this. For every single person
who passed away, the estimates are there’s 8 to 10 people who are
profoundly affected — mother, father, son, daughter, husband, wife. And
it’s had a profound effect.  
   
Well, folks, we can overcome all of this. We really can. And I think it
just — and the world is looking for us to lead.   
   
I don’t want to — you know, everybody says, “Well, why are you putting
the burden on us?” Because it’s who we are.   
   
We’re the most unique country in the world. Last comment, I promise. The
most unique country in the world. Every other country is organized based
upon ethnicity, geography, religion.  It’s a — but we’re the only
country based on an idea. It’s not — it’s not a joke. An idea.   
   
We’ve never fully lived up to it, but we’ve never walked away.  The idea
is we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are
created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
rights. Like — we’ve never lived up to it, but we’ve never walked away
from it. We’ve never walked away from it.   
   
That’s why the rest of the world looks at us the way they do. That’s why
we have so much influence.   
   
And as long as I’m your president, we’re not going to give up that
influence.   
   
God bless you all.   
   
Thanks for everything.  (Applause.)
