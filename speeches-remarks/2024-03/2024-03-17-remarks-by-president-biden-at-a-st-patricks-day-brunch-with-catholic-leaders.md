  Leaders"

THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Well, happy St. Patrick’s
Day.  
   
Please — (applause).  Well, thank you, thank you, thank you.  Thank you
for making me look so good in front of my daughter.  (Laughter.)  Please
sit.   
   
Well, good morning everyone.   
   
AUDIENCE:  Good morning.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Taoiseach, I’m so glad to get to spend the day together
again.  
   
Your Eminence, thank you very much for being here as well.  
   
I’m glad to be joined by so many friends and — from the Catholic Bishops
Conference, as well as the Archdiocese of Washington.   
   
And it’s great to see our Special Envoy for Economic Affairs to Northern
Ireland, Joe Kennedy.  Where are you, Joe Joe?  (Applause.)  It doesn’t
go very much noticed, but Joe is doing one heck of a job — you really
are, Joe — pulling things together.  Thank you.   
   
And it’s great to have Kerry and Kathleen Kennedy.  Where are Kerry and
Kathleen?  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Hello.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  There you are.  Welcome almost home.  (Applause.)  It
wouldn’t be St. Patrick’s Day without you.  
   
And, also, Sister Carol Keehan and Sister Simone Campbell.  Where’s —
where are you, Sisters?  (Applause.)  The Nuns on the Bus.  (Laughter.) 
You remember, right?  God, I love you guys.  Thanks for being such
great, great partners.  
   
And welcome, everyone, to St. Patrick’s Day at the White House.   
   
You know, this has always been a special day for the Biden family and
the Biden household.  It’s not just about heritage, but it really is
about faith.  So much of it being Irish means to be connected to the
Catholic teachings I grew up with.  
   
I went to St. — as they say in Scranton, *St. Paul’s* — (pronounced in a
Scranton accent) — meaning “Paul’s” — St.  Paul’s School in Scranton,
Holy Rosary in Claymont and St. Helena’s, and then Archmere Academy.   
   
And, you know, I like the belief that we’ve learned from the beginning:
that we’re all created equal in the image of God, that every single
human being deserves to be treated with dignity.   
   
My dad used to have an expression.  My dad would say, “Joey, a job is
about a lot more than a paycheck.  It’s about your dignity.  It’s about
respect.  It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say,
‘Honey, it’s going to be okay.’”   
   
And it’s not — you know, that is — it’s just not enough to wish the
world would be better.  We have a duty to make it better.   
   
My best friend in the world, my sister, Valerie, has — Val, stand at
up.  I want people to — (applause).  
   
Valerie used to be three years younger than me.  Now, she’s 20 years
younger than me.  (Laughter.)  I might note, there’s no woman in the
Biden household as old as any man in the household.  (Laughter.)   
   
And, you know, our mother, Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden, used to
say, “Joey” — and I mean this; this is what she’d say, repeatedly — “as
long as you’re alive, you have an obligation to strive.  And you’re not
done until you’ve seen the face of God.  So, keep moving.”  That was her
expression, for real.   
   
And that belief inspired generations of Irish women and men to keep
going, even in the face of enormous setbacks.  And it convinced millions
of Irish immigrants, including my ancestors and many of you here, to —
here today — to leave their beloved homeland and begin a new life in
America.   
   
It led Ireland to become a global voice of liberty — which it still is —
equality, and peace.  And it continues to inspire the work of Catholic
organizations represented here today.   
   
The Catholic Church has always stepped in when people were suffering to
meet their needs — food, shelter, healthcare, education.  Your
organizations make real the instructions of Jesus and — gave his
apostles, “Whatever you do unto the least of my brothers — these, my
brothers and sisters, you do unto me.”  And that’s kind of the essence
of who we all are.   
   
I want to thank you all for the incredible, valuable work you do to
support the vulnerable people in communities across the United States
and, I might add, around the world.   
   
So, thank you all for being here.  Happy St. Patrick’s Day.   
   
And now, I’d like his Eminence, Cardinal Pierre, to come up here and to
maybe give us a blessing.  (Applause.)
