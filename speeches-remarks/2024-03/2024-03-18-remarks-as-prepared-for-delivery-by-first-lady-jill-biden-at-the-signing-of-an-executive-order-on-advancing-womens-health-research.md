East Room, The White House

“If you don’t have an idea that materializes and changes a person’s
life, then what have you got? …You have talk, research, telephone calls,
meetings, but you don’t have a change in the community.” Eunice Kennedy
Shriver.  
   
Maria, you live your mother’s words purely, lovingly, and relentlessly.
Thank you for your life’s work and for being an amazing partner on this
effort.  
   
Good morning.  
   
In the early 1970s, researchers in the U.S. studied estrogen’s effect in
preventing heart attacks.  
   
You see, it was observed that women who had gone through menopause –
therefore, who had lower levels of estrogen – were more likely to have
heart attacks.  
   
So, a study was conducted asking whether estrogen prevents heart
attacks.  
   
8,341 people were selected for that study.  
   
All of them men!  
   
This is how things were done.  
   
Even though women are half the population, women’s health research has
been underfunded and understudied.  
   
Too many of our medications, treatments, and medical school textbooks
are based on men and their bodies.  
   
But that ends today.  
   
Finally! Women will get the health care we deserve.  
   
In just a few moments, my husband, President Biden, will sign the most
comprehensive executive order in history to advance research on women’s
health.  
   
On behalf of all of us, thank you, Joe.  
   
If you ask any woman in America about her health care, she probably has
a story to tell.  
   
You know her.  
   
She’s the woman who gets debilitating migraines, but doesn’t know why,
and can’t find treatment options that work for her.  
   
She’s the woman going through menopause, who visits her doctor and
leaves with more questions than answers, even though half the country
will go through menopause at some point in their lives.  
   
She’s the woman whose heart attack isn’t recognized because her symptoms
don’t look like a man’s, even as heart disease is the leading cause of
death among women.  
   
So many of us – and so many of the women in our lives – suffer from
health conditions for which we simply don’t have answers or solutions.  
   
Think about it: you might have the best doctors, or the best
insurance.  
   
But when it comes to Alzheimer’s, Endometriosis, IBS, or disruptive
menopausal symptoms, is that enough?  
   
No!  
   
We simply don’t know enough about how to prevent, detect, and treat the
conditions that affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or
differently.  
   
And that’s the result of a choice: Because, for decades, “business as
usual” has meant understudying and underfunding research on women’s
health.  
   
Your President believes this is unacceptable.  
   
When Maria brought this issue to me and Joe less than a year ago, he
knew he could make a real difference.  
   
That’s what Joe does best: he takes action – and quickly.  
   
Joe is the first President to make investing in women’s health research
– investing in your health, in our health – a top White House
priority.  
   
It’s no secret that Joe’s accomplishments on health care are historic.  
   
You’ve heard about his successes: reducing health care premiums and
prescription drug costs, protecting millions of patients from surprise
medical bills and junk fees, and getting more Americans covered by
insurance.  
   
But it’s important you know that what Joe is doing through his White
House Initiative on Women’s Health Research is different and without
precedent.  
   
He is investing resources into actually understanding the scientific
basis of women’s health conditions – which will allow researchers,
doctors, and industry to find new ways to prevent, detect, and treat
women’s health.  
   
Thanks to Joe’s experience and vision, he’s approaching this problem
differently, too.  
   
As President, Joe created ARPA-H, a new health care agency that pursues
breakthroughs in health research at lightning speed.  
   
Just a few weeks ago, ARPA-H launched its first-ever “sprint” for
women’s health, putting $100 million into women’s health research and
development.  
   
During his State of the Union address earlier this month, Joe called on
Congress to invest $12 billion into women’s health research, giving
researchers the funding needed to make the kinds of discoveries that
will change everything.  
   
And he’s calling on entrepreneurs, investors, private industry, and
philanthropists to do their part – because it’s going to take all of
us.  
   
Joe is fighting to finally deliver the answers that millions of women
need about their health.  
   
This Executive Order wouldn’t be possible without so many women who have
been at this work for decades. Many of them doctors who are here with us
today – including Susan, Valerie, Carolyn, and so many others.  
   
So today, as we celebrate Women’s History Month, let’s write a new
future for ourselves, and for the girls and women who will follow.  
   
A future where women leave doctors’ offices with more answers than
questions.  
   
A future where no woman or girl has to hear that, “it’s all in your
head,” or “it’s just stress.”  
   
A future where women aren’t just an after-thought in a world designed
for men, but the first thought in a world designed for everyone.  
   
A future where women don’t just survive, they lead long, healthy, and
happy lives.   
   
Today is only the beginning.  
   
Thank you.  
   
And now it is my honor to introduce a person who is helping make this
future a reality: my husband, the President of the United States, Joe
Biden.
