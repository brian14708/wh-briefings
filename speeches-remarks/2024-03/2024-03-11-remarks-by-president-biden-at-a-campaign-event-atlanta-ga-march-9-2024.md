Pullman Yards  
Atlanta, Georgia  
(March 9, 2024)

5:42 P.M. EST  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, Atlanta!  (Applause.)  I’m Joe Biden.  I’m Jill
Biden’s husband.  (Laughter and applause.)   
   
And, Desera, thank you for your introduction.  And when you’re President
of the United States and I — they say, “Joe Biden is out in the waiting
room,” don’t say “Joe who?”  Okay?  (Laughter.)  
   
Mayor Andre Dickenson — Dickens — I just add another syllable to your
name.  (Laughter.)  Thank you for the passport into the city, Mr.
Mayor.  (Applause.)  
   
And Reverend Senator Warnock, thank you for your leadership. 
(Applause.)  And thank you for the honor — giving me the honor to speak
at your congregation at Ebenezer Baptist Church.   
   
Look, Senator Ossoff — you’re the best, Jon.  You’re doing a hell of a
job.  And he’s always, always there, and he votes his conscience, and
he’s not afraid to stand up for what he believes.  (Applause.)  
   
To the many members of the House of Representatives here and all other
elected officials, thank you for your service.   
   
And to former Atlanta mayor and former member of my team in the White
House, Keisha Lance Bottoms, thank you.  (Applause.)  Keisha — I said to
her a moment ago — I said, “We miss you.”  And her husband said, “So did
I.  I got her.”  (Laughter.)  
   
     And, Governor Wes Moore, thank you for coming down from Maryland,
man.  (Applause.)  He’s the best, man.  He can play.  (Laughter.)    
   
And all of you here today, you know, you’re the reason why we’re going
to win.  (Applause.)  By the way, that’s not hyperbole.  You’re the
reason we’re going to win.   
   
Donald Trump has a different constituency.  Here’s a guy who’s kicking
off his general election campaign on the road up with Marjorie Taylor
Greene.   
   
AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  It can tell you a lot about a person who he keeps
company with.  (Laughter.)  And yesterday, he was hosting at his club,
Viktor Orbán —   
   
AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  — who says he doesn’t think democracy works.  Called him
a “fantastic leader.”  Seriously.  (Laughter.)  He’s been sucking up to
win him — (laughs) — anyway —  (inaudible) dictators and authorian —
authoritarian thugs all around the world.   
   
He said the North Korean Dictator Kim Jong Un wrote him a — quote,
“wrote him a beautiful letter.”  (Laughter.)   
   
He bragged about calling Xi Jinping a “king.”  He called Putin and he
said, “Do whatever the hell you want to our Allies.”   
   
AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m not making these — I’m not making these quotes up. 
When he says he wants to be a dictator, I believe him.   
   
But I don’t want to get carried away here.  (Laughs.)  Before I begin, I
want to say thank you —  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  What are you going to do, Genocide Joe?  Tens of
thousands of Palestinians (inaudible).  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Whoa, whoa, whoa —  
   
AUDIENCE:  Four more years!  Four more years!  Four more years!  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  
   
AUDIENCE:  Four more years!  Four more years!  Four more years!  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Look, thank you.  Look, I don’t resent — I don’t resent
— I don’t resent his passion.  There’s a lot of Palestinians who are
being unfairly victimized.   
   
But, folks, look —  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Free, free Palestine!  Free, free Palestine!  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  — before I begin, I want to say thank you to all those
outstanding Black, Latinos, AAPI organizations supporting Kamala and
me.  (Applause.)    
   
In 2020 and 2022, especially here in Georgia, but all across the
country, you called your neighbors, you texted your friends, you knocked
on doors, and you never stop.  And you’re with us all the way. 
(Applause.)  And we’re here to say a simple thank you, thank you, thank
you.  (Applause.)  
   
And here tonight, because you really want to do it again, because you
are going to win this primary for us on Tuesday.  And because we’re
going to win in November.  (Applause.)  
   
So, I mean this: Thank you, thank you, thank you.  I really mean it.   
   
Three years ago, you helped the Democratic ticket and won Georgia a
presidential election for the first time in 30 years.  (Applause.)  On
Thursday, when I gave my State of the Union Address, I talked about how
far we’ve come since the 2020 election.  I also talked about how much is
at stake.   
   
Folks, it’s not hyperbole to suggest our freedoms are literally on the
ballot this November.  Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans are trying
to take our freedoms away.   
   
And, by the way, not all Republicans.  This ain’t — this ain’t your
father’s Republican Party.  These guys are different.   
   
But guess what?  We’re not going to let them take them away. 
(Applause.)  
   
Thursday night marked 59 years since hundreds of foot soldiers for
justice in Selma, Alabama, marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge named
after the Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan to claim their fundamental
right to vote.  They were beaten, they are bloodied, they were left for
dead, but they were unbowed.  
   
Our late friend, son of — son of Georgia, John Lewis, was there. 
(Applause.)  And what happened five months later?  We passed — the
Voting Rights Act was signed into law.  But nearly six decades after
that, the same forces are back — led by Donald Trump — taking us back in
time, suppressing the vote, subverting elections. 

That’s why we have to stand up again.  (Applause.)  We know what to do. 
And my message to Georgia voters and to voters all across this country
is: Send me a Congress that will pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the
John Lewis Voting Rights Act.  (Applause.)    
   
The same forces that want to deny the right to vote try to deny other
core values of American diversity as well: banning books, erasing
history.  Instead of celebrating the contribution of immigrants to our
country, to our economy, and our communities, Donald Trump calls them
“vermin,” “poison” in the blooding of — poisoning the blood of
America.   
   
No one should ever doubt where my heart is.  Unlike Donald Trump, on my
first day in office as President, I introduced a comprehensive — a
comprehensive plan to fix our immigration system, secure our border,
provide a pathway for citizenship for DREAMers and their families —
farmworkers, essential workers who helped us through the pandemic and
are part of the fabric of our community.   
   
Because unlike Donald Trump, I know who we are as Americans. 
(Applause.)  It’s why I promised to have an administration that looks
like America.  (Applause.)  The most diverse Cabinet and administration
in American history led by a \[historic\] Vice President.   
   
A court that represents all the people.  Sixty-five percent of the
judges I’ve appointed are women.  (Applause.)  Sixty-five percent are
people of color.  (Applause.)  I’ve appointed more Black women to the
circuit courts than every other president in American history combined —
(applause) — and the first African American woman to the Supreme Court. 
(Applause.)  
   
Look, in my State of the Union Address, I talked about the social worker
in Alabama.  She scheduled an IVF treatment for her second child.  But
the Supreme Court of Alabama shut down IVF treatments across the state,
unleashed by the U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade.   
   
AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
 THE PRESIDENT:  What her family has gone through should never have
happened.  And folks — folks, you know why this happened.  Well, I tell
you why: Donald Trump.  He came to office determined to see o- — Roe v.
Wade overturned.  In fact, he brags about it.   
   
Well, he got his wish.  And states are passing bans that criminalize
doctors, forcing rape and incest victims to leave their states to get
help.  And now MAGA Republicans and Donald Trump want to pass a national
ban on the right to choose.  
   
Well, hear me loud and clear: not on my watch.  (Applause.)  In its
decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court majority wrote, and
I quote, “Women are not without electoral or political power.”  As I
said in the State of the Union, “They ain’t seen nothing yet.” 
(Applause.)  
   
But they’re about to see — they’re about to see it, just like we saw it
on the ballot in 2022 and 2023.  And they’ll find out again in 2024. 
(Applause.)  
   
I’m deadly earnest about this.  Look, I want — I want to thank Vice
President Harris for leading the way on this issue and so many others. 
(Applause.)   
   
And, Georgia, I have a message for you: Send me a Congress that supports
the right to choose, and I promise you I will restore Roe v. Wade as the
law of the land again.  (Applause.)  
   
Folks, I inherited an economy that was on the brink.  But since I took
office, we’ve created 15 million new jobs in just three years. 
(Applause.)  That’s a record in American history.   
   
Eight hundred new manufacturing jobs.  I said, “Where’s it written that
we can’t be the manufacturing capital of the world?”  (Applause.)  

Unemployment hit a 50-year low — (applause) — so far.  And under Donald
Trump, Black and Latino unemployment skyrocketed.  Under my
administration, we have record low Black and Latino un- — unemployment. 
(Applause.)   
      
Donald Trump, Asian American unemployment nearly doubled.  Now — now the
employment rate of Asian Americans is the highest it’s been since 2008. 
(Applause.)  
   
Look, we’ve cut Black child poverty in half, cut Latino poverty by a
record as well.  We’re seeing the fastest rate of new Latino businesses
all over this decade.  And the next 30 years, it’s going to even be
bigger.   
   
Look, folks, more people have health insurance than ever before. 
(Applause.)  The racial wealth gap is a smallest it’s been in 20 years. 
(Applause.)  Wages are back up; inflation is coming down.  Inflation has
dropped from 9 to 3 percent.  (Applause.)  
   
We’ve already accomplished a lot.  So, now let’s talk about the future
we can build together.  (Applause.)  It’s about the future.   
   
For example, Americans pay more for prescription drugs than anywhere
else in the world.  It’s wrong.  But I’m ending it.  (Applause.)  The
law I propose that we signed, no — not one Republican voted for it, I
might add — we finally beat Big Pharma.  (Applause.)   
   
For example, instead of paying $400 a month for insulin that saves
seniors lives, they now only pay $35.  Do you know how much it costs to
make it?  It costs $10.  It costs $10 to make it.  (Applause.)   
   
But I didn’t stop there.  We capped insulin at 35 bucks a month, and I
want to do it for every single American.  (Applause.)   
   
I finally beat Big Pharma and gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower
prices for all prescription drugs, like the VA does.  But guess what? 
It just doesn’t save seniors money; it’s saving the taxpayers $160
billion — (applause) — that one thing.  Seriously.    
   
Cutting the federal deficit — these guys talk about the de- — I don’t
want to get into that.  I’ll get carried — (laughter).  
   
Now it’s time to go further and no- — negotiate lower drug prices for
every drug.  Look, that will save taxpayers, if we do that, another $200
billion because Medicare doesn’t have to pay the bill.   
   
Beginning in January of next year, it’s already the law we passed.  We
capped prescription drug costs for seniors on Medicare at total $2,000 a
year, no matter how much they cost.  (Applause.)  Because you — as some
of you know, unfortunately, you’ve experienced it.  These cancer drugs
can cost $10-, $12-, $15,000 a year.  Now let’s cap prescription drug
costs to $2,000 a year for every American — (applause) — all
Americans.   
   
And, folks, the Affordable Care Act is still a very big deal. 
(Applause.)  It used to be called “Obamacare.”  (Applause.)  Over 100
Americans — 100 million Americans can no longer be denied health
insurance because of a preexisting condition because of that law. 
(Applause.)  And not only that, we’ve lowered the cost of insurance by
$800 a year for so many families — and on top of it.   
   
Donald Trump wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act.   
   
AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  That would mean ripping health insurance away from 3
million Black Americans, 4 million Latinos, and a million Asian
Americans.   
   
I’ve got news for Donald Trump: not on my watch.  (Laughter and
applause.)  And if Trump and the Republicans try to cut Social Security
again, I will stop them.  (Applause.)   
   
Look, I’m also working to bring down the cost of housing.  That’s why I
want to pri- — I want to provide an annual tax credit for the next two
years of $400 a month, over the next two years, as rates come down, to
put toward mortgages.  If they’re pur- — buying your first home or you
need to trade up a little for more space.  That’s what’s going to
happen.  (Applause.)  And the interest rates will be down.  
   
We’re cracking down on big landlords who break antitrust laws by price
fixing and driving up rents.  Now Congress needs to pass my plan to
build and renovate 2 million affordable houses and apartments —
(applause) — and bring those rents down.   
   
Look, we’re also removing all poisonous lead pipes in the — millions of
them in America so every child can turn on a water fountain at school or
at home without risking getting brain damage, because that’s what’s
happening.   
   
Look, and I’m making college more affordable.  (Applause.)  It was hard
for me and my — my brothers and sisters to get through college because
it was tough.  And the — and the tuitions weren’t even anywhere near
what they are today.   
   
By fixing the student loan program, like the Public Service Loan
Forgiveness Program, I’ve reduced the burden of student debt for nearly
4 million Americans — (applause) — including teachers, nurses,
firefighters, and other public servants.   
   
Donald Trump swears that if he gets elected, he’s going to stop it. 
Well, let me tell you something: He won’t stop me.  (Applause.)  
   
So, let’s continue to increase Pell Grants for working-class and
middle-class families, increase our record investment in HBCUs and other
minority-serving institutions.  (Applause.)   
   
We already contributed over $7 billion to HBCUs.  And you know why? 
Because they’re just as bright, just as capable as — though they don’t
have the endowments.  And so, they can’t — they can’t — they don’t have
the laboratories to train for the new high-tech jobs.  But now they
will.  And now they do.  (Applause.)  
   
Look, we’re building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up,
not the top down.  Donald Trump did just the opposite.  He — he enacted
a $2 trillion tax cut that overwhelmingly benefited the top one half of
1 percent and the biggest corporations and exploded the federal
deficit.  He added more to the national debt in the four years he was
there than any presidential term in history —   
   
AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  — so — by the way.  Give me a break about reducing the
debt.  Come on.  
   
Folks, how many of you think the tax code is fair?  Raise your hand.  
   
AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I sure don’t.  And I’m going to keep fighting like hell
to make it fair.  Under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a
year will pay an additional penny in federal tax.  Nobody.  Not — not
one penny.  (Applause.)  But big corporations and the very wealthy will
finally begin to pay their fair share.    
   
In 2020, the 55 largest corpora- — of the five — Fortune 500, 55 of
those companies made $40 billion in profits, and they didn’t pay a
single penny in tax.  Zero.   
   
AUDIENCE:  Booo —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Not anymore.  Thanks to the law I wrote and signed, big
companies have to pay a minimum of 15 percent.  (Applause.)  But 15
percent is still less than working people pay in federal taxes.  It’s
time to raise the corporate minimum tax to at least 21 percent —
(applause) — so every billion-dollar corporation begins to finally begin
to pay their fair share.   
   
Look, folks, there are one thousand billionaires in America — one
thousand.  Look, I’m a — I’m a capitalist.  If you make a billion
dollars, fine, if you do it fairly.  But guess what?  Pay your fair
share of federal taxes.  (Applause.)  Do you know how much they pay? 
You know what the rate is they pay in federal taxes?  8.2 percent.  
   
Raise your hand if you’d trade for that?  You’d all take 8.2 percent,
wouldn’t you?   
   
It’s far less than the vast majority of Americans pay.  No billionaire
should pay a lower tax rate than a teacher, a sanitation worker, a
nurse.  (Applause.)   
   
That’s why I proposed a minimum tax of 25 percent for billionaires — 25
— just 25 percent.  You know how much money that would raise?  Five
hundred billion dollars over the next 10 years.  (Applause.)  Imagine
what that could do for America and our — for our future — from lowering
the deficit to childcare, home care, paid leave so many other countries
have — and still lower the deficit.   
   
Look, folks, let me close with this.  You’re all standing.  I’m keeping
you too long.  I know —  
   
AUDIENCE:  Four more years!  Four more years!  Four more years!  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I know the American story.  It’s a con- — thank you.  
   
AUDIENCE:  Four more years!  Four more years!  Four more years!  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Folks, look, I know the American story. 
It’s a contest between competing forces in the battle for the soul of
this nation, between those who want to pull America backwards and those
who want to move America into the future.   
   
My lifetime has taught me to embrace the future of freedom and
democracy.  And Trump and I have a very different value set, if it isn’t
obvious already.  Mine is based on core values that defined America. 
And the rest of the world looks at us that way: decency, honesty,
fairness, equality.   
   
But we all know Donald Trump sees a different America — an American
story of resentment, revenge, and retribution.  That’s not me.  That’s
not you.  (Applause.)   
   
We see a future where we define democracy and defend it, not diminish
it.  We see a future where we defend the basic freedoms, not take them
away.  We see a future — we see a future where we reward work, not just
wealth, where the wealthy pay their fair share.  And we see a future
where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from
gun violence.  
   
And, folks, I mean this.  As I’ve traveled the world — I’ve been in most
countries around the world.  I know the vast majority of the world
leaders because I’ve been around a day or two.  (Laughter.)  I know I
don’t look it.  (Laughter.)  
   
But we see a future — I see a future that must remain the beacon of the
world.  Above all, we see a country for all Americans, a future for all
Americans, a presidency for all Americans.  So, join me.  Get out the
vote.  (Applause.)   
   
Vote!  Vote!  Vote!  
   
AUDIENCE:  Vote!  Vote!  Vote!   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Vote!   
   
From the bottom of my heart, I believe in America.  I believe in you,
the American people.  We just have to remember who we are, for God’s
sake.  We are the United States of America.  (Applause.)  There is
simply nothing — nothing beyond our capacity when we act together.  So,
let’s do that.  Get out to vote.   
   
And God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops.  (Applause.) 
Thank you, thank you, thank you.   
   
(The President picks up a pin thrown onto the stage.)  “Regulate guns,
not women.”  (Applause.)
