VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Good afternoon.  President Arévalo, welcome to
Washington D.C.  It is good to see you after we have talked on the
phone.  But it was my pleasure to congratulate you by telephone on your
election in September — when we spoke in September.   
   
And now, of course, it is my great pleasure and honor to welcome you to
the White House.   
   
During your campaign, you vowed to combat corruption, you pledged to
build a coalition to represent all Guatemalans and include members of
the Indigenous community in the democratic process, and you committed to
expand access to healthcare and education, to combat the climate crisis,
and to grow your economy.  And it was clear that the people of Guatemala
voted resoundingly in your election and for your message of reform.  
   
Your election has brought a sense of optimism to the people of America
and around the world.  And despite the challenges that have been posed
to Guatemala’s democratic process, the United States was proud to stand
with you, Mr. President, following a free and fair election and
throughout your transition.  And the will of the people of Guatemala, by
our observation, has triumphed.   
   
For the past three years, I have led our administration’s efforts to
address the root causes of migration from northern Central America and
to create what we have named the “Root Causes Strategy.”   
   
That strategy rests on five pillars.  One, to invest in economic
development in the region.  Two, to combat corruption and promote good
governance.  Three, to respect human rights and labor rights.  In
addition, to reduce violence.  And finally, to address gender-based
violence.   
   
This work is improving lives and livelihoods in the region and
addressing the factors that drive people to migrate to the United
States.   
   
Mr. President, I believe your presidency offers an important opportunity
for us to strengthen U.S.-Guatemalan relations and to make further
progress on each of the five pillars I have outlined.   
   
In particular, Mr. President, I commend you for your steadfast
commitment to combat corruption.  Corruption, of course, erodes trust in
democracy and prevents governments from responding to the needs of their
people.  Corruption is also an impediment to U.S. investment and
threatens economic growth as American business leaders need stability,
predictability, and rule of law to make their investments in countries
like Guatemala worthwhile.  And corruption, of course, empowers criminal
organizations and perpetuates violence.  All factors that drive people
to leave their home country.   
   
Mr. President, as you hold corrupt actors accountable and promote good
governance, we support you.   
   
Your leadership can help rebuild Guatemalans people’s trust in their
institutions and give them a sense of hope and opportunity.   
   
Our work under the Root Causes Strategy represents long-term development
efforts.  The problems, of course, did not occur overnight, and the
solutions will not be achieved overnight.  Yet we have seen short-term
progress in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras.   
   
Thus far, the Root Causes Strategy has helped as many as 63,000 farmers
increase their production and income, has reached nearly 3 million youth
through primary and secondary education.  We have trained more than
18,000 police officers and nearly 27,000 people to strengthen judicial
systems.  And we have supported thousands of labor and human rights
activists throughout the region.   
   
When I first started my work on root causes, I recognized that we needed
to involve the private sector in order to have a lasting impact on
irregular migration.  A critical component of our strategy has been to
increase private-sector investment in the region to help create jobs and
expand economic opportunity.   
   
I believe that public-private partnerships are essential to combine the
resources, the experience, and the expertise of the private sector with
the reach and the capacity that only governments can provide.  And
growth and opportunity will far exceed what either the public or private
sector can do independently.   
   
To that end, we have established Central America Forward, an innovative
public-private partnership that over the past three years has been
fueled by CEOs and philanthropic leaders around the world.  I am pleased
to announce that as of today, this partnership has generated more than
$5.2 billion in private-sector commitments, with more than 50 companies
representing financial services, textiles, apparel, agriculture,
technology, and telecommunications.   
   
Central America Forward has thus far created 70,000 new jobs throughout
the region, provided skills training for more than 1 million people,
brought more than 2.5 million people into the formal financial economy,
and connected more than 4.5 million people to the Internet.   
   
Today’s announcement of more than $1 billion in new investments includes
energy transmission projects to connect people to the grid, an
initiative to transport crops from small farms to new and larger
markets, construction of a new industrial park, and digital financial
inclusion, and workforce development programs.   
   
Our partnership has also created what we have named “In Her Hands,”
which is an initiative to advance economic security for women.   
   
We have launched the Good Governance, Good Jobs Declaration, which
includes a corporate pledge on the rule of law to support labor rights,
combat corruption, and increase transparency.   
   
We have sent a team to Honduras to explore development of infrastructure
projects and to expand an economic corridor. And we started Central
America Service Corps, which will provide vulnerable youth with training
and opportunities for paid community service projects.   
   
In conclusion, President Arévalo, I am pleased that you will join in
convening a meeting that we will host later today with leaders from the
private sector and civil society to continue this important work.   
   
And I look forward to a productive visit today and to a productive
partnership, which, of course, relies on the importance and the mutual
and, I believe, shared priority of transparency and candor to achieve
our mutual interest to the benefit of all of our people.   
   
I thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you.  
   
PRESIDENT ARÉVALO:  Thank you very much, Madam Vice President.  Thank
you very much for the invitation.  It is an honor to be here today.   
   
And thank you very much for your leadership in helping us develop this
new moment of promising new partnership between Guatemala and the United
States.   
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Thank you.  
   
PRESIDENT ARÉVALO:  I view this as a historic moment in relations
between our two countries, which share basic values and common interests
and confront many joint challenges.  Your ongoing work, which you have
described in terms of the initiatives that you have been leading for the
Central American region for several years now, are welcomed by all of us
who want to strengthen the ties between Guatemala and increase
prosperity in our region in general.   
   
I also want, on behalf of all Guatemalans, to express my deep
appreciation for the support that the United States provided to our
country during our difficult trans- — electoral process and presidential
transition.  The actions of the United States and the international
community in support of democracy and — and rule of law were critical to
ensuring that the popular will of the Guatemalan people prevails.   
   
This meeting today reflects what we believe will be continuing strong
support from the United States for our efforts to consolidate democracy,
strengthen public institutions, and fight corruption, and promote
economic prosperity and sustainable development that benefits all
Guatemalans.   
   
We recognize that, just like the majority of Guatemalans, our supporters
in the United States and in the international community have great
expectations for what can be achieved in Guatemala in the next few
years.   
   
My government is committed to doing everything it can to meet those
expectations and to deliver results in the short, medium, and long
term.   
   
And we also recognize that many of the problems we face are structural
and longstanding and cannot be solved in a short period of time, nor
without support and cooperation from the United States and other key
international partners.   
   
So, as I said, this is a truly historic moment that offers great promise
for strengthening our collaboration and advancing together as strategic
partners on the basis of shared values and common interests.   
   
We will maintain our commitment as governments to foster engagement
across sectors to build a new, democratic, and most — more prosperous
Guatemala that offers opportunities for all to live and to thrive.   
   
Thank you very much, madam.  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Welcome again.  Welcome.  (Applause.)   
   
PRESIDENT ARÉVALO:  Thank you.  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Thank you.
