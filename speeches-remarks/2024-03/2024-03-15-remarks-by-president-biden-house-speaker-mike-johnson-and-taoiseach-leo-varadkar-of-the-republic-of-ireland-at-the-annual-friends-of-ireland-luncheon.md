U.S. Capitol  
Washington, D.C.

1:35 P.M. EDT  
   
SPEAKER JOHNSON:  Well, thank — thank you all.  I know it’s been a great
time of fellowship and enjoyment.  It’s been very loud in here.  That’s
a good sign.  That’s a good sign.  Not great acoustics, but great
fellowship.  
   
This lunch is a special event, as we noted earlier because it’s a time
when we come together here in Washington each year.  And what’s unique
about it, what important, I think, is that we look past our political
differences for this moment in time and we remember the importance of
peacemaking and we celebrate the important friendship between our two
countries: the United States and Ireland.  
   
And today, we all welcome continued efforts to promote and preserve the
Good Friday Agreement and promises of a bright future for all the
friends of Ireland.  
   
And certainly, at this time, in many ways, our hearts are heavy, in
spite of the fun fellowship, because stability is being threatened in
Europe and in the Middle East.  And our allies and friends, such as
Israel and Taiwan, continue to fight for their very right to exist.  
   
And I know everyone is this room is committed to the same things.  We
know that we all must stand for national sovereignty and work for peace.

And this is an important time for all of us to encourage a productive
dialogue and mutual respect.  And even when we may disagree on matters
of politics and policy, which is inevitable, we should all appreciate
traditions like this — an occasion for thoughtful discourse where we can
thoughtfully move beyond was Yeats called “polite” but “meaningless
words.”  
   
When we do that, it restores trust among the people and it renews faith
in our institutions.  And I think all of us know that we need that
desperately right now.  
   
So — so, today, I’m happy that we’re able to showcase the Irish spirit
of charity and humor and friendship that flows through your children and
through my children and all the children and all of the friends of
Ireland.  
   
So, I have the distinct pleasure now of introducing our
Commander-in-Chief and someone who is known everywhere as America’s most
famous Irishman, President Joe Biden.  (Applause.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you all very much.  Thank you. 
(Applause.)  
   
Well, Mr. Speaker, thank you very much.  I was telling the Speaker at
dinner when a good friend of mine and many of you, a former senator from
Oregon, Senator Smith, came to me when I was vice president and said,
“You know, I’ve checked it out.  You’re able to accept this gift.”  I
said, “What’s the gift?”  He said, “Well, the single most significant
compilation of historical records and family records are held by the
Mormon church.”  And he said, “We want to do — we want to do a
background for you.  We want to check your genealogy for you.”  
   
And they ended up showing up five months later with six volumes.  And
one of them pointed out that, on one side of the family, the ones that
came from County Louth, they started off in New Orleans.  And I’ve
warned them.  They could have stayed; I would have been a bit of
trouble.  (Laughter.)  
   
Folks, look, Mr. Speaker and — and I want to — I want you to know that
diplomat Shane Leslie once wrote, “Every St. Patrick’s Day — every St.
Patrick’s Day, every Irishman goes out to find another Irishman to make
a speech to.”  So — (laughter) — so, thank you for allowing me to find
you.  Mom, it’s okay.  (Laughter.)   
   
Look, you know, I’m glad I found all of you, because no matter how much
we debate, no matter how much we disagree, we always have been able to
come together as friends of Ireland.  And, you know, the friendship goes
back centuries.   
   
But today is an important period, an important milestone: nearly 100
years of diplomatic relations, Taoiseach, and (inaudible) 100 years of
Ireland and the United States.   
   
So, Mr. Speaker, thank you for hosting us today.  It’s a tradition I’ve
always enjoyed.  
   
And, Taoiseach, thank you for joining us again.   
   
And I’d also like to extend the 100,000 welcomes to all leaders who are
involved in the Ireland and Northern Ireland agreements that they’ve now
— put it together.  And I think — I — I just wonder whether my mother
would have ever thought that would happen.  (Laughs.)  But it has
happened, and it’s great.   
   
You know, it’s great to come together once again.  
   
To all Irish Americans, Democrats and Republican members here, I’m glad
to be united on this issue.  We begin the next century of a real
partnership.  And it has been partnership, but it’s really increasing
now.   
   
And finally, to all that wish they were Irish, I’m glad you’re here
too.  (Laughter.)  My grandfather used to say that being Irish is — is
enough.  (Laughs.)  At any rate, I won’t go into that.  (Laughter.)  
   
Well, I stand here as a proud descendant of the Finnegans and the
Blewitts.  The Finnegans are from the County Mayo, which I just was
there not long ago.  And the Finnegans are from County Louth.  And this
pride is part of my soul, as I’m sure that all of you who are Irish
ancestry feel the same way.   
   
In fact, as many of you know, when I served on Capitol Hill, my
colleagues used to kid me because I always quoted Irish poets.  They
thought I quoted Irish poets, Rev, because I was Irish.  I don’t do it
for that reason.  Because they’re the best poets in the world, that’s
why I quote them.  (Laughter.)   
   
Steny, it’s true.  (Laughter.)  
   
And, you know, I really — today, there’s one poem in particular that
comes to mind.  It was written by my great-grandfather Edward Francis
Blewitt, who was only the second Catholic elected to the state senate in
the state of Pennsylvania, back in 1906.  And he wrote a book of poems,
a hundred poems, and — about his — he referred to it as his Ireland.   
   
One, he called “The Worker.”  And here’s what he said: “No barrier is
too thick or strong to stay the onward march each day.  A goal they
seek, a goal they find.  Hardship to them is but real play.”   
   
And I think, together, Ireland and America are always marching forward
toward a better world, toward a better life, and one of greater liberty,
greater dignity, and greater equity and outcomes of opportunity and
possibilities for everybody — possibilities.   
   
I was with Xi Jinping a couple of years ago on the Tibetan Plateau, and
he asked me could I define America.  And I said — this was recorded by
him, as well.  I said, “Yes, in one word.”  He said, “What’s that?”  I
said, “Possibilities.”  
   
Think about it.  What defines us as Americans?  We think anything is
possible.  Anything is possible if we do it together.  
   
Well, together, Ireland and America have always moved onward for a
better future, one of greater liberty, greater dignity, greater
equality, opportunity, and possibility.  And even when those barriers
seem so thick and so strong, even — even when we face sorrow, setbacks,
and division and darkness, together, we’ve always persevered — Ireland
and the United States.  We’ve always held out hope that arises that
we’ve not yet seen.   
   
You know, I often say that the Irish are the only people in the world
who are nostalgic about tomorrow.  (Laughter.)  Think about it.  That’s
an original quote, unfortunately.   
   
But they — that’s — that’s (inaudible) who we are.  And I often say that
because wherever — wherever there is a yearning for freedom, wherever
there is a call for progress, people around the world, they can always
count on Ireland and the United States to be on their side, not just for
hope but to help — to help them in their march forward.  We see this in
our — in our support of Ukraine and the people in the face of Putin’s
vicious onslaught against Ukraine.   
   
Taoiseach, we — we had a meeting earlier today.  I told you that I’m
deeply grateful for Ireland’s unwavering humanitarian aid to people of
not only Ukraine but also Gaza.  I’m committed to continue to do our
part.  I’m confident the vast majority — and excuse me for saying this,
but I think the vast majority of members of Congress are willing to do
their part and continue to urge every member in this room to stand up to
Vladimir Putin.  He’s a thug — a thug.  (Applause.)  
   
And I urge you to send me the national security bill now.  The bill
includes funding for Ukraine and Israel and, maybe equally important,
humanitarian assistance to Gaza.  They badly, badly need it.  And it
sends a clear message that America stands up for freedom and we bow down
to no one — to no one in the world.  
   
You know, I said in Belfast last year, where we marked the 25th
anniversary of the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, I’m also committed to
protecting peace and progress in Northern Ireland.  We all know — we all
know that we feel — I assume all of us feel the same way.  That includes
Northern Ireland’s newest leaders, Minister O’Neill, and your Deputy
First Minister — are you guys here? (Applause.)  Stand up.  Thank you. 
(Applause/\_  
   
As a friend of mine from Claymont, Delaware, would say, “Who woulda
thunk it?”  (Laughter.)  
   
Thankfully, you’re here.  
   
And, look, to both of you, for — thank you for reminding us what
possibilities are as we work across the aisle and rise above
longstanding disagreements.  
   
Let me close with this.  I think we stand at an inflection point not
only in American history but in world history where the decisions we
make now are going to determine what the next three, four, five, six
decades are going to look like.  And I believe history is watching.  I
think history is watching.  
   
Today, let us resolve to march forward with each other and all those who
— all those who seek a better future.  Like our ancestors, remember no
barrier is too thick or too strong for Ireland and the United States to
get through.  There’s nothing, nothing our nations can’t do together
when we work together.  And I mean that from the bottom of my heart. 
I’m confident there’s not a thing we can’t do if we work together.  And
I say the same thing.  Remember this is the United States of America. 
There is nothing — nothing, nothing, nothing — beyond our capacity when
we work together.  
   
So, my prayer today is we continue and we increase our working
together.  Thank you all for having me.  (Applause.)  
   
SPEAKER JOHNSON:  Thank you for your remarks, Mr. President.   
   
And our next guest, though he is now leading the country and I believe
he is the youngest to ever hold his office, he started out — you may not
know this — as an intern in these very halls more than two decades ago. 
And while this is my first time having the pleasure to meet him in
person, he’s no stranger to this lunch either.  He’s been in leadership
for quite some time.  And he’s done a few of these.  
   
Will you please join me in welcoming our guest of honor from the
Republic of Ireland, the Taoiseach.  (Applause.)  
   
TAOISEACH VARADKAR: (Speaks Irish.)  (No translation provided.)  Mr.
Speaker, Mr. President, members of Congress, First Minister, Deputy
First Minister, esteemed friends and colleagues, it is a honor and a
privilege to be back among friends here in Washington, D.C., today.  And
thank you, Mr. Speaker, for continuing the tradition of hosting this
lunch today.  We are very appreciative.   
   
I believe that Ireland is perhaps the only country in the world that can
get away with turning our national holiday into an international week of
events or, in some places, a whole month.  (Laughter.)  
   
We’re also unique in having a national holiday where the head of
government and all the senior ministers leave the country to celebrate
it around the world — (laughter)– with our diaspora and our friends and
our allies.   
   
St. Patrick’s Day is more than our national holiday.  It is an
international moment.  It’s when we get to share our story with the
world — a story of faith in the future, no matter what the obstacles;
hope in our ability to work together for the greater good, out of
charity towards those who are experiencing suffering.   
   
As the President acknowledged, since we last gathered here last year,
the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement have returned.  And it’s
hugely significant that we’re joined here today by the First Minister
and the Deputy First Minister, Michelle O’Neill and Emma
Little-Pengelly, two women from different political traditions who are
showing what can be achieved working together, holding jointly a
co-equal office as heads of government of Northern Ireland.  It is so
good to have both of you here today.  (Applause.)  
   
And it’s really good to see colleagues here as well, ministers and
members of the Northern Ireland Assembly, including the Speaker of the
Assembly, Mr. Poots.  Also, to see members of the House of Commons here
too and members of Dáil Éireann and Oireachtas here, too, as well.  So
very much seeing all three strands of the Good Friday Agreement, the
totality of relationships — Northern Ireland, North South, and East West
— all represented here today, which makes us a very special moment.   
   
And I want, on behalf of all of us, to thank the United States and
members from both sides of the aisle and, indeed, beyond politics for
what you’ve done to help make Ireland and Northern Ireland a place where
young people can dream of coming times brighter than their grandparents
could ever have dared imagine.   
   
So, thank you for your role in giving us back our future.  We’ll forever
remember the steadfast work of so many members of Congress — Democrat
and Republican — as well as successive administrations over the years
who have made this possible.   
   
Throughout the entirety of the peace process, the Friends of Ireland
Caucus have been our resolute friends.  And on behalf of the Irish
people, thank you for your commitment to Ireland.  Our country is so
grateful for your friendship, for your leadership, and for your enduring
support.  So, thank you so much.  
   
Mr. Speaker, someday soon, we would really like to welcome you to
Ireland.  So, consider this the official invitation.  We’d love to —
love — love to show you around.   
   
And, of course, last year, we had the pleasure of showing President
Biden around the country.  Although he knows it so well, I don’t think
he needed a tour guide.  But it was a wonderful opportunity for him to
reconnect with relatives and friends and also to make new ones.   
   
Mr. Speaker, today, as we run into St. Patrick’s Day, I’m thinking very
much of the prayer of St. Patrick, which was alluded to earlier.  As we
face the most complicated and difficult circumstances in the world,
problems that have no easy answers, which demand that we do our best to
repel the forces of darkness, to defend our values, and to shield the
innocent — I’m thinking of St. Patrick’s prayer today for strength and
protection against every cruel and merciless power.   
   
When I reflect on the war being waged by Russia against Ukraine, the
light of democracy, the rule of international law, and liberty itself
are under attack from a relentless adversary who would extinguish them. 
Ukraine must not fall.  And together, we need to stand by Ukraine for as
long as it takes.  (Applause.)  
   
I’m also thinking of St. Patrick’s prayer today when he prayed for the
wisdom to guide us, when I reflect on the catastrophe that’s unfolding
in the Middle East — the savage attacks of October 7th in Israel, and
the terrible violence and loss of human life in Gaza which has followed
and continues.  And we very much want that to end.   
   
These are global challenges that demand our courage, our empathy, and
our action.  And we pray for the wisdom of St. Patrick in facing them.  
   
Mr. Speaker, over a hundred years ago, Ireland and the U.S. established
diplomatic relations — the oldest republic welcoming the newest member
of the international community.  And since then, it’s a relationship
that has grown on respect, friendship, and shared kinship.   
   
So, thank you so much for helping us in those 100 years to take our
place among the nations of the world.  We look forward to working with
America for the next hundred years, a second century of friendship and
alliance.   
   
(Speaks Irish.)  (No translation provided.)  
   
Happy St. Patrick’s Day, and thank you very much.  (Applause.)
