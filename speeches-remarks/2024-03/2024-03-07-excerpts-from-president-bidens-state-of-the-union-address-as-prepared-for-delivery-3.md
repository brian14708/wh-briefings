In its decision to overturn *Roe v. Wade* the Supreme Court majority
wrote “Women are not without electoral or political power.” No kidding.
Clearly those bragging about overturning *Roe v. Wade* have no clue
about the power of women in America. But they found out when
reproductive freedom was on the ballot and won in 2022, 2023, and they
will find out again in 2024. If Americans send me a Congress that
supports the right to choose I promise you: I will restore *Roe v. Wade*
as the law of the land again.

I came to office determined to get us through one of the toughest
periods in our nation’s history. And we have. It doesn’t make the news,
but in thousands of cities and towns the American people are writing the
greatest comeback story never told. So let’s tell that story here and
now. America’s comeback is building a future of American possibilities,
building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up – not the top
down, investing in all of America – in all Americans – to make sure
everyone has a fair shot and we leave no one behind.

My lifetime has taught me to embrace freedom and democracy. A future
based on the core values that have defined America: honesty, decency,
dignity, equality. To respect everyone. To give everyone a fair shot. To
give hate no safe harbor. Now some other people my age see a different
story: an American story of resentment, revenge, and retribution. That’s
not me.
