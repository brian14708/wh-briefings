The White House

Thank you, Susan. In your words and in your career, it’s clear how much
of your mom’s humor, strength, and love for this country lives on in
you.  
   
And I’m also grateful to have many other members of the Ford family with
us today.  
   
I know we have several of First Lady Ford’s friends here as well. Thank
you all so much for joining.  
   
Postmaster General DeJoy ─ the stamp is beautiful and spectacular.  
   
Dr. Lee and the rest of the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation, I’m grateful
that you’re helping carry on Betty’s work.  
   
I’m excited to welcome all of you to the White House for this special
moment.  
   
There is no roadmap for becoming a First Lady, let alone becoming one
overnight. But as she did with everything in her life, Betty Ford threw
herself into the new role.  
   
“If we have to go to the White House, OK, I will go,” Mrs. Ford told her
husband. “But I’m going as myself…And if they don’t like it, they’ll
just have to throw me out.”  
   
It turned out that Betty as herself, with her trademark candor, wit, and
lack of pretense, was exactly what the country needed. A warm, charming
First Lady who would help restore a weary nation’s faith in
government.  
   
Betty’s time in the White House may have been brief, but her mark was
lasting.  
   
She was unafraid to speak her mind. She supported legalized abortion and
was a vocal advocate for the Equal Rights Amendment.  
   
When her husband’s senior advisors complained about Betty placing calls
from the White House to lobby for the ERA, she installed her own
personal phone line.  
   
And in a remarkable display of courage and vulnerability, she went
public about her breast cancer and mastectomy, at a time when such
things were only whispered about.  
   
As she lay in a hospital bed in Bethesda, she watched news programs
beaming footage of women lining up at hospitals to get their screenings,
too.  
   
She didn’t think what she did was revolutionary. She was simply being
Betty – forthright, honest, and relatable. Countless women would owe
their lives to following her example.  
   
After Mrs. Ford left the White House, she bared her soul once more,
revealing her battle with addiction. Just as she had done so many times
before, she brought light into a place of darkness. Sharing her own
demons, she gave countless others the strength to confront their own.  
   
“You have to give it away to keep it.”  That mantra would become one of
the guiding lights behind the creation of the Betty Ford Center.  
   
Mrs. Ford’s extraordinary story is a lesson in the beautiful and
sometimes cruel unpredictability of life, and our capacity for
redemption.  
   
Her journey reminds us that we are not defined by our worst moments, but
rather by our ability to turn life’s inevitable pain and struggle into
purpose and salvation.  
   
Heroism is not perfection. It’s resilience.  
   
Ultimately, Betty gave us hope.  
   
Hope that tomorrow is a brighter day. Hope that this too will pass. Hope
that even in the depths of despair, the human will is limitless.  
   
As many at the Betty Ford Center would say: if Betty can do it, I can do
it.  
   
Mrs. Ford once wrote that to be remembered with joy is a kind of
immortality. I’m sure if she were with us today, she would offer a witty
quip about being immortalized with her own forever stamp.  
   
Susan, it’s an honor to celebrate your mom today. She inspired a nation,
and captured our hearts for an eternity.  
   
Thank you.
