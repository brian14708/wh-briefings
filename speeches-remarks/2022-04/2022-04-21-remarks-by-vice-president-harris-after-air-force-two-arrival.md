title: "Remarks by Vice President Harris After Air Force Two\_Arrival"

*San Francisco International Airport  
*San Francisco, California**

Q    Two questions for you, to start.

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible).  (Laughs.)

Q    Okay, two questions for you.  First, do you have any reaction to
the latest sanctions from Russia that would bar your entry into the
country?

And then, second, on Title 42, would you be in favor of delaying the
ending of it, especially as a few members of your own party have kind of
pushed back?  Is that something that’s under consideration?

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  So, let’s be very clear about where we stand in
terms of Russia: As far as I’m concerned — and I think, objectively,
many people will agree — that their invasion of Ukraine has not only
been steeped in atrocities but will proof to be a strategic failure for
Russia.

What we have done most recently, and the President did a speech this
morning talking about what we will continue to do as a — one of our
highest commitments to continue to support the Ukrainian people,
President Zelenskyy with what we can in terms of economic assistance,
humanitarian assistance.  But also, with equal fervor, we are absolutely
committed to continuing with the serious consequences and costs to
Russia of its act of aggression and, as the President has rightly said,
with its criminal conduct.

And so that has included what we will continue to do to issue sanctions,
as we just announced, but all with an understanding that one of our
highest priorities is sovereignty and territorial integrity as a — is
solid principle that binds and unifies the NATO Alliance, to your point
about NATO. 

And so we’re going to continue to do that work, and we’re not going to
give up.

Thank you.                           END
