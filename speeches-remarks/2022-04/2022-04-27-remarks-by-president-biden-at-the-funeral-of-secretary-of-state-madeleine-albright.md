THE PRESIDENT:  Freedom endures against all odds in the face of every
aggressor because there are always those who will fight for that
freedom.  
   
And in the 20th and 21st century, freedom had no greater champion than
Madeleine Korbel Albright.  
   
Anne, Alice, Katie — your mom was a force — a force of nature.  With her
goodness and grace, her humanity, and her intellect, she turned the tide
of history.  
   
David, Daniel, Jack, Jake, Ben, and Ellie — you’re too young to remember
this, but when the Iron Curtain fell and the Berlin Wall came down, our
world faced one of those inflection points — a once-in-a-generation
moment of upheaval but opportunity as well.  
   
People and nations around the world were deciding the future they wanted
to make for themselves.  And your grandmother — your grandmother — as
Madam Ambassador and as the first female Secretary of State in American
history, made sure those nations and those people knew exactly where the
United States of America stood — and what we stood for.  
   
You know, and all through it, her beloved sister Kathy and her brother
John can attest, she never forgot where she came from or who she was.  
   
President Obama, President and Secretary Clinton, Vice President Al
Gore, members of Congress, Cabinet members past and present: Today, we
honor a truly proud American who made all of us prouder to be
Americans.  
   
I also want to welcome the distinguished guests and dignitaries who have
traveled from around the world to celebrate a daughter of the Czech
Republic who knew — who knew what it meant to endure war and flee
persecution.  
   
With her friend Vaclav Havel — when he died, I remember, when Madeleine
eulogized him, she used these words, and I quote, “He cast light into
places of deepest darkness and reminded us constantly of our obligations
to one another.”  
      
These words — these words apply equally to Madeleine.  
   
When I got word that Madeleine had passed, I was in mid-air on my way to
Europe to meet with our NATO Allies in Brussels to help try to continue
to keep the — the strong, strong alliances together — our organization
and international response to Russia’s brutal and unjustifiable war
against Ukraine.  
   
And it was not lost on me that Madeleine was a big part of the reason
NATO was still strong and galvanized, as it is today.  
   
And a few days later, I traveled to Poland and spoke about all that is
at stake in our world and for democracy and freedom — which is under
assault from forces of autocracy and oppression.

Many are tired of hearing me say I think we’re at another inflection
point in world history, where there is literally a severe contra- —
confrontation between autocrats and democratic nations.  
   
President Clinton — Bill, it was not lost on me that you spoke at the
same Warsaw Castle that I was about to speak at 25 years earlier.  
   
In my case, it was evening.  The interior of the castle — a beautiful
courtyard — holds about 5-, 600 people.  And mostly Poles and Ukrainians
were present when I spoke.  And I’m sure many in the audience spoke
English, though likely not their first language.  
   
But when I mentioned the name — they were respectful of what I was
saying — but when I mentioned the name of Madeleine Albright, there was
a deafening cheer.  They all stopped everything and started to cheer. 
It was spontaneous.  It was real.  For her name is still synonymous with
America as a force for good in the world.  
   
Madeleine never minced words or wasted time when she saw something that
needed fixing or someone who needed helping.  She just got to work.  
   
And as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from the time
I was a kid — God, they were the good old days.  (Laughter.)  I — I was
the chairman or the ranking member for a good part of that time.  And in
the ‘90s, I can attest that Madeleine, with the significant help of the
President of the United States, kept the committee really busy.   
   
In our work to halt genocide in the Balkans, support new democracies in
Eastern and Central Europe, to develop Plan Colombia — in all of those
undertakings, Madeleine was an incomparable ally and advisor beyond the
President to me and to others on the committee.   
   
She always had a knack for explaining to the American people why it
mattered to them that people everywhere in the world were struggling to
breathe free.   
   
And Madeleine didn’t stop when she left government.  For decades, she
was a nexus of the foreign policy community, always — and I mean always
— on top of the latest developments, always speaking out for democracy,
and always the first to sound the alarm about fascism.  
   
Presidents and leaders around the world continued to solicit her advice,
including me.  When I asked her last year to chair the Defense Policy
Board, she built businesses.  She pumped out New York Times bestsellers
that were both highly prescient and deeply salient — and constantly
bestsellers.  I think I’ve read them all.  
   
You know, and she — and she mentored generations of rising foreign
policy experts — the, quote, “foreign policy establishment.”  
   
You know — and the thing that I noted that was deliberate and remarkable
about her — not unlike Secretary Clinton — was that she made sure that
young women knew they belonged at every single table having to do with
national security, without exception.  
   
Today, across our government and around the world, Madeleine’s protégés
are legion.  Many are here today, each carrying within them a spark lit
by her passion and her brilliance.  
   
I think part of the reason why Madeleine was such a successful diplomat
was that she understood something I’ve always believed.  And my boss,
President Obama, when I was Vice President, used to kid me because I’d
repeat so often, because I believed she understood something I’ve always
believed: that all politics, especially international politics, is
personal.  It all, ultimately, is personal.  
   
She could go toe to toe with the toughest dictators, then turn around
and literally teach a fellow ambassador how to do the macarena on the
floor of the U.N. Security Council.  (Laughter.)  You all think I’m
kidding.  I’m not kidding.

She thought it was too difficult to teach me how to dance, though. 
(Laughter.)  She was right.  
   
No matter where she was, she understood people.  She cared about
people.  And all of that was grounded in an education gained by watching
her father, Josef Korbel — and her mentor as well.   
   
She learned diplomacy at the dinner table.  And throughout her life,
nothing mattered to Madeleine more than the family — nothing.  
   
Madeleine had the same rule that I do and others here do: No matter
what’s happening in my day — as President Obama can tell you — or who
I’m meeting with, if one of my children calls, I take the call.  She was
the same way.  
   
Anne, Alice, Katie, and her grandchildren — each of you — each of you is
literally a tribute to her enormous — to her enormous capacity to
love.  
   
I know it’s hard, but I promise you: She’s always with you — in your
mind, in your heart, and part of your soul.  And I promise you: You’re
going to have a tough decision, and you’re going to be asking yourself,
“What would she want me to do?”  Not a joke.  Remember I said it. 
That’s going to happen.   
   
And, Kathy and John, the connection the three of you maintained through
your lives was always an anchor to Madeleine  
through all the ups and downs of life.  What a gift.  What a gift.  What
a family.  
   
You know, from that first trans-Atlantic crossing on the SS America, to
landing in nations around the world in that big blue-and-white plane
emblazoned with the words “United States of America,” Madeleine
understood her story was America’s story.  Her story was America’s
story.   
   
She loved to speak about America as the “indispensable nation.”  To her,
the phrase was never a statement of arrogance.  It was about gratitude
for all this country made possible for her.  It was a testament to her
belief in the endless possibilities that only America could help unlock
around the world and to her understanding of what American power could
achieve when it was united with and motivated by enduring American
values.  
   
That’s why there was nothing she loved more than swearing in new
citizens to this great nation of ours.  She’d light up, reminding them
that she had once stood where they stood.  
   
Having gained the blessings of liberty, she wanted nothing more than to
share them around the globe.  
   
To Madeleine, from my prospective, there was no higher mission, no
greater honor than to serve this great experiment in freedom known as
the United States of America.  
   
May her memory continue to be a blessing to our nation, and may we
remember her words and her deeds.   
   
May she always be a light to all those in the darkest places — a
reminder of our obligation to one another.  
   
May God bless Madeleine Albright.
