State Dining Room

10:56 A.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  Today, we learned that in March, our
economy created 431,000 jobs.  Nice sound to it.  And we also learned
that in January and February, our economy created 100,000 more jobs than
had — we previously had thought.  That means that over the last three
months, the economy has created more than a half million — more than
500,000 jobs a month.  
   
Over the course of my presidency, our recovery has now created 7.9
million jobs — more jobs created over the first 14 months of any
presidency in any term ever.  And that’s striking.   
   
But what’s even more striking is this: In March, the unemployment rate
fell to 3.6 percent, down from 6.4 percent when I took office about 15
months ago — the fastest decline in unemployment to start a President’s
term ever recorded.    
   
In fact, there have been only three months in the last 50 years where
the unemployment rate in America is lower than it is now.   
   
And that me- — what it means is clear, is very clear: Americans are back
to work.  And that’s good news for millions of families who have a
little more breathing room and the dignity that comes from earning a
paycheck — just the dignity of having a job.  
   
And more and more Americans get jobs — as they do, it’s going to help to
ease the supply pressures we’ve seen.  And that’s good news for fighting
inflation, it’s good news for our economy, and it means that our economy
has gone from being on the mend to being on the move.  
   
You know, the American people, I think they — they’re beginning to
understand that the American Rescue Plan — and there’s no reason why
they should know the names of all these pieces of legislation that got
passed — but the American Rescue Plan, with it, we were able to get
Americans vaccinated, schools open, and businesses humming.   
   
A leading financial firm, Moody’s, estimated that because of the Rescue
Plan, 4 million more American jobs were created and unemployment is 2
percent lower than it would have been had we failed to move that
legislation.    
   
Thanks to our infrastructure law, we have more than 4,000 projects
getting started this year — 4,000 — in every single state in America — a
total of 4,000 in all 50 states, rebuilding America.   
   
We’re building a recovery worth of — worthy of American workers: strong
and resilient.  And it’s going to be able to overcome the headwinds —
and it has — of Delta, Omicron, and even war in Europe.  
   
Our policies are working.  And we’re getting results for the American
people — which is what it’s all about, to state the obvious.  
   
Record job creation.  Record unemployment declines.  Record wage gains. 
And, by the way, jobs and unemployment are not just another statistic. 
They go directly to the core of what the economy represents: the ability
for hardworking Americans to live with dignity, support their families,
and build a better life for their children.   
   
People are making more money.  They’re finding better jobs.  And after
decades of being mistreated and paid too little, more and more American
workers have real power now to do — get better wages and to do what’s
best for themselves and their families.    
   
Some people see that as a problem; we’ve had this discussion in the
past.  I don’t.  I see it as long overdue.   
   
So when you hear these numbers, they’re not statistics; it’s a statement
of the type of economy we’re fighting for — an economy, as I’ve been
saying from the beginning, built from the bottom up and the middle out —
not from the top down.  When we do it that way, everybody does well,
everybody wins.   
   
Even though we’ve created a record number of jobs, we know — I know —
that this job is not finished.  We need to do more to get prices under
control.   
   
Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has driven up gas prices and food prices all
over the world.  To help deal with that, yesterday I authorized the
release of 1 million barrels per day for the next six months from our
Strategic Petroleum Reserve.     
   
I acknowledge this, by far, is the largest release from our national
reserves in our history.  It is a wartime bridge — is the way I look at
it — to increase our oil supply as we work with our oil — U.S oil
producers to ramp up their production to get us through this period.   
   
I’ve coordinated this release with partners and allies around the
world.  This morning, over 30 countries from across the world convened
an extraordinary meeting and agreed to the release of tens of millions
of additional barrels of oil onto the market.    
   
Hundreds of hours of meetings with key allies, keeping them together, is
paying off.  Nations are coming together to deny Putin the ability to
weaponize his energy resources against American families — not only
American families, but families in Europe and around the world.  
   
I’ve also made it a priority to get America’s fiscal house in order. 
Under my predecessor, the federal budget deficit went up every single
year — every year.  As I committed when I was running and I got here,
we’re going to turn that around.  
   
In fact, last year, in 2021, we cut the federal deficit by more than
$350 billion.  And this year, in 2022, we’re on track to cut the deficit
by more than $1.3 trillion — $1.3 trillion.  That would be the largest
one-year reduction in the deficit in U.S. history.  And it’s
particularly important now as we work to reduce pressures on inflation. 
That’s what happens when you reduce the deficit.   
   
So here are the facts: It was the previous administration whose reckless
policies and mismanagement led to the record budget deficits.  In my
administration, that’s getting the deficit under control.   
   
In fact, I just released my budget this week, and it shows, going
forward, we can cut the deficit by another $1 trillion over the next
decade while still making prudent investments in economic growth, in
climate, and other equitable economic decisions.    
   
But to do that, we have to be willing to do something previous
administrations and Republicans today refuse to do.  We need to make
sure corporations and the super wealthy begin to pay their fair
share.   
   
Here’s one example: Right now, billionaires — and there’s not a whole
lot of them in the country; maybe I won’t give a number because I don’t
know for sure.  They — they average less than 1 percent.  But my point
is billionaires pay an average rate of only 8 percent on their total
income.  
   
A family led by a firefighter and a teacher can pay double that income
tax rate — double what a — what a billionaire pays; double the 8
percent.   
   
So my budget has a Billionaire Minimum Tax — a 20 percent minimum tax
that applies only to the top one — one-hundredth of one — one-hundredth
of 1 percent of American households.   
   
The Billionaire Minimum Tax is fair.  And here’s the deal: It raises
$360 billion that can be used to lower costs for families and cut the
deficit.  It would add — it would — and I would add, nobody making less
than four — and you’re tired of hearing me say it, but no one making
less than $400,000 a year will pay a single penny more in federal
taxes.  
   
As I’ve said in the past, I’m a capitalist.  I have no problem with
people making as much money as they are capable of making.  But I’m
asking you one simple question: Just pay your fair share.  Pay your fair
share.  That’s all.  That’s it.  Just your fair share.    
   
And no one can argue that 20 percent for a billionaire is unfair.    
   
Here’s what this adds up to: We’re going to continue to create jobs,
bring down the cost for families, and rein in deficits left by my
predecessor — all important steps in our pro- — to continue our historic
progress to build a better America.    
   
I said from the outset we’re the only country in the world that’s comes
out of crises stronger than we went into them.  That’s what we’re doing
here.   
   
I want to thank you all for showing up today.  And we’ll have plenty of
time to answer questions about other items other than the — the jobs
report next week.  Thank you.  Appreciate it.
