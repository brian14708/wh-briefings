THE VICE PRESIDENT: But I’m so looking forward to our conversations. But
you all just have to know, we applaud and thank you. We are so grateful
for what you all do. And you know, we were just talking about it — it
takes a lot to do the work that that you all do, and it can be quite
painful because you see so much pain and you care so deeply.  
  
And in spite of all of that, you all are about empowerment, about
recognizing — not giving but recognizing the dignity and fighting for
the rights.  
  
And it’s extraordinary the gift that you have and that you give. And so,
I wanted to come here today — and with the Administrator — so we could
talk with you, we can visit with you so we can talk about you as we
travel around the country.  
  
Because, you know, we were talking earlier about it. When we’re fighting
for the ability of women and their families and their community to
receive all that they are entitled to receive, it’s important that we
also let them know that they are not alone. And that’s part of telling
the stories.  
  
It is also about letting them know and see what the solution looks like
so that they don’t have to ever have an experience of wondering whether
it is even possible that they would be treated with dignity and receive
what is necessary for them to have a joyful and healthy experience and
be seen in the full totality of who they are.  
  
So, by being here today and lifting up and sharing what you all are
doing here, we’re going to be talking with women you all will never
meet, will probably never even know your names or mine, but who will
benefit from what you all are doing here on the ground. So, I just want
to thank you all so very much.  
  
And with that, why don’t we begin our conversation.  
  
END
