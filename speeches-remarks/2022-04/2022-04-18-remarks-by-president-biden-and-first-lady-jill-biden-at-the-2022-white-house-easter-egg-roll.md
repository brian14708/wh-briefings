THE FIRST LADY:  Good morning, and welcome to the Easter Egg Roll! 
(Applause.)  The President and I are so excited that you are here.   
   
As your First Lady and as a teacher, I’ve seen again and again that
learning doesn’t only happen in a classroom.  There are so many fun
opportunities to learn around us every day.  And that’s especially true
here at the White House.   
   
For generations, Presidents and First Ladies and kids, just like you,
celebrated the Easter Egg Roll together — racing and making crafts,
reading books, and, of course, meeting the Easter Bunny.  (Applause.)   
   
Education never stops.  The determined spirit of education is what we
wanted to honor in this Easter Egg Roll.  So, we turned the South Lawn
into a school community.  
   
Today, we hope you learn that re- — we help you learn by going to the
reading nook, roll some eggs, and, most of all, have fun.  
   
Welcome to your house, the People’s House.  Happy Easter!  
   
Now, please welcome my husband, our President, Joe Biden. 
(Applause.)   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  My job is to keep it from raining — (laughter) — for
another two minutes.   
   
Jill and I are excited to have you at the White House.  The — we weren’t
able to host this Easter Egg Roll last year because of the pandemic. 
But this year — this year, we’re finally getting together again, and
it’s so special.  It means — it means so much to see and hear the
children and all the families show up to be here today.  
   
The joy, the laughter, and the occasional — at least with my young
grandson, who’s only two — the occasional, “There’s the Easter Bunny.” 
(Laughs.)  A little startled sometimes.   
   
But the joy and the laughter is something that has been a wonderful
tradition here at the White House for a long, long time.  
   
I especially want to thank the White House Associat- — Historical
Association, the National Park Service, and America’s Egg Board for all
their hard work to make this day possible.  Let’s give them a round of
applause.  (Applause.)   
   
To all of you, have fun today and welcome to the White House.  Welcome
to your house.  Welcome to the South Lawn.  
   
Thank you and happy, happy Easter.  (Applause.)  All right.
