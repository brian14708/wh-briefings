*Private Residence  
Los Angeles, California*

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, the first Second Gentleman of the United
States.  I do want to say a couple of things about my husband.

   
If any of you have been following the work that he has been doing — last
year alone, he traveled, I think, over 35 trips on behalf of the
administration, going around the country, talking about a variety of
issues that have been priority areas for the administration.    
   
But one of the things that Doug, as most of you know him, has been doing
is really lifting up the voice of what it means to be a partner to
someone, regardless of gender, but in this case, as the first Second
Gentleman of the United States.  And he’s been doing it in a way that is
really very, I think, important and special.  
   
There are so many young men and women who have been watching how he does
it, as a model of how we can think about relationships and
partnerships.   
   
And so I hadn’t planned on saying all of this, but I just want to thank
you for your service to our country and what you are doing on behalf of
the administration.  (Applause.)  
   
THE SECOND GENTLEMEN:  (Inaudible.)  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  Yeah, I know.  
   
Well, it’s good to be home.  Dana and Matt, thank you, guys.  Many of
you may know there’s a — first of all, Dana and I have been friends for
decades.  And that’s all I will say.  (Laughs.)   
   
But there’s a connection here in terms of the order of the speaking
because, you see — and many of you may know this — Dana and Matt
introduced on a blind date Chrisette Hudlin and Reggie Hudlin, who then
introduced on a blind date me and Doug.  (Laughs.)    
   
So, in many ways, Dana and Matt are responsible for my marriage. 
(Laughs.)  But have always been extraordinary friends.  
   
And so thank you, guys, for bringing us back together in your home once
again.  
   
And to Chrisette and Laura and all of the folks who have been so
dedicated in your support of me and of the Democratic Party, I want to
thank you.   
   
There are friends that I see here that have been supporting me since I
first ran for DA and through the years, and you have to know that that
really means a lot.  
   
So I want to thank you all for also what you are doing to support the
DNC, because the work that you have done and the generosity you have
shown really matters a great deal and is going to mean so much as we
continue to talk with our country about the issues we care about.    
   
With many of you, I had a chance to chat far too briefly, but one of the
things I found myself saying a lot recently is: It’s important to know
what you stand for.  Because when you know what you stand for, then you
know what you’re prepared to fight for.    
   
And as we all know, there’s so much that we stand for that never has
been nor will it ever be easy to achieve.  In fact, I dare say, as a
daughter of parents who met when they were active in the Civil Rights
Movement, there has never been any substantial or significant progress
that our country has made that did not involve a fight, did not involve
hard work, did not involve extraordinary forces that seemed to be
working against that progress.  
   
So that’s the context in which we have, frankly, always found ourselves
and in which we find ourselves again.   
 

But as we all also know, everything we have fought to achieve has been
fueled by our collective sense of optimism around what is possible, what
can be, as I also like to say, unburdened by what has been.  
   
And so, what do we stand for?  Well, as Democrats, we stand for many
things.  We stand for our belief in those words that each of us is
equal, regardless of gender, race, background, religion.  We stand for
the principle that, given that we are all equal, we should be treated
that way.  So, so much of our policies are fueled with that perspective,
including being guided by not only the importance of equality, but of
equity.  
   
So, you look at the policies that we have been fighting for as an
administration; equity has been one of the guiding principles.  Equity,
it’s basically — it’s a real simple concept.  It takes into account not
everyone starts out on the same base.    
   
So if we are to end up equal, we might have to look at the distribution
of resources to figure out who needs what to be able to be treated and
actually have equal opportunity.  
   
So we have focused on things like pay equity.  As many of you know, we
still have a lot of work to do in that regard, especially when it comes
to equity based on gender  
and race; and when you couple gender and race, even more so.   
  
So that has been the work of our administration: focusing on what we
must do — for example, during the course of the pandemic, it was
highlighted — the specific needs of women in the workforce. 
Understanding that if it wasn’t clear before, we are now quite clear, as
a nation, that women have, as a general matter, extraordinary burdens
and responsibilities that when unmet mean they may have to leave the
workforce.  
  
So we focus, and it is a priority of ours and it will continue to be, to
say, “Hey, childcare shouldn’t be so darn expensive, to the point that
workers have to remove themselves from the workforce because it costs
more for childcare than they would earn to go to work every day.”    
  
So what do we stand for?  We stand for pay equity.  And we stand for the
proposition that working parents should not have to pay more than 7
percent of their income in childcare.  That’s what we stand for.  That’s
what we fight for: equality and equity.  
  
We stand for equality when we say our transgender community and
transgender youth should not be the subject of the kind of rhetoric
fueled by hate that we are seeing around the country, and that we will
address this issue in a number of ways, including having our State
Department indicate that those who choose may fill out the box that says
“gender” with an X.  
  
What do we stand for?  We stand for a healthcare system that is informed
with the understanding that access to affordable healthcare should be a
right, that access to healthcare should not just be a privilege of those
who can afford it.    
So we continue to do the work of expanding the Affordable Care Act.  We
do the work of standing for the proposition that prescription drugs
should not be so expensive, because we have a significant population of
people in our country, for example, that have diabetes, who in many
cases have to spend hundreds of dollars a month for the thing that will
save their life, called “insulin.”    
  
We stand for the proposition no one should have to pay more than $35 a
month for insulin.  Because we believe that this is a matter that is not
only about a right, it is also about dignity.    
  
We stand for the proposition that people in the healthcare system who
have endured, who have suffered acute illness and have therefore
collected stacks of medical bills to the point that they are in medical
debt; to the point statistically, by the way, that that debt is greater
than — the medical debt that Americans are covering right now, that
they’re burdened with, is greater than car loan debt and credit card
debt combined.  
  
We stand for the proposition that we need to — through our, for example,
our VA — get rid of that debt, figure out ways to wipe that out, figure
out ways to help people.  Because it just makes sense to think about the
fact that if you’ve acquired that much debt through medical bills —
well, why do you acquire medical bills?  Because you need healthcare. 
You need something to help extend your life or alleviate your pain.    
  
 And then we have this whole population of people with this debt who are
also still attempting to recover from a serious health issue and are
burdened by the fact that they may go bankrupt or become homeless.    
  
These are the things we stand for that are an extension of what we
believe is about fighting for the dignity of all people.    
  
We stand for an economy that works for all people.  We saw, during the
course of the pandemic, so many small businesses that went out of
business.  
  
Well, we know that half of America’s workforce works for a small
business or — or owns a small business.  We know that in many
communities, including our Black and brown communities, Asian
communities, that these small businesses are part of the economic fabric
and lifeblood of those communities, that those business leaders are not
only leaders in business, they’re civic leaders.  They’re community
leaders.  They’re role models.  They hire locally.  
  
So we stood for what we did in the American Rescue Plan to ensure that
the PPP loans would get out to folks.  
  
We stand for what we have been doing to expand the investment in
community banks to make sure that those small- business owners that
include minority- and women-owned businesses have access to capital so
that they can grow and contribute to the economic wellbeing and
lifeblood of their communities.  
  
We stand for women’s rights when it comes to what should be a
non-negotiable understanding and right that all women should have to
make decisions about their own body, including their reproductive health
and choice.  
  
These are the things that we stand for.  And so we are prepared to fight
for these things.  
  
And it is a difficult moment — many of us have discussed this — where
we’ve come out of two years of a — of a pandemic.  We’ve come out of —
we’ve come out of more co- — more crises than we’ve seen in generations,
in terms of the health issue, in terms of what we have seen in terms of
the economy; we’re now looking at a war in Europe.  
  
And so it is time for us then, as Democrats, to remind people of what we
stand for, what we are prepared to fight for, and to also remind people
of the optimism that we bring to everything that we stand for and
everything we know is achievable.  It means reminding people, as the
Democratic Party, of what we have achieved and accomplished.   
  
On the issue of foreign policy, remember, one of the things that we
stand for is saying that we value relationships that we have around the
world — that those relationships will be informed by trust, by an
acknowledgement of history, shared principles, and values.   
  
Which is why in spite of the fact that, not very long ago, people
thought NATO was obsolete — through the leadership of Joe Biden and our
administration, and the hundreds of hours of phone calls he and I and
the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense and so many others
have done, meetings that we have had with leaders around the world, so
much so — so effective we’ve been that when I meet with them — I’ve been
to Europe three times in the last four months — one of the first things
those leaders will say when we sit down to talk, “Thank you to your
administration for what you have done to bring the Alliance together and
strengthen it in the midst of some of the worst aggression we have seen
in generations.”    
  
We have looked at, yes, an economy that, through no fault of most of the
people who have suffered, took a deep dive during the course of the
pandemic.  But yet — people thought recovery would take years and years
— we created 7 million new jobs just last year.  
  
Now, yeah, it costs more money at the pump and we need to deal with
that, we need to acknowledge that.  But we also need to keep with our
program around making it easier to get by day to day, which means —
again, going back to the childcare issue — which means bringing down the
cost of living, which means looking at what we can do and should do in
terms of an investment in affordable housing, what we should do in terms
of bringing down the cost of prescription drugs.  This is the work that
we are doing.   
  
So, we are months away from an election, and it is going to be incumbent
on all of us as leaders to remind people of what we stand for and what
we have accomplished.  And, you know, during an election, I think that
we should all be prepared for the question we’ve heard every time: “Why
should I vote?”   
  
Well, let’s just look at the fact that in 2020, we had a historic
turnout — more people voted than ever before.  And I like to say to
people, “You know, basically, when you stood in that line for hours,
when you put them kids in the backseat and drove around to find the drop
box, when you took the time away from all of the other demands of your
life, you basically put in an order.  You put in an order.  You said, ‘I
want certain things to happen.  I want an extension of the Child Tax
Credit,’” which you got, which has meant that, at least in the first
year, we reduce child poverty by almost 50 percent.   
  
You said you wanted the first Black woman to serve in the history of the
United States Supreme Court on that Court.  You got it.  You want an
administration that’s going to bring back the world community; you got
that.  You want the creation of jobs.  You want a vaccine that’s going
to be distributed to all people.  You want the schools to be reopened. 
Check, check, check.   
  
So, when you voted, when you made the effort, when you did the e-mailing
and the calling and the texting and the knocking on doors, it mattered. 
Elections matter.  
  
And so, as we go toward this next election, let’s remind people that it
matters and that we are so well aware of the work that we still have yet
to do.  We did good work in the Infrastructure Bill, on climate, but
there’s still so much more to do.   
  
We did good work in terms of saying that there should be paid family
leave, but we still got more work to do.  More work to do to bring down
the cost of home healthcare for seniors, and we’re on the path to
getting that done.    
  
Some of this stuff takes time, but we are seeing progress in a way that
is giving a lot of people a sense of optimism.   
  
Because I’ll tell you — and I’m going to close my comments — one of the
benefits that I do believe has resulted from what we have achieved so
far is it has empowered a whole lot of people to know that they have a
right to demand certain things of their government, that they have a
right to expect that we will do certain things, and that we will
actually do those things.  But there is more work to be done.   
  
So let us move forward, understanding that it ain’t going to be easy; it
never has been.   
  
You know, I was saying to somebody — there’s an old adage, “You either
run without an opponent or you run scared,” when you’re running an
election.  Right?  So you know what that means.    
  
But you run, and we run, meaning going toward this election with a sense
of great optimism, fueled by what we have achieved thus far, and knowing
we still have more to get done.  And we don’t have any time to slow
down.  We don’t have any time to doubt ourselves.  We got to get to
work.   
  
So, thank you all very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)
