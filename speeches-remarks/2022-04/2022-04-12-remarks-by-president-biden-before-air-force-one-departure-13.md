Q    Mr. President, what made you use the word “genocide” today?  
   
Q    Mr. President, have you seen enough evidence to declare genocide in
Ukraine, sir?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, I called it genocide.  It has become clearer and
clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of even being —
being able to be Ukrainian.   
   
And the amount — the evidence is mounting.  It’s different than it was
last week.  The — more evidence is coming out of the — literally, the
horrible things that the Russians have done in Ukraine.  And we’re going
to only learn more and more about the devastation.  
   
And we’ll let the lawyers decide internationally whether or not it
qualifies, but it sure seems that way to me.   
   
Thank you.
