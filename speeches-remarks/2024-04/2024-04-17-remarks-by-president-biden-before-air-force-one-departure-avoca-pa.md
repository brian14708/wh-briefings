Wilkes-Barre Scranton International Airport  
Avoca, Pennsylvania

12:05 P.M. EDT  
  
Q    Mr. President, will you talk about the war memorial you were just
at very briefly?  What did you see?  What did you hear?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  I wanted to see where my uncle, Ambrose J. Finnegan, was
memorialized.  And there was a World War Two memorial built for those
who lost their lives in World War Two. 

And when D-Day occurred, the next day, on Monday, all four of my
mother’s brothers went down and volunteered to join the military.  And
four of them — three of them made it.  One was 4-F — couldn’t go.  
  
And Ambrose Finnegan — we called him “Uncle Bosie” — he — he was shot
down.  He was Army Air Corps before there was an Air Force.  He flew
single-engine planes, reconnaissance flights over New Guinea.  He had
volunteered because someone couldn’t make it.  He got shot down in an
area where there were a lot of cannibals in New Guinea at the time.   
  
They never recovered his body.  But the government went back, when I
went down there, and they checked and found some parts of the plane and
the like.  
  
And what I was thinking about when I was standing there was when Trump
refused to go up to the memorial for veterans in Paris, and he said they
were a bunch of “suckers” and “losers.”  
  
To me, that is such a disqualifying assertion made by a president —
“suckers” and “losers.”  The guys who saved civilization in the 1940s —
“suckers” and “losers.”   
  
And I just wanted to go and — we have a tradition in our family that my
grandfather started.  When you visit a gravesite of a family member —
it’s going to sound strange to you, but — you say three Hail Marys.  And
that’s what I was doing at the site.  
  
My — my gran- — my uncle, Ambrose Finnegan — Uncle — Uncle Bosie was a
hell of a guy from what I — I never met him, obviously.

  
And — but I just wanted to see where he was memorialized.  
  
Q    And, Mr. President, what do you think about these separate bills
for Ukraine and Israel aid?  Are you confident that it’s going to get
through?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m getting briefed on it when I get on the plane. 
That’s why I was talking to my staff.  I’ll tell you then.  
  
Thank you.
