THE FIRST LADY:  Welcome to the White House Easter Egg Roll.  Happy
Easter, everybody.  (Applause.)

I’m a teacher, so I love any time when we can turn the White House into
a classroom.  And that’s what we’re doing today.

The South Lawn is transforming into our learning playground and school
community.  And there’s so much to discover. Listen to a story in the
reading nook, explore space, make circuit breakers, write notes to our
troops, take a field trip to a farm, hunt for dinosaur fossils, and so
much more.

Education expands our horizons and transports us to new worlds.  Just
like these balloons, it allows all students to soar and reach
unimaginable heights.

I hope that you all learn something new today.  But most importantly, I
hope you all have fun.

And now it is my honor to please welcome my husband, the President of
the United States, Joe Biden.  (Applause.)

THE PRESIDENT:  Happy Easter!

Well, we did everything, but we couldn’t control the weather.  Although,
Al Roker told me this morning it was going to get sunny.

Folks, welcome to what’s expected to be the biggest White House Easter
Egg Roll ever.  (Applause.)

I want to thank the National Park Service, the White House Historical
Association, the American — especially the American Egg Board, and our
nation’s egg farmers.  For the egg board — they’ve done a great job. 
(Applause.)  And thank you for making this special tradition possible.

You know, it began in 1878 because they wanted to have an Easter egg
roll on the park grounds, but they weren’t allowed to do it.  So, the
President then said, “Let’s have it on the White House lawn.”  They
couldn’t stop that.  It’s been going on since then.

Easter reminds us of the power of hope and renewal, sacrifice and
resurrection, but mainly love and grace toward one another.

It’s a time to pray for one another, to cherish the blessings and the
possibilities that we have as Americans.

That’s what I see in our country.  We are a great nation because we’re a
good people.  Our values are solid.  And the rest of the world looks to
us, and we’re determined to keep up that banner.

And because of you, the American people — and I mean this sincerely —
I’ve never been more optimistic about America than I am today.  We have
enormous opportunities — enormous opportunities.

We just have to remember who we are.  We’re the United States of
America, and there’s nothing — (applause) — nothing beyond our capacity.

May God bless you all.  Enjoy the day.  And I’m coming down to do that
Easter egg roll in just a minute.

Thank you all so very, very much.  (Applause.)  Thanks, everybody. 

And, by the way, say hello to our Easter bunnies.  Come on up, bunnies. 
Get up here so they can see you.  Come on, get in there.  Pretty big
bunny, huh?

All right.  Thank you all so very, very much.  It’s all yours: the
President’s home.
