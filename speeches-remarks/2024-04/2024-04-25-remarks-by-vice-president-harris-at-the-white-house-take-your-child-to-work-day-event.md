3:52 P.M. EDT

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Hello.  That’s me.  (Laughs.)

Good afternoon, everyone.  Good afternoon, and welcome to the White
House.  (Applause.)

I want to thank Elliot for that introduction.  I just love seeing all of
our young leaders here today.  And on behalf of our President, Joe
Biden, and all of us at the White House, a warm, warm welcome to you.

And to all of the young leaders who are here today, part of why I wanted
to come out and see you is to thank you for letting your parents and
your godparents and your aunts and uncles and big sisters and brothers
and your family members — thank you for letting them work here.  You
guys, by giving them permission to work here, you are helping children
around our country and around the world.

The work that your parents do is about making sure that our children are
happy and they’re doing well and they have clean air and clean water and
that they are safe.  And you guys letting your parents do this work is
helping so many children that you may never meet.

So, I wanted — on this day, when you’re here with your parents while
they’re at work, I want to thank you for letting them do what they do. 
It means a whole lot to our entire country. 

And with that, I will also say, when I was your age, I used to go to
work with my mom.  And it was really kind of neat to see what they do
all day.  Right?  Wasn’t it neat?  Did you ask them lots of questions?

AUDIENCE:  Yes!

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yes, good.  Did you get lots of good answers?

AUDIENCE:  Yes!

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Are all of you skipping school today?

AUDIENCE:  Yes!

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  It’s a good day.  Okay.

Well, welcome, welcome, welcome, and happy day.  And I’m so happy to see
all of you. 

And to all of the parents, the godparents, the grandparents, the aunts,
the uncles, the big sisters, big brothers, thank you all for the work
that you do every day.  Thank you all very much.  (Applause.)
