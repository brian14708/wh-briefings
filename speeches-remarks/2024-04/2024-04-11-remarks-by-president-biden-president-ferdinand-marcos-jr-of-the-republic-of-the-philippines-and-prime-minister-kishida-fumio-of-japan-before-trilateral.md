4:21 P.M. EDT

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, today we mark a
historic moment: the first-ever leaders’ summit between the United
States, Japan, and the Philippines.  And it’s truly an honor to have you
both here as we begin this new era of a partnership.  
   
As you’ve heard me say before, a great deal of history in our world will
be written in the Indo-Pacific over the coming years and the three — as
the three allies, three steadfast partners, and three proud democracies
representing a half a billion people.  And, today, we commit to writing
that story and a future together, to building an Indo-Pacific that is
free, open, prosperous, and secure for all.  
   
This afternoon, we’ll discuss a few key areas where our nations are
deepening ties.  First, technology and clean energy.  We’re securing our
semiconductor supply chain — from securing our semiconductor supply
chain, to expanding trusted telecommunications in the Philippines, to
building a clean energy workforce, to expanding our cooperation across
the entire board.  
   
Second, we are deepening our maritime and security ties.  This is
something I know you’ve discussed with Vice President Harris during her
travel to the Indo-Pacific.  And I want to be clear: The United States —
The United States’ defense commitments to Japan and to the Philippines
are ironclad.  They’re ironclad.  
   
As I’ve said before, any attack on Philippine aircraft, vessels, or
armed forces in the South China Sea would invoke our Mutual Defense
Treaty.  
   
Finally, I’m proud to announce we’re launching an economic corridor in
the Philippines as part of the G7’s Partnership for Global
Infrastructure and Investment.  This is the first corridor in the
Indo-Pacific.  It means more jobs for people across the entire region. 
It means more investment in sectors critical to our future: clean
energy, ports, railroads, agriculture, and much more.  
   
I’m looking forward to discussing all this with all of you.  But, first,
Mr. President, I’m going to hand it over to you.   
   
President Marcos.  
   
PRESIDENT MARCOS:  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  And, once again,
allow me to thank you for hosting us — Prime Minister Kishida and myself
— in the White House for this very important agreement, which we are
going to formalize today.  
   
We meet today as friends and partners, bound by a shared vision and
pursuit of a peaceful, stable, and prosperous Indo-Pacific.  It is a
partnership borne not out of convenience, nor of expediency, but as a
natural progression of a deepening relation and robust cooperation
amongst our three countries, linked by a profound respect for democracy,
good governance, and the rule of law.  
   
Today’s historic summit is a culmination of several preparatory
engagements between our foreign ministries, our national security
advisors, and our vice ministers, as well as the conduct of trilateral
maritime exercises and joint development cooperation.   
   
But this meeting can be just a beginning.   
   
Facing the complex challenges of our time requires concert- — concerted
efforts on everyone’s part, a dedication to a common purpose, and an
unwavering commitment to the rules-based international order.  
   
This is a meeting that looks ahead.  As we deepen our ties and enhance
our coordination, we seek to identify ways of growing our economies and
making them more resilient, climate-proofing our — our cities and our
societies, sustaining our development progress, and forging a peaceful
word — world for the next generation.  
   
Today’s summit is an opportunity to define the future that we want and
how we intend to achieve it together.  
   
Thank you.  And I wish us all a successful meeting.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you.   
   
Mr. Prime Minister, the floor is yours.  
   
PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:  (As interpreted.)  I very much appreciate that
we are having the first-ever Japan-U.S.-Philippines summit.  And I would
like to extend my deep gratitude to President Biden for your
leadership.   
   
And, President Marcos, we met last year in December, and what a pleasure
it is to see you once again.

In the midst of compound crisis faced by the global community,
multi-layered cooperation between allies and likeminded countries is
essential if we are to maintain and bolster a free and open
international order based on the rule of law.

Today’s meeting will make history as an occasion that significantly
pushed forward such initiative.

Japan, the U.S., and the Philippines are maritime nations connected by
the Pacific Ocean and are natural partners.  We share fundamental values
and principles and have supported regional economic development.

In order to secure peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific, I hope to
reaffirm our intention to further strengthen trilateral cooperation and
to present the specific way forward through today’s meeting.   
   
Thank you.

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you very much, Mr. President and Mr. Prime
Minister.

To put it simply, when we stand as one, we’re able to forge a better
future for all.  And that’s what this new trilat is all about, in my
view: building a better future for people across the Indo-Pacific and,
quite frankly, beyond — around the world.

So, thank you both for being here.  And I look forward to this first
summit and many more in the years ahead.

And as we say goodbye to the press, we’ll wait a minute here, and we’ll
get moving.
