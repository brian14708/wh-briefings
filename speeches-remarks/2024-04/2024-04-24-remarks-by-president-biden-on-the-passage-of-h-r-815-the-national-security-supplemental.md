State Dining Room

10:57 A.M. EDT

THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  It’s a good day for America, it’s a good
day for Europe, and it’s a good day for world peace, for real.  This is
consequential.

I just signed into law the national security package that was passed by
the House of Representatives this weekend and by the Senate yesterday. 

It’s going to make America safer.  It’s going to make the world safer. 
And it continues America’s leadership in the world, and everyone knows
it. 

It gives vital support to America’s partners and they — so they can
defend themselves against threats to their sovereignty and to the lives
and freedom of their citizens.  And it’s an investment in our own
security, because when our allies are stronger — and I want to make this
point again and again — when our allies are stronger, we are stronger.

I’m grateful for all — grateful to all those in Congress — Democrats,
Republicans, independents — who voted for this bill.

It’s a path — to my desk, it was a difficult path.  It should have been
easier, and it should have gotten there sooner.  But in the end, we did
what America always does: We rose to the moment, we came together, and
we got it done.

Now we need to move fast, and we are. 

Over two years, Russia has been responsible for a brutal campaign
against Ukraine.  They’ve killed tens of thousands of Ukrainians, bombed
hospitals — deliberately picked them out — bombed hospitals,
kindergartens, grain silos; tried to plunge Ukraine into a cold and dark
winter by striking their power grid.

Ukrainians have fought — the Ukrainians have fought back, defending
their country and their families with extraordinary courage.  Many of
you have been there with me many times.  It’s amazing what they do.  I
mean, it’s amazing.   
   
Against such a larger military, Ukraine has regained over half the
territory that Russia took from them in this invasion.  And they won
important victories against Russia’s navy.  But make no mistake about:
They’re a fighting force with the will and the skill to win — the will
and the skill to win.

For months, while MAGA Republicans were blocking aid, Ukraine has been
running out of artillery shells and ammunition.

Meanwhile, Putin’s friends keep giving him — are keeping him well
supplied.  Iran sent him drones.  North Korea has sent him ballistic
missiles and artillery shells.  China is providing components and
know-how to boost Russia’s defense production.

With all this support, Russia has ramped up its airstrikes against
Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure, rained down munitions on
U- — brave Ukrainians defending their homeland.  And now Americans are
going to send Ukraine the supplies they need to keep them in the fight.

This weekend, there are reports — and this is — I find this amazing. 
There are reports of cheers breaking out of the trenches in eastern
Ukraine — probably came from one of your folks — a reporter or someone. 
I’m not sure where it came from.  But that they’re cheering as they
watch the House vote in support for Ukraine.

It’s not like they don’t understand what we’ve done.  Not like they
don’t understand how critical this is for them.

I’m making sure the shipments start right away.

In the next few hours — literally, the few hours — we’re going to begin
sending in equipment to Ukraine for air defense; munitions for
artillery, for rocket systems; and armored vehicles. 

You know, this package is literally an investment, not only in Ur- —
Ukraine’s security but in Europe’s security, in our own security.  
   
We’re sending Ukraine equipment from our own stockpiles, and then we’ll
replenish those stockpiles with new products made by American companies
here in America: Patriot missiles made in Arizona, Javelins made in
Alabama, artillery shells made in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas.   
   
In other words, we’re helping Ukraine while at the same time investing
in our own industrial base, strengthening our own national security, and
supporting jobs in nearly 40 states all across America.  
   
You know, the United States is not acting alone, to state the obvious. 
Our allies in Europe and around the world, who for — constantly been
asking me, “Are we going to step up?  We’re not going to walk away, are
we?  How many” — and some of you have been in these international
meetings with me.  They’re very concerned.  Had we failed to step up,
Lord only knows what would happen to the cohesion of NATO.  
   
We’re also sendi- — they’re also sending significant help to Ukraine. 
We’re all standing together against this brutal dictator.    
   
As I’ve argued for months, this is directly — directly in the United
States’ national security interest.  If Putin trium- — triumphs in
Ukraine, the next move of Russian forces could very well be a direct
attack on a NATO Ally.  And you all know full well that invoking Article
Five of the North Atlantic Treaty would be the first thing that comes to
mind, which declares an attack on one is an attack on all.  
   
If Putin attacks a NATO Ally, like he’s attacking Ukraine today, we’d
have no choice but to come to their aid, just like our NATO Allies came
to our la- — our aid after the September 11th attacks here.   
   
That’s why we’re supporting and surging support now to Ukraine: to stop
Putin from drawing the United States into a war in Europe and in the
future.   
   
You know, it seems to me we should take a little bit of a step back and
realize what a critical moment this was for the United States and for
NATO.  This is a historical moment.  
   
In the last two years, we’ve helped unify, strengthen, and expand NATO. 
Imagine if instead we had failed — we had failed to step up now and
support Ukraine.  All those gains would have begun to unravel, the
cohesion of NATO would have been weakened, and our national security
would have been undermined, without any question.  
   
You know, Putin started this war believing he could easily break the
will of the people of Ukraine.  When that failed, he changed his
strategy a little bit, thinking he could break the — break the will of
NATO, break the will of the United States, break our will.  Well, he’s
failed again.  
   
America stands with our friends.  We stand up against dictators.  We bow
to no one — to no one, certainly not Vladimir Putin.   
   
Look, this bill also includes vital support for Israel.  Just 10 days
ago, we saw Iran launch over 100 missiles and drones at Israel.  And
because of them and other allies across the countr- — world, including
from the region, none — no serious damage occurred.  An unprecedented
attack that followed years of Iran supporting Hezbollah, Hamas, and
proxies of their own — their own attack on Israel.  They — they fund
these guys.   
   
My commitment to Israel, I want to make clear again, is ironclad.  The
security of Israel is critical.  I will always make sure that Israel has
what it needs to defend itself against Iran and terrorists it
supports.  
   
And with this aid, the United States can help replenish Israel’s air
defense and provide other critical defense so Iran can never carry out
the destruction it intended with its attack 10 days ago.  
   
But at the same time, this bill significantly — significantly increases
humanitarian assistance we’re sending to the innocent people of Gaza,
who are suffering badly.  They’re suffering the consequences of this war
that Hamas started.  And we’ve been working intently for months to get
as much aid to Gaza as possible.  
   
This bill includes $1 billion for additional humanitarian aid in Gaza. 
We’re going to immediately secure that aid and surge it — surge it,
including food, medical supplies, clean water.  And Israel must make
sure all this aid reaches the Palestinians in Gaza without delay.   
   
And everything we do is guided by the ultimate goal of bringing these
hostages home, securing a ceasefire, and setting the conditions for an
enduring peace.   
   
You know, there’s more that this bill does, in- — as you all know, the
press here, including providing for support to strengthen even further
our allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region, as well as
humanitarian aid to places including Haiti, Sudan, and Somalia.   
   
But there’s one thing this bill does not do: border security.   
   
You know, just this year, I proposed and negotiated and agreed to the
strongest border security bill this country has ever, ever, ever seen. 
It was bipartisan.  It should have been included in this bill, and I’m
determined to get it done for the American people.  But I’ll come back
to that in another mom- — another time.   
   
This is a reminder of what America can do when we s- — when we come
together, despite our differences.   
   
I want to thank everyone in Congress who made it possible, especially
the bipartisan leadership: Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson; Leader
Jeffries; Leaders Schumer and McConnell.  They don’t always agree, but
when it matters most, they stepped up and did the right thing.  And I
mean this sincerely, history will remember this time.  History will
remember this moment.  
   
For all the talk about how dysfunctional things are in Washington, when
you look over the past three years, we see that time and again on the
critical issues we’ve actually come together.  It hadn’t always been
easy, but when it’s come time to decide to rebuild America, we did it
with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which is just underway.   
   
When it came time to invest in our semiconductor industry and technica-
— technologic- — technologies of the future, we did it with the CHIPS
and Science Act.   
   
And when it came time to stand with Ukraine and Israel and help the
people of Gaza, we did that as well.   
   
At the end of the day, most of us — whether we’re Democrats,
Republicans, or independents — believe that America must stand up for
what is right. 

We don’t walk away from our allies; we stand with them.  We don’t let
tyrants win; we oppose them.  We don’t merely watch global events
unfold; we shape them.   
   
That’s what it means to be the ins- — the indispensable nation.  That’s
what it means to be the world’s superpower and the world’s leading
democracy.   
   
Some of our MAGA Republican friends reject that vision, but this vote
makes it clear: There is a bipartisan consensus for that kind of
American leadership.  That’s exactly what we’ll continue to deliver.   
   
I thank you all very much.  And now I’m going off to make a speech at a
hotel that I am late for.  And I’ll have plenty of time to answer
questions on this and other matters.   
   
Thank you.
