Q    Mr. President, how was your meeting with Abigail?  Can you talk
about your meeting with Abigail a little bit?

We’re told that you met with Abigail, the little — the little girl that
was held hostage.

THE PRESIDENT: I’m sorry, I can’t hear you (inaudible).

Q    Abigail.  You met with Abigail the other day.

THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.

Q    The little — the little girl.  How did that go?

THE PRESIDENT:  That went really well.  Her dad sent me — her — excuse
me — her family sent me a note saying she was riding home and she said,
“You know, I love Joe Biden.”

Q    We’re told that she did a lot of playing.

THE PRESIDENT:  She did.

Q    And had you seen — can you discuss that a little bit.  Was she
outside, inside?  She was playing a lot?

THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, she was.  We had her on the swings.  She was pla- —
swinging around in the Oval Office.  She was really good.

Q    Have you seen the video of the hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin with
the missing arm?  Have you seen that video of that hostage?  Any
reaction?

THE PRESIDENT:  I haven’t, but I know about it.  I haven’t physically
seen it.
