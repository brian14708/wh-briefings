Oval Office

10:52 A.M. EDT

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, Fumio, welcome back to the White House.  Welcome
back to the Oval Office.  It’s good to have you here and good to see you
again. 

When we were here last year, we said the role being played by the United
States and Japan is — is becoming even greater.  And we — I — I couldn’t
agree more with your assertion back then.

And what we see in our joint support for Ukraine in the face of Russia’s
vicious assault was — it’s — it’s just outrageous.

We see it in our historic trilateral relationship with South Korea.  We
see it in our economic investments, which has helped generate millions
of jobs across both our nations.

And I sincerely want to thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, for your bold
leadership across all these issues.  You, personally, have made all this
possible.  And I would assert our alliance has never been stronger in
our entire history.

So, today, I look forward to discussing how we can even deepen it more,
including increasing defense and in technology and cooperation across
the board.

And we can also discuss how we can continue to enhance and ensure
Indo-Pacific remains a free, open, and prosperous region of the world
with us standing together.

And thank you for being here, Mr. Prime Minister.  You’ve heard me say
this before, but I’ll say it again: You’re a genuine leader, a true
partner, and a good friend.

Thank you for being here.

PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:  (As interpreted.)  Well, Joe, thank you so much
for those very kind words of welcome.  And I’m very grateful to be
invited to the United States for this official visit.

My wife, Yuko, and I are sincerely grateful for the warm hospitality
extended by you and Dr. Biden. 

Up until now, Joe, you and I — we have had countless dialogues, and we
have nurtured a friendship and a trust along the way.  Japan and the
United States are now at the forefront in maintaining and strengthening
a free and open international order, based on the rule of law.

Japan and the United States are also indispensable now to each other in
driving sustainable and inclusive economic growth as well.

Through this official visit, I look forward to confirming the robust
bond between our two nations and show — demonstrate at home and abroad
how Japan and the U.S., firmly bound together, will build a future as
global partners.

So, once again, I thank you for your warm hospitality.

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you.
