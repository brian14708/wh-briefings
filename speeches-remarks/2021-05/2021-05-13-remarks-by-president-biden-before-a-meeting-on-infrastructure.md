Oval Office

1:41 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you all in the press may be getting tired of
seeing me all day today.  I’m going to see you again later, too.  But I
hope my colleagues aren’t tired of seeing me because they just got
here.  (Laughter.)  
   
Look, what we’re doing is — at the — at the request of — mutual request
of us getting together, getting leading Republicans in the Senate
together to see if we can work out something on a compromise on
infrastructure.  And — and I know they’re sincere about it, and so am
I.   
   
And what we’re going to try to do is figure out what we can agree
constitutes infrastructure from each of our perspectives, and then see
whether or not we’re in a position that — how — how much we want to fund
it above the baseline — the baseline, meaning what we spent last year. 
And then, we’ll talk about how to proceed from there.  
   
But I assure you — I know, Senator Capito, this is in good faith —  
   
SENATOR CAPITO:  Yes.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  It’s a genuine effort.  I think we can get there.  And
I’m hoping that — just in case, I brought along two of the Secretaries
who are smarter than I am so they can answer the really tough
questions.   
   
But all kidding aside, I’m looking forward to this meeting.   
   
And I want to thank you all for coming in, and we appreciate you being
here.  So, thank you for being here.  
   
Q    Mr. President, are you open to a deal that isn’t fully paid for?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m going to get a chance to talk to you later.  
   
Q    Sir, will you be making a new scaled-down offer to the GOP today?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m prepared to compromise.
