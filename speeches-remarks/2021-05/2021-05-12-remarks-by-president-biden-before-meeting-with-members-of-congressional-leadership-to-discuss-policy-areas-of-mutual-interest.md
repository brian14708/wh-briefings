Oval Office

11:12 A.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’m happy to have the House and Senate leadership
here.  You can see Senator McConnell and Leader McCarthy and Speaker
Pelosi and Majority Leader Schumer.  And what we’re going to talk about
today is — you know, when I ran, I said wasn’t going to be a Democratic
President; I was going to be a President for all Americans.  
   
And what the bottom line here is: We’re going to see whether we can
reach some consensus on a compromise on moving forward.  And we’re going
to talk a lot about infrastructure today to see if there’s any way we
can reach a compromise that gets the people’s work done and is within
the bounds of everyone agreeing.  And that’s the purpose of this
meeting.  
   
Not much more to say right now, but we’ll — we’re going to get — we’re
going to get going.  That’s it.  
   
Q    How do you expect to do that, sir?  How do you expect to come to a
compromise?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Easy.  Just snap my fingers.  It’ll happen. 
(Laughter.)  
   
Thank you.
