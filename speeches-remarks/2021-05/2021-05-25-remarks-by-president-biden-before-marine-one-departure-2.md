5:16 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m going up to a viewing of a woman who worked with me
in a senior position from the time I ran for the county council who
passed away.  Her name was Norma Long.  That’s why I’m heading home. 
I’m heading back — back tonight.  And so I just wanted to let you know
what I’m doing.   
   
Q    Sir, how was your meeting with the Floyd family?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  The Floyd family meeting went incredibly well.  We spent
a long time together.  I spent — I got a chance to spend a lot of time
with Gianna and the family.  And we just talked about — you know, it’s
the one-year anniversary, and those of you who’ve been through personal
loss know that although every anniversary is — you’re happy people
remember, it also brings everything back immediately like it happened
that day.  It takes a lot of courage to go through it.   
   
And they’ve been wonderful.  And I’ve spoken with the negotiators.  I’m
hopeful that sometime after Memorial Day, we’ll have an agreement on the
— on the George Floyd legislation.  And so, I’m optimistic.   
   
And I think they spoke to you.  Maybe they didn’t speak to you; they
spoke to some of you.  I think they were very pleased with the time we
spent together.  It was mostly personal.  We spent a long time — I
guess, almost a couple of hours.  
   
Q    And how was the time with Gianna for you?  What did you
(inaudible)?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  First thing she did when she ran in was throw her arms
around me — gave me a big hug and wanted to sit in my lap.  And we spent
— she also loved the idea that — she said, “I’m really hungry.”  And so
she — she said, “Do you have any snacks?”   
   
Q    What did you give her?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we gave her — my wife would kill me. We gave her
some ice cream.  She had some Cheetos.  And I think she had a chocolate
milk.  I’m not sure what the third one was.   
   
But they were in and out.  I showed them all — and we spent time — I
spent time showing them around not just the Oval, but around the White
House.  And they were interested and — I gave them all — I gave them all
little mementos, especially her.  I had a great picture of Gianna when I
went down for the funeral — or for the eve of the funeral, and I gave
her that.  
   
Q    Why have you decided to meet with President Putin?  And why are you
letting Germany and Russia to build — to continue building Nord Stream
2?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Because it’s almost completely finished, number one. 
The idea that anything that — and it’s not like I can allow Germany to
do something they’re not.   
   
I have been opposed to Nord Stream 2 from the beginning, but it only has
— it’s almost completed by the time I took office.  And to go ahead and
impose sanctions now, I think, would be counterproductive now in terms
of our European relations.  And they know how strongly I feel.  And I
hope we can work on how they handle it from this point on.  
   
Q    Have you considered canceling the summit because of what happened
in Belarus?  Have you ever considered cancelling the summit with Mr.
Putin because of what just happened —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, no, no.  I — Putin had indicated he wanted to meet
with me well over a month ago.  I’ve spoken with him a number of times.
 We’re going to be having a meeting in Switzerland not too long from
now.  
   
Q    What are you thinking about in terms of sanctions on Belarus?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, that’s in play.  I don’t want to speculate until
we get it done.  
   
Q    Mr. President, (inaudible) end qualified immunity?  That’s one of
the hang-ups in negotiations.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  The negotiations are taking place now.  In case you
haven’t figured me out by now, I never negotiate in public like others
do.  That’s why I’m relatively successful in getting things done.  And
so I will tell you when that happens.  
   
Thank you so much.
