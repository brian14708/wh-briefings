title: Remarks by President Biden During Briefing on the Atlantic Hurricane Outlook
  and Preparedness Efforts

FEMA Headquarters  
Washington, D.C.

1:44 P.M. EDT

THE PRESIDENT:  Hey, the press.  Welcome.  I have a very brief opening
statement here.   
  
Administrator Criswell, thanks for — thanks for hosting us.  You know, I
wanted a tested veteran for FEMA, and that’s exactly what I got in the
new head of FEMA.  I really do appreciate it.   
  
She served as a fire safety officer — I got to turn this on — a fire
safety officer in — in Iraq and Afghanistan — that qualifies for any
tough job — and played a critical role at FEMA before, and — and was a
leader in response to something I was deeply involved in as Vice
President at the time: Superstorm Sandy.  Thank you for all that great
work.   
  
Already this year, FEMA has stepped up and vaccinated America and
responded to winter storms, reminding us that we can never be too
prepared.   
  
My administration is going to bring every resource to bear — every
resource to bear every time to help American people — the American
people weather emergencies.  And, you know, we’re going to spare no
expense, no effort to keep Americans safe and respond to crises when
they arise.  And they certainly will.   
  
Now it’s time to get ready for the busiest time of the year for
disasters in America: hurricane season in the south and east, and the
fire season out west.   
  
I’m here today to make it clear that I will insist on nothing less than
readiness for all of these challenges.  We’re going to make sure the men
and women of FEMA and our other key agencies have everything they need —
everything they need, because they’ve got an incredibly difficult
job.   
  
Today, I’m announcing that FEMA is going to make $1 billion available to
the states, territories, Tribes, and rural communities through the
Building Resilience Infrastructure and Communities program — the
so-called BRIC program.   
  
That’s going to double the funding available of la- — from last year,
and it’s going to help communities, including those too often
overlooked, and it’s going to invest in resilience and better protect
themselves to serve for other climate events that we’re going to be
facing.  
  
Last year, as you all know, we faced the most named storms on record. 
Seven out of the thirty named storms alone claimed 86 lives and caused
more than $40 billion in damage.   
  
This year, NOAA is focusing on another severe season, perhaps — and God
willing — not as bad as 2020, but still quite bad.  We all know that
these storms are coming.  And we’re going to be prepared; we have to be
ready.  We have to be ready.   
  
When disaster strikes, we have to be there to protect and also help
people recover.  And so it’s about — not about red states and blue
states.  You all know that.  It’s about having people’s backs in the
toughest moments that they face, ready with food, water, blankets,
shelters, and more.   
  
But there’s, you know, there — to be, you know, beginning this effort
for 2021 is — I think we’ve learned a few lessons from last year as
well.  There’s help us — we — there, you know, being there to help clear
roads, rebuild Main Streets, and so that the families can get back to
their lives — that’s what FEMA does every single day.  As my mother
would say, “They’re doing God’s work.”  
  
Today — today’s briefing is a critical reminder: We don’t have a moment
to lose in preparing for 2021.  And so, again, I want to thank you for
all that you do.  And I’m looking forward to hearing from you all.  And
I thank the press for coming in.  Appreciate it.
