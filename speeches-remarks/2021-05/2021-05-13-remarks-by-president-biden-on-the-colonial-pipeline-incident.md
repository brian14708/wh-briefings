title: "Remarks by President\_Biden on the Colonial Pipeline\_Incident"
---
 
Roosevelt Room

12:27 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, folks.  I want to update everyone on the
ransomware cyberattack that impacted on the Colonial Pipeline over this
past week.  
   
As of yesterday evening, Colonial has begun restarting the flow of
refined products in their pipeline.    
   
This morning, Colonial reported that fuel is beginning to flow to a
majority of the markets that they service, and they should be reaching
full operational capacity as we speak — as I speak to you right now.  
   
That is good news.  But I want to be clear: We will not feel the effects
at the pump immediately.  This is not like flicking on a light switch. 
This pipeline is 5,500 miles long.  It had never been fully shut down in
its entire history, and so — so fully.  And we have to — now they have
to safely and fully return to normal operations.  And it’s going to take
some time, and there may be hic- — hic- — hiccups, like I just had,
along the way here.  (Laughter.)  
   
Still, we expect to see a region-by-region return to normalcy beginning
this weekend and continuing into next week.  
   
In the meantime, I want to update you on what our administration is
doing to accelerate this process, to mitigate shortages, and to protect
you from price gouging — to protect the American people from price
gouging — all those along the line.  
   
First, we relaxed rules for pipeline operators to provide flexibility
for emergency personnel to help manually get portions of the pipeline up
and running earlier this week.  Secondly, over the weekend, we reviewed
and worked with the company to get a portion of the pipeline system from
North Carolina to Maryland to operate under manual control and deliver
its ex- — deliver its existing inventory.   
   
In addition, we’ve put in place emergency orders that lifts hours — the
hours restrictions and allowed states to lift weight restrictions for
tank truck drivers to be on the road.  This allows those drivers to work
more and carry more fuel to the affected regions.   
   
Third, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a targeted, 20-day
waiver of standards in several states to give fuel suppliers more
flexibility to use available fuels where they’re needed, which will
boost the fuel supply.   
   
And those — those last two actions have made tens of millions of gallons
of additional fuel available each day to be able to be distributed.   
   
Put another way: The extraordinary measures the administration has
taken, we estimate, sent enough gas to stations to fill the tanks of
over 5 million vehicles in the last few days. 

Fourthly, as part of an effort to use every possible means to accelerate
fuel deliveries, last night I granted a waiver of the Jones Act to fuel
suppliers.  This allows non-U.S. flagged vessels to transport refined
fuel products from the Gulf of Mexico to affected areas.  And we’ll
grant additional waivers if necessary.  These steps are temporary, but
they will remain in place until full service is fully restored.    
   
This is a — this is a whole-of-government response to get more fuel more
quickly to where it is needed and to limit the pain being felt by
American customers.  
   
Now, here is what drives — the driver in the states that are affected,
here’s what they — you can do — the drivers: Don’t panic, number one.  I
know seeing lines at the pumps or gas stations with no gas can be
extremely stressful, but this is a temporary situation.  Do not get more
gas than you need in the next few days.    
   
As I said, we expect the situation to begin to improve by the weekend
and into early next week.  And gasoline supply is coming back on line,
and panic buying will only slow the process.  
   
And I also want to say something to the gas stations: Do not — I repeat,
do not try to take advantage of consumers during this time.  
   
I’m going to work with governors in the affected states to put a stop to
price gouging wherever it arises.  And I am asking our federal agencies
to stand ready to provide assistance to state-level efforts to monitor
and address any price gouging at the pump.  
   
Nobody should be using this situation for financial gain.  That’s what
the hackers are trying to do.  That’s what they were about, not us. 
That’s not who we are.    
   
And as for the people who carried out this attack, the FBI has released
details on the attack so others can take steps to prevent being
victimized like Colonial has been.     
   
We do not believe — I emphasize, we do not believe the Russian
government was involved in this attack.  But we do have strong reason to
believe that criminals who did the attack are living in Russia.  That’s
where it came from — were from Russia.      
   
We have been in direct communication with Moscow about the imperative
for responsible countries to take decisive action against these
ransomware networks.    
   
We’re also going to pursue a measure to disrupt their ability to
operate.  And our Justice Department has launched a new task force
dedicated to prosecuting ransomware hackers to the full extent of the
law.   
   
And finally, let me say that this event is providing an urgent reminder
of why we need to harden our infrastructure and make it more resilient
against all threats — natural and manmade.   
   
My administration is continuing to safeguard our critical
infrastructure, the majority of which is privately owned and managed,
like Colonial Pipeline.  Private entities are in charge of their own
cybersecurity, and we need — and we have to — we know — we know what
they need.  They need greater private-sector investment in
cybersecurity.  And that’s why we launched a new public-private
initiative in April that is focusing on strengthening cybersecurity in
the electric sector for natural gas, for pipelines, as well as water
systems and other lifeline sectors.   
   
And last night, I signed an executive order to improve the nation’s
cybersecurity.  It calls for federal agencies to work more closely with
the private sector to share information, strengthen cybersecurity
practices, and deploy technologies that increase reliance against
cyberattacks.   
   
It outlines innovative ways the government will drive to deliver
security and software, using federal buying power to jumpstart the
market and improve the products that all Americans use.   
   
To assist in this urgent work of protecting our nation’s — our nation
against cyberattacks, I’m calling on the United States Senate to move
quickly to confirm Chris Inglis as our National Cyber Director and Jen
Easterly to be the Director of Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency at the Department of Homeland Security.    
   
In America, we’ve seen critical in- — infrastructure taken offline by
floods, fires, storms and criminal hackers.  In Texas, last month, we
saw what happens when storms hit power systems that aren’t fully
modernized or ready for the threats of extreme weather with tragic
results.  
   
Now we’re seeing the effect of criminal hackers with gas lines
throughout the Southwest — excuse me, the Southeast.  And we’re in a
competition with China and the rest of the world to win the 21st
century, economically.  And we’re not going to win it competing with an
infrastructure that is out of the 20th century.  We need a modern
infrastructure.  
   
My American Jobs Plan includes transformative investments in modernizing
and in securing our critical infrastructure.  
   
Later this afternoon, I’ll be meeting with Republican senators to
discuss ways we can move forward on modernizing the infrastructure we
have today and building the infrastructure we need for tomorrow.  
   
I’m willing to negotiate, as I indicated yesterday to the House members
and to the leadership.  But it’s clearer than ever that doing nothing is
not an option.   
   
Again, we expect things to return to normal over the next several days. 
I will be monitoring Colonial’s progress and the federal government’s
support every step of the way.   
   
So, stay strong.  Help is on the way.  We’re going to get through this
as we always do, as Americans, and we’re going to do it together.  And
it’s going to be quick.  
   
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.  
   
Q    Mr. President, you said that the hackers are believed to be living
in Russia.  At what point does the U.S. start to try to inflict pain on
governments who allow this sort of this to happen in their territory?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  We are working to try to get to the place where we have
sort of an international standard that governments knowing that criminal
activities are happening from their territory, that we all — we all move
on those — those criminal enterprises.  And I — I expect that’s one of
the topics I’ll be talking about with — with President Putin.  
   
Q    Are you confident that Putin was not involved?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I am confident that I read the report of the FBI
accurately, and they say they were not — he was not, the government was
not.  
   
Q    Mr. President, Wednesday’s executive order mentions the Colonial
Pipeline directly, but the press release says it only encourages
private-sector companies to follow the federal government’s lead, which
— encouragement is good, but in the face of profit, it’s kind of
sketchy.  So what concrete steps is the administration taking to ensure
that companies are prepared and held accountable for their cyber issues
— cybersecurity issues?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  You’ve asked three different questions in that one
thing, I think — as I understand it.  
   
The bottom line is that I cannot dictate that the private companies do
certain things relative to cybersecurity.  A lot of you are very
seasoned reporters; you’ve been covering this debate up on the Capitol
Hill for — before I became President — and, unrelated to President
Trump, just a debate internally among senators as to whether or not the
government should be assisting.  And it gets into privacy issues and a
whole range of things.  
   
So that’s going to be an ongoing negotiation.  But I think it’s becoming
clear to everyone that we have to do more than is being done now, and
the federal government can be significant value added in having that
happen.  
   
Yes.  
   
Q    Will you consider doing any kind of retaliatory cyberattacks to
shut down these criminals?  Are you ruling that out?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No.  
   
Q    Is Prime Minister Netanyahu doing enough to stop this violence
there from escalating?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I had a brief conversation with him yesterday.  And I
have my intelligence community, the Defense Department, as well as the
State Department have been in contact with all of their counterparts in
— not only in Israel, but in the region.   
   
And one of the things that I have seen thus far is that there has not
been a significant overreaction.  The question is how — how we get to a
point where — they get to a point where there is a significant reduction
in the attacks, particularly the rocket attacks that are
indiscriminately fired into population centers.   
   
But I expect I’ll be having some more discussions.  And it wasn’t — we
haven’t just spoken with the Israelis — the Egyptians, the Saudis, and
others.  So, we’re — it’s — it’s a work in progress right now.  
   
So thank you all so very much.  
   
Q    One more, Mr. President?  Just one more on the ransom: Were you
briefed on the fact that the company did pay the ransom?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I have no comment on that.  Thank you.
