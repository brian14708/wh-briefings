Cross Hall

THE PRESIDENT:  Folks, I’ve just spoken with Prime Minister Netanyahu. 
Earlier today, I spoke with President Al Sisi of Egypt.   
   
And Minister — Prime Minister Netanyahu informed me that Israel has
agreed to a mutual, unconditional ceasefire to begin in less than two
hours.  The Egyptians have now informed us that Hamas and the other
groups in Gaza have also agreed.  
   
In my conversation with President \[Prime Minister\] Netanyahu, I
commended him for the decision to bring the current hostilities to a
close within less than 11 days.  I also emphasized what I have said
throughout this conflict: The United States fully supports Israel’s
right to defend itself against indiscriminate rocket attacks from Hamas
and other Gaza-based terrorist groups that have taken the lives of
innocent civilians in Israel.  
   
The Prime Minister also shared with me his appreciation for the Iron
Dome system, which our nations developed together and which has saved
the lives of countless Israeli citizens, both Arab and Jew.  I assured
him of my full support to replenish Israel’s Iron Dome system to ensure
its defenses and security in the future.  
   
Over the last 11 days, I spoke with the Prime Minister six times.  I’ve
also spoken with President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority more than
once in part of our intense diplomatic engagement.   
   
And I want to also thank the Secretary of State, the Secretary of
Defense, our National Security Advisor, and everyone on our team for
their incredible efforts to bring this about — this outcome that we’re
about to see.  
   
You know, we’ve held intensive high-level discussions,  
hour by hour, literally — Egypt, the Palestinian Authority,  
and other Middle Eastern countries — with an aim of avoiding the sort of
prolonged conflict we’ve seen in previous years when the hostilities
have broken out.  
   
I extend my sincere gratitude to President Al Sisi and the senior
Egyptian officials who played a critical role in this diplomacy.  
   
I also apprec- — appreciate the contributions  
of other parties in the region who have been engaged in working towards
the end of hostilities.  
   
These hostilities have resulted in the tragic deaths of so many
civilians, including children.  And I send my sincere condolences to all
the families — Israeli and Palestinian — who have lost loved ones and my
hope for a full recovery for the wounded.  
   
The United States is committed to working with the United Nations, and
we remain committed to working with the United Nations and other
international stakeholders to provide rapid humanitarian assistance and
to marshal international support  
for the people of Gaza and the Gaza rec- — reconstruction efforts.  
   
We will do this in full partnership with the Palestinian Authority — not
Hamas, the Authority — in a manner that does not permit Hamas to simply
restock its military arsenal.  
   
I believe the Palestinians and Israelis equally deserve to live safely
and securely and to enjoy equal measures of freedom, prosperity, and
democracy.   
   
My administration will continue our quiet and relentless diplomacy
toward that end.  I believe we have a genuine opportunity to make
progress, and I’m committed to working for it.  
   
I want to thank you all.  And may God bless you all.  And I pray that
this continues.  Thank you so much.
