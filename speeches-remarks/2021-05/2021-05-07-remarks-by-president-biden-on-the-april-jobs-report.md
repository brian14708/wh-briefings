East Room

12:00 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  It’s exactly 12:00.  I want to — I want
to put today’s jobs report in perspective.  And — look, when we came to
office, we knew we were facing a once-in-a-century pandemic and a
once-in-a-generation economic crisis.  And we knew this wouldn’t be a
sprint; it would be a marathon.   
   
Quite frankly, we are moving more rapidly than I thought we would.  This
morning, we learned that our economy created 266,000 jobs in April.  It
hadn’t been adjusted again yet, but that’s what it says: 266.  
   
And listening to commentators today — (laughs) — as I was getting
dressed, you might think that we should be disappointed.  But when we
passed the American Rescue Plan, I want to remind everybody, it was
designed to help us over the course of a year — not 60 days, a year.  We
never thought that, after the first 50 or 60 days, everything would be
fine.   
   
Today, there’s more evidence that our economy is moving in the right
direction, but it’s clear we have a long way to go.  All told, our
economy has added more than 1,500,000 new jobs since I took office. 
That’s the most number of jobs created in the first three months of any
presidency in our history.   
   
And just for perspective, in these three months before I got here, the
economy added about 60,000 jobs a month, not half a million.  In the
three months since I’ve been here, the economy has added 500,000 jobs
per month.   
   
And this is progress.  And it’s a testament to our new strategy of
growing this economy from the bottom up and the middle out.   And it’s a
clear testament to why it’s so needed.    
   
Some critics said that we didn’t need the Ameriscan — the American
Rescue Plan, that this economy would just heal itself.  Today’s report
just underscores, in my view, how vital the actions we’re taking are. 
Checks to people who are hurting.  Support for small businesses, for
childcare, and school reopening.  Support to help families put food on
the table.  Our efforts are starting to work, but the climb is steep and
we still have a long way to go.  
   
Today’s report also puts some — some truth to some loose talk that we’ve
been hearing about the economy lately.     
   
First, that we should stop helping workers and families out for fear of
“overheating” the economy.  This report reinforces the real truth: For
years, working people and middle-class people — the people who built
this country — have been left out in the cold, struggling just to keep
their heads above water while those at the top have done very well. 
We’re still digging out of an econ- — an economic collapse that cost us
22 million jobs.  Let me say that again: It cost us 22 million jobs.  
   
When we came in, we inherited a year of profound economic crisis and
mismanagement on the virus.  And we proposed a — and what we proposed is
— is going to work.  We’re going to get to 70 percent.  But at any rate
—  
   
But, look, it’s going to take focus, commitment, and time to get the
economy moving again as we want it to move.  We’ve got work to do, and
the st- — and the — to state the obvious, we have work to do.  
   
But, look, let’s keep our eye on the ball.  That’s why the American
Rescue Plan is so important.   
   
I said we built it as a yearlong effort to rescue our country.  It’s
already working.  Eight weeks later, we passed — it was — after it was
passed, but parts of the bill are still getting underway.   
   
Here’s one example — I know you all know this, but it’s worth repeating:
State and local governments have to balance their budgets.   As a
consequence of this pandemic, revenues are way down in cities and
states.  State and local governments had to have — had to lay off 1.6
million employees.  That’s an awful lot of firefighters, police
officers, sanitation workers, essential workers.   
   
But later this month, we’re going to be distributing the first tranche
of the state and local assistance from the American Rescue Plan.  We
won’t get all 1.6 million of those jobs back in one month, but you’re
going to start seeing those jobs and state and local workers coming
back.   
   
Starting this month, we’ll also deliver assistance to tens of thousands
— and this — I notice every Republican is up in their home state,
talking about this being a good idea — tens of thousands of restaurants
and bars across the country.    
   
And by the way, the majority of the jobs that have come back have been
in the entertainment indu- — in the — in those industries, in the — and
so, you know, we’re going to help schools, and children in child centers
across the country as well, accelerate reopening, and that’s underway.  
So, look, this is going to — this is going to continue to improve.   
   
Today’s report makes clear: Thank goodness we passed the American Rescue
Plan.  Help is here, and more help is on the way, and more help is
needed.    
   
Second, today’s report is a rebuttal to the loose talk that the
Americans just don’t want to work.  I know some employers are having
trouble filling jobs.  But what this report shows is that there’s a much
bigger problem, notwithstanding the commentary you might have heard this
morning.  It is that our economy still has 8 million fewer jobs than
when this pandemic started.   
   
The data shows that more — more workers — more workers are looking for
jobs, and many can’t find them.   While jobs are coming back, there are
still millions of people out there looking for work.   
   
And the idea that they don’t want to work — most middle-class,
working-class people that I know think the way my dad did.  He used to
say — and I know I’m repeating myself, but I’m going to continue to
because I think it’s critical.  “A job is a lot more than a paycheck,”
he’d say.  “Joey, it’s about your respect, your dignity, your place in
the community.”  More than a paycheck.  It’s people’s pride.  It’s about
being able to look at your child in the eye and say, “Honey, it’s going
to be okay.”   
   
I’ve never forgotten that.  I’ve never forgotten those folks I grew up
with.  I think about them every day as President.  They didn’t have a
lot of money, but they busted their necks their whole lives to take care
of their families.  And all they ever wanted was a shot — a fair shot at
making it.   
   
Last month, there were 266,000 more Americans with the dignity that
comes from the job.   
   
And there are millions — millions of Americans out there who, through no
fault of their own, have been knocked flat on their back this past
year.  The virus stole their jobs, and I’m determined to give them a
fighting chance.  That’s why I’ve been so focused on vaccinating the
nation and getting our economy running again.  That’s why we fought so
hard to pass the American Rescue Plan.   
   
And again, the American Rescue Plan was for the whole year.  It plays
out over a year, and it’s working.  But we can’t let up.  This jobs
report makes that clear, and we’ve got too much work to do.   
   
And the American Rescue Plan is just that: a rescue plan.   It’s to get
us back to where we were.  But that’s not nearly enough.  We have to
build back better.  That’s why we need the American Jobs Plan I
proposed: to put us in a position where we can build back better, to
reclaim our position as the leading and most innovative nation in the
world, and win the future — the 21st century.   
   
We need to rebuild the nation’s roads and highways and bridges and ports
and airports.   
   
We’ve got water systems all over the country that need repair.  There
are over 400,000 schools and daycare centers with lead pipes that —
where the — the water goes through.  Ten million homes.  
   
I saw a water project system yesterday in New Orleans that was over 80
years old.  It’s in need of major, major overhaul.  And, by the way, if
they don’t get it fixed, New Orleans itself is in real trouble.   
   
They need reliable, affordable, high-speed Internet throughout this
country.   
   
Our businesses need to compete worldwide.  Our rural communities need to
be able to compete and make their own judgements as to when to buy and
sell.   
   
And our kids need to succeed in school.  As my wife Jill says, “Any
nation that out-educates us is going to outcompete us.”   
   
We also need to up our game in our education system.  Twelve years of
education in the 20- — in 2021 is not enough to compete in the 21st
century.  In my view, we need 16 years of public education guaranteed in
this country from preschool for three- and four-year-olds at the early
end, to two years of community college after high school.   
   
We have some serious decisions to make and fundamental choices.  And
think about it: How much better off is the country if we have tens of
thousands of graduating seniors from high school and beyond going to get
two years of community college?  Doesn’t that increase our capacity
significantly?  
   
This month’s jobs numbers show we’re on the right track.  We still have
a long way to go.  As I said, my laser focus is on growing the nation’s
economy and creating jobs.  My laser focus is on vaccinating our
nation.  And we’re making continued progress.  
   
My laser focus is on one more thing: making sure working people in this
country — hardworking people — are no longer left out in the cold. 
They’re going to get a share in the benefits of a rising economy.  It’s
been a long time since that happened.   
   
I’ve called my plan the “blue-collar blueprint for America,” and that’s
exactly what it is.  So, let’s not let up.  We’re still digging our way
out of a very deep hole we were put in.  No one should underestimate how
tough this battle is.   
   
We still have a job to do here in Washington.  The American people are
counting on us.  So, let’s get it done.  Let’s build an economy that
delivers dignity and gives everybody a chance.   
   
I’m confident we can do this because there is nothing beyond the
capacity of the American people.  I want to thank you.  And God bless
you.  And may God protect our troops.  Thank you very much.  
   
Q    Mr. President, do you believe enhanced unemployment benefits had
any effect on diminishing a return to work in some categories?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, nothing measurable.  Thank you.  
   
Q    Mr. President, on CDC mask-wearing, I noticed you walked out to the
podium with your mask on.  Why do you choose to wear a mask so often
when you’re vaccinated and you’re around other people who are
vaccinated?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Because I’m worried about you.  No, that’s a joke.  It’s
a joke.  
   
Why am — why am I wearing the mask?  Because, when we’re inside, it’s
still good policy to wear the mask.  That’s why.  When I’m outside — and
the problem is: Lots of times, I walk away from this podium, you notice,
I forget to put my mask back on because I’m used to not wearing it
outside.  
   
Q    Mr. President, are you at all concerned about Vladimir Putin
amassing troops on the border of Ukraine?  Do you see that as a message
to you?  And could it impact your desire to have a one-on-one meeting
with him?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  It does not impact my desire to have the one-on-one
meeting.  And, you notice, he had more troops before.  He’s withdrawn
troops.  There’s still troops amassed, but significantly less than he
had a month ago.  
   
Q    Mr. President, do you believe that the Iranians are serious about
negotiation in Vienna?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  But how serious and what they’re prepared to do is
a different story.  But they’re — we’re still talking.  
   
Sir, you had a question.  I had to cut you off.  
   
Q    Do you have any update on whether you’ll be able to meet Vladimir
Putin in June?  Is that going to happen?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m confident we’ll be able to do it.  We don’t have any
— a specific time or place.  That’s being worked on.  
   
Thank you very much.  Thank you.
