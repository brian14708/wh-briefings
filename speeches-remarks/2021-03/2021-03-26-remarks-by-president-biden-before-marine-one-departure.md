title: Remarks by President Biden Before Marine One Departure
---
 
South Lawn

2:59 P.M. EDT

Q    Have you invited President Xi and Putin to the climate summit?

THE PRESIDENT:  I haven’t yet, but they know they’re invited.  But I
haven’t invited — I haven’t spoken to either one of them yet
individually. 

I just got off the phone speaking with the British Prime Minister.  And
yesterday, I spoke with all the members of the EU.  So — but I haven’t
spoken to those two.

Q    Can you comment on the new Georgia election law, Mr. President?

THE PRESIDENT:  Say again?

Q    The new Georgia election law.

THE PRESIDENT:  It’s an atrocity.  The idea — if you want any indication
that it has nothing to do with fairness, nothing to do with decency —
they passed a law saying you can’t provide water for people standing in
line while they’re waiting to vote.  You don’t need anything else to
know that this is nothing but punitive design to keep people from
voting.  You can’t provide water for people about to vote?  Give me a
break.
