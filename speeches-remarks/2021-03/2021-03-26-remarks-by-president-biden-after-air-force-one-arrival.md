Delaware Air National Guard Base  
Wilmington, Delaware

Q    On COVID, sir, do you have any theories about the origins of COVID
ahead of the WHO report on the origins of COVID?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  Do I have —  
  
Q    Any theories on the origins of the coronavirus —  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  No — no, I don’t.  I have theories, but I’m not a
scientist.  I’m going to wait until the scientific community makes that
judgment.  
  
Q    You spoke to the British Prime Minister.  What was the conversation
about?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we talked a lot about climate change.  We talked a
lot about the need also for Britain and the United States to — to stand
together and deal with the whole notion of whether or not NATO stands
together, whether we stand united, and whether or not I’d be able to
come, and I hope I can, to the NATO meeting in — I think it’s in late
June.  So we talked about scheduling and when I come over and how we’d
work that out.  
  
Q    Any commitments on either side during the call?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there was full agreement.  One of the things I
suggested to do is — we talked about China and the competition they’re
engaging in in the Belt and Road Initiative.  And I suggested we should
have, essentially, a similar initiative coming from the democratic
states, helping those communities around the world that, in fact, need
help.  
  
Q    What does it mean to have Baby Beau on the plane with you, on Air
Force One?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  It’s really great.  
  
Q    President Biden, you issued strong words about the Georgia voting
bill —  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  Not — not as strong as I was really thinking.  
  
Q    Is there anything the White House can do to protect voting rights
in Georgia?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re working on that right now.  We don’t know
quite exactly what we can do at this point.  The Justice Department is
taking a look as well.  
  
Q    Mr. President, how does the voting issue affect your thinking on
the filibuster?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, look, we’ll see.  The question is whether or not —
you know, you have to have 50 votes — 51 votes to have to win to be able
to move the filibuster and any change in the filibuster.  And right now,
that doesn’t exist.  That doesn’t exist.  
  
So, you know, look, I — the only thing I’ve been relatively good at in
my long career in the Senate is figuring out when to move and when not
to move.  We got to have the votes.  
  
Q    (Inaudible) gun control?  
  
Q    Can we expect any gun control executive orders?     
  
THE PRESIDENT:  Pardon me?  
  
Q    Can we expect any gun control executive orders soon?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re looking at that right now.  We’re looking at
what kind of authority I have relative to imported weapons, as well as
whether or not I have any authority to — these new weapons that are
being made by 3D equipment that aren’t registered as guns at all, there
may be some latitude there as well.  
  
Q    On the Suez Canal, sir: What offer has the DOD, has the Pentagon
made to help Egypt?  Can you say?  What all can the U.S. do to
assist?     
  
THE PRESIDENT:  We have equipment and capacity that most countries don’t
have, and we’re seeing what we can do — what help we can be.  
  
Thank you.
