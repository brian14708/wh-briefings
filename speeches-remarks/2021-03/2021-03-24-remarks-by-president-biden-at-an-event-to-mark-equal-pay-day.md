South Court Auditorium

5:09 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, good afternoon, everyone.  Megan and Margaret,
thank you.  Thank you for being here.  And to all your teammates
virtually, thank you as well.  I’m an unadulterated fan.  Not a joke. 
Not a joke.   
   
And both of you and your entire team — I’m not joking — have inspired
our daughters and our granddaughters, who, I might add, are all really
good athletes: one two-time All-State; my niece, All-American.  There’s
a whole lot of talent in the Biden family athletics, almost all on the
women’s side of the equation.  But I — really, thank you for what you’ve
done.  
   
You know, you’re all heroes for so many people — and that’s not
hyperbole to suggest that — on and off the field.  You know, and it
matters that you lent your voice to the issues and the issue of fair pay
and decency for so many years.   
   
Megan, it’s hard to believe it was almost a year ago that we met
virtually during the campaign.  I said it last April, when we spoke, and
I’ll say it again: The fact that Jill and I get to talk with you and
your teammates makes us heroes with our granddaughters.  Not a joke.  I
went so far as I took — they might may say — a privilege of getting our
granddaughter Maisy, who is a rising junior at the University of
Pennsylvania — up taking a course right now — I got her on the phone so
she — all she wanted to do was meet both of these women and meet them
virtually.  And she’s a soccer player.   
   
And as Jill mentioned, seeing you win the World Cup back in 2015, that
was an incredible moment for our family and our country.  And I didn’t
bore you with all the pictures we still have walking on the field —
(laughter) — no, I’m serious — and off the field.  You all made me a
hero with my granddaughters.   
   
And the reason we’re here today is because it’s Equal Pay Day, which has
been around for 25 years.  It was declared 25 years ago — Equal Pay Day
— though not enough people know about that and — and they — as they
should.  
   
You know, it’s a day that measures how much longer women typically have
to work to match what men make in a single year.  That’s what Jill was
talking about.  And it’s shocking when you look at the numbers.   
   
Twelve years ago, when President Obama and I came into office, the very
first law we enacted was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, and Lilly was
standing at our side.   
   
This year — that year, I should say, in 2009, we marked — Equal Pay Day
occurred in late April.  By late April, women will have made, at that
time, on average, what men make in 12 months.  They had to go all the
way through January, February, March, and April to catch up.  That meant
that it took women until April of 2009 to earn the same amount of money
that a man made in all of 2008.   
   
Another way to look at it is, it took more than 15 months for a woman to
earn the same amount that a man made in 12.  And more than three extra
months — it’s more than that.  And it’s even longer for women of color. 
And it’s wrong.   
   
This year, Equal Pay Day falls in late March, which is a little bit
better, but not much — from late April to late March.  And, frankly, we
shouldn’t be satisfied until Equal Pay Day is no longer even necessary
to mention at all.   
   
The reality though is that in nearly every job — more than 90 percent of
the occupations — women still earn less than men: 82 cents on the dollar
on average.  For AAPI women, it’s 87 cents for every dollar a white man
earns.  For Black women, it’s 63 cents.  For Native American women, it’s
60 cents.  For Hispanic women, it’s 55 cents.   
   
It doesn’t matter if you’re an electrician, an accountant, or part of
the best damn soccer team in the world, the pay gap is real.  And this
team is living proof that you can be the very best at what you do and
still have to fight for equal pay.  
   
You know, as Jill mentioned, this pandemic has only exacerbated the
problem.  Women are on the frontlines as essential workers, particularly
women of color, in hospitals, grocery stores, childcare facilities,
farms, factories, but they’re still earning less.   
   
More than 2 million women have dropped out of the workforce since the
pandemic started — 2 million.  And now we’re at the lowest rate of women
participation in the labor force that we’ve been in more than 30 years. 
Let me say it again: The lowest — the lowest percent of women in the
workforce — had to go back 30 years to get to where we are today.  
   
A lot of that is because so much extra weight of caregiving and
responsibility is falling on their shoulders.  It causes women to miss
work, cut hours, and leave their jobs and care for their children and
aging loved ones.  That in and of itself sows some discrimination.  How
many men are staying home and doing it, and the woman’s staying in the
workforce?  
   
It undermines financial security.  And, by the way, it’s hard.  I was a
single parent with two children after my first wife and daughter were
killed well over 40 years ago.  And the fact of the matter is, I was a
U.S. senator.  I was 29 years old.  I was making $42,000 a year, and I
couldn’t afford help to take care of my kids while I worked.  Thankful-
— thankfully, my mother — my sister gave up her job.  My brother — they
helped me raise my kids.   
   
It undermines financial security for women and families.  It hurts our
entire economy when we lose the talent and hard work of so many
people.  
   
In the American Rescue Plan you’ve heard so much about that we just
passed, it was designed to address this core challenge.  It puts money
directly into the pockets of people who need it the most: $1,400 checks
for 85 percent of American households.  The hundredth million check has
been deposited as of today, and many more are on the way.   
   
It also expanded the Child Care Tax Credit. And here’s what that means,
for those who don’t know: Right now, if you file for federal income tax,
you get up to a $2,000 credit for each child.  But if you need help the
most, if you’re making a minimum wage job and you don’t have to — you
don’t make enough to pay federal income tax, then you don’t get this
credit.   
   
But because of the American Rescue Plan we passed, if you have two
children under the age of six, for example, and you’re making $7.25 an
hour — which is the minimum wage that so many people are making — you’ll
get a check for $3,600 per child or $7,200.  Roughly, you get $500 a
month mailed to you by the federal government.  That’s life-changing.   
   
The American Rescue Plan is going to cut poverty across the board in
America by about 31 percent.  And that’s a significant lift up for
women.  The law provides $360 billion for funding state and local
governments.  What that means is that’s going to prevent layoffs on jobs
often held by women — nurses, teachers, healthcare workers, home
healthcare aides — because the states have to balance their budget,
because if they can’t — because of the lack of income coming in without
the help from the federal government — they’ll have to lay off those
essential workers.  
   
And the law also includes $130 billion to reopen our schools safely; $40
billion for — invest in childcare investments; $160 billion to get the
country vaccinated and beat this pandemic.  All this is going to give
millions of women, including many moms and dads too, the freedom to
rejoin the workforce and make the career choices that are best for them
and their families.  
   
But there’s so much more we need to do.  So much more.  We need the
Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act — the bill to remove
loopholes in the law allowing employers to justify gender pay
disparities.  It would help hold employers accountable for systemic pay
discrimination.  It would help level the playing field for women and
people of color by making it easier for workers to challenge the
disparities as a group.  It would increase pay transparency.   
   
By that, I mean, you know, there’s a whole range of American
corporations — if you sign the Fortune 500 — you sign up with them, you
cannot reveal — it says in your contract you cannot reveal your salary
to another employee.  Why is that?  They don’t want me sitting there
saying, “Well, I’m making $60,000.”  And the woman doing the same job,
and she looks and said, “You’re making 60?  I’m making 40.”  They
actually try to hide it.  That’s what I mean by transparency.   
   
Some employers may not allow you to know exactly, like I said, how much
the person sitting next to you is making.  Some may even discipline you
for asking that.  That has to change.   
   
Too often, secrecy is part of the problem.  We know information is
power.  You can’t solve the problem if you don’t know you’re not getting
paid fairly.   
   
My administration is going to fight for equal pay — for it to become a
reality for all women.  It’s about justice.  It’s about fairness.  It’s
about living up to our values and who we are as a nation.  Equal pay
makes all of us stronger.  
   
It’s not just women who care about this.  I’ve been around the country. 
I’ve gone right into union halls and asked the men in the room, “How
many of you — how would you feel if your wife or your sister didn’t earn
the same amount of money as the man doing the same job next to you?” 
And you hear them say — you hear them respond they don’t like it.  Why? 
When your spouse or your sister is making the same amount of money the
man she’s standing next is making, it means that when the hot water
heater breaks, you can replace it.  You can get four new tires on the
car.  It means everybody’s life is made better in that family.   
   
Let me close with this: that to come out of this crisis and build back
better, we need to erase the gender pay gap by ensuring that women have
access to good-paying jobs; by raising wages for working folks and
fighting for the right to organize and collectively bargain, because we
know unions lift women’s wages even more than they lift men’s; and by
investing our care — in our care infrastructure — our care
infrastructure — in paid leave, childcare, homecare — so that people can
care for their families and also go to work.   
   
There’s a lot to do, but together we can ensure that our daughters have
all the same rights and opportunities as our sons.  And if we’re able to
do this, it’ll be transformational for our nation.  That’s the goal. 
That’s what this is all about.  That’s what this team, all of you, are
all about.  
   
Let me make one more point.  You know, I’ve told my daughters,
granddaughters from the time they got old enough to understand what I
was saying — and I mean it: There’s not a single thing a man can do that
a woman can’t do as well or better.  Not a single thing.   
   
I was among the first senators ever to appoint a woman to the Naval
Academy.  I was just able to, as President of the United States, appoint
two women as four-star generals, who now are combatant commanders. 
Three out of the six are combatant commanders, and they’re women. 
Women.  There are so many, some in the Congress, who were jet fighter
pilots flying at twice the speed of sound.  So many doing so much.   
   
But this soccer team, America’s team, has done more to lift up people’s
sense of who they can be, particularly young girls and women, above
anything that’s been done.   
   
So, as President of the United States, I thank you.  I thank you for the
example you’ve set and for your willingness to say, “Look, we’re not
going to take it anymore.  We’re not going to take it.”  Figuratively
speaking, “You can take my trophies, but you can’t take my pride.”   
   
As I said, my dad used to say, “Joey, a job is…” — when he lost his job
and had to get another one.  We had to move.  He’d say, “You know, Joey,
a job is about a lot more than a paycheck.  It’s about your dignity. 
It’s about respect.  It’s about your sense of yourself and your
self-worth.  It’s about your place in the community.”  That’s what this
is all about, and that’s why you guys are leading the way.   
   
And now it’s my great pleasure and honor — I’d like you to stand next to
me, if you would, while I sign a proclamation making Equal Pay Day —
naming it — an expression of our commitment to seek equal pay as we
build back better and restore this economic growth.   
   
Thank you, folks.  I’m going to sign it now.  Come on over here.   
   
The title of the proclamation is “National Equal Pay Day 2021.”  
   
THE FIRST LADY:  You can move up.  (Laughter.)  
   
MS. RAPINOE:  I’m checking.  Just making sure it says what it says. 
(Laughter.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s what it says.   
   
MS. RAPINOE:  I know.  Joseph R. Biden.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Junior.  (Laughter.)  
   
MS. RAPINOE:  Junior.  Junior.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  My dad.  He was a fine man.   
   
It says “Equal pay is a reminder of the work that still remains to
advance equal — equality and ensure that all Americans have the
opportunity to reach their full potential.”  Like you guys.  
   
THE FIRST LADY:  Thank you.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thanks, everybody.  
   
THE FIRST LADY:  Thank you.
