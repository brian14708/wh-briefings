title: "Statement by President\_Biden on the Attack on the Right to Vote in\_Georgia"
---
 
More Americans voted in the 2020 elections than any election in our
nation’s history. In Georgia we saw this most historic demonstration of
the power of the vote twice – in November and then again in the runoff
election for the U.S. Senate seats in January. Recount after recount and
court case after court case upheld the integrity and outcome of a
clearly free, fair, and secure democratic process.

Yet instead of celebrating the rights of all Georgians to vote or
winning campaigns on the merits of their ideas, Republicans in the state
instead rushed through an un-American law to deny people the right to
vote. This law, like so many others being pursued by Republicans in
statehouses across the country is a blatant attack on the Constitution
and good conscience. Among the outrageous parts of this new state law,
it ends voting hours early so working people can’t cast their vote after
their shift is over. It adds rigid restrictions on casting absentee
ballots that will effectively deny the right to vote to countless
voters. And it makes it a crime to provide water to voters while they
wait in line – lines Republican officials themselves have created by
reducing the number of polling sites across the state,
disproportionately in Black neighborhoods.

This is Jim Crow in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century. It must end. We have a
moral and Constitutional obligation to act. I once again urge Congress
to pass the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights
Advancement Act to make it easier for all eligible Americans access the
ballot box and prevent attacks on the sacred right to vote.

And I will take my case to the American people – including Republicans
who joined the broadest coalition of voters ever in this past election
to put country before party.

If you have the best ideas, you have nothing to hide. Let the people
vote.
