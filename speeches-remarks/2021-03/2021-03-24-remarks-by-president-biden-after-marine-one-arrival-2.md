Q    Can Americans feel confident in the AstraZeneca vaccine? 

THE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible) can’t hear a word you’re saying.

Q    Can Americans feel confident in the AstraZeneca vaccine?

THE PRESIDENT:  I haven’t gotten the final report today.  We haven’t
used it at all.  We have it available, but we haven’t used it.  And I
don’t know what’s — I’ve been gone all day.  I don’t know what’s
happened today. 

Q    Have you spoken to Dr. Fauci about it?

THE PRESIDENT:  Pardon me?

Q    Have you spoken to Dr. Fauci about it?

THE PRESIDENT:  Not as of today.  No, I haven’t.  Thank you.

Q    Will you — will you increase the number of doses you’re going to
give Mexicans and Canadians? 

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, that — that depends on how — what is finally
approved.  Okay?  Thank you. 

Q    On North Korea, sir: Do you consider that to be a real provocation
by North Korea — the missile launch?

THE PRESIDENT:  No.  According to the Defense Department, it’s business
as usual.  There’s no new — there’s no new wrinkle in what they did.

Q    Does it affect diplomacy at all?

THE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)
