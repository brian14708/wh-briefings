  \ & Coretta Scott King Unity\_Breakfast"

Good morning to everyone joining in this unity breakfast named after Dr.
and Mrs. King and to commemorate the anniversary of the march in
Selma.  
   
I know this is the first commemoration of Bloody Sunday without Reverend
C.T. Vivian,  
Reverend Joseph Lowery, and Congressman John Lewis. Preachers of the
social gospel. Architects of the ‘Beloved Community,’ they built not
only with words but with action. And reminders that in our lifetime, for
Black Americans, the fundamental right to vote has been denied by white
supremacy hiding both behind white hoods and in plain sight in state
houses and courtrooms.  
   
Yet those torches and burning crosses, the batons, tear gas, fire hoses,
attack dogs, and unfair laws and trials could not stop progress. The
blood of John Lewis and hundreds of other brave and righteous souls that
was spilled in Selma, on this Sunday in 1965 sanctified a noble
struggle.  
   
And when the country saw those images that night, America was forced to
confront the denial of democracy — the fierce urgency of justice.  
   
Congress passed the Voting Rights Act a few months later, and President
Johnson signed it into law.  
   
The legacy of the march in Selma is that while nothing can stop a free
people from exercising  
their most sacred power as a citizen, there are those who will do
everything they can to take that power away.  
   
The Voting Rights Act began to dismantle barriers to voting and to make
our elections more fair, free, and representative.  
   
I was always proud to lead the efforts to reauthorize it over the years
as a U.S. Senator in the Judiciary Committee. But at the same time,
Republicans at every level have chipped away at it.  
   
Then in 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act,
holding that times have changed and blatant voter discrimination was
rare, contrary to the assault that was taking place on the ground. The
late Justice Ginsburg wrote that the decision was like “*throwing away
your umbrella in a rainstorm*.” Today, we have a hail storm, not a rain
storm.  
   
And in 2020, our very democracy on the line, even in the midst of a
pandemic, more Americans voted than ever before. Multiple recounts in
states and decisions in more than 60 courts – from judges appointed by
my predecessor, including at the Supreme Court – upheld the integrity of
this historic election.  
   
Yet instead of celebrating this powerful demonstration of voting – we
have seen an unprecedented insurrection in our Capitol and a brutal
attack on our democracy on January 6<sup>th</sup>. A never before seen
effort to ignore, undermine, and undo the will of the people.  
   
And to think that it’s been followed by an all-out assault on the right
to vote in state legislatures all across the country happening right
now. During the current legislative session, elected officials in 43
states have already introduced more than 250 bills to make it harder for
Americans to vote. We cannot let them succeed.  
   
Last week, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1, the For the
People Act of 2021. This is a landmark piece of legislation that is
urgently needed to protect the right to vote, the integrity of our
elections, and to repair and strengthen our democracy. I hope the Senate
does its work so that I can sign it into law.  
   
I also urge Congress to fully restore the Voting Rights Act, named in
John Lewis’ honor.  
   
Today, on the anniversary of Bloody Sunday, I am signing an executive
order to make it easier for eligible voters to register to vote and
improve access to voting. Every eligible voter should be able to vote
and have that vote counted. If you have the best ideas, you have nothing
to hide. Let the people vote.  
   
I’ll close with this – a few days before he passed, Jill and I spoke
with John, Congressman Lewis.  
   
But instead of answering our concerns about him, “how are you doing,
John,” he asked us to stay focused on the work left undone to heal and
to unite this nation around what it means to be an American.  
   
That’s the God’s truth. John wouldn’t talk about his pending death or
his concerns. He said we just got to get this done.  
   
That we are all created equal. That we all deserve to be treated
equally.  
   
On this day of reflection, please, let’s stay focused on the work
ahead.  
   
Let’s remember all those who came before us as a bridge to our history
so we do not forget its pain, and as a bridge to our future so we never
lose our hope.  
   
May God bless their memory. May God bless you all.
