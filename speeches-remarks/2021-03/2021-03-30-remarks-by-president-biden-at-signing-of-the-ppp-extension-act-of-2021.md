Oval Office

2:11 P.M. EDT

THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everyone.  How are you?  I want to thank
Administrator Guzman, who’s running the show for us.  And we’re really
starting to move here. 

And the Vice President, thank you — 

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Of course. 

THE PRESIDENT:  — for your focus on small business. 

We’re pushing lenders to raise their game and provide more help to small
— many small businesses.  As you know, particularly Hispanic, as well as
African American small businesses are just out of business because they
got bypassed the first time around.

Today, I’m proud to sign the extension, which I’m going to do in a
second, of the Paycheck Protection Program.  It is a bipartisan
accomplishment. 

Nearly 90,000 business owners are still in line, and there’s money
left.  Without somebody signing this bill today, there are hundreds of
thousands of people who could lose their jobs, and small and family
businesses that might close forever.  And, as you know, small business
is the backbone of our economy, representing almost 50 percent of all
the employees in America.

And I want to thank Senators Cardin, Shaheen, Rubio, and Collins for
their work in the Senate — it was a bipartisan effort — and Young Kim
and Velazquez, as well as Luetkemeyer for their work in the House to
make sure this happened.

And in the last two months, we’ve approved forgivable loans for three
thousand — excuse me, three million six hundred \[sic\] small businesses
— -six hundred thousand small businesses.  And three million three
hundred \[thousand\] of those small businesses were less than — higher —
had fewer than 20 employees, which is the backbone of most of the
communities.

So with that, I’m going to sign this.  And thank you all for coming. 

(The bill is signed.)

Thanks, folks.  Enjoy yourselves.
