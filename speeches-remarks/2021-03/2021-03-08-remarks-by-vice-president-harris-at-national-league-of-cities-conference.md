THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Council Member Kathy Maness, for that
kind introduction and the spirit behind it.  And to Mayor Clarence
Anthony, the NLC Board and staff members, local leaders: It is truly an
honor to join with you today.   
   
And, of course, as Kathy said, we gather at the start of an important
week for our country.  Yes, we are honoring the women of our country and
the world, but this is also a week for our country that could mark a
real turning point in our fight against COVID-19.   
   
Last weekend, as you know, the House of Representatives passed our
American Rescue Plan.  It is a plan that will provide immediate relief
to America’s cities, towns, and villages, and directly to the American
people.   
   
This past weekend, the Senate advanced this landmark legislation.  And
very soon, the President of the United States, Joe Biden, will sign the
American Rescue Plan into law.   
   
So, for a year now, we have faced this crisis of almost immeasurable
proportions, impacting the health of our communities, the livelihood of
our businesses, and the education of our children.  Through it all,
local leaders — you — have been in the thick of it.  You are the ones
who get called when there aren’t enough vaccine doses to go around. 
You’re the ones fighting to make sure first responders can keep their
jobs.  You are working with teachers and parents to get schools reopened
safely.  You’re working with small businesses to keep their doors open
and working at food distribution sites, in what remains of your spare
time.   
   
Being a local leader has always been a 24/7 job.  And this year, I know,
has tested the limits.  And still, you keep getting up every morning and
working to make things better.   
   
So, on behalf of myself and President Biden — who, I think you all know,
both of us served as local leaders — we thank you.  We thank you.  We
thank you.   
   
When the President and I were preparing to take office, we knew what you
were up against.  We knew we needed to be ready to go on day one, so we
started working with you to put a plan in place to rescue our nation
from this pandemic.   
   
I’m proud to report that we’ve made incredible progress.  More than 80
million vaccines have now been administered.  Last week, 18 million
doses were sent to states, to pharmacies, and community health centers. 
Merck and Johnson & Johnson — competitors before now — are teaming up to
speed up manufacturing, which means that we should have a full vaccine
supply for adults by the end of May.   
   
And to get shots in arms more quickly, we’ve opened new vaccination
centers in a number of places: in the place of my birth, Oakland,
California; in Los Angeles; in Houston; in Dallas; in Arlington, Tampa,
Orlando, Jacksonville, Brooklyn, Queens, and Upstate New York.  And one
opened in Philadelphia last week, others will open in Chicago and
Greensboro this week, and another two are coming to Atlanta and
Cleveland soon.  So, as you know, we’ve all been busy.   
   
And we’re doing this — all of this — as I’ve mentioned, as we advance
our American Rescue Plan.  This plan is big, and it is bold, and it will
help us beat this virus and build back our economy.   
   
With this plan, we will scale up our vaccination program, get relief to
the small businesses that fill your main streets, and get your schools
safely reopened.  The bill provides targeted support for as many as
19,000 cities, towns, and villages.   
   
And we know many of you are dealing with budget shortfalls as revenues
are down and, of course, expenses are up.  As a result, vital services
have been cut — and I know you didn’t want to — and we’ve lost more than
1.3 million state and local government jobs in just the past year.   
   
In the aftermath of the Great Recession, these kinds of cuts put a
significant drag on our economic recovery.  And, guys, we can’t let that
happen again.  The American Rescue Plan will also get $1,400 checks in
the pockets of people who need them most, and a $3,000 tax credit per
child.   
 

Think about it: This plan will actually lift one in three black and
Latino Americans who are living in poverty and lift them out of
poverty.  We will also lift half of America’s children who are living in
poverty out of poverty.  I mean, just think about that: Half of the
children in our country who are living in poverty won’t be.  
  
So the American Rescue Plan, for that and so many other reasons, is, we
are happy to say, incredibly popular.  And the support for it is broad
and it is bipartisan.  Three in four Americans support the bill. 
Democratic and Republican mayors and local leaders have endorsed it. 
And of close — of course, so has the National League of Cities, and
thank you for that.   
  
And think about it: Two mayors just most recently — a Republican from
Miami and a Democrat from St. Petersburg — wrote an op-ed about why they
support the plan.  And they said in the op-ed, quote, “Our people need
help.”  And as the President would say, “Help is on the way.”   
  
Today, the American Rescue Plan is very close to becoming the law of the
land.  And now we need to help ensure that relief is distributed
equitably — equitably.  And that means we need to acknowledge, as so
many of us do — we need to acknowledge the pandemic has made worse the
fissures and the flaws and failures that already existed in our systems
and in our structures.  We’ve seen that race and place matter a lot in
how well protected a person is from the virus or not.  And race and
place have played a role in access to services.   
  
So one way we’re addressing this is with our COVID-19 Health Equity Task
Force.  This task force stemmed from a bill I introduced in the United
States Senate to have a dedicated group of experts who report on the
disparities that exist in the allocation of resources.  The task force
is required to make recommendations on how to solve for those problems. 
And local leaders are vital — you are vital to the solution.   
  
So today, we have a big announcement, and we’re actually making it right
here with you because it will have a direct impact on the communities
that you serve: Our administration will offer $250 million in grants for
localities to partner with community organizations on health literacy. 
Our goal is to provide underserved communities with the information they
need to stay safe and to get vaccinated.   
  
And remember, information and education, of course, saves lives.  When
folks have the information and the education, they have the — the tools
that equip them to take care of themselves and their family.   
  
We expect to fund 30 projects in urban communities and 43 projects in
rural communities for two years.  And I’m going to give you some
information on how you can — can apply and get more.  And that is to
apply through April 20th at — and I’m going to give you a website —
MinorityHealth.HHS.Gov.  And we’ll follow up and get it for you in
writing.   
  
But I ask the friends here: Please do work with us to put equity at the
center of our collective response to identify those individuals and
communities who have been overlooked, and to connect them with the
resources that are available, and to connect with them in a way that we
renew and, in some cases, establish trust between community and those
folks who are elected to serve those communities.   
  
And also, we’ve got a Child Tax Credit coming that they can take
advantage of, so please tell them about it.  And tell them about the
Paycheck Protection Program and the loans there for small businesses. 
Please tell your folks about how to get vaccinated at pharmacies and
community health centers and mobile units.  And please continue to tell
everyone you know to wear a mask.   
  
And this brings me to my final point: The American people will continue
to look to you as much as they look to me or the President.  Because of
your tireless efforts, because they know they can rely on you, they will
continue to look to you for answers and for action and for comfort and
for hope.   
  
And I know it’s not an easy job, but what you do, especially at this
moment of crisis, couldn’t be more important.  So thank you again for
all you do.  I know it takes personal sacrifice and sleepless nights,
but know that the President and I are working right alongside you.   
  
So may God bless you.  And may God bless America.  Thank you all.
