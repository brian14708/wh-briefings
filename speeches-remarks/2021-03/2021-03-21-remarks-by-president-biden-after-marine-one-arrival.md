South Lawn

Q    Are you thinking of going to the border?

THE PRESIDENT:  At some point, I will.  Yes.

Q    Do you want to see firsthand what’s going on in those facilities?

THE PRESIDENT:  I know what’s going on in those facilities.

Q    Why do you think the message to the migrants, telling them to stay
home and don’t come now — why do you think that hasn’t resonated yet? 
What more can be done, sir?

THE PRESIDENT:  A lot more.  We’re in the process of doing it now,
including making sure that we reestablish what existed before, which was
they can stay in place and make their case from their home country.

Thank you.
