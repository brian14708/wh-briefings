East Room

11:36 A.M. EST  
   
THE FIRST LADY:  You’re so quiet.  It’s like a classroom.  (Laughter and
applause.)   
   
So, in the intermission, were you all, like, dancing and everything? 
(Laughter.)  Get a little movement.  You know, you’ve been sitting for a
while.  
   
So, thank you for standing.  But, you know, I’m glad you get a little —
like you said, Robin, a little movement, right?  It’s — that’s what it’s
all about.  
   
So — oh, please sit down.  Please.  (Laughter.)  If you feel all
stretched out by now.  
   
So, before I begin, I just want to say I’m so glad that you got to come
here today because the White House is decorated.  (Applause.)  And the
theme this year is “Peace and Light.”  So, I hope that you all feel that
sense of, you know, peace and light and that, just for a moment, when
you leave here today, that you feel — I don’t know — a little — a sense
of joy, because I think we all need, like, this — you know, we all need
to feel joy now during this — this time of the season, during — just
during this time.   
   
So, anyway — (laughter) — okay.  Now I’ll start.  You’re all reading
into that.  (Laughter.)   
   
Anyway, for decades, for centuries even, at dinner tables and in waiting
rooms, in whispered conversations, you know, when we meet our friends
for coffee, women have been talking to each other about our health. 
Isn’t that true?  
   
AUDIENCE:  Yes.  
   
THE FIRST LADY:  So, today, we brought that conversation to the White
House.  (Applause.)  Today, we are saying to women everywhere: We hear
you, and we will get you the answers you need.  
   
So, thank you for joining us for the White House Conference on Women’s
Health Research.  
   
The United States has the best health research in the world, yet women’s
health is understudied and research is underfunded.  And so many of you
have said this.  And the United States economy loses $1.8 billion in
working time every year to menopause symptoms that upend women’s
lives.  
   
And that’s what Maria Shriver and I talked about on that Saturday
afternoon in April last year.  So, Maria keeps this quote next to her
phone — you have a stationary phone?  (Laughter.)   
   
MS. SHRIVER:  (Inaudible.)  (Laughter.)  
   
THE FIRST LADY:  — in her office, and it says, “Why go to the moon?” 
And your uncle, President Kennedy, asked, “We choose to go to the moon
in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy,
because they are hard.”  
   
So, Maria, thank you for carrying on that mission, pushing for
breakthroughs that are never easy but possible.  Thank you. 
(Applause.)   
   
So, a little more than a year ago, President Biden launched — thank you,
Joe — (laughter) — the first-ever White House Initiative on Women’s
Health Research, building on the foundation of decades of work in
women’s health from many of you in this room.  
   
And Carolyn made sure yesterday, as we were doing speech prep, that I
understood — she said, “Jill, you know, I know that we’re doing this
now, but there are some women” — like Carolyn — “who’s been doing this
research forever and ever and ever.”  And I just want you — to say we —
we recognize that.  So — (applause).  
   
So, it — you heard from Carolyn, you know, our incredible — and our
incredible team here at the White House who’s ensured that
government-funded research, you know — and they will include women from
the beginning.  
   
And that means designing studies and separating the data, which everyone
has said, and reporting findings to create treatments specifically for
women and for we- — men.  I mean, we’re not going to leave you guys
out.  (Laughter.)  
   
And we’ve invested nearly $1 billion in this research on women’s
health.  (Applause.)  
   
So, a- — over this past year, I’ve traveled around the country, and I
have met, honestly, some really incredible researchers.  And I’ve been
to universities and the New York Stock Exchange to bring people together
and create connections across industries.   
   
And the women of this country are paying attention.  Researchers and
business leaders are too.   
   
So, we brought all of you into this room to elevate all this
information: discoveries that will change how we treat menopause
symptoms — we’ve talked about this all this morning; research that uses
genetics to find the cause of extreme morning sickness.  And I heard
this a couple weeks ago, and I was particularly interested because my
own granddaughter was going through the same thing — because we’re going
to be great-grandparents.  (Applause.)  (Laughs.)  
   
So, funders and founders who are seeing the market for women’s health
products triple, advocates who are making sure that women know that
solutions are at our fingertips if we just keep fighting for them.  
   
Together, we’ve laid down a new line, a marker of our progress toward
closing the gaps in women’s health.  Everything that you’ve heard today
— and hasn’t it been, like, so informative and fascinating?  I mean, I
love these forums because I always learn something new.  I just — you
know, it’s just so inspiring.  Because this is our new normal.   
   
And today isn’t the finish line; it’s the starting point.  We — all of
us, we have built the momentum.  Now it’s up to us to make it
unstoppable.  
   
It has been the honor of my life to serve as your first lady and to join
you in this work, but my work doesn’t stop in January when Joe and I
leave this house.  I will keep building alliances, like the ones that
brought us here today, and I will keep pushing for funding for
innovative research.  (Applause.)  (Laughs.)  
   
So, join me.  Be the researcher who makes sure that each proposal you
work on considers women from the beginning.  Be the investor who
searches for the next breakthrough product <s>of</s> \[or\] treatment. 
Be the voice in every space, from boardrooms to classrooms to
laboratories, who asks, “What are we doing to advance women’s health?”  
   
Let’s make a promise to all those women out there right now, sitting in
a parking lot somewhere, in a doc- — after a doctor’s appointment,
wondering why you’re not being heard — so, maybe feeling, you know, like
you’re all alone.  
   
And — well, I’ll just have to stop here for one second.  I did hear
during that little intermission thing — like, we’re not putting our
doctors down — right? — so, some doc ba- — in the back said, “You know,
it sounds like you’re putting the docs down.”  We’re not putting the
docs down.  I don’t want you to feel that way.  That, you know — but I
think the docs are joining us and saying, “Hey, we want the answers.” 
So, I just want to make that 100 percent clear.  
   
So, the White House, all of us here, we will keep fighting for you until
your worries turn into answers, your symptoms into solutions.  Until
women everywhere benefit from the lifesaving and world-changing research
that we know is possible.   
   
A new future can ring out from this conference, one that — one that
answers the call from women who have been waiting for too long.  Let
this be the moment that we push harder, the moment that people say
changed the world of women’s health forever.   
   
Thank you.  (Applause.)  (Laughs.)  Thank you.  Thank you. 
(Applause.)   
   
Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Please.  
   
So, I’m so grateful to have a president who — (laughs) — who heard us —
(laughter) — and took action quickly.  So, without Joe, really, this
wouldn’t have been made possible.  And that’s the power of someone who
understands how to make things happen in government — because God knows,
Joe, you’ve been for — what? — 50 years.  (Laughter.)  (The president
makes the sign of the cross.)   
   
So, someone who has fundamentally shifted how our nat- — nation
approaches women’s health research.  
   
So, please welcome my husband, your president and champion, I think, of
all of us.  So, my husband, Joe Biden.  Come on, Joe.  (Applause.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  (Applause.)   
   
Thank God she said “yes” the fifth time I asked her to marry me. 
(Laughter.)   
   
Please have a seat.   
   
You know, I — as they used to say in the Senate, a point of personal
privilege: I — when — no man deserves one great love, let alone two. 
When I was introduced to Jill, my younger brother — my youngest brother
said, “You’ll love her; she hates politics.”  (Laughter.)   
   
Well, look, I — hello, everyone.  My name is Joe Biden; I’m Jill Biden’s
husband.  (Laughter.)  Let’s be honest, we wouldn’t be here today
without Jill.   
   
Across our administration and across Congress, across the country, the
work we’re doing on women’s health research is some of the most
important work this administration has ever done.  
   
And I’ve always believed that our nation is at its best when we — when
we plumb the endless possibilities that exist for all our women and
girls.  And that includes their health.  
   
Women on- — are half our population, to state the obvious.  But like
Jill said, for too long, they’ve been underrepresented when it comes to
health research.  And that’s real.   
   
You know, that’s why, over a year ago, we launched the first-ever White
House Initiative on Women’s Health Research.  And the goal was to
fundamentally change and improve how we approach and invest in women’s
health research — we weren’t doing enough of it — and to pioneer the
next generation of scientific research and discoveries that are going to
improve care for — women receive all across the country.  
   
Because the fact is the health of our moms and grandmothers, sisters and
daughters, friends and colleagues affects not just women’s well-being
but the prosperity of the entire nation.  And that’s a fact.  We haven’t
gotten that through to the other team yet.  (Laughter.)  No — no, I mean
it, across the board.  Anyway, I won’t get into that.  (Laughter.)  
   
But that’s why, in my State of the Union address this year, I called on
Congress to invest $12 billion in women’s health research to benefit
millions of lives — (applause) — and families and communities all across
America.  
   
Folks, but my administration wasn’t going to wait for Congress to secure
the funding.  We looked for other ways to prioritize women’s health with
existing dollars that are already in the government and to get important
work started.  
   
And I knew where to start: Rosa DeLauro.  (Applause.)  Rosa, stand up. 
I’m not joking.  As they say in souther- — you all think I’m kidding. 
I’m not kidding.  (Laughter.)  She’s incredible.  Every important thing
I’ve ever tried to get done that no one paid attention to, you were
there for me.  I mean it sincerely.  You’re the best, Rosa.  What you
did on Child Tax Credit — I mean, across the board.   
   
And, folks, women’s health is — is a — something that — that matters so,
so very much.  Along with members that are here today, you — she’s going
to keep this effort going to — when we leave.  When we leave — when Jill
and I leave.  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Fight like hell.  (Laughter.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re going to fight like hell.  And w- — I — I’m
the — we’re — we’re no longer going to be president and first lady, but
we’re not going away.  (Laughter.)  And so — (applause).  
   
Along with members here, like <s>Diane</s> \[Diana\] and Lauren.  Where
— where is <s>Diane</s> \[Diana\]?   
   
REPRESENTATIVE DEGETTE:  Right here.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  There you go.  Stand up, kiddo.  Let them see you. 
(Applause.)  
   
And, Lauren, thank you.   
   
So, I’m so proud that, to date, we’ve secured $1 billion so far in
women’s health research from different government agencies.  
   
You know, our new agency, ARPA-H, which is patterned after Advanced —
it’s called Advanced Research Projects and Agencies for Health — is
based on DARPA, which is the Defense Department program for Advanced
Research and Projects Agency.  That drove breakthroughs — the Defense
Department broke breakthroughs in everything from the Internet to GPS. 
It had a big budget for doing everything else, but it also had this
specific individual budget.   
   
And ARPA-H does for biomedicine what DARPA does for technology, driving
breakthroughs to prevent, detect, and treat diseases, including cancer,
Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and so much more.  We’re using their funding to
drive breakthroughs in women’s health in ovarian cancer and menopause,
in migraines, in high blood pressure for pregnant women.  
   
The National Institute of Health is using their funding to break down
the silos — a lot of silos in government, a lot of silos across the — in
America — to make more progress and do it more quickly.  
   
For example, we know that heart disease is the leading cause of death
for women.  But we don’t know — we don’t know enough about how menopause
may affect heart disease.  And that’s going to change now.  We’re going
to learn so much more.  
   
And the Department of Defense is dedicating funds to research women’s
health issues like arthritis, cancer, chronic fatigue that affect women
in the military, but this research is going to benefit all women — all
women.  
   
Our work doesn’t stop here.  
   
Look, you know, the addition to — in addition to launching the Women’s
Health Research Initiative earlier this year, I signed an executive
order that — directing the most comprehensive set of executive actions
ever taken — ever taken in the history of this country to improve
women’s health issues.  
   
And, look — (applause) — it ensures that women’s health is integrated
and prioritized all across the entire federal government — all research
projects and budget plans, across the entire government.  And it spurs
new research and innovation on a wide range of women’s health needs
throughout their lives.  And it does so much more — so much more.  
   
Folks, there’s literally never been more comprehensive effort from the
federal government to spur innovation in women’s health research in our
entire history.   
   
And thank you, by the way, kiddo.  (Laughter and applause.)  I — no, I
mean it.  (Applause.)  I mean it.  
   
If I can digress for a moment, I — I would — I have been the beneficiary
of a lot of the research that’s been done.  I had a — two cranial
aneurysms.  I had two nine-hour operations.  They took the top of my
head off twice; they couldn’t find a brain the first time. 
(Laughter.)   
   
But all — all kidding aside, I mean the research that’s going on across
the entire world.  I visited every single solitary major health center
in the world — in the world — seven of them.  And, you know, a lot of
wha- — what happens, even in not just women’s research, but, you know,
docs who are great, they walk by the mirror, and they see a Pulitzer
Pri- — a — a Nobel Prize about to be won and — rather than sharing the
data.  But that’s all changing.  That’s all changing.   
   
And this initiative lays the groundwork for discoveries and research for
generations to come.  Mark my words.  And the benefits we gain tomorrow
will happen because we made the decision to do something about them
today — today, now.   
   
And all of you in this room are leading the way, and that’s not
hyperbole.  You really are.  It’s a hell of a com- — combination of
people that make things change.  
   
Let me close with this.  And my daughter, Ashley, sitting here, she runs
a — she works for women — she runs a women’s health shel- — women’s
health center — shelter in Philadelphia.   
   
And — and, you know, this holiday season is a time not for gratitude but
for reflection.  Gratitude is important, but we got to reflect on what’s
going on.   
   
And let me say to you that it’s been an honor of my life to serve as
your president the last four years.  But I’m — and I’m forever
grateful.  I really am.  (Applause.)   
   
But folks, it’s not a joke.  We’re blessed to live in America.  We’re
blessed to live in America.  I’ve been to over 140 countries.  I mean,
but for the grace of God, I could’ve been born a lot of other places. 
Literally the greatest country on Earth, that’s who we are.  But we got
to raise up even more than we are now.  
   
I often say, America can be summed up in one word.  I was on the Tibetan
Plateau with Xi Jinping, and he said, “Can you define America for me?” 
And I — this is all on the record.  I said, “Yes, one word:
possibilities.”   
   
Think about it.  We’re the only nation in the world where people — they
think there’s arrogance in that.  But we’ve never failed to get things
done when we set our mind to it.  It’s all about possibilities. 
Anything is possible.  
   
That’s what the Women’s Realth — Health Research Initiative is all
about: possibilities.  You know, and that’s what this conference is all
about.  That’s what you’re all about.  Researchers, innovators,
investors; businesses, advocates, elected officials; public, private,
and non-profit leaders unleashing the drive and discovery and the talent
and imagination that you have in this room — a spirit of innovation
inherent in who you guys are.   
   
I really mean it.  Think about it.  Turn and look at the people to your
left and right who you know are engaged in this.  It’s all about the
possibilities and belief we can do things, we can change things
fundamentally.     
   
I think inherent in the American con- — conscience is setting a bold
vision and taking concrete steps to make our dreams a reality, holding
on to one more thing that we can never lose: hope — hope, hope, hope. 
Because what we need — we need to raise the expectations of the American
people up.  We got to let them know we haven’t forgotten.  Whether it’s
a business or labor or whether it’s politics, whatever, we haven’t
forgotten.   
   
You — you guys go out there.  You take care of all of these folks. 
Guess what?  How many of them think that we just sort of forgotten?  Why
aren’t we focused?  
   
Because of you and your fearless determination, you’re making real
progress.  You’re really making progress.   
   
There’s still so much more to do.  And we’re going to take all of us to
get it done.  I know it’s a battle.  But I know I have a hell of a lot
of — a hell of an army here.  (Laughter.)   
   
You know, when I look around at all of you here today — and I mean this
sincerely — I know it’s a battle we’re going to win.  We’re going to win
this battle.    
   
We just have to remember who in the hell we are.  We’re the United
States of America.  And there is nothing we’ve ever set our mind to
we’ve been unable to do when we’ve done it together.  It’s not beyond
our capacity, when we work together.  And that’s what you’re all doing:
working together.   
   
And so, I — and I want to close by thanking my wife for Ji- — I mean,
Jill, I tell you.  Like I said, when we got married, my brother said,
“Don’t worry; she doesn’t like politics.”  Well, I tell you what, you
stepped up, kid.  (Laughter.)  You’ve stepped up.  
   
And in case you wonder, when she speaks, I listen.  (Laughter and
applause.)  
   
Thank you all so very, very much.  Let’s get this done.    Thank you. 
(Applause.)
