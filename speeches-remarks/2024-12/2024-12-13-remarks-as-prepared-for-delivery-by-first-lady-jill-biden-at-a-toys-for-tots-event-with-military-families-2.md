The White House

Thank you, Lieutenant General Anderson. Joe and I are so grateful to you
and Lieutenant General Laster for your decades of service and
leadership. Both of you have built inspiring careers guiding troops and
giving back to our communities alongside your amazing Toys for Tots
team.

To the senior spouses who are with us today: through your care and
resolve, you lift up all of our military families. Your service doesn’t
go unnoticed by the Commander-in-Chief. Thank you.

Welcome to the White House!

The festive music we’ve heard today is performed by the President’s Own
Marine Band. Joe and I are grateful to them and to their families for
their service, and for filling the White House with talent and grace.

Each year, we decorate this house for the holidays—and I’m so glad that
all of you can be part of the magic.

Did you see the gingerbread house in the State Dining Room?

This season can be filled with excitement and wonder—with colorful
lights and hot chocolate and presents. But if you only remember one
thing from the holidays, after all the wrapping paper is cleaned up, let
it be this: you are loved.

There are so many people who care about you—from your family and
friends, to your teachers and classmates, to the President and me.

And the best thing we can do with that love is to let it overflow—to
share it with others who might really need it.

I know that you already do this in so many ways: by caring for your
siblings and cousins, by being a friend to a kid at school who feels
lonely, and you’re doing it today, by helping more children experience
the joy of the holidays.

You’re also part of a special group of kids who help everyone in our
nation, through your families’ military service.

And I want to thank your parents—for your dedication to this country,
for raising such wonderful kids, and for bringing delight to children
across the nation who will have these gifts under their tree this year.

The President and I are grateful, and we’re honored to open the White
House to all of you.

Merry Christmas and happy holidays.

And now, let’s get to sorting!
