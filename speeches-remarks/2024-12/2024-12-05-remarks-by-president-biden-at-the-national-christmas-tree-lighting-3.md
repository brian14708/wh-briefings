The Ellipse

THE PRESIDENT:  Merry Christmas, everyone!  (Applause.)  Merry
Christmas.  

This Christmas tree lighting is one of my wife Jill’s favorite events,
so she truly regrets not being here tonight.  She’s on an international
trip in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates and Sicily to — in order to
promote women’s health research.  (Applause.)  She sends her best wishes
to all of you.

And on behalf of Kamala and Doug — where are you, Kamala and Doug?  You
— (applause) — there you go.  Welcome to the — on behalf of them,
welcome to the National Christmas Tree lighting.

Thank you, Mickey, all the artists who are performing tonight. 

A special thanks to the Jones family for their service and sacrifice and
our military families.  (Applause.)  Tonight, they’ll help light this
beautiful Christmas tree. 

Mickey, will you start the countdown?

MS. GUYTON:  All right, y’all.  Let’s count down together, people. 

AUDIENCE:  Five, four, three, two, one!

(The Jones family light the National Christmas Tree.)

THE PRESIDENT:  Whoa!  (Applause.) 

MS. GUYTON:  Merry Christmas!

(A choir sings “Joy to the World.”)

THE PRESIDENT:  Folks, as we gather here in President’s Park just
outside the White House, a special thanks to the National Park Service
and the National Park Foundation.  (Applause.)  I mean it. 

This 30-foot Red Spruce represents the spirit embodied in this year’s
White House holiday theme, which Jill unveiled earlier this week.  The
theme is “A Season of Peace and Light” — of peace and light — the peace
we feel as we pause and reflect on our blessing and the light — the
light we see as we gather with loved ones that cherish our time
together. 

During this season of reflection and renewal, many of us will sing “O
Holy Night.”  A phrase in the song is, “His law is love; His gospel is
peace.”  <s>May</s> \[My\] wish for you and for the nation, now and
always, is we continue to seek the light of liberty and love, kindness
and compassion, dignity and decency. 

Merry Christmas, America.  Merry Christmas to all of you.  And may God
bless you all.  (Applause.)  And may God protect — may God protect our
troops.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)
