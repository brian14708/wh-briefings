title: "Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by First Lady Jill\_Biden at a Holiday Reception\
  \ for National Guard\_Families"
---
 
State Dining Room, The White House

It’s great to be here today with a fellow community college professor
and Delawarean. Lieutenant Garden, thank you for sharing your story, and
for adding a new link to the chain of your family’s military legacy. I
am so grateful to you, John, and Jaiden for your family’s service.

General Nordhaus, you are guided by a deep sense of purpose. Thank you
for your decades of service to our country—and for this new chapter, as
you will make the Guard stronger and more resilient.

I’m also grateful to Major General Wendy Wenke, SEA John Raines, and his
spouse Karen for their record of service and leadership.

The Bidens are a Guard family—our son Beau was a Major in the Delaware
National Guard. So we understand what makes Guard life different.

You don’t live on bases. One day, you’ll be in uniform—and the next,
you’ll be running a small business, practicing law, or teaching at a
community college.

You live and work and worship among civilians. And through your service,
you become the beating heart of your communities.

But I also know that this life isn’t easy. It asks you to balance the
demands of a career with the responsibilities of stepping up for our
country, to spend time away from your families—sometimes at a moment’s
notice—and to put your lives on the line to answer the call of duty.

The day after Joe’s inauguration in 2021, I brought baskets of chocolate
chip cookies to National Guard troops who had kept all of us safe on
that important day. It was a small act, but full of a Guard mom’s love
and gratitude.

National Guard families are always in my heart.

As First Lady, I’ve made National Guard families—and all military
families—a priority.

Over the past four years, through our initiative to support military
families, called Joining Forces, we’ve been helping make sure that
National Guard kids have the support they need in schools, that spouses
have all of the career opportunities they deserve, and that we care for
both the physical and mental health of our service members.

I began my time as First Lady by thanking National Guard members, and I
remain grateful. For your service, and for sharing your stories and
hopes with me. I have been so proud to work together, arm in arm, to
make this life a little easier for fellow Guard families.

Now, this is a special time of year as we transform this house for the
holidays. And one of the privileges I have as First Lady is deciding who
will be the first to experience the magic of the season here at the
White House.

Every year, I’ve asked to share it with National Guard families.

So today, I hope you’ve found delight in everything from the gingerbread
house to the carousel that circles the tree in the Blue Room—and that
even in the flow of the holiday season, you would find peace in your
purpose and strength in your community.

May God bless you and your families.

Happy holidays!
