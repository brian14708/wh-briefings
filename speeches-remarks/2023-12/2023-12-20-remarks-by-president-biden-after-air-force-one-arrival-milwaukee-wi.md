Q    Mr. President, your reaction to the Colorado ruling on Trump and
the ballot?

THE PRESIDENT:  I’m not going to comment on a court case.  I —
(inaudible) —  
  
That’s up to the court.  That’s all I have to say about it.

Q    Is he an insurrectionist?

THE PRESIDENT:  What did you say?

Q    Is Trump an insurrectionist, sir?

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think cer- — certain things are self-evident. 
You saw it all.  Now, whether the 14th Amendment applies, I’ll let the
court make that decision.  But he certainly supported an insurrection. 
No question about it.  None.  Zero.

And he seems to be doubling down on — about everything.  Anyway, I’ve
got to go do this event.

Q    Hey, what is — are we expecting a hostage deal anytime soon?

THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.

Q    Oh, really?  Okay.

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, wh- — where?

Q    Over in —

Q    Venezuela.

Q    Oh, no, I was — I was talking about —

THE PRESIDENT:  You were talking about —

Q    — over in the Middle East.

THE PRESIDENT:  We’re pushing it.  We — I don’t — there’s no expectation
at this point.  But we are pushing it.

Q    Can you address the prisoner exchange with Venezuela, sir?

THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, I — can I do that after this event?  Okay?

Q    Yes, sir.

THE PRESIDENT:  All right?  Looks good, and it looks like Maduro, so
far, is keeping his commitment on a free election.  But it ain’t done
yet.  Got a long way to go.  But — but it’s good so far.

Q    And your reaction to 20,000 dead in Gaza — that death toll reached
— likely to be reached today?

THE PRESIDENT:  It’s tragic.

Q    Thank you, sir.
