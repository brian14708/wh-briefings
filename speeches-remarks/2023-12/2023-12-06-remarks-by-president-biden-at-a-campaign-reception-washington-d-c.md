Washington, D.C.

5:46 P.M. EST  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Please have a — take a seat, if you have
one.   
   
I want to thank you.  Thank you very much, Annette.  And, you know, this
means a lot to me.  Not a joke.  I’m — I’m being deadly earnest.  
   
You know, when I first got here in the United States Senate 370 years
ago — (laughter) — but, you know, we owe you so much.  We owe the Indian
Nations so much.  I’m not just saying that.  Think of what you preserved
for the nation. 

You were here.  You’re the ones — you’re the ones that did it.  You’re
the ones that deserve credit for all the things that remain.  And I
really mean it from the bottom of my heart.   
   
And I want to thank you all for your support.  I really do.  And I
sincerely mean it.  
   
You know, the reason we won in 8- — in 2020 with 81 million votes — more
than any other presidential candidate has ever gotten in history — is
Native American voters played a critical role, especially in states like
Arizona and Wisconsin.  And I mean it.   
   
You know, and you’re the reason why Donald Trump is not the only former
president, but he’s — (applause) — but he’s a defeated president. 
(Laughter.) 

Forgive me, I’m — (applause) — I — I shouldn’t get started.   
   
But, look, you’re the reason we’re going to win again in 2024, and I’m
not just saying that. 

Earlier today, I spoke at the White House Tribal Nations Summit, which
many of you attended.  And I was proud to relaunch this annual summit
after years of neglect and — and just — it’s even more than neglect,
it’s just as if you weren’t there, as if the Indian Nations did not
exist — after years of neglect by my predecessor. 

And not just one, but there’s just not been much attention.  And it
matters to me.  You know, it shows — you — shows a commitment and to
respect Tribal sovereignty and self-determination.   
   
And at the summit you heard me talk about ushering in a new era in our
nation-to-nation relationship, because you heard me say a thousand
times, that’s what Danny Inouye taught me 50 years ago: It’s nation to
nation.  That was the commitment.   
   
And while she’s disappointed she can’t be here today, I’m so fortunate
to have Deb Haaland.  She’s done a hell of a job.  Hasn’t she —
(applause) — no, I’m — it is not merely she’s the first Native American
in the Cabinet, but she’s done one heck of a job.  She’s really good at
what she does.   
   
And — you know, and scores of Native Americans in key roles across my
administration — she helped make that happen.   
   
And look, we made important progress with record investments in Tribal
Nations — investments like the American Rescue Plan, the largest
investment in Tribal Nations ever, to help vaccinate Tribal communities
and get our economy going again. 

Not a single one of my opponents on the other team voted for it.  Not
one single one.   
   
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the single biggest investment in
roads, bridges, water, high-speed Internet, electricity, irrigation,
environmental cleanup, and so much more.  And the Indian Nations are
going to be — have significant benefit from it.   
   
The Inflation Reduction Act, the biggest investment in fighting climate
ever in the history of the world — that’s not hyperbole; that’s a fact. 

And helping Tribal communities lead in the transition to clean energy,
ease the impact of droughts and wildfires — so many wildfires the
Nations have put up with in the last, just, 10 years, especially the
last 3 or 4 — rising sea levels that threaten Native lives and precious
homelands.   
   
And, you know, there’s so much at stake.  But again, not a single one of
my opponents voted for it, which I don’t quite get.  And I really mean
it, because I don’t think they’re anti-Indian Nation; I just don’t think
it’s on the radar.  I don’t think they just don’t — they don’t think
about it.   
   
And now they’re trying to repeal parts of that.  It’s — I — I can
understand when there’s a fundamental disagreement on an issue and it’s
up in the air as to what the impacts of it are, but I don’t understand
this.   
   
We’re also protecting national treasures and sacred ancestral sites.  I
was saying to one person when I was out in — out in the valley, in the
Grand Canyon, and I put a fair amount of land aside, in addition to
being there.  And they said, “Why?”  I said, “Why not?  What would you
do?” 

And they talked about sacred lands.  I said, “What would you say — how
many times have…” — and they said — I won’t mention the particular faith
that came to me, but asked me to help protect cemeteries — old
cemeteries.  I said, “What the hell is the difference between that
Christian cemetery you want me to protect and what’s been around for a
couple thousand years?”  
   
You know, in just my first year in office together, we protected — you
and me — we protected more lands and water than any president since John
Kennedy — nationwide, across the board.  (Applause.)   
   
And we restored protections gutted by predecessor at three national
monuments: Bears Ears, the Grand Staircase in Utah — Utah, Northeast
Canyons and Seamounts in New England.  And we used my authority under
the Antiquities Act to designate new national monuments and — as well as
including Camp Hale in Colorado, Spirit Mountain in Nevada, Castner
Range in Texas, and the Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon in
Arizona.  
   
What I don’t get is — I mean this sincerely now.  I don’t get why
everybody doesn’t think that’s a good idea, not just Indian Nations. 
Why is that not a good idea?  I don’t get it.  
   
And after the previous o- — the previous administration undermined the
Indian Health Services, my administration, last year, secured the
first-ever advanced funding for Indian Health Services: 51.1 —
(applause) — I mean $5.1 — $5.1 billion locked in before the budget
negotiations so hospitals could plan ahead, order supplies, hire doctors
knowing the money would be there ahead of time.  
   
And we’re going to keep fighting to make sure it’s a mandatory part of
the federal budget, so Tribes can — can count on it year to year, so
they don’t have to have this fight every single year.  
   
We’re also keeping our sacred obligation to our veterans in the PACT
Act.  
   
What I keep reminding people — you realize; I know you do — but I want
to remind you, because you don’t talk enough about it: A higher
percentage of Native Americans have signed up for the United States
military, volunteered, than any other group of individuals in the entire
nation. 

Let me say that again: a higher percentage than any other group, any
other identifiable group of Americans — Indian Nations.  
   
One of the most significant laws ever signed was to help veterans
exposed to toxic materials and compensate their families.  My son was
one of those exposed to those toxic materials in Iraq.  They sit there
for a year in a burn pit that’s about couple hundred yards away.  And
you all fought like hell to make sure we got that done.   
   
Three hundred and thirty thousand veterans are Native Americans today —
today — 330,000.  (Applause.)  
   
And, folks, while there’s more work to do on the economy, healthcare,
and so much more, there are transformational investments that help
Tribes and all Americans.  Because another thing I keep telling people
who criticize me of this: When you help a Tribe, you’re helping all of
America.  How in God’s name is it not helping all of America?  
   
And the executive order I just signed today is going to cut the red tape
so you can — so you can better deliver those historic resources to your
communities in ways that you — that you should, because you know best
what’s needed in your communities.  
   
How can we talk about how local communities in a (inaudible) area know
best for the communities and you don’t know best for yours?  I don’t get
the reasoning.  I don’t get that. 

I always hear about, “Well, you know, this county council or this local
legislative body, this — they know best.”  What the — I don’t get it. 
What — why do you not know best for your communities?  You do.  You know
better than anybody.  
   
But all of it is at stake in this election.  And so, it’s something that
— something else is at stake: the future of American democracy.  Not a
joke.  
   
Let me be real clear.  I’m going to say it straight up, and I’m — some
suggest I shouldn’t say it straight up, but I’m going to: Donald Trump
poses many threats to this country, but the greatest threat of all he
poses to the country is the remainder and the continuation of our
democracy.  Because if we lose that, we lose everything.  
   
When I first ran for president, you may recall, I said at the
Independence Hall up in Philadelphia that I thought democracy was at
stake.  And I think a lot of people thought I was exaggerating.  But I
don’t think anybody thinks that anymore.  I really don’t.  
   
We all know what happened on January the 6th.  Trump sat in the private
dining room off of the Oval Office for hours, watching it all unfold on
television as a mob attacked the Capitol Police and desecrated the
Capitol, as the mob threatened the life of his own vice president,
because the Vice President refused to violate the constitution and do
what he wanted done.  
   
We all know what became of that first losing presidential candidate in
history who refused to accept the will of the people.  He didn’t even
show up for my inauguration.  I can’t say it disappointed me. 
(Laughter.) 

But think about it: Only two other presidents in all of American
history, in the middle of wars — wars North and South — didn’t show up
for the inauguration of the next president.  My guess is he’s not going
to show up on my next inauguration either.  (Laughter and applause.)  
   
And hear his words today.  He says he’s running not to serve the people
of America but to get “revenge” and “retribution.”  God bless me. 
(Laughter.)   
   
He said it’s time — and I quote, “the termination of all rules,
regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution.” 

He’s not — I’m not making these words up.  You hear it.  That’s what
he’s saying.  
   
What do you think that means when it comes to upholding — upholding
federal trust and treaty obligations to — to Tribal Nations?  I’m
serious.   
   
He called those who oppose him “vermin,” language that echoes what we
heard in Nazi Germany in the ‘30s.  It has a sp- — how many times have
you heard any political person refer to another opponent as “vermin,”
other than when you read your history on the — during the Nazi era?   
   
He threatened to use the American military — the American military on
the streets of America to go after his political opponents — the
Insurrection Act.   
   
He called, again, to get the Affordable Care Act, which supports Indian
Health Services, eliminated.  This will be the 51st time they tried it. 
No, I’m serious.  I know that sounds bizarre.   
   
Folks, what kind of respect do you think he’d have for Tribal
communities, of what we — what you’ve — you’ve done?  You — you’ve given
me credit for getting things done.  You’ve come to me and told me what
you need most in Indian Nations, and I believed you.  I’ve seen it.  I
look.  
   
All of you understand what freedom means.  Freedom is basically — you
can’t have much freedom if you don’t tell the truth, if you don’t have
courage, you never — unwilling to hold up a mirror to yourself and to
the country and ask yourself, “Is this who we are?  Can we do better?” 
That’s what freedom is about.   
   
Let me close with this.  I’m taking too long, and I apologize.  It’s not
easy to hear and — what’s been done in the past and to heal the wrongs
of the past, to change the course and move forward.  But the work we’re
doing together is carrying us into a new era of Tribal sovereignty and
self-determination.  And that’s not hyperbole.  They’re not words; it’s
real.   
   
And we’re now grounded in dignity and respect that recognizes Tribes’
fundamental right to govern and grow on your own terms.  That’s what
this election is about.    
  
And, by the way, you’re not asking for anything that’s inconsistent with
the United States Constitution.  You’re not asking for anything that’s
inconsistent.  That’s why we need you.   
   
We need every Democrat, Republican, and independent who believes in
democracy and our nation-to-nation relationship to join us in 2024 — and
I mean this sincerely; I give you my word as a Biden — not because I am
running, but this is one of the most important elections in modern
history.   
   
You know, you’re always hearing me talk about inflection points, where
this — things that happen in a short period of time and determine what’s
going to happen in the next four or five decades.  We’re at one of those
points.  I — but I’ve never been more optimistic than I am today.   
   
We’re proving that there’s nothing beyond our capacity when we work
together.  And I mean it.  Think about it.  When have we, in this
country, ever worked together and not been able to solve the problems in
front of us?  There’s not a single issue that we’ve gone into that’s
caused us problems we haven’t come out stronger than we went in.   
   
And I think, with your added strength — and I really mean it — I really
mean it — you have a moral force behind what you’ve been doing.  And it
carries with the American people.  It sounds corny, but I — I really
mean it.  Think about it.  Think about it.   
   
Think about if you’re going to sit down and talk to any young person in
eighth, ninth, tenth grade, and you start talking about the history. 
Who among them says, “No, no, we’re doing too much for Indian Nations”? 
It’s just not there.  People know it if we talk about it.  
   
That’s why I’m so opposed to these book bannings and all this other
stuff that, you know, tries to keep the history from being talked
about.  The way to get rid of the bad history is talk about it so we get
a new history.   
   
Well, I’m going to get off too much on what I really get talking about. 
(Laughter.)   
   
But all kidding aside, thank you for your support, and it means a lot to
me.  I mean, really — I — and some of you know me — this means a lot. 
It really matters that you would do this for me.   
   
And it’s — I don’t want to exaggerate it, but there’s an emotional
component to it.  You do what you say.  You can be counted on.  
   
And, by the way, like I said, we’re going to have an all-Indian lacrosse
team in the Olympics.  (Applause.)  You all think I’m kidding?    
   
Like I said, you know, I was not a bad athlete.  I was a runner-up at
state scoring championship in — in — in football in the state of
Delaware — a small state, but I still was a pretty — I was proud of it. 
I was a pretty good baseball player.  
   
But the real athletes in my family are the women.  My daughter was a
great — she’s — she’s faster than I was, I think; played lacrosse.   
   
And my — my niece played lacrosse all-state, first team All-American in
high school, All-Ivy.  
   
I mean, you know, the real power in my family is the women.  
   
But, somehow, I suspect it may be in yours as well.  (Laughter.) 
Anyway, thank you all so very much.  (Applause.)  
   
Really, thank you.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  It means a lot.
