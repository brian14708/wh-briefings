2:32 P.M. EST  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, Mr. President, welcome back.  
   
PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY:  Thank you so much.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Welcome back to the White House —  
   
PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  — and the Oval Office.  And it’s great to be at your
side once again.  We’re going to stay at your side.   
   
You know, we stand at a real inflection point in history — I know you
and I have talked about this — where the decisions we make now are going
to determine the future for decades to come, particularly in Europe. 
And this is one of those moments.  
   
Congress needs to pass the supplemental funding for Ukraine before they
break for the holiday recess — before they give Putin the greatest
Christmas gift they could possibly give him.  And so — because we’ve
seen what happens when dictators don’t pay the price for the damage and
the death and the destruction they cause, and they keep going when no
price is paid.  
   
The threats to America, to Europe, and the world will only keep rising
if we don’t act.  And I intend that we act.  
   
The American people, Democrats and Republicans alike, I think,
understand this, and they understand the very real fight that’s going on
right now.   
   
In the winter — this winter, Putin plans once again to bombard Ukraine’s
electric grid, intends to — with rockets — plunging families into
darkness in the coldest part of the year and doing great damage.  We
can’t and won’t let him succeed.  We mustn’t let him succeed in that.   
   
Mr. President, I’ve called on Congress to do the right thing, to stand
with Ukraine, and to stand up for freedom.   
   
And I want to thank you for being here.  You’re going to help the
cause.  And I don’t want you giving up hope.  
   
PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY:  Thank you so much.  Mr. President, dear
journalists — really glad to be here at the White House today and share
some very important messages.   
   
Thank you for invitation.  And I like to thank America and our partners
for the support.   
   
And today is a special day — a very special day for Ukraine, Ukrainian
people.  It’s the day of our land forces — almost 600,000 incredibly
brave Ukrainian sons and daughters — are on the battlefield.  And they
are powerful.  And this is their day.  And — and, really, they prove
every day that Ukraine can win.  
   
And our forces are advancing, and we have successfully defeated Russia
in the Black Sea.  And Russia is hiding the remnants of its naval fleets
in remote base.  And meanwhile, Ukraine has set up an export corridor in
the Black Sea that’s really boosting our economy and global food
security.  
   
Yesterday, I met with the IMF and World Bank.  And they impressed with
Ukraine’s economic growth — almost 5 percent.  And that’s significant. 
Ukraine is gradually becoming less dependent on aid.  And we are moving
to the right, I think — right direction.   
   
And I want to discuss with the President how — how to strengthen it,
especially in enhancing our air defense and ability to destroy Russia’s
logistics.  
   
Our goals for ‘24 are clear: Take away Russia’s superiority and disrupt
their offensive operations.  And I think it’s real.   
   
And also some other important things.  I met with the heads of American
defense companies yesterday — thank you very much, Mr. President —
really powerful companies.  I thanked them and thanked all the workers,
engineers, managers who build — and build the strength of American
weapons, helping Ukraine boost the development of arsenals of
democracy.   
   
President Biden agreed — and we spoke about it in September — to joint
weapon co-production.  It’s very important for us, and we’ll discuss how
to speed up this.   
   
We also need to work faster with the frozen Russian assets — over $300
billion frozen assets from terrorists — and we should use it to protect
against Russian terror.   
   
And I want to talk about some details regarding our reforms and EU
integration.  Ukraine continues to reform its institutions, even during
the war.  It’s very important for us, and we are successful.  I think
that’s very important.   
   
And people need to be confident that freedom is secure and strong enough
to win.   
   
Thank you very much, Mr. President.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you.  And before the press — before — before the
press leave —  
   
(Cross-talk.)  
   
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hush up a second, okay?  I’ve got one more thing to
say.   
   
I just signed another $200 million drawdown from the Department of
Defense for Ukraine, and that will be coming quickly.  
   
PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY:  Thank you very much.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you.  
   
PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY:  Thank you very much.  
   
2:37 P.M. EST
