\*\*\*

Thank you, Major Quiros. You and Catherine and your family have been
through so much. I’m grateful you’re all here today with us. Thank you
for your service, and for finding ways to help so many.

And I know so many in this room did the same: sharing your homes,
clothes, and groceries. Helping neighbors dig precious memories out of
rubble. Being there for those who lost everything – even when you had
lost so much yourselves.

Major General Sylvia, thank you for the warm welcome to Fort Campbell.

I also want to recognize the Armed Services YMCA, Toys for Tots, and
Mission Barbeque for all of your hard work to make today possible.

As Americans across the country gather this weekend for the holidays,
our family wanted to come here – we wanted to be with all of you, to
stand with you, to let you know that you’re not alone.

Because in our family, we have a saying: if you have to ask, it’s too
late.

Military families live by that saying too, don’t you?

In moments of hardship, you’re the ones who step up, you’re the ones who
put your lives in harm’s way, you’re the ones who reach out a hand to
carry others through.

I know that the last two weeks have probably tested that strength.

But even in this moment of grief and heartbreak, there is so much love
and support that surrounds you – that Screaming Eagles spirit that Major
Quiros described.

I know it can be hard to ask for help when you’re usually the ones
answering the call. But I hope that you let others share the weight of
your burdens.

The Bidens are a military family. And military families look out for
each other. We take care of our own.

On behalf of the President and Americans everywhere, you are in our
hearts, and we are so grateful for your service. May God bless and
protect our troops and their families.

Now, I know your holidays this year might look a little different, so, I
brought a special guest with me, all the way from the North Pole!

Who wants to come meet Santa?
