Private Residence  
Bethesda, Maryland  
  
(December 19, 2023)

5:36 P.M. EST  
   
THE PRESIDENT: Hello, hello, hello.   
   
Thank you, Governor Wes Moore, for that introduction.  I tell you, I was
ready to hear another hour or so.  (Laughter.)  Thank you very much.  
   
And I want to thank you for — the First Lady, Dawn, for putting up with
you all these years.  (Laughter.)  
   
Look, the fact is that, you know, you have — do have a great Lieutenant
Governor.  She is first rate.   
   
And my good friend, Steny Hoyer, we’ve worked together a long, long
time.  Now, you were saying all those things about Maryland being
first.  I’ve been saying to Steny for years the eastern shore of
Maryland is really the western shore of Delaware.  (Laughter.)  But I’m
glad he’s taken such incredible, good care of us.  Steny, you’re the
very best, man.  You are the very best.  (Applause.)  
   
Risa and Ben, thank you for hosting.  This is really important to me,
and I can’t tell you how much it means to me and your friendship as
well.  
   
But before I begin, I want to say a few words about the situation in the
Middle East because I know a lot of you want to hear about it.  And I’m
going to be very brief because I’ll have time to talk about it later.   
   
But I we- — when I went to Israel, I went to — to fight Hamas, to — they
faced a burden, a few milestones that few countries have to face and
militaries that — a military enemy that says it has one goal: to — the
elimination — elimination, using terror, of the entire state of Israel. 
Hamas has no regard — none whatsoever — on whether civ- — if those
civilians live or die.   
   
They faced additional burdens too.  Hamas is holding a significant
number of hostages, including American hostages.   
   
But from the beginning — I’ve said from beginning, those added burdens
do not lessen Israel’s responsibility to distinguish between the
Palestinian people and Hamas and to take care to minimize civilian
deaths.   
   
And we’re take — and, you know, we’re talking to Israel and the Arab
partners about political future for the Palestinian people and a
two-state solution with Israel’s security guaranteed, where Israel
enjoys peace and normal relations with their Arab neighbors.   
   
And we’re — I’ve been in discussion — I think one of the reasons why
Hamas moved when they did — as Steny knows, I was working very closely
with the Saudis in the formal recognition of Israel.  
   
But, ladies and gentlemen, let me get to the reason we’re here tonight. 
I — I want to thank you.  In 2020, you were the reason why we got 81
million votes — more votes than any presidential candidate has ever
gotten in American history.  But they’re also the reason why Donald
Trump not only is a former president but a former defeated president.   
   
And — (applause) — and you’re the reason why we’re going to win in
2024.  (Applause.)  
   
You know, when we started, the pandemic was raging, the economy was
reeling.  Because of you, look at what we’ve achieved: record job
creation, historic economic growth, among the lowest inflation rates of
any major economy on Earth.  We rebuilt our alliances around the
world.  
   
And because of the great help of Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois,
Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, we continue to provide for a
significant number of — over 60 now — federal judges at a historic pace,
two thirds of the people — of whom are people of color.  The most
diverse slate ever, the first Black woman ever appointed to the United
States Supreme Court, and more Black women in the federal — federal
appellate courts and circuit courts than every other president in
history combined.  (Applause.)  
   
Trump and the MAGA Republicans want to get rid of the Affordable Care
Act.  In fact, they failed 50 times so far.  They’re going for 51. 
(Laughter.)  They’re still not giving up.  And it’s going to — it’s the
very thing that allows people with preexisting conditions to have
insurance.  I won’t go into all the detail.  You know it.  
   
On our watch, we made affordable care even stronger.  We’re in a
position — we made the biggest investment in the history of the world to
combat climate change.  We signed the first new gun safety law in 30
years.  (Applause.)  
   
We need to do more.  Despite actions from the Supreme Court and MAGA
Republicans, I’ve relieved the student debt of 3.6 million Americans,
and we’re going to keep going.  (Applause.)  
   
I made a historic commitment to rebuild America.  Here in Maryland,
you’ve al- — we’ve already announced over $11 billion, including 140
specific projects, including fully replacing the Baltimore Tunnel.  I’m
probably the only person in here who’s ever walked through that tunnel. 
(Laughter.)  Not — not a joke.  
   
I traveled over 1 million 2- — -320,000 miles on Amtrak, commuted every
single day for years.  And that tunnel was built about 180 years ago. 
(Laughter.)   
   
The tunnel will be all electric.  Trains will travel through at 110
miles an hour instead of 30 miles an hour now, and it’s going to be a
gamechanger across the board.   
   
But for all we’ve done, the real heroes of this story are really the
American people.  In thousands of towns all across America, we see
thousands of stories of revival and renewal, hope and optimism, and
pride — pride in your work, your family, your town — pride in the
nation.  
   
We know there’s more to do for child care and elder care, making sure
that the very big corporations — and, by the way, I know something about
big corporations.  I come from Delaware.  (Laughter.)  More corporations
incorporated in Delaware than every other state in the nation combined. 
I’m not anticorporation, but it’s about time they start paying their
fair share in taxes.  (Applause.)   
   
And, by the way, even with the historic investments we’ve made, we still
have reduced the deficit — all the talk about all we’ve done, we’ve
reduced the deficit so far by $1 trillion — $1 trillion.  In part
because of increasing revenue, but the recovery is going so strongly
that we now are able — relative to when I took office — are able to
generate additional income.  
   
We reached a bipartisan budget agreement, cut spending an additional $1
trillion over the next 10 years, and in my budget, we proposed more than
$2 trillion in deficit reduction, on top of — mostly by asking the big
corporations to begin to pay their fair share.  
   
Look, and we all know that progress is at stake in the next election. 
But I want to talk about what I think is even more at stake in this next
election: literally the future of American democracy.  And it makes
everything possible.  
   
Let me be clear: Donald Trump poses many threats to the country, from
the right to choose to civil rights to voting rights to America’s
standing in the world.   
   
Some of you are — you’re all successful people; you’ve traveled the
world.  Find me a head of state or someone of consequence in a country
you visit that doesn’t say — you will not be- — will not — will believe
that every head of state I’ve met — come in contact with says, “You’ve
got to win.  You’ve got to win.”  
   
More — less about me, unfortunately, I think, than about the other guy. 
(Laughter.)  
   
But all — it’s — the greatest threat Trump poses is to our democracy. 
Because if we lose, we lose everything.   
   
When I first ran for president, I said democracy was at stake in
America.  I think a lot of people, particularly the press, thought I was
exaggerating.  But they don’t think that anymore.   
   
They saw what happened on January 6th.  Sitting in that little dining
room off the Oval Office, Trump — Trump sitting there, watching it
unfold on TV as a mob attacked the Capitol and desecrated the Capitol. 
A mob threatened the life of his own vice president because the Vice
President refused to violate his constitutional oath.   
   
The same mob went looking for Nancy Pelosi, spun up by the same lies
that inspired the assault that attacked her husband with a hammer to the
head two months later.  
   
This is a former president who actually condones and encourages violence
against his fellow Americans.  It’s simply not acceptable in America to
condone violence.  It’s despicable.  
   
Trump became the first losing presidential candidate in history who
refused to accept the will of the American people, even though he lost
60 court challenges, recounts in Georgia and Wisconsin.  In fact, Donald
Trump is the only candidate in history to lose Georgia three times in
the same election.  (Laughter and applause.)  
   
He didn’t even show up for my Inauguration.  Can’t say I was
disappointed.  (Laughter.)  My guess, he won’t show for the next one
either.  (Laughter and applause.)  
   
But, look, listen to his words today.  Just this weekend, Trump was
embracing his old pal, Putin.  Trump even quoted him this weekend.  It’s
no surprise.  After all, there’s a lot of agreement between Moscow and
Mar-a-Lago.   
   
Trump says he’s running not to serve the people of America, but to reget
— his quote — to get “revenge” and “retribution.”  Just recently, he
said he’d be a dictator for only one day.  In that one day, he’s going
to take out the Affordable Care Act — 40 million people — he wants to
get rid of it.  He wants to fill the government with Trump loyalists,
seeking a loyalty oath; fire career officials.  
   
He uses the power of the federal government for revenge and retribution
against his enemies.  And the language he uses reminds us of the
language coming out of Germany in the ‘30s.  He has called those who
oppose him “vermin.”  And, again, this weekend, he talked about “the
blood of our country” is being poisoned.  Even conservative Republicans
have spoken out against it.   
   
He’s threatened to use the U.S. military in the streets of America to go
after his political opponents.  Once again, he embraces political
violence instead of rejecting it.  We can’t let this happen.  God knows
where he’ll take us.  
   
Look, all of you here understand that freedom means to tell the truth,
to have the courage to hold up the mirror to the American people and
say, “Is this who we are?  Can we get better?  How can we get
better?”   
   
Trump, we don’t believe — he doesn’t believe he — when he said — he
talks about America being, quote, “a failing nation,” driven by anger,
fear, and revenge.  Then Trump spoke — at his Inaugural, he spoken to
the American — he spoke about “American carnage.”  When I spoke at my
Inauguration, I talked about America’s possibilities.   
   
I believe — I was with Xi Jinping on the Tibetan Plateau when I was Vice
President, because I had to get to know him because Barack and I knew he
was going to be president.  It wasn’t appropriate for the President to
travel with him.  So, I’ve spent over 68 hours alone with him, just he
and I with contemporaneous interpreters, and a total of 100 — over 100
hours on — on Zoom with him, total.  
   
And he asked me on the Tibetan Plateau — this is the God’s truth — he
said, “Can you define America for me?”  I said, “Yes, I can.”  And I
meant it.  “In one word: possibilities.”  Possibilities.  
   
We’re the only nation in the world that believes anything is possible if
we put our mind to it — anything.  We believe we’re a hopeful and we’re
an optimistic nation, driven by a simple proposition that everybody
deserves a clear shot.   
   
We’re only — the only nation in the world built not on race, religion,
ethnicity, geography.  We’re the only nation built on an idea —
literally an idea.  Not hyperbole.  An idea: We hold these truths to be
self-evident, that all men and — you know the rest.    
   
We’ve never fully lived up to it, but we’ve never walked away from it. 
It’s the idea that created America.  And, ladies and gentlemen, we’re
not going to walk away now.  
   
Let me close with this: In three years, we’re going to commemorate the
250th anniversary of the signing — excuse me — of the Declaration of
Independence.  It will be a moment not only about our past, celebrating
what we’ve done, but also about our future and all we can be.  
   
I don’t believe in — I don’t believe and I will not believe that, after
all this time, what we’ve done as a nation, we’re going to be — walk
away.  From the — from the fight for independence to the Civil War to
world wars; after being blessed with leaders like Washington and Lincoln
and Roosevelt and Dr. King; after having — having stood as a beacon of
freedom, for equality in the world — for all the world, I don’t believe
our 250th anniversary is going to turn to Donald Trump.  
   
Just this weekend, Trump said, and I quote, “Our country is not a great
country anymore.”  “Our country is not a great country anymore.”  I
simply don’t believe that, and I don’t think any of you do.  
   
Folks, imagine that moment and ask, “What do we want to be on the 250th
anniversary?”  If we do our job in 2024, we’ll be able to say something
few generations get to say or have done: We’ll actually be able to say
we saved American democracy.  Because the alternative is stark.  It is
stark.  
   
I’m positive — absolutely positive we can do it.  You know, all the talk
about polls and all the like — well, you know, there’s an awful lot of
polls.  But the one that just came out talking about a summary of all
the polling by Simon Rosenberg, we, on average, are up by 47, 45.  It
shouldn’t even be that close — the New York Times/Siena poll.   
   
Eight recent polls show us winning by two to six points.  But that’s not
— that doesn’t mean a lot right now, in my view, either way, in polls. 
Those of you who know the business, it’s awful hard.  You know, you’ve
got to call — you’ve got to make about 20 calls to get 1 person to
answer their cellphone.  Seriously.  
   
But I’ve never been more optimistic about America, about our country.  I
know that I was — when I had — I had an emergency operation years ago
for a cranial aneurysm.  And the doc — when they were wheeling me down,
I said, “What are my chances, Doc?”  And he gave me his estimate.   
   
And I — he said, “I’m not sure whether this is congenital or — a
congenital problem or it’s environmental.”  And I said, “I don’t care
what it is, Doc, just take care of it.”  (Laughter.)   
   
And he looked at me and said, “You know what your problem is, Senator?” 
And I’ll never forget this.  He said, “Your problem is you’re a
congenital optimist.”  (Laughter.)  
   
I am a congenital optimist about America.  There’s nothing, nothing,
nothing beyond our capacity.  I really mean it.   
   
Think about it.  Name me another nation in the history of the world that
has come out of every crisis stronger than we went in — stronger than we
went in.  That’s who we are, because we’re the American people.   
   
We’re the United States of America.  We got to remember that.  There’s
nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity.  
   
I promise I’ll do everything in my power not to let you down.  I
guarantee I’ll work like the devil.  And I guarantee you: We make our
case, we win.  
   
God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops.  Thank you for
taking the time.  (Applause.)  
   
Folks, I used to think that traffic was a problem before I was President
— (laughter) — but they tell — the Secret Service tells them when to
shut down the roads.  For every vote you’re helping me pick up, I’ll
lose three.  (Laughter.)  
   
We told them we’d be doing this now.  If I don’t, they shut down the
roads, and they may come for the tent.   
   
So, thank you again.  Thank you, thank you, thank you very much. 
(Applause.)  
   
And, by the way, your governor is one of the best in the nation. 
(Applause.)  (Inaudible.)  
   
Thanks for the help, man.  Thank you all very much.  (Applause.)
