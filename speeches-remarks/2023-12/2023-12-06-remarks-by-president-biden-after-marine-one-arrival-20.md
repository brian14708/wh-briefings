Q    Mr. President, would you be running if Trump wasn’t running?  Would
you be running for president if Trump wasn’t running?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  I — I expect so.  But, look, he is running, and I just —
I have to run.  
  
Q    Would you drop out if Trump runs out?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  No, not now.  
  
Q    What’s the latest on the American hostages in Gaza?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  We’re pushing hard.  We’re talking to the Qataris.  I
don’t know where it’s going to go, but we’re not giving up.  
  
Q    Does Hamas have all eight of them, or are other groups holding them
too?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there’s others.  But we — look, I’m not going to
talk more about it.  But we’re not — we’re not walking away.  
  
Q    Have you spoken to anyone on the Hill about Ukraine funding?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, a couple.  And look, the failure to — the failure
to support Ukraine is just absolutely crazy.  It’s against U.S.
interests.  It’s against the interests of the — of the world.  It’s just
wrong.  And we’re — we’re going to get that — we’re going to get that
aid.  We’re going to get it.  
  
So, anyways, thank you all for waiting.  Appreciate it.
