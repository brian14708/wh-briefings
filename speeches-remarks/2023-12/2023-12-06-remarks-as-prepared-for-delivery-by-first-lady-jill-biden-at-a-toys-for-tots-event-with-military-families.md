The White House

\*\*\*

Thank you, Brigadier General Jackson. I’m grateful for your and
Lieutenant General Laster’s leadership.

And welcome, everyone, to the White House!

Did you have fun ice skating?

I know we usually hold this event at a military base, but this year, I
wanted to host you here, because our holiday theme celebrates children
and the way all of you experience this season.

We even have ornaments made with the handprints and family portraits of
military children in the Red Room – because we wanted you to see
yourselves here.

You may not hear this a lot, but kids have something important to teach
us grown-ups. Especially military kids like you.

You teach us how to be brave, even when we’re scared. You teach us how
to make friends, even when we don’t know anyone. You teach us how to
reach out a hand when other people need help.

And we need that courage, kindness, and compassion now more than ever.

So thank you. You may not wear a uniform, but we know military children
serve our country too.

And to your parents, thank you.

For decades, Toys for Tots has brought magic, wonder, and joy to
children in need, and this year is no different. The President and I are
grateful, and we’re honored to open the White House to all of you.

Now, let’s sort some toys!
