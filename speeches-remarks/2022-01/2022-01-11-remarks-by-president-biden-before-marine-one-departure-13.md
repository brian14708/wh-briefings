Q    Good morning, sir.  Quick question on voting: Any thoughts on
Stacey Abrams skipping your speech today, sir?  Are you insulted she is
skipping the speech?

THE PRESIDENT:  I’m insulted you asked the question.  (Laughs.)  I spoke
with Stacey this morning.  We have a great relationship.  We got our
scheduling mixed up.  I’m going to be — I talked with her at length this
morning.  We’re all on the same page and everything is fine.

Q    What do you risk, sir, by putting so much on the line for voting
rights when you know the state of the Senate?

THE PRESIDENT:  Say that, again, please?

Q    What do you risk politically, sir, when you know the state of the
Senate?

THE PRESIDENT:  I risk not saying what I believe.  That’s what I risk. 

This is one of those defining moments.  It really is.  People are going
to be judged — where were they before and where were they after the
vote.  History is going to judge it; it’s that consequential.  And so,
the risk is: making sure people understand just how important this is —
just how important this is.

Q    Mr. President, are you concerned overall about the progress on the
pandemic right now?  Do you feel like your administration is not meeting
the targets it needs to meet?

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I am concerned about the pandemic just because it
— worldwide, it’s not slowing up very much. 

And thank God what we’ve been able to do is I’ve been able —

(The President readjusts his facemask.)  Does this looks stupid? 
(Laughs.)  
  
I’ve been able to generate significant federal help, in terms of folks
both coming into the hospitals and administering all the help that these
states need.  That’s what we’re doing now.  But I’m confident we’re on
the right track. 

Thank you all.
