Q    Mr. President, what do you think of the site?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  It’s incredible.  I mean, this is — first of all, these
guys deserve an incredible amount of credit going down here.  And while
this was going on, they tell me the gas leak was — explain what you said
to me about the noise.  
  
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL:  There was just a very loud — like a jet
engine.  (Inaudible.)  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  And you can see — you see it coming out on the other
side of the concrete there, this side, up by the crane.  And were you
worried that that — that there had been an explosion or that there had
been a collapse?  
  
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL:  We weren’t sure whether the gas had
caused this or whether the leak was, you know, a result of —  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  
  
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL:  — the bridge collapse.  So we just
weren’t sure at that time.  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  How long did it take the company to shut off the gas?  
  
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL:  Probably —  
  
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL:  I’d say about a half hour.  
  
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL:  Half hour, 45 minutes.  So that was
just continuing outside of the — out in the air.  
  
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL:  So there’s — obviously there’s another
line right here as well.  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  On this side as well, yeah.  
  
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL:  Yeah.  So that was rushing out.  So —  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  And it was probably too early for joggers to be down
there.  
  
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL:  There was a few joggers actually. 
There was a few.  One of them actually helped us get some people out of
the cars there.  So —  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’ll be damned.   
  
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL:  Yeah.  
  
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL:  It’s a miracle, Mr. President.  It’s a
miracle.  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  It really is.  It really is.  It’s astounding.

You all realize — I’ve been coming to Pittsburgh a long time and as a
former Pennsylvanian.  But I didn’t realize there are literally more
bridges in Pittsburgh than in any other city in the world.  Did you
know?  More than in Venice.

I mean, I knew there are a lot of bri- — I had no idea that.  And we’re
going to — they’re going to fix them all.  Not a joke.  This is going to
be a gigantic change.  And there’s 43,000 nationwide.  And we’re sending
the money.

And, by the way, we’re going to give you guys more money too — cops.   
  
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL:  Thank you, sir.  
  
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL:  Thank you, sir.  We appreciate that.   
  
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
