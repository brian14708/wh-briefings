*South Court Auditorium  
Eisenhower Executive Office Building*

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Dear
Dr. Bernice King, thank you for that introduction and for all that you
do every day in your role of leadership.  And thank you for the
invitation to address this most distinguished group of leaders.  
   
I also want to thank Presiding Bishop Michael Curry, Pastor Sam Collier,
and all those taking the stage today for sharing your words and your
wisdom, and encouraging us to fight on — borne out of the optimism that
we must hold — grounded in our faith.    
   
I also want to thank members of Congress who are there and part of this
important occasion, including your own Reverend Raphael Warnock; and the
members of our administration who are part of this; state and local
leaders; activists and organizers for coming together on this very
special day in this most special place.  
   
As some of you know, last week, I was honored to once again visit your
historic sanctuary together with members of the King family.  
   
And it is an honor to be with you today as our nation remembers the
Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.   
   
As has been said, as is known throughout the world, Dr. King was a
prophet.  He was a prophet in that he saw the present exactly as it was
and the future as it could be.  And he pushed our nation toward that
future.   
   
Dr. King pushed even as his character was maligned.  
   
He pushed even as his family’s life was threatened.   
   
He pushed even as his own life was in jeopardy.  
   
He pushed for racial justice, for economic justice, and for the freedom
that unlocks all others: the freedom to vote.  
   
Today, our freedom to vote is under assault.  In Georgia and across our
nation, anti-voter laws are being passed that could make it more
difficult for as many as 55 million Americans to vote — 55 million
Americans.  That is one out of six people in our country.  
   
And the proponents of these laws are not only putting in place obstacles
to the ballot box.  They are also working to interfere with our
elections to get the outcomes they want and to discredit those they do
not.  That is not how democracies work.  
   
We know the threat we face.  We know that this assault on our freedom to
vote will be felt by every American, in every community, in every
political party.   
   
We know that if we stand idly by, our entire nation will pay the price
for generations to come.  
   
You know, I’m reminded of the words of Dr. King’s partner — a great
American leader and his partner in the struggle — yes, Coretta Scott
King, who said, “Freedom is never really won.  You earn it and win it in
every generation.”  
   
So many in this state have worked tirelessly to protect our democracy. 
You have registered voters.  You have organized on college campuses and
in senior living communities, at coffee shops and cookouts.  You have
worn out the soles of your shoes going door-to-door to get out the
vote.  
   
And last week, the President and I visited Atlanta to deliver a message:
It is time for the United States Senate to do its job.   
   
A landmark bill, as we all know, sits before the United States Senate:
“The Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act.”  This bill represents the
first real opportunity to secure the freedom to vote since the United
States Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act nearly a decade ago. 
And the Senate must pass this bill now.   
   
You know, it was more than 55 years ago that men, women, and children
marched from Selma to Montgomery to demand the ballot.   
   
When they arrived at the state capitol in Alabama, Dr. King decried what
he called “normalcy” — the normalcy, the complacency that was denying
people the freedom to vote.   
   
As Dr. King said, the only normalcy he would accept is “the normalcy
that recognizes the dignity and worth of all God’s children.”  
   
Today, we must not be complacent or complicit.  We must not give up, and
we must not give in.  
   
To truly honor the legacy of the man we celebrate today, we must
continue to fight for the freedom to vote, for freedom for all.   
   
Thank you, all.  May God bless you.  And may God bless America.  Have a
good morning.   
   
                        END
