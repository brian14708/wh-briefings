title: "Remarks by Vice President Harris During Service Event at Martha\u2019s Table"

*Martha’s Table  
*Washington, D.C**

Q    Madam Vice President, what’s the next step on voting rights after
your speech today?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  To keep working on it.  I’m making calls.  I’m
meeting with folks.  We’re not going to give up.  You’ve heard me say
that before, and I mean it.  This is too important.  This is not about —
it — this is literally about the future of our country in terms of its
democracy.  And we have to remain deeply committed to getting this done
and seeing it through however long it takes.   
   
But right now, we have bills before us.  The United States Senate has
the opportunity and, I daresay, the responsibility to pass these bills
through Congress so the President can sign them.  And the resistance to
doing that will not deter us from our commitment to getting it done.  
   
Q    What’s your message to Manchin and Sinema?  Vice President Harris,
what’s your message to Manchin and Sinema?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  As I’ve said before, there are a hundred members of
the United States Senate, and I’m not going to absolve — nor should any
of us — absolve any member of the United States Senate from taking on a
responsibility to follow through on the oath that they all took to
support and defend the Constitution of the United States.
