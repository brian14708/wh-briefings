*Hernán Acosta Meijía Air Force Base  
Tegucigalpa, Honduras*

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Hi, guys.  So, this was an important trip
and — this was an important trip.  As you know, I head the Root Causes
Strategy that is designed to address the issue of irregular migration
into the United States.  And so we came here today to make a clear
statement about our administration’s support for what the people of
Honduras have clearly said they want: They’ve turned out in record
numbers in this election, and they seem to be desirous of a democracy
that is devoid of corruption and that can meet their essential needs
and, in particular, their economic needs and their human rights needs,
which are critical pillars in our Root Causes Strategy.  
   
The conversation that I had today then with the now president was rooted
in those issues.  It was about our intention to prioritize the
importance of her agenda, as it relates to the combating of
corruption.  
   
I talked extensively about why that is important.  There are obvious
reasons, but the reasons include a connection to the second point, which
is the need for them to have economic security and to do well
economically, so that their people don’t want to leave.   
   
And the connection is pretty obvious.  When we talk about our attention
to dealing with the economic support we can give countries in Central
America, a lot of it includes partnerships with CEOs and with our
private sector in the United States — with American corporations.  Well,
they want to know they can do business in a country where there will be
adherence to the rule of law, where there will be consistency in terms
of a judiciary, where there will be consistency in terms of
regulations.  
   
So, these issues are interconnected.  And speaking of interconnection
and interdependence, not only is there an interconnection and
independence — interdependence between the United States and Honduras on
these issues as it relates to the effect which is irregular migration,
but also we talked about the public health issues that are confronting
all of us.  We talked about COVID-19 and the work we have already done
as an administration to assist Honduras and the work we will continue to
do.   
   
The President has a particular interest in addressing the pediatric
needs of her population, and so we discussed some of the detail in that
regard.   
   
It was a good discussion.  It was in depth.  There were many due outs. 
And we look forward to a partnership, and we feel very optimistic about
the future potential of this relationship.  
   
Q    Madam Vice President Harris, when you compare the three Northern
Triangle countries, are there different things that each of them needs? 
Because you’ve gone to Guatemala — you’ve been there.  You’ve been to
Honduras for the first time.  What are the differences that three
different countries need?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  One aspect of this that I fully appreciate is that
they do not want to be considered — nor are they are they — a monolith. 
So each country has its own identity, its own culture, its own history,
and that should be respected.  Which is why you will see that I rarely,
if ever, refer to it as the “Northern Triangle,” because that then
treats it as a monolith when it is not.  
   
So — but there are commonalities to be sure, but of different
proportions, on the issue of what they need in terms of economic
systems, for example.  There are commonalities that are true for the
entire Western Hemisphere in terms of the impact of the climate crisis,
and that — what that means in terms of our ability for farming, for an
agricultural economy.  There are commonalities in terms of the concern
that we have about corruption.  Certainly, commonalities about irregular
migration, including the use of human smuggling and human
trafficking.   
   
But there are varying degrees in each.  And for that reason, our level
of attention to each issue is different and is moderated based on the
needs of that particular country.   
   
Q    Madam Vice President, one thing we didn’t see in the — in the
readout today: We did not see anything about China.  I‘m wondering if,
either in your conversations today or your conversations in December,
this is — China, Taiwan and that relationship — is something that came
up, and how you addressed it?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, we did not discuss China.  But, certainly,
you probably know the Vice President of Taiwan was there.  He came up
and introduced himself to me.  And the brief conversation that we had
was really about a common interest in this part of the region and,
apparently, Taiwan’s interest in our Root Causes Strategy.  
   
Q    Can you reflect on the retirement of Justice Breyer and what role
you’re going to play in advising the President as he makes his
decision?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, as a — my entire life as a practicing
attorney, I will tell you, I have a great deal of respect for Justice
Breyer and his legacy and his commitment, and particularly to those
words etched in the United States Supreme Court outside wall, “Equal
Justice Under Law.”  He has truly been a champion of equal justice under
law.  
   
And as it relates to his retirement, I wish him well, of course, and
thank him for his legacy.   
   
But the President and I will work closely together on this and the
selection process.  And I’ll (inaudible) the President will make his
choice about who will be the next person to fill Justice Breyer’s
seat.   
   
Q    He said in particular, you’re going to help advise him on that.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  
   
Q    Vice President Harris, you were nodding your head during the speech
of Castro talking about corruption.  Can you just talk about — a little
bit about what you were feeling when she was talking about that
passionately?   
   
And also, a lot of the American people are concerned that things won’t
move fast enough.  How soon do you think this relationship could
materialize into some positive impact?  
      
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great question.  So, I was impressed with the
passion with which she took about — talked about her priority on
addressing and combating corruption in this country.   And that fuels my
optimism about our ability to partner on that issue because, again, it
is a priority issue for us in terms of our Root Causes Strategy and any
investment in this country going forward.  
   
I think that on the issue of what this will mean in terms of the
timeline, the Root Causes Strategy has always been clear, and we have
been clear: The work we need to do is going to be work that will
manifest over a long period of time — hopefully not too long, but
certainly not overnight.   
   
The problems that we need to address are problems that did not occur
overnight.  And the solutions, if they’re going to have any impact, will
not occur overnight.  
   
Thank you.
