Q    Mr. President, how are you feeling?  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  I’m feeling great, and I learned a lot hanging out
with the President.  (Laughter.)    
   
Q    Mr. President, what’s it like to be home?  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  It feels great.  You know, I know it sounds silly, but
there’s so many Irish Americans, like my relatives, who got here and got
to America in 1844, ’45, and ’46 who’ve never been back here.  And they
talk about it.  
   
The interesting thing — and I know many of you have the same experience
with your ancestry wherever the country of origin was.  But you hear all
these stories about, you know, what it was like back in Ireland, and
they heard from their parents and grandparents and
great-grandparents.   
   
And the thing — on my first trip over here, when I went to the Boyne,
and I looked down and I — my Grandfather Finnegan used to say — his
grandfather, Owen Finnegan, in Scranton, used to say, “Scranton,
Pennsylvania is just like the Boyne Valley.”  And I thought, “How could
that be?”  Well, you stand there and you look.   
   
In Scranton, there’s a river that runs through it called the Lackawanna
River and a mountain on either side and the valley.  And where we lived,
if you look down and see — you could see how, 100 years earlier, it
would be — it would look like the Boyne.  And there’s all those
things.  
   
Anyway, it’s just so great to always have an excuse to come back.   
   
Q    Mr. President, could you give an update on that leak investigation
— the leaked documents from DOD?  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  I can’t right now.  There’s a full-blown investigation
going on, as you know, with the intelligence community and the Justice
Department.  And they’re getting close.  We don’t — I don’t have an
answer for you.  
   
Q    How concerned are you about this leak?   
   
Q    Mr. President, just to press you on that —  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  I’m not —  
   
Q    — are British secrets safe in American hands, Mr. President?  
   
Q    Yeah, are you concerned about the leak?  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, I — I’m not concerned about the leak because —
I’m concerned that it happened, but there’s nothing contemporaneous that
I’m aware of that is of great consequence right now.   
   
Q    Mr. President, I’m a reporter from Belfast.  And you’re ringing the
Peace Bell, which was put forward in 2008 by Mary McAleese to mark the
10th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.  So that’s the
significance of the Peace Bell.  Twenty-five years on from the Good
Friday Agreement, what are your hopes for the next 25 years for the
people of Ireland — both jurisdictions?  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Gets even closer; that the — I hope that the — that
the government begins to function as it used to in terms of functioning
as a representative body in the north.  I think that’s necessary.  And —
but that’s for you all to decide, not for me to decide.  
   
But I think that I’m very — I’m very proud of my colleague, George
Mitchell.  I think he did a fine job.  As he said, “Three hundred
\[sic\] days of failure and one day of success.”  And we got to build on
that one day continually.  
   
Thanks.  
   
Q    Mr. President, can I have a selfie?  (Laughs.)  No, it’s “no” to a
selfie.  A selfie, Mr. President, very quickly?  Just over here.   
   
Thank you.  I’m Henry McKean from Newstalk Radio Ireland.  Lovely to
meet you.   
   
(The President takes a photograph.)   
   
Q    Mr. President, why do Irish shoemakers make great presidents?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Isn’t that amazing?  Isn’t that amazing?  My
great-great-grandfather left from the same port five weeks later after
Barack’s great-grand- — great-great-grandfather.  And the idea that they
both would seek a new life and think that their great-great-grandsons
would end up being President of the United States is remarkable.  It’s
just like — but that the Irish of it.  
   
Thanks.
