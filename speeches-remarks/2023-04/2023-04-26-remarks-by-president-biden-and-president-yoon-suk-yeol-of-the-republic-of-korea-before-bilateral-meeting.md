Oval Office

11:16 A.M. EDT  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, Mr. President, a friend, we’re honored to
celebrate with you the 70th — the 70th anniversary of our alliance with
you, with Korea.  And the — and as President Eisenhower said all those
years ago — he said, quote, “The security of an individual nation in a
free world depends upon the security of its partners.”  
   
And today, I’m proud to say, Mr. President, I think that our partnership
is ready to take on any challenges we may face.   
   
We see it in the Indo-Pacific, where our alliance is the linchpin of
regional security and prosperity.  
   
And we see it — we see it in the Indo-Pacific, where our alliance is the
linchpin of that security.  And we see it in our defense of democratic
values — from the ROK leading the next Summit for Democracy, to our
shared commitment to stand with Ukraine as it defends its democracy
against Russia’s assault.   
   
And we also see it in the way we’re doubling down on our cooperation as
allies, even as the DPRK ramps up its challenges.  
   
And we see it in our growing economic cooperation.  ROK businesses are
investing billions in the United States.  And together, we’re building
the future — everything from electric vehicles and batteries, to solar
power, to semiconductors.  
   
Mr. President, I want to thank you and your courageous, principled
diplomacy with Japan, which strengthens our trilateral partnership.  It
makes an enormous difference.  
   
I’m looking forward to our meeting today.  And most importantly, I’m
looking forward to the future our countries will forge together.  
   
Thank you for being here.

PRESIDENT YOON:  (As interpreted.)  Mr. President, thank you very much
for your warm welcome once again.  It is indeed meaningful for me to
talk to you here at the Oval Office. 

This is the very place where the presidents of the United States strive
to realize a nation that embodies the spirit of the Constitution written
by the Founding Fathers.

I suppose that many important decisions regarding the Republic of Korea
were also made at this office.  I believe I was only able to be here
today as a consequence of all those moments of history.

The journey of the ROK-U.S. alliance over the past 70 years proves that
our predecessors’ decisions were right and wise.

Korea rose from the ashes of war and has become one of the leading
countries of the international community.  Now, the ROK-U.S. alliance is
not only the linchpin of peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula but
also across the globe.

Mr. President, our alliance is an alliance of values based on our shared
universal values of freedom and democracy.  It is not a contractual
relationship of convenience only seeking for interest.  Guided by our
shared values, our alliance is an everlasting partnership. 

The ROK-U.S. alliance is also resilient.  Together, we can resolve any
issues between us through close consultations.   
   
This is the reason that the ROK-U.S. alliance is now transforming into a
true global alliance.

Mr. President, attempts to alter status quo by force, supply chain
fragmentation and disruption, challenges in food and energy security are
threatening global peace and stability.

As a value alliance, we can together play a critical role in navigating
through all of these challenges, Mr. President.

Mr. President, our summit talks today will set a historic milestone for
the alliance, marching anew toward the peace and prosperity of the world
as a global alliance.  
   
(The leaders shake hands.)  
   
PRESIDENT YOON:  (Inaudible.)

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Agreed.

All right.  Thank you all.  
   
Q    Mr. President, a comment on your reelection, sir?

Q    (Inaudible) call with Xi, Mr. President?   
   
(Cross-talk.)  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  We’ll see you in the Rose Garden.  
   
Q    Mr. President, a comment on your reelection, sir?

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Underway.
