Q    Mr. President, have you spoken to Evan Gershkovich’s family?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I tried to get them yesterday.  We missed calls.  I
called them yesterday, and we missed calls.  I’m going to try them from
the plane.  
   
Q    Try them from the plane?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  Because —  
   
Q    That’s Evan Gershkovich’s family?   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  
   
Q    Anything you can say about his case?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you know, we’re making it real clear that it’s
totally illegal what’s happening, and we declared it so.  It changes the
dynamic.  
   
Q    What’s your top priority on this trip, sir?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Make sure the Irish accords and the Windsor agreement
stay in place, to keep the peace.  That’s the — that’s the main thing. 
And it’s look like we’re going to — keep your fingers crossed.  
   
Q    Is your family coming with you on the trip?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Just two of my family members who hadn’t been there
before.  
   
Q    And on the abortion pill ruling, what are your thoughts?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  My thoughts are: It’s completely out of bounds what the
judge did.   
   
Thank you.
