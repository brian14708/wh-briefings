*Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator  
Los Angeles, California*  
(April 17, 2023)

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Hi, everyone.  Good afternoon.  Have a seat.  I
think there are chairs.  Yes.  (Laughs.)  
   
Thank you, Evette, for that.  It has been my absolute joy to be here,
and I could actually spend days here.   
   
Matt, as I told you, I am so excited about the work that you and this
team are doing here.   
   
And as many of you know, I travel the country and I also travel the
world.  And truly, the work that is happening at LACI is a model — a
worldwide model around what happens when we invest in talent, when we
invest in innovation, when we invest in people who have really great,
smart ideas born out of an understanding and a belief that we can create
things that have never been done before and it will forever change the
world.   
   
You know, I think about innovation as being the pursuit of that, right? 
The pursuit of what makes us more efficient, more accurate, faster —
right? — more relevant to the needs of the people.  We don’t engage in
innovation because we’re bored with things the way they’ve been.  It’s
the pursuit of doing things better than we have done and seeing what is
possible, unburdened by what has been.  And that’s the very work that’s
happening right here.   
   
And congratulations to you, Matt, and the whole team for what you are
doing.  
   
I had the privilege of — of touring the facility and speaking with
entrepreneurs like Evette.  And they’re solving problems.  They’re
solving problems.   
   
What you’re doing in terms of the incubation without — with the eye to
and intentionality of also ensuring that we’re also including people who
historically have not been invested in by VCs, and looking at it through
the lens of life experience and race and gender.  And what you’re doing
then is really fueling innovation, understanding that the more people
that are participating with the diversity of life experience and
perspective, the more interesting and relevant and exciting the
innovation will be.  All of that is happening right here.   
   
So I’ve met with entrepreneurs during this brief tour, and I’m coming
back — I’m telling you, I’m coming back — who, through life experience,
understand: Hey, we have plenty of members of our community who need to
get where they need to go in terms of transportation but may not be able
to afford a car, but they have needs.  They have life needs just like
anyone.  And they also have an interest in investing in transportation
in a way that it is going to produce clean energy, that it is not going
to contribute in terms of carbon — right? — and pollution — what it is
going to do to bring down greenhouse gas emissions.   
   
And so we have people here who have been benefited by the work of LACI
who are doing creative things like piloting an approach that is about
electric bicycles to inner-city communities to get it to parents, to get
it to individuals.   
   
And guess what?  It’s like they say: You build it, and they will come. 
You’re building it, and they’re right there.   
   
Stand up, young man.  Mr. Jones, wasn’t it?  Come with — the work you’re
doing.  (Applause.)  
   
It’s so exciting.  He showed me his bike.  He’s got an electric one. 
He’s got a regular one.  Right?  Giving it to folks on a — at a
rent-free lease for a month.  And then they’re going to check on the
bikes after they’ve given them out in the community, and people are
using them and logging hundreds of miles on the bike.   
   
You’re showing that when you build it — if you have some sense of what
folks need and you build it and you invest in their aspirations for
their lives, it’ll work in a way that is an approach that we haven’t
seen before but is sorely needed.   
   
You know, this is the thing that I really am so excited about when we
think about this new economy we’re all building — a clean energy
economy.   
   
Because, yes, we have very clear goals: We want to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions.  We want to save this precious planet of ours.  We want clean
air.  We want clean water.  We want to invest in innovations that also
will make the cost of living for families less expensive.  But it’s also
about tapping into things that communities have long wanted, but these
things have just not been available.  So we’re really doing a lot here. 
We’re really doing a lot here.   
   
And I want to thank SBA Administrator Isabel Guzman for being here. 
(Applause.)  She and I have travelled the country together and highlight
the work of our small businesses and our entrepreneurs.   
   
You know, I think that when we think about the SBA, it’s about small
businesses, and — but entrepreneurs are also small businesses.  I’ve
started to use the two phrases together, because we don’t want to leave
anyone out because they’re the same kind of people.  They actually are
the same people.  So I want to thank you, Administrator Guzman.  
   
I want to thank Supervisor Hilda Solis for being here and all the work
you are doing.  (Applause.)  
   
Matt was talking extensively about the partnerships.  It is about
public-private partnership.  It’s about nonprofit.  It’s about the
private sector.  It’s about government from local, state, and federal
levels having the ability to see what’s possible, having the courage to
— to invest in these — these new approaches.  And I want to thank
you.   
   
And then I want to thank the leaders from labor who are here, in
particular IBEW, for the work that you do — (applause) — in terms of
skilling — upskilling and training.   
   
We’ve talked extensively about the fact that, you know, as I travel the
country and as I travel the world, I meet with folks who are thinking
about investing in a clean energy economy as manufacturers, as those who
are doing the training and the apprenticeships.   
   
And one of the points that we discussed during our tour this afternoon
is I think we, collectively, as a community, should also challenge
ourselves when we’re thinking about the jobs that we are creating —
because we’re creating a lot of jobs, right? — but think about the jobs
in a way that I would challenge us to not just think of a title.  I
would challenge us to not just think of a degree, but to devi- — define
and advertise the job based on the skill that the job requires.    
   
Because for the private sector, for the employers who are feeling
challenged in many places that “is the workforce there?” — the workforce
will come if they’re really clear about the skill that they need to
develop to do the job.    
   
And so, let’s think a little bit more about how we are defining the jobs
based on the skill because that will also then speak to the educators to
know what they should be teaching to meet the demand and the need.  And
it will speak to the folks who already have the skills, who think this
new economy isn’t about them.    
   
We were just talking, for example, about the work that is happening —
where are you? — we — we were talking about the work that you’re doing
to convert diesel trucks to clean energy.  There you are.  Stand and
wave.  Let everybody see you.  (Applause).   
   
And transitioning, you know, this diesel truck that’s on its last wheels
— (laughs) — I got jokes — (laughter) — and transitioning it to give it
10 more years of its lifespan, transitioning it to being an electric
vehicle.  
   
And, as we were discussing it, because he’s talking about not only doing
the work of transitioning it but the folks who are going to actually do
the actual work — right? — of changing its composition so that it can
then be an electric vehicle, well, we would have all traditionally
called that person a “mechanic.”  But now we’re calling the person who’s
doing the EV stuff a “technician.”  It’s the same skill.  
   
So, again, let’s think about this in that way that — you know, we got
some fancy new titles, but we are talking about — we’re talking about
folks who have the skills who have been doing the work for years and
generations, and their skills transfer into this new economy.  
   
It’s so exciting.  It’s so exciting.  (Applause.)  
   
So, I want to talk specifically then about what you’re doing here at
LACI.   
   
So, as I mentioned, it really is a worldwide model.  I just — many of
you know — took a trip to the continent of Africa, and I met with some
incubators there.  And the work that is happening here is a model,
literally, for folks around the country who are investing in
entrepreneurs, small businesses to do this work in the clean energy
economy.  
   
And this place then, for those who don’t know, is basically a one-stop
shop.  They are doing everything from training up the folks to have the
skills to work the jobs that are in the clean energy economy to
investing in the entrepreneurs.  I think you — at least $50,000 of — of
investment in what folks need in terms of entrepreneurs is in seed
funding.   
   
The work that is happening here is also about access to capital —
something I’ve worked on for years, even when I was in the Senate — what
we need to do to expand access to capital for our entrepreneurs, our
small businesses, our community-based brilliant people.  Because so
often, when they go to what we would otherwise refer to as a “big bank,”
the folks who are there don’t necessarily understand the talent, the
skills, the capacity, or the need of individual communities.    
   
But there are a certain type of funders, like what’s happening at LACI,
who do get it and then invest in it.  (Applause.)  And that’s what
produces what we’re seeing here today.    
   
And then I just want to talk about — again, back to the point about the
interconnection between the work that is happening here, local
government, state and federal; the work that Administrative Guzman knows
that we’ve been doing at the federal level; and the work that President
Biden cares so deeply about: is ensuring that we boost where we need to
be as a domestic economy in a way that invests in where it is all
heading.  And that is about a clean energy economy.  
   
We are very proud that we, through the Inflation Reduction Act, combined
with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, have invested what we — and then
actually some of the other things, including what we have done in terms
of CHIPS and Science — the CHIPS and Science Act — we have calculated
that we are investing in the area of $1 trillion dollars over the next
10 years.  (Applause.)  
   
And just imagine what that means as the boost, as the leapfrog into
where we need to be, because we’ve lost some time over the last few
years.   
   
And then think about it also in terms of: That’s the — the federal
government piece — and what that will do to spur private investment; and
the synergy and what that will create; and the exponential growth of
financial investment, which means an investment in human capacity; and
the innovation to get us where we can be.  
   
So we are all sitting in these positions at this very moment in time,
and I think history is going to show this was a pivotal moment.   
   
And for us to all be here with the excitement that we have and the
motivation and, dare I say, the ambition, I think, generations from now,
they will look back at this moment and see that it truly was an
inflection point.  
   
So let us just continue to lead with the ambition, to promote and invest
in the aspirations, and to do all of this in the best interest of the
health, safety, and wellbeing of this beautiful planet.  
   
I thank you all very much.  Have a good afternoon.  Thank you. 
(Applause.)
