Dublin Airport  
Dublin, Republic of Ireland

THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, hello, hello.  Is this working?  There you go. 
Well, how are you?  (Applause.)  God love you.  
   
So great to see you all.  
   
PARTICIPANT:  Welcome to Donegal!  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah. I’m with you.  God bless Ireland.  (Applause.) 
Well, I’ll tell you what, the Taoiseach is here, you know.  And our
ambassador is here.  (Applause.)  
   
Taoiseach, come on over here, Leo.  Come on.  This is a guy who has
become — I don’t want to hurt his reputation politically, but, in
addition to us being allies, we’re also friends.  This is a good man
right here.  
   
And, by the way — and Claire Cronin.  Come here, Claire.   
   
(Inaudible.)  (Microphone disconnects.)  (Microphone reconnects.)  
   
And at the time I ran as a 26-year-old (inaudible) council and then as a
senator, I’ve had overwhelming support from the American firefighters. 
And there’s an expression: God made man, then he made a few
firefighters.  (Laughter.)  Then he made a few firefighters.  Because
who else is crazy enough to run into a fire?   
   
By the way, I was raised in aa little town called Claymont, Delaware,
when we moved from Scranton, Pennsylvania.  And Claymont, Delaware, was
an old steel town.  And I went to my — my sister and I and brother went
to a little Catholic school called Holy Rosary.   
   
And right across the street was the Claymont Fire Hall.  Everybody I
grew up with either became a cop, a firefighter, or a priest.  I
couldn’t qualify for any, so here I am.  (Laughter.)  That’s how I got
here.  
   
Anyway, thank you all.  Thank you, thank you for being here.   
   
(Turns to address children in the audience.)  And, by the way, who are
these guys over here?  Who are these guys?  Holy mackerel.  Look at all
these.  Hi, guys.  How are you?   
   
AIDE:  It’s not going to go that far.     
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I think it will go close.  Well, maybe it won’t.  Here
you go.   
   
How you all doing?  
   
CHILD:  Mr. President —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  How are you doing?   
   
CHILD:  — will you sign (inaudible) please?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Can I sign?  I promise I’ll sign it.  It’s good to see
you guys.  Chilly?  
   
CHILD:  Yes.   
   
CHILD:  Yeah.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible.)  Thank you all so very much.   
   
And, by the way, to all the parents, I want to thank you because, you
know, being — working at an embassy, everybody thinks, back home, it’s
pretty glamourous.  But I don’t want — you don’t want to be around the
day you got to walk home and tell your 13-year-old kid, “You’re not
going back to the same school and you got to stop dating that girl you
were with and that boy you liked very much.  You’re not going to be
around.”   
   
So, I want to thank the kids, too.  I really mean it.  Thank you, thank
you, thank you for taking care of your moms and dads.  Thank you.   
   
Any of you guys want to ask me any questions?   
   
CHILD:  Yeah.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  What do you want to ask me?   
   
Whoa, the Air Force — there’s Air F- — look at this.  It’s Air Force
One.  Right here.  It’s pretty cool, man.   
   
MR. HUNTER BIDEN:  In the back.  He’s got a question. 

THE PRESIDENT:  What’s your question?  
   
CHILD:  What’s the top step to success?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  What’s the top what?  
   
CHILD:  Step — steps — step to success.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  What’s the top step to succ- — to success?  
   
CHILD:  Yes.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, well, making sure that we don’t all have COVID. 
What — why — what are we talking about here?  
   
CHILD:  Like —  
   
MR. HUNTER BIDEN:  If you can — what’s the — what’s the key to
success?     
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, what’s the key to success?  You know what I found
out is the key to success is?  And I’m not sure I’m the best guy to
explain it; these guys can tell you.  
   
The key to success is whenever you disagree with someone, it’s okay to
question their judgment — whether they’re right or wrong — but it’s
never okay to question their motive.  If you question their motive, then
you never get to be able to agree.   
   
For example, if you say to somebody, “The reason why you don’t agree
with me is because you are stupid, you are bad, you are — you just don’t
like the people I like.”   
   
Instead of saying I just didn’t — just tell you why, I disagree with you
because of the following things.  Because once you question somebody’s
motive — why they’re doing something — because you don’t know.  In fact,
what happens after that, you can never get an agreement, get
together.   
   
I learned that lesson a long time — I say to that to all the embassy
folks, too — I learned that a long time ago.  
   
There was a guy named Jesse Helms from South Carolina — from North
Carolina — South Carolina.   
   
MR. HUNTER BIDEN:  North.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  — North Carolina.  And he was a very conservative guy
who was very, very — not very crazy about African Americans when he got
here.  He was all — we always had fights.   
   
And one day, I was going into the United States Senate, and Jesse Helms
said — was — was on the floor of the Senate saying some terrible things
about Ted Kennedy and Bob Dole, the Republican leader, who both had
introduced a bill for making sure people with disabilities have access
to curb cuts, access to buses, and all these things.  It’s called the
Americans with Disabilities Act.   
   
And what happened was, I was very upset when I walked in to go see the
Majority Leader when I heard this debate.  And unfortunately, I was more
afraid of the Majority Leader being late than — than I was to go and
talk.   
   
I walked in, and I guess I looked like I was angry.  And he looked at
me, and he said, “What’s the matter, Joe?”  I was 32 years old.  And I
said — and I went on about Jesse Helms, that he has no social redeeming
value.  “How could he possibly say things like that?”  I couldn’t
believe it.   
   
And he looked at me and he said, “Joe, what would you say if I told you
that Jesse Helms, in 1970, sitting in his living room with his wife,
Dot, in Raleigh were reading the paper.  And there was a photograph of a
young man on crutches — 16 years old, with braces from under his arms
all the way down to his ankles, and two steel crutches.”  And I said,
what would you — and — “It was an advertisement for an orphanage.  And
it said, ‘All I want is someone to take me home for Christmas and love
me.’”   
   
He said, “What would you say, Joe, if I told you they adopted that young
man?”  I said, “I’d feel foolish.”  Well, they did adopt him.  They did
adopt him.   
   
And I said — and I went and apologized to Jesse Helms, because the idea
that I disagreed with everything he said, but when he — but the
suggestion that he’s doing it because he didn’t care about people with
disabilities was wrong.  I questioned his motive.  I never did that
again.   
   
That’s a long answer to a real quick question.  (Laughter.)  
   
Yes.   
   
CHILD:  How is your dog doing?   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  My dog is doing well.  (Laughter.)  His name is
Commander.   
   
CHILD:  Yeah?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  What’s your doggie’s name?  
   
CHILD:  Louie.  
   
PARTICIPANT:  Louie.

THE PRESIDENT:  Louie!  All right.  

THE PRESIDENT:  Anyway, guys —  
   
MR. HUNTER BIDEN:  You’re supposed to do the rope line, Dad.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m supposed to do the rope line?   
   
MR. HUNTER BIDEN:  Just to say hi to everybody.  (Inaudible.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  All right.  Well, guys, thank you.
