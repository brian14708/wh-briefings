VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Good afternoon.  Mr. Prime Minister, welcome to
Washington, D.C.  It is very good to see you.   
   
This is our fourth substantive discussion over the course of the last
couple of years.  And it is my great pleasure to host you here at the
White House and to continue the conversation that you and I started
quite some time ago.  
   
When we first spoke over a year ago, it was to coordinate our respective
responses after Russia launched its unprovoked attack on Ukraine.  I
have since traveled to Warsaw in March of 2022, where you graciously
hosted me, and we demonstrated to the world the strength of our alliance
in the face of Russia’s aggression.  
   
While there, it was also my honor to meet with President Duda, to meet
with Polish and American troops who are working together and — and
working to defend NATO’s eastern flank.  
   
I also, while I was there, had the opportunity to meet with refugees who
are in Poland thanks to the gracious welcome that they have received by
the Polish people.  And I met with them there to talk about the
concerns, of course, that they have — having had to flee their home
country.  
   
Again, you and I spoke last September to build on these meetings and to
discuss cooperation on European energy security, after which my na- — my
national security advisor, who is here behind some of these cameras,
traveled to Warsaw on my behalf to follow up on the conversation that
you and I had.  
   
And then, since, of course, my trip to Warsaw, President Joe Biden has
traveled twice to your country.  And my husband, the Second Gentleman,
traveled to Krakow earlier this year to commemorate International
Holocaust Remembrance Day at Auschwitz, which was, of course, an
historic visit that was incredibly meaningful to him personally, as it
was for millions of Jewish Americans.  
   
These visits, Mr. Prime Minister, and meetings reaffirm the very strong
alliance between the United States and Poland.  
   
And I might say that our — the strength of our relationship has only
increased over the last couple of years, to the great pleasure of the
American people.   
   
Poland is a valued ally, a partner, and a friend, and we have an
enduring relationship based on shared priorities and democratic
values.  
   
So today is a continuation of the conversation that you and I started
some time ago, and I look forward to strengthening and continuing to
strengthen the relationship between our two nations.  
   
Welcome again.  
   
PRIME MINISTER MORAWIECKI:  Thank you.  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Welcome.   
   
PRIME MINISTER MORAWIECKI:  Thank you.  Thanks for having me, Madam Vice
President.  You’ve presented the history of our meetings, so I will jump
onto the — on the point of what we are going to discuss.   
   
Well, like it is said that in politics there are no friendships, only
interests.  But I — I think that there is more than only interests
between the United States and — and Poland.  
   
Warsaw and Washington are two poles of Western civilization and the
current situation in Ukraine.  And not only this, we had a brief chat
about Africa just before this meeting.  And it’s so visible to me, so
clear to me that we have to work hand in glove in many different regions
all over the world.  
   
There are no nations that love freedom as much as Poles and Americans,
and this unites us as well.  And today, we stand together in defense of
the freedom of the Ukrainian people.  Many Americans may be asking
themselves why Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is so important for
America as well, because it is important — it’s critically important for
Europe.  That’s — that’s clear.  
   
But why also for America?  The answer is: Russia’s attack on Ukraine is
only the beginning.  The consequences of this war have already reached
the USA.  I know that, as in Poland, many American families suffer
inflation — post-pandemic, post-energy crisis — and, as we call it,
“Putinflation” — inflation triggered by Russian attack on Ukraine.   
   
And after the fall of communism, Russia lay in wait for nearly three
decades.  But the resurgence of Russian imperialism is a harbinger —
harbinger of a new Cold War.  If we do not defend Ukraine, we risk a
global conflict, global crisis of difficult-to-imagine proportions.  
   
Putin will not stop in Ukraine.  I’m absolutely sure about that.  This
is why all three nations must unite and stop Russia before it is too
late.   
   
Old Europe believed in an agreement with Russia, and old Europe failed. 
But there is a new Europe — Europe that remembers what Russian communism
was.  And Poland is the leader of this new Europe.   
   
Poland wants to become a bedrock of European security, and we are on the
right track.  Poland increases defense spending this year even up to 4
percent of GDP, which was going to be one of the highest percentage
expenditures — percentagewise expenditures amongst NATO countries.  
   
Poland buys also new Abrams tanks, F- — F-35 combat aircrafts, HIMARS
multi-launch rocket systems from the United States.  And we are very
pleased with that.  We are very happy with that because we want our
defense systems to be interoperational as much as possible with — with
yours as well.  It’s — it’s very important.   
   
Poland wants to build the strongest army in Europe.  That is why we want
to cooperate with the most advanced defense industry in the world, which
is the American industry.  And Poland believes that only a strong
transatlantic alliance is the answer to this specter of imperialism,
colonialism, and nationalism — and all imperialism, not only Russia.  
   
Some European politicians, betrayed by the Russian bear, seek a deal
with others, but this is the way of dividing the West.  We have to
protect our nations from Russian propaganda.  We have to protect against
infiltration.  
   
We recently were able to break up a Russian spy network.  They are very
active all over Europe, and the Russian propaganda is enormous.   
   
Some predict the end of Western civilization.  And it is in our power to
defend our civilization.  There is one condition: We must stay united. 
We don’t want and we don’t need any kind of war.  And we work towards
peace and development and prosperity.  And this what the geopolitical
game is about.   
   
If we lose, the next generation — generations of Poles and Americans
will grow up in much more difficult conditions.  That is why I would
like to talk to Madam Vice President about strengthening our relations —
not only the military ones, but also political and economic
relations.   
   
And I want to thank you personally, Madam Vice President, the — the
entire American government, administration, President Biden, of course,
and the entire American nation for supporting Europe so strongly and for
staying united without — with us all.   
   
I can only say that just like in the times of communism, America has
once again become a source of hope for free Europe.  The relations
between Poland and the U.S. are the best in the history, but no one said
we had reached our peak.   
   
I believe that the war in Ukraine is not only the beginning of the end
of Russian imperialism but, above all, the beginning of the renaissance
of transatlantic community.  
   
Thank you.   
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.  And I’ll add, if
I may, to emphasize the point about the relationship as it relates to
security: We have been very clear — and the President has been very
clear with President Duda as well — that the United States’ commitment
to our NATO Allies is ironclad.  And the commitment of the United States
has resulted in — in fact, in increasing the number of troops, as you
know —  
   
PRIME MINISTER MORAWIECKI:  Yes.  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  — that we have sent to Poland.   
   
In fact, we have created a new permanent army headquarters because of
that.  And so, I will mention that.  
   
And then you mentioned the importance of prosperity and security as it
relates to, for example, energy security.  That is something you and I
have discussed many times, and it will be the subject of our
conversation today.  With the goal, as you and I have discussed, of
reducing reliance on fossil fuels, and emerging economies —  
   
PRIME MINISTER MORAWIECKI:  And Russian fossil fuels but all fossil
fuels.  Yes.  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Exactly right.  Exactly right.   
   
So I’m looking forward to it.  And thank you again.  Welcome.   
   
PRIME MINISTER MORAWIECKI:  Thank you.  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Thank you, all.   
   
                          END
