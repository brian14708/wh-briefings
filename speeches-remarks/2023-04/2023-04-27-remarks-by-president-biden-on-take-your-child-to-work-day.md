South Lawn

12:43 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I want to thank my Secret Service agents who
walked me out here.  And I want to thank you all, all you kids, for
bringing your parents to work.  (Laughter.)  
   
This is a good day.  Anybody supposed to have school today?  
   
AUDIENCE:  Yeah!  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  All right.  It’s a real good day then, isn’t it? 
(Applause.)

Well, it’s great to see you all.  Oh, hey, people in back of me, too. 
Hi, everybody.  
   
Well, you know what?  One of the things that, when I was — my kids were
little that I miss the most was being able to take them to work.  But I
have in my office, over in the — over in the Oval Office, I have
pictures of them on the White House lawn on days — on Bring Your Kid to
School Day — Work — today.  
   
And so — I don’t know.  Which one of you guys is going to be President
of the United States?  You got any presidents here?  All right, man. 
That’s good.  
   
You know, you got to — just got to make me a promise, though.  When
you’re President and they say, “Joe Biden is out in the waiting room
coming to see you, promise me you won’t say, ‘Joe who?’”  (Laughter.) 
You’ll remember me, okay?

CHILD:  Okay.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  All right.  Well, I’ll be darned.  Do you guys have any
questions for me?  Any of you guys — kids have a que- — yes.  
   
CHILD:  What’s it like being President?

THE PRESIDENT:  What’s it like being President?  Well, first of all,
it’s probably the greatest honor anyone in America can have bestowed on
them, number one.  
   
Number two, one of the best parts is — and I mean this sincerely — you
get to meet so many different people.   
   
And number three, it also means that you live in this house.  It’s not a
bad place to live, you know?  
   
And number four, you get to meet folks like you.  And I really mean it. 
Thank you, thank you.   
   
What’s your name, angel?

CHILD:  Hadley \[ph\].  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Hadley.  What’s — what’s your question?  
   
CHILD:  What — how many people live in the house?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  How many people live in the house?  Well, right now, the
only two people who live in the house every night of the family is Mrs.
Biden and me.  But we have — we have grandchildren and children.  
   
So I have a son who lives in California but comes once in a while with
his family.   
   
And I have a daughter who lives up in Philadelphia.  She’s a — she works
to help women who are victims of violence, and she’s a social worker. 
And every once in a while, she comes down with her husband.  
   
And then, the best part of it all, I have six grandchildren.  And I’m
crazy about them.  And I speak to them every single day.  Not a joke. 
Matter of fact, I just got finished going through the calls.  And only
one of them answered the phone.  (Laughter.)  But at least I got to
leave a message.  
   
And they’re — my oldest granddaughter is named after one of my daughters
who I — I lost in an accident a long time ago.  And her name is Naomi.  
   
And then I have number two — I have a \[grand\]daughter who works in the
environmental movement.  And her name is Finnegan and — named after my
mom.  
   
And number three, my granddaughter — I call her my “All-American girl.” 
She was a great little athlete.  And she’s about to graduate from
college in about two weeks.  And her name — her name is — she’s — the
nickname we call her is “Maisy.”  
   
And then I have two other — a granddaughter who I just spoke — did get
to speak to.  And her name is Natalie, and she is a senior in high
school about to graduate and go off to college where her daddy went to
school.  
   
And then I have a grandson who’s going to be a senior in high school.  
   
And then, now I have a new — a new baby boy.  He’s three and a half
years old.  And his daddy named him after his brother, my deceased son. 
And he’s Beau Biden.  
   
So — and guess what?  They’re crazy about me — (laughter) — because I
pay so much attention to them.  
   
Anybody else have any questions?  Yes, baby.  What do you have?  
   
CHILD:  My name is Amelia \[ph\].  And where are your — where are your
grandsons or granddaughters?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Where?  Okay.  Her name is Amelia.  She wants to know
where my granddaughters are.  
   
One granddaughter lives in — in Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia.  One
granddaughter lives in New York.  One granddaughter lives in
Washington.  One granddaughter lives in Wilmington, Delaware.  And the
other grandsons — my grandson lives in California.  
   
I left somebody out, didn’t I?  Anyway.  Philadelphia, Wilmington, and
—  
   
CHILD:  There are six, but you only said five.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I did say five.  You’re right.   
   
So, let me see.  I got one in New York, two in Philadelphia — or is it
three?  No, three, because I got one granddaughter who is — I don’t
know.  (Laughter.)  You’re confusing me.  But they’re all around.   
   
Wilmington, California, New York, and Philadelphia — the cities they
live in.   
   
Yes, honey.   
   
CHILD:  I’m (inaudible), and I wanted to ask: Why did you want to become
the President?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Why did I want to become the President?  Well, you know,
when I was younger, 120 years ago — (laughter) — when — when I was
younger, I was in — I lived in a state that — it was very hard for
African Americans to have a fair chance.  It was segregated by law.   
   
And so, as a high school student, I got involved in what was called the
Civil Rights Movement.  And so, one of the things that was happening in
my state was we were trying to get people to run to fight for civil
rights, and we were having trouble getting that many people to run the —
when I started off.  And they asked me to run.   
   
And I said I didn’t want to.  And then, my sister, who’s my best friend
— my sister used to be three years younger than me.  Now she’s 20 years
younger than me.  (Laughter.)  We went to the same university.  She
graduated with honors; I graduated.  
   
But she managed my campaign, and so we ran in a district where my team —
the team I belong to — hadn’t won.  And so, I said, okay, I’d run —
being the good sport.  But guess what?  We won because of my sister.   
   
And next thing I know, they — one thing had — one thing came after
another.  And then it turned out that I ended up being a senator for a
long time.   
   
And then, Barack Obama — President Obama asked me to be his Vice
President.  And then I ran for President four years later.   
   
Yes, honey.  
   
CHILD:  What’s your favorite ice cream flavor?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Now she’s talking my language.  What’s my favorite ice
cream flavor?  (Laughter.)  I may be among the dullest presidents of the
world because I’m known for two things: my Ray-Ban sunglasses and
chocolate-chip ice cream.  That’s my favorite.   
   
Down here.  Yes, what’s your — what is your question, honey?  
   
CHILD:  My question is: What makes you hopeful for the next generation
of America?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  You.   
   
He said: What makes me hopeful for the next generation of Americans?   
   
The generation of Americans from you guys to the people all the way to
their late 20s is the most open, the least prejudiced, the best
educated, and the most giving generation in American history.  For
real.  Not a joke.   
   
And that’s why I’m so hopeful.  Because in — in America, we can do
anything — anything at all — if we do it together.  For real.  There’s
not a single thing we can’t do.   
   
And what gives me the most hope is all of you guys.  For real.  And
that’s the God’s truth.   
   
At any rate, yes.  
   
CHILD:  What’s your favorite color?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  My favorite color is blue.   
   
All right.  Not because it — when I started off, it wasn’t red and blue
states.  It was — everything was — anyway — (laughter).  But that’s my
favorite color.  
   
CHILD:  How did you become a President?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I became a President by go and asking people like your
mommy and daddy — and I don’t know your mommy and daddy — but asking
them to look me over.  I’d say, “Look me over.  And if you like what you
see, help out.  If not, vote for the other guy.  But give me a look.”   
   
And — but I ran because I think America is not only the greatest nation
in the world, but we have — we can do more than any other nation to keep
peace and to help people going.  
   
I’m going to take two more.  I’m getting myself in trouble here because
your parents are saying, “When is he going to stop?”  (Laughter.)   
   
And my Secret Service agents — they’re packing, so I got to be careful
what they tell me.  (Laughter.)  
   
I’m going to go down at this end for just a minute.  Okay?  And then
I’ll finish up here.  Okay?  Hang on.   
   
Okay.  The lady in pink.  You.  
   
CHILD:  Me?  Oh.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Fire away.   
   
CHILD:  Hello.  Okay —  
   
CHILD:  (Whispers.)  What he’d eat for breakfast?  
   
CHILD:  Oh, what have you eaten for breakfast?  And also, can I have a
fist bump?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  You can have a fist bump.  And I had a bacon and cheese
on a croissant.  
   
CHILD:  Thank you.  I’m going to try that.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I mean bacon, scrambled egg, and cheese on a
croissant.  
   
CHILD:  That sounds good.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I forgot the scrambled egg.  
   
Yes, honey.  
   
CHILD:  Can I have a fist bump?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Sure, you can have a fist bump.   
   
CHILD:  Can I have a fist bump?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  You sure can.   
   
CHILD:  My name is Sophie \[ph\].  I was wondering what your biggest
accomplishment so far in the White House has been.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think the biggest accomplishment we’ve had so
far is helping people being able to get healthcare and be able to afford
healthcare.   
   
You know, people need — you know, your moms and dads and a lot of people
you know need prescription drugs.  They need a prescription to stay
healthy.  
   
I’ll give you one example.  Do you know anybody — any of you kids know
anybody who has diabetes — any kid you know?  
   
Well, guess what?  It used to be, when I came to the office, that to pay
for the diabetes for a month, a lot of parents had to pay three, four,
five hundred dollars a month.  
   
CHILD:  That’s a lot of money.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I was able to change it.  They don’t have to pay
more than — they’re not going to have to pay more than $35 a month for
that.  Those kinds of things.  
   
The other thing is, I think one of the biggest things is — and it’s —
it’s not complicated, but it is a little bit.  There is a concern when I
got elected whether or not — I’ll — I’ll get your question — (laughter)
— there is a concern that — whether or not we would hold all of our
allies together, the people in Europe — France, England, Italy, Germany
— to stay with a thing called “NATO,” the North Atlantic Treaty
Assembly.  And we’ve always been able to keep the peace since World War
Two that way.   
   
And so, I spent a lot of time pulling all those folks together to stay
on the same page to take on the Russian aggression, what they’re doing
to the poor people in Ukraine.   
   
And so, I think I’d consider that an accomplishment.  
   
And the third thing I think is an accomplishment is that, you know, we
have to — to be the strongest and most prosperous nation in the world,
we have to have the best — what they call infrastructure: bridges,
roads, highways, Internet, all those things.   
   
And I was able to convince a lot of my Republican friends to join us. 
And so, we passed a significant bill to rebuild all our roads and all
the things that are going to make your generation much, much stronger.  
   
Yes, honey?  
   
CHILD:  Who is your biggest inspiration?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  My biggest inspiration?  Let me see.  Who — politically,
my biggest inspiration was probably Dr. Martin Luther King.  But, in
terms of personally, my biggest inspiration were my mom and my dad.   
   
My mom — for real, my dad used to say things when he was alive.  He’d
say, “Remember to be a person of your word, to be a man or a woman of
your word, you have to keep your word.  Whatever you say, you have to
commit to.  You have to stick with what you say and tell the truth.  And
it really does matter.”   
   
And my mom used to say, “Just remember, Joey: Never bow, never bend,
never kneel.  Just get up and fight back.”  And that’s for real.   
   
And so, I think my mom and dad are my two biggest inspirations.   
   
Yes?   
   
CHILD:  How many guards are in the building?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  How many guards in the building?  Well, other than the
four Secret Service people over there right in front of the podium —
but, you know, to tell you the truth, I don’t know how many there are. 
There’s a whole bunch, though.  (Laughter.)  There’s — there’s a whole
bunch.   
   
I  — I don’t know, honey.  There’s — there’s a lot.  I wish I knew the
number.  I don’t know.  
   
Yes, baby?   
   
CHILD:  What is it like in the White House?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:   Well, what’s it like in the White House?  Well, here. 
Come here.  You hang with me for a minute and I — you don’t want to go
into the White House.  Okay, all right.  (Laughter.)  Okay.  
   
CHILD:  Do you watch the Stanley Cup playoffs?  And if you do, do you
have a favorite team?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I did and I do.  The Philadelphia Flyers.  
   
CHILD:  I’m — I’m rooting for the Devils.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, you’re —  
   
CHILD:  I’m rooting for the Devils.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  All right.  That’s a good thing.   
   
CHILD:  Can I have a fist bump?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  There you go.  Hey, man.  
   
CHILD:  Can I have a sel- — a selfie?  And what was your favorite team
in the Super Bowl final round?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, let me grab that.  What was your favorite team?  
   
CHILD:  Kansas City Chiefs.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I got to admit, it was the other team for me.  But
Kansas City is pretty cool.   
   
You ready?  There you go.  
   
CHILD:  Can I see?  Can I try?   
   
What do I say?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Whatever you want to say.  Want to make a speech?   
   
CHILD:  Yeah.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  What’s your name?  
   
CHILD:  Yuri \[ph\].   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Did you have a question?  
   
CHILD:  Yes.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Want to tell me what it is?  
   
CHILD:  Yuri Newman \[ph\].  (Laughs.)  
   
WOMAN:  He said Yuri Newman.  (Laughter.)  
   
CHILD:  That sounds crazy.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Can’t answer that one.  
   
CHILD:  What was the last country you traveled to?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  The last country I’ve traveled — I’m thinking what’s the
last one I was in.  I’ve — I’ve been to 89 — I met with 89 heads of
state so far.  So, I’m trying to think.   
   
What was the last — where was the last place I was?  It’s hard to keep
track.  
   
CHILD:  Ireland!   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I was — I mean, yeah, you’re right.  Ireland. 
(Laughter.)  That’s where it was.  How’d you know that?  
   
CHILD:  I’m going to Ireland, too.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, you’re kidding me?  All right, man.  
   
CHILD:  I’m visiting my nan and grandad.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  
   
Yes?   
   
CHILD:  What is your favorite rose in the Rose Garden?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  My favorite rose is the white rose.  And the reason
that’s my favorite rose is that that’s the rose I always give my wife:
the white rose.   
   
Folks, I’m keeping you a long, long time.  And I promise I’ll answer
some questions back here.  But let me just say to — you know, your mommy
and daddies are doing really important work, for real.  
   
And, you know, in America, you’re allowed to have really different
points of view.  You can really disagree on which direction you think as
you — that we should take the country, whether we should be spending
money on this program or that program, or we should be dealing with one
country or another.  
   
But in the past, we’ve always, at the end of the day, come together. 
We’ve always come together.  And so, the most important thing to
remember is that —  
   
Let me — you know, America is the most unusual country in the world and
we — for you little kids, “unique” — meaning there’s not any other
country like it.  
   
Most countries become countries because they are all the same religion
or they’re all the same ethnicity or they all have the same
backgrounds.  They’re all — all very similar.  
   
But America is the only country that was built on an idea.  And no
matter how young you are, I hope you remember the idea.  And that is
that we’re based not on where we live, not the geography.  We’re based
on this idea — and this is true.  It says: We hold these truths to be
self-evident that all men and women — all men and women are created
equal, endowed by their Creator, endowed by God, with certain
inalienable rights — meaning rights that they just — they have just
because they’re born.  And those rights are life — to have a good life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  
   
No other country is based on that idea.  No other country in the world. 
That’s what makes us so special.  And that’s what makes us the envy of
the world.  
   
And I tell you, your moms and dads — both in the press, as well as in
government — they allow us to be able to make it work.  We’ve never
completely reached our goal, but we’ve never walked away from it.  
   
So, remember: In America, you should be able to do anything.  You can
accomplish anything.  And there’s an awful lot of people who have become
very, very, very consequential and done incredible things for America
because we afford them access to an education, we afford them access to
be able to do neat things.  
   
So, thank you, thank you, thank you.  I can see everybody is going,
“Slow it up, Biden.  We better get this — get back to work.”  
   
But thank you, thank you, thank you.  
   
I wish I could take more of your questions.  But I — (applause) — I’m
going to say hi back here.  Thank you.  (Laughs.)  
   
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Appreciate it.  
   
(The President speaks to another group of children.)  
   
Hey, guys.  I didn’t ask — let you guys ask me any question.  What do
you —  
   
CHILD:  I’m (inaudible).  And what are you going to do to ensure the —
the healthcare and money for the employees of the White House?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  What am I going to do to make sure we have healthcare
for the employees of the White House?  We’re going to make sure that we
tell the American people what we’re doing and why everybody — if
everybody paid their fair share in taxes, the super-wealthy — like
regular people pay their fair share — we can easily afford this.  
   
You know we have a thousand billionaires in America.  They only pay 8
percent of their taxes.  Your moms and dad pay 20, 25 percent on their
taxes.  They don’t make anywhere near that.  So we just got to make sure
everybody pays their fair share.   
   
And we can do all these things.  We can do them well.  
   
Yes, honey.  
   
CHILD:  First, what’s your favorite part about being President?  And can
I have a handshake?   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  My favorite part about being President is doing what I’m
doing right now, getting to look the American people in the eye and hear
what’s on their mind.  I really mean it.  That’s my favorite part of
being President.  
   
Yes, honey.  
   
CHILD:  What’s your favorite room in the White House?   
   
And can I have — also have a ha- — a handshake?   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  My favorite room in the White House is the room that’s
off the bedroom, where I — I made it into a study where I’m able to go
in there and write my speeches and do a lot of things very quietly.   
   
And I also like that little place called the Oval Office.  That’s a
pretty neat place too.  
   
Okay?  Thank you, man.   
   
What’s your question, honey?  
   
CHILD:  When you became President, did it take you a while to get used
to everyone crowding you and taking pictures?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  Well, yeah it did a little bit.  But see I
had an advantage when I became President.  I had, for the previous eig-
— I had for eight years shown up every single day in the Oval Office as
Vice President.  So I got used to being with Barack and being in that
circumstance, so it wasn’t like all of a sudden, I was just in the
national position.  But it made it a little bit easier.  
   
I’ll take one more question here.  Then I’m going to go across and ask
for a question over here.  
   
CHILD:  Where were you born?   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s a good question.  I was born in a place called
Scranton, Pennsylvania.  In — it’s up in Pen- — it’s north of
Philadelphia.  It’s almost into New York.  But Scranton, Pennsylvania,
is where I was born.   
   
I’ll be right back.  (Applause.)  
   
CHILD:  What do you do on a daily basis?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  What do I do on a daily basis?  Well, that’s — without
getting into the whole — every morning, I have a meeting with what they
call my — the National Security Coun- — the people who are the people
who collect all the information overnight, the secrets around the world,
and fill me in on what they know is happening and not happening.   
   
And so, I sit with this tell the C- — the head of the CIA, the head of
the military, and I do that.   
   
Every morning, I meet with my Chief of Staff to find out what the most
important things are going on that day.  And then, it depends.  For
example, today I’m going to be — anyway, the — the schedule varies but —
and I meet with my press team.  And I talk to the press as well.   
   
Yes?  
   
CHILD:  What’s your favorite movie?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  My favorite movie was the new movie that was about that
guy who flies jet planes.  You know who I’m talking about?  
   
CHILD:  “Top Gun”?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  “Top gun.”  The —  
   
CHILD:  Oh, yeah, “Top Gun: Maverick.”  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Did you see — did you see “Top Gun: Maverick”?  That’s
been my favorite movie I’ve seen this year.  
   
CHILD:  Can I please have a fist bump?  
   
CHILD:  Mr. President, I heard you have to get back to the Oval Office. 
(Laughter.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  What was that?  
   
CHILD:  That’s my sister.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, hi.  How are you?  
   
CHILD:  Hi.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  You — what did you say?  I didn’t hear you.  
   
CHILD:  I said you have to get back to the — I heard you had to get back
to the Oval Office.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  And by the way, the one thing I thought when I got to be
President, I’d get to give orders.  (Laughter.)  But I take more orders
than I ever did.   
   
And you’re right, babe.  What’s your name?  
   
CHILD:  Kathleen \[ph\].   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Kathleen, what a beautiful name.  
   
Kathleen is reminding me I’ve got to get back to the office.  If I don’t
go, they’re going to get the Secret Service working on me, so I’m going
to be in trouble.   
   
Well, thank you all for taking the time.  I appreciate it.  Thank you. 
(Applause.)  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
