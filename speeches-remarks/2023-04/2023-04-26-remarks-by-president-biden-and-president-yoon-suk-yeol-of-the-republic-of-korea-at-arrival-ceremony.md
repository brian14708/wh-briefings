PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Good morning, good morning, good morning. 
(Applause.)  What a beautiful day to invite great friends back to the
White House.  And welcome to the White House.  
   
Today — today, we celebrate the ironclad alliance, the shared vision of
our future, and the deep friendship that unites the Republic of Korea
and the United States.  
   
President Yoon, Mrs. Kim, you were kind enough to host me in Seoul last
year just 10 days after your inauguration.  
   
And Jill and I, we’re honored to be able to return some of your
hospitality with your second state visit to this administration.  
   
This year marks the 70th anniversary of the alliance between our two
nations.  It’s an unbreakable bond, forged in bravery and the sacrifice
of our people, sanctified by the blood of American and Korean troops who
fought and defended liberty.  And I’m proud we are joined today by
veterans of the Korean War.  
   
Those veterans are the reason we can stand here today –(applause) — two
vibrant and innovative democracies.  We stand as strong, proud, and free
because of them.  
   
And it’s so meaningful, Mr. President, to visit the Korean War Veterans
Memorial with you last night, to lay a wreath of remembrance, to fulfill
a sacred obligation.  
   
On September 1, 1950, Corporal Luther Story performed acts of bravery
above and beyond all measure defending his brothers-in-arms on the Pusan
Perimeter in the Korean — in the Korean War.  
   
The last anyone saw of the Corporal, he was wounded, fighting off a
hostile assault to protect his company’s withdrawal.  
   
In 1951, his heroism was recognized with the Medal of Honor, but
Corporal Story’s body was never accounted for, until now.  
   
The Republic of Korea and the United States worked together to identify
Corporal Story’s remains among those buried as a Korean War Unknow- — as
a Korean War Unknown in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific.  
   
Today, we can return him to his family and to his rest, with all the
honors he deserves, because we never forget our heroes.  (Applause.)

Mr. President, over the past seven decades, our alliance has grown
stronger and more capable, and the cooperation between our people, our
commitment to one another has grown deeper across every aspect of our
partnership.  
   
Today, our economies are on the vanguard of technological development;
our nations are powerhouses of innovation; and our people, united still
by our democratic values, are taking on the challenges of the world, and
we’re taking them on together.  
   
We’re standing strong against Russia’s brutal aggression against
Ukraine, advancing an Indo-Pacific region that is free and open,
building secure and resilient supply chains and pioneering the clean
energy economy, investing together to ensure our future will be grounded
in the values that we share, which have always — always — made us
strong.  
   
Mr. President, ours is a future filled with unimaginable opportunity and
endless possibility.  Nothing — nothing — is beyond our ability to reach
when our nations and our people stand united.  We have proven that time
and again over the last 70 years.  
   
As our troops say, who still proudly serve together in the ROK to this
day: We go together.

May the — we continue that refrain of the Republic of Korea and the
United States for all the days ahead: We go together.

God bless our nations.  And God protect our troops.

Thank you.  (Applause.)

PRESIDENT YOON:  (As interpreted.)  Mr. President, Dr. Biden,
distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.

Last evening, my wife and I visited the Korean War Memorial on the
National Mall with President Biden and Dr. Biden.

There, I saw the epitaph that reads, “Our nation honors her sons and
daughters who answered the call to defend a country they never knew and
a people they never met.”

Why did they sacrifice their lives for this faraway country and for the
people they never met?  That was for one noble cause: to defend freedom.

The ROK-U.S. alliance was forged in blood as a result of our fight for
freedom.  The ROK-U.S. alliance is not a transactional relationship; it
does not operate for the sake of mere interest.  The ROK-U.S. alliance
is an alliance of values, standing together to safeguard the universal
value of freedom.  (Applause.)

Thus, the ROK-U.S. alliance is a just alliance; it is a global alliance
for the freedom, peace, and prosperity around the world.  The ROK-U.S.
alliance is an alliance in action moving toward the future.

Ladies and gentlemen, I came here to look back to the 70-year-long
history of our alliance and, with President Biden, to design the vision
for our shared future.

I came here to celebrate and congratulate on the 70th anniversary of the
alliance with pride, with joy, and with the American people. 
(Applause.)

President, Dr. Biden, I once again thank you for your kind invitation
for my state visit.  And I also thank the American people for your warm
welcome and hospitality.

Thank you.  (Applause.)
