  Convention"

*Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel  
*New York, New York**

12:13 P.M. EDT  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, NAN!  (Applause.)  Good afternoon. 
Please have a seat.  Please have a seat.  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  We love you!  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I love you.  (Applause.)  
   
Oh, good afternoon.  Well, let me start by thanking the members of our
administration who are here, members of Congress who are here, members
of the clergy, and all of the leaders who are here today.  It is truly,
truly my honor to be with everyone as we celebrate 32 years of the
National Action Network.  (Applause.)  
   
Rev, I love you.  (Laughter.)  And I thank you on behalf of all of us —
everyone — for all that you do and all that you are.  And as I have said
in public and in private many times: Rev, no matter where you are, you
are always a voice of truth, speaking about the importance of justice
for all people.  You are part of the conscience of our country.  And I
thank you for all that you do.  (Applause.)  
   
So, as we all know, last week we marked the 55th anniversary of the
assassination of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  And every year,
NAN holds this conference in April to honor Dr. King’s legacy.  
   
So, I’ll tell you, I have been reflecting recently that among Dr. King’s
many gifts was his ability to understand the present moment in the
context of a vision for a better future.  
   
So, NAN, in that spirit then, let us clearly understand the moment we
are in — a moment in which our hard-won freedoms are under attack.  
   
Because just look at where we are.  Extremists across our country attack
the freedom to vote.  They ban books to attempt to erase America’s full
history.  They attack the ability of people to love openly and with
pride.  They attack the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her
own body instead of the government.  They attack medication that for 20
years the FDA ruled as being safe.  
   
And just yesterday, in Florida, extremists there signed a six-week ban
before most women even know they are pregnant.  
   
And, NAN, isn’t it interesting that in the midst of all these attacks on
fundamental freedoms, these so-called leaders dare to tell us they are
fighting for our freedoms.  Don’t you find that interesting?  
   
Some have gone so far as to name and brand their agenda the, quote,
“Freedom Blueprint.”  
   
Don’t fall for the “okey-doke.”  (Laughter and applause.)  Don’t fall
for the “okey-doke.”   
   
Because as we know, freedom — well, it doesn’t censor books.  Freedom
does not criminalize doctors and punish women.  Freedom does not turn
off a microphone when an elected leader is speaking.  (Applause.)  
   
And, you see, as Dr. King made clear, freedom includes the ability of
all people to fully exercise their rights — rights that generations of
Americans bled and died for, rights that the people in this very room
continue to march and fight for.  
   
That is our nation’s freedom blueprint.  And that is what we stand
for.  
   
And I do believe that when you know what you stand for, you know what to
fight for.  (Applause.)  
   
And so, NAN, two of the many important fights before us — I could go on
all day if we were to articulate all of them — but two of them I’m going
to talk about this afternoon.  
   
One, the fight for our children and all people to be free from gun
violence.  (Applause.)  And, two, the fight for freedom to fully
participate in a democracy.  (Applause.)  Both fights fully on display
these last few weeks.  
   
So, just think: In our country, already, in the 104 days of this year,
there have been more than 150 mass shootings — already this year.  
   
Just think.  You’ve seen the statistics.  Gun violence is now the
number-one cause for death of children in our nation.  And a
heartbreaking one in five Americans has lost a family member to gun
violence.  
   
And, you know, while all this violence impacts all communities in
devastating ways, we know it does not do so equally.  Black people are
only 13 percent of America’s population but more than 60 percent of
homicide victims from gun violence.  
   
Meanwhile, as Rev said, we speak here while the NRA is holding its
convention in Indiana.  
   
Now, you know what they’ve called it?  They have called it a, quote,
“freedom-filled weekend.”  
   
So, we must ask: “Freedom-filled” for who, exactly?  Because it’s not
for parents who pray that their children will come home from school safe
from a classroom in Uvalde or Nashville.  Not for those who pray that
their loved ones will come home safe from a bank in Louisville,
Kentucky, from a grocery store in Buffalo, or from everyday gun violence
in communities across our nation.  
   
Let us all declare: Enough is enough.  (Applause.)  Enough is enough.   
   
And here’s the thing: The solutions — because there’s clearly a problem
— the solutions are clear.  We must have reasonable gun safety laws at
the state and the federal level.  
   
And, by the way, most gun owners agree.  Even the majority of NRA
members support background checks for all gun purchases.  
   
So, let’s reject the false choice that some are pushing to suggest that
you’re either in favor of upholding the Second Amendment or you’re in
favor of passing reasonable gun safety laws.  Let us reject that false
choice.  We’re not falling for the “okey-doke.”  
   
And let us continue to demand that leaders step up and show some courage
in statehouses and in the United States Congress — (applause) — to make
background checks universal, repeal the liability shield that protects
gun manufacturers, and to renew the assault weapons ban.  (Applause.)  
   
And I see there are a lot of cameras here, so I’ll say this.  For
everyone watching — (laughter and applause) — for everyone watching,
please be clear: The voices of students, parents, teachers, and
preachers will not be silenced, and these voices must be heard. 
(Applause.)  These voices must be heard.  They will not be discouraged
or deterred, even if using a bullhorn becomes necessary!  (Applause.) 
These voices will not be silenced.  
   
So, it’s an issue of public safety.  
   
And we also know, here at NAN and all over our country, I do believe,
that the right to public safety is not only about the freedom to learn
in a classroom without fear of an active shooter.  
   
But it is also freedom to drive to one’s mother’s house without being
killed by five lawless officers in a, quote, “SCORPIONs” unit. 
(Applause.)  
   
Rev, you and I were in together in Memphis when you eulogized Tyre
Nichols.  And I will say today what I said that day: When we talk about
public safety, was not Tyre a member of the public?  Was not Tyre also
entitled to the right to be safe?  
   
And so, then, in the name of public safety, can’t we all agree that when
there is biased policing and excessive force that it must be met with
accountability?  (Applause.)  
   
Can’t we all agree that there is much we must do to increase public
safety and that that includes the need for Congress to pass
comprehensive police reform legislation?  (Applause.)  
   
The kind of commonsense reform that, by the way, many police officers
themselves, including the Major Cities Chiefs Association, have called
for.   
   
So, we’re talking about members of Congress.  We’re talking about
statehouse legislatures.  There’s a theme here: They’re all elected by
the people — by the people.  
   
And NAN, change comes in many ways.  And one of the most direct is
through the ballot box.  (Applause.)  
   
Because in 2020 — let’s reflect — in 2020 — and I’m looking with thanks
at the leaders in this room — in 2020, because people stood in line for
hours and voted, Joe Biden and I went to the White House.  (Applause.)  
   
And in 2022, because people voted, women’s reproductive freedom in every
state ballot, from Kentucky to California, was protected.  (Applause.)  
   
We won races for secretary of state, attorney general, and governor.  
   
We flipped legislative chambers in three states and expanded our
majority in the United States Senate.  (Applause.)  
   
So, I say:  When we vote, we win.  We win.  (Applause.)    
   
And, of course, then for our right to vote to have meaning, the people
we elect, the people who reflect our values and represent our voices —
well, they too must be heard.  That, too, is what democracy is about.  
   
However, that too has come under attack.  And that was what Nashville
was all about: an attempt to silence the voices of the people.  
   
Now, can you imagine — the voice of the people was too much for these
extremists to handle.  It was just too much; they couldn’t bear it.  
   
But you see, the Tennessee Three clearly were not deterred. 
(Applause.)  
   
But those extremists couldn’t handle it, so much so that they turned off
the microphones.  (Applause.)  
   
But the Tennessee Three said, “All right, let’s pull out that bullhorn
because we will be heard.”  (Applause.)  And they channeled the cries
and the pleas and the demands of the people, and required that those
voices be heard.  
   
And then what happened?  For only the fourth time in nearly 160 years,
there was a vote there in Tennessee to expel elected legislators from
their seats — two young Black men.  
   
But 7,000 students and parents continued to march and organize and raise
their voices.  (Applause.)  And now, Justin Jones and Justin Pearson are
back in their seats!  (Applause.)  That’s right.   
   
The people spoke.  The people spoke.    
   
And that, however, was just the most recent attack that we have seen in
an attempt to silence the voice of the people — which, by the way, let’s
all be clear and we know is an attack on democracy itself.  
   
And just go back two years to see the pattern.  We can go farther back
than that, but let’s just go back two years.  In 2020, NAN helped turn
out record numbers of voters during the height of a pandemic. 
(Applause.)   
   
A vote that you anticipated and did result in, for example, an historic
$5.8 billion invested in our HBCUs.  (Applause.)   
   
A vote that resulted in the first Black woman to serve on the United
States Supreme Court.  Her name is Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. 
(Applause.)   
   
Resulted in a cap on the insulin at $35 a month for our seniors. 
(Applause.)   
   
A vote that resulted in the lowest rate of Black unemployment in the
history of the United States of America.   
   
Well, the promise — the very promise of that progress from that vote
scared a whole lot of people.  
   
And so what did they do almost immediately after the 2020 election?  In
states around our country, extremist so-called leaders started to ban
drop boxes; reject mail-in ballots; and even make it a crime to give
food and water to people standing in line to vote; proposed and passed
undemocratic laws — un-American laws.  
   
But in a democracy, there are still checks and balances.  And so, to
respond to these threats to democracy, because you voted in 2020 and we
now have a Department of Justice that actually believes in the pursuit
of justice — (applause) — we were able to double the size of the
Department of Justice’s team on voting rights enforcement.  Checks and
balances.  
   
Checks and balances also require that Congress do its job and pass the
John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. 
(Applause.)    
   
So while we are clear-eyed and see the moment we are in and, in
particular, the attacks on our democracy and our foundational principles
and values — while we fight off these attacks, I will also say, NAN, we
must also keep our eye on the affirmative agenda.  We got to do
both.      
   
Because remember: Dr. King, when he was assassinated, was on the verge
of the next phase in the rights that he was fighting for all Americans
that are about civil rights.  And he was combining that fight for civil
rights and justice with the fight for economic justice.   
   
And as Dr. King said in Memphis, we must continue the fight for economic
justice as part of our fight for civil rights.  
   
And economic justice then, we know, is our collective commitment to
equity and to make sure all people have access to opportunity. 
(Applause.)  
   
It is the fight for paid leave and affordable child care; to permanently
expand the Child Tax Credit; to cancel student loan debt; to provide
access to capital for small-business owners and entrepreneurs; to make
sure all families can buy a home; and to protect Social Security and
Medicare from attack.  (Applause.)  
   
We got to keep our eye on our affirmative agenda while we are handling
all those attacks.  Because we will not fully, I believe, achieve the
dream of freedom until it includes economic justice for all — a justice
that protects the dignity of work and basic rights of all people.  
   
So, in conclusion, NAN, there’s a lot I could say, but I’m just going to
go with this.  (Laughter.)  I think there is one bottom line that is for
sure: We all love our country.  We do.  We love our country.  That’s why
we fight so hard.  (Applause.)  We love our country.   And we stand in
the long tradition of those who have faithfully believed in the founding
principles of our nation.  
   
But at this moment, the founding principles are under attack.  And I
believe always and especially today that the strength of our nation
depends on us each to fulfill our duty — yes, I said “our duty” — to
stand and protect our democracy.  (Applause.)  
   
And so, specifically then, I will speak to the young leaders who are
here.  And, Rev, you are always lifting up our young leaders. 
(Applause.)  Remember — to the young leaders I say, remember: Reverend
Sharpton was only 16 when he founded his first organization, the
National Youth Movement.  Sixteen.  (Applause.)  Diane Nash was just 21
years old when she led the Nashville sit-ins.  John Lewis was only 23
when he spoke during the March on Washington.  
   
And it is no coincidence that the two expelled members of the Tennessee
Three are both in their twenties.  (Applause.)  
   
So, to our young leaders, I say: We hear you.  We support you.  And we
need you.  We need you.  We are all in this together, and we need you. 
(Applause.)   
   
So, to everyone here, I say: Thank you.  And God bless you.  And God
bless the United States of America.  Thank you.  (Applause.)
