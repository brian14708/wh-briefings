THE FIRST LADY:  Welcome to the Easter Egg Roll.

As your First Lady and as a teacher, I’ve seen again and again: Learning
doesn’t only happen in the classroom.  There are so many fun
opportunities to learn around us every day.  And that’s what we — why we
wanted to celebrate our Easter Egg Roll. 

So we turned the South Lawn into a school community.  What brings it to
life is all of you — your laughter, your joy, the art you create, and
the memories you take home with you.  That is what makes this event so
special.

So today, we hope you learn, explore, and grow by listening to a story
in the Reading Nook, rolling some eggs, playing with circuit boards, or
building robots — and, most of all, having fun.

Welcome to your house, the White House.  Happy Easter.  (Applause.)

Now please welcome my husband, our President, Joe Biden.  (Applause.)

  
THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning, everyone.  I’m Joe Biden, Jill’s husband. 
(Laughter.)  And welcome to the White House, your house.  And a special
thanks to the Egg Board and the American Egg Farmers, the White House
Historical Association, the National Park Service, and all the talented
performers for making this day possible.

And thanks to all the children and families for being part of such a
special White House tradition.  It’s been going on for a long time.

Hope you had a wonderful Easter weekend.  Easter is a season of joy — a
time of rebirth, renewal, faith, hope, and love.  A time to remember
that in the beauty of spring, the seeds of new opportunity are
planted.  
  
And this spring, our future fills — is filled with unlimited
possibilities that multiple and grow because of all the good people here
and throughout the country.  
  
Ladies and gentlemen, what I see, looking across the South Lawn, is a
country made up of possibilities.  Anything is possible in America if we
remember who we are and we do it together.  
  
So, have a wonderful, wonderful time here at the People’s House.  God
bless you all, and may God protect our troops. 

Happy Easter.  (Applause.)
