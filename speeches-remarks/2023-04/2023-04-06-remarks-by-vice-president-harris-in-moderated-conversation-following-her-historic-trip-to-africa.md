*National Museum of African American History and Culture  
*Washington, D.C.**

4:39 P.M. EDT  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon, everybody.  (Laughs.)  
      
AUDIENCE:  Good afternoon!   
      
MS. NABONGO:  Good afternoon.  
      
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  
      
MS. NABONGO:  It’s so nice to see you in D.C. —  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I know.  
   
MS. NABONGO:  — after seeing you in Accra.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  The last time I saw you was in Ghana.  
        
MS. NABONGO:  Yes.  
       
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Just a few days ago probably.  (Laughs.)  
      
MS. NABONGO:  Just a few days.  (Laughter.)  We have been country
hopping.  
   
And I have to say, for me, as someone — I’m an American-born Ugandan.  
      
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  
      
MS. NABONGO:  I’ve been to all 54 countries on the continent.  And I
used to work in development.  You know, I used to work for the U.N.  I
used to consult for USAID.  
      
So to receive that invitation was not only a huge honor, but, for me, I
took it as a personal call to get more involved and understand what the
country is doing on the continent.  So, thank you for the invitation.   
      
And I’m super excited to talk about what we learned on the continent
about your goals for the continent, in partnership with the United
States.  So let’s roll into it.  
      
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Okay.   
      
MS. NABONGO:  So, I think let’s start with how — or why did you decide
to travel to the continent of Africa at this time.  
      
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  So, first of all, let me thank both of you for
being such a big part of the trip.  I hope we can cover in this short
time we all have together the layers of what that trip was and the
nuances.  
      
That being said — so, as Vice President of the United States, I have now
traveled to many places around the world in my capacity as Vice
President.  I have, at this point, met with over 100 world leaders, be
they presidents, prime ministers, chancellors, or kings.   
      
And in these meetings and in these travels, it is always with a sense of
the responsibility that we have as the United States of America to be
present, to be engaged with our allies, with our partners, with people
with whom we have great interdependence and intersection in so many
ways.  
      
And so, I have traveled all over the world, practically.  And this trip
to the continent of Africa was very much in line with that approach but
with an incredible sense of optimism about what is happening on the
continent.  
      
The median age on the continent of Africa is 19.  By 2050, one in four
people occupying space on Mother Earth will be on the continent of
Africa.   
      
Think about what that means in terms of the opportunity, in terms of the
future, in terms of the obvious fact, I believe, as evidenced by the
demographics I’ve just shared, which is that what happens on that
continent will impact the entire globe.   
      
Not to mention what is the intertwined history that we have and share
with the continent.  Not to mention the history and present innovation
and ingenuity that is on that continent.  Not to mention what that
continent has done to inform culture in so many ways around the
globe.   
      
Not to mention the connection in terms of the diaspora and what that
means in terms of the untapped yet — I think, in terms of maximized —
power of the diaspora to participate in this partnership we have.  
      
And so, all of that was the motivation for the trip and — and — as
captured in the speech I gave our — our second full day there in Ghana. 
And I wrote and delivered that speech with a very clear intention, which
is to highlight the innovation and the excitement and the opportunity
and the momentum that is happening there and what should be our
engagement for so many, I think, at this point, obvious reasons.  
      
And it was also in follow-up to the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit that we
hosted here in December of last year, where our President, Joe Biden,
made clear and said from a podium: The United States is all in on
Africa.  
      
And so it was my intention to reinforce that point and to explain what
that means: “all in.”  All in as a partner, not to — to go in with a
sense of, like, this is about our benevolence.  No, this is about a
partnership with the continent and its leaders, tapping into all that is
there.  (Applause.)  
      
So, the speech I gave, as you know, was at the Black Star, at the
monument, where independence is honored, and it’s about freedom and
justice. And the speech was then — the emphasis was on the excitement
that we feel and then to also talk about, in particular, then what we
can do to uplift a couple of specific areas of focus for me, in terms of
the trip and going forward.  
   
And so, one is the importance of digital inclusion, because let’s be
clear, 21st century economies require digital inclusion for the economic
empowerment of any one and all people.  And so thinking about how we can
then uplift and bring investment to the continent to work with those who
are already doing the work on the continent, to increase digital
inclusion.   
   
I highlighted, in particular, also what we must do to specifically
address the economic empowerment of women, understanding as it —
(applause) — but just understanding a universal truth, which is: You —
you increase the economic capacity of women, and families benefit,
communities benefit.  All of society benefits when we do that. 
(Applause.)  
   
And it was about also, again, in my role as Vice President, being there
to uplift the importance of good governance and democracy.  And so I had
bilateral meetings, which are just one-on-one meetings, with the three
presidents of the three countries.  And among the topics that I raised
and we discussed is the importance of good governance and democracy.  
   
So raising that it is important, when we’re looking at, in particular,
private investment and U.S. private investment on the continent, that
there’s going to be certain priorities that include — we’re going to
want to know that there’s freedom of the press, that rule of law, human
rights — that these will be issues for Americans in terms of
shareholders or consumers, to know that we are engaged in a way that
there are certain shared priorities in terms of those goals.  
   
So these were the — the areas of focus for the trip, as captured in the
second day that we were there with the speech that I gave at Black Star
Monument.  
   
MS. NABONGO:  Thank you so much.  
   
MR. YOUNG:  We’ll be sharing the mic.  Old school.  (Laughter.)  
   
I really want to ask you a bit about the Ghana portion of the trip. 
We’re in this museum of history and remembrance, a place from the
beginning that was committed to the unvarnished truth.  And I know you
visited Cape Coast Castle in Ghana.  And you said some powerful words,
which are not only about pain but survival.   
   
I was watching it today, and it said, quote, “History must be learned,
and we must then be guided by what we know also to be the history of
those who survived in the Americas and in the Caribbean.”   
   
Can you tell us about your experience at the “Door of No Return” and
what that meant to you?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  You know, in many ways, I’m still processing it. 
It’s one thing to read about it and learn history as most of us have
since the day we were born, and then to be at that site, which is one,
sadly, of many such sites.   
   
And, you know, the — the tour guide — I don’t want to call him a tour
guide; he was a historian — taking us through the various dungeons —
right? — the section for men, the section for women, the section for the
troublemakers, where pregnant women were kept because they had been
raped.  The details of the fact that women were being raped by their
captors and then the baby taken away on the day she gave birth so she
could be sold — the mother.  And then if the baby lived, would be put to
work in that very place.   
   
It’s — it’s like — this monument to all that we are discussing today. 
There is something about being in a physical space that if you have
learned about what it represents, you feel what it represents.  And
that’s how it felt.  It was — it’s a place of horror.  It’s a place of
horror.   
   
Because let’s remember, first of all, people were kidnapped from their
homes and taken for miles, hundreds of miles, to this place.  They
didn’t know where they were headed.  Untold numbers died on that voyage,
then to be put in dungeons, where there’s a hole toward the ceiling
where the light could come, but also depending on whether it was — there
was a pathway behind it is where the guards would watch.  And from time
to time, they might give water.  And the water was so — there was — it
was so little that he described about how these people who had been
kidnapped — these victims of a horrible crime — would try to survive,
including drinking the water off of somebody else’s hair.  
   
And you — you see this place, and it’s — it’s — it’s horrendous.  It’s
horrendous.   
   
And so, after — you know, we had press with us on the trip.  And after
they had — they — I spoke to the press, and I had some prepared
comments.  And I looked down at the prepared comments and I was like,
“No, I’m not doing that.”  And I just said what I felt.  (Applause.)  
   
And — and it was about — yes.  Right?  In the midst of so-called leaders
who are trying to erase history in our country — (applause) — what we
must all do to stand up and speak out about this as loud as we can. 
It’s not just about “forget”; they’re trying to erase history.  
   
Let’s understand what this means.  And there are historical precedents
for this kind of approach and what it means and what could come next. 
So there was that piece of it, in terms of my comments that day.  There
was also the piece of it that — that I spoke of that was about: We are
not going to be defeated.  And we weren’t defeated.  
   
And out of that incredible pain and those crimes, the survivors and the
descendants, carrying traditions and culture and faith and a memory of
family, endured generation after generation.  And in this country
included the freedom fighters who fought for civil rights.  And all of
those who benefited across the board, whether their ancestors were at
that slave — I don’t even like calling it a castle, by the way.  
   
MR. YOUNG:  Right.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And what we should do then to also celebrate the
strength of our people to come through that and go on to be
astronauts.   
   
I just spoke yesterday with Astronaut Glover.  Do you guys know who he
is?  (Laughs.)  (Applause.)  He’s about to go on the Artemis II mission
to circle the Moon.  I just talked to him yesterday.  Right?   
   
And so, the scientists and the astronauts and the mathematicians and all
of the people —  
   
MS. NABONGO:  And the Vice President.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — and the Vice President of the United States. 
(Laughs.)  (Applause.)  Right.  
   
And so, I felt it important at that moment there to bring up all these
points: the importance of teaching history, the importance of speaking
it, the importance of speaking out against those crimes against
humanity, and then to also remember how we must celebrate the endurance
and the — the strength of the will to survive and thrive.  
   
So, there you are.  (Applause.)  
   
MR. YOUNG:  Absolutely.  
   
MS. NABONGO:  That was work.  
   
MR. YOUNG:  All right.  
   
MS. NABONGO:  So, you have been working to empower women throughout your
career, and it was obviously a major focus of the trip as well.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  
   
MS. NABONGO:  And you breathe rare air, you know, being a woman of power
at the head of a major economy.  But you also were able to meet with the
President of Tanzania —  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  
   
MS. NABONGO:  — who’s one of 13 female heads of state of 193 countries
right now.  
   
So why did you feel it important to emphasize empowerment of women?  And
what was that like to meet one of so few of the female heads of state?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  She’s the only woman on the continent to lead a
country.  And before her, Ellen Johnson, who was the first and the last
elected woman to lead a country on the continent.  So there is still
work to be done there — and here, obviously.  (Laughs.)  (Applause.)  
   
But, you know, I — I — so, I — for example, we convened these women
entrepreneurs, who are just phenomenal and doing all this extraordinary
work.  I’m — I’m sure there was a picture up here somewhere of that
meeting.  We’re doing all this extraordinary work.  
   
One — one of the women is finding ways that is about sustainable
agriculture and smart agriculture to — she’s, I think, the major
producer of mushrooms; she refers to herself as the “mushroom queen” —
and what she is doing to do smart agriculture.   
   
There was another woman who is a physician, who created a whole approach
where she then got investors to get vans to take medical — to take
doctors to the villages, in particular to help with — with childbirth,
because there, like here, there are unacceptable rates of maternal
mortality.   
   
And she was doing the work of going — like, basically, it’s like a
clinic on wheels.  And then she would stay in a village for a period of
time for all the births for that moment.  And then she would train the
midwives about how to deal with what can be critical moments during —
during delivery and teach them techniques.  
      
 There was another young woman who was doing work that is about
connecting people with resources.   
      
 Anyway, it was just — it was fantastic.  
       
In some of the countries, over 50 percent of farmers, which is one of
the main sources of the economy — agriculture — over 50 percent were
women.  In another country, over 70 percent of the farmers are women
and, for the most part, do not own the land and are not in the banking
system and not online.  
          
 And so, a lot of the work that I did focused on women was about talking
about what we need to do in terms of their economic empowerment and, as
a tool toward that end, what we do around digital inclusion, giving them
the ability to have technology so that they can be in the banking
system, in fintech — the financial technology systems — so they’re not
just having cash that somebody might take.  
      
You know, dealing with — what we know is when you have economic
empowerment, then you can walk away from bad situations, because you
actually have resources.  And so, the connection between that and the
health and wellbeing of women — connecting that with financial and
economic empowerment.  
       
But the reason to focus on it is, again, there are disparities there,
like here.  And we have to address them because we know the data is
clear, anecdotally.  We know when you address those gender disparities,
everyone benefits.  
       
And so, that’s why I focused on that.  
       
The President of Tanzania, she and I spent a wonderful time together.  I
actually hosted her at a meeting here at the White House when she was in
the States.  And then we saw each other at the U.S.-Africa Summit.  And
so, this was our third meeting.  It was actually the third meeting, I
think, for each one of the presidents.   
      
 And she is — you know, she is working on good governance.  She is — she
has succeeded — the president before her passed away.  And she came in
having been in government for decades and really is — takes very
seriously the importance of being a public servant and fixing systems
and reforming systems.  And so, it was a really good meeting with her —
President Samia.  Yeah.  
      
MS. NABONGO:  Thank you.  Speaking about governance, protecting and
expanding democracy is a core value for the Biden-Harris
administration.  All three countries that you visited are democracies
and making democratic progress.  Why did you feel it was important to
meet these leaders specifically?   
       
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  So, each of these three countries is really
focusing on the issue of good governance and democracy.  
       
I mean, for example, Zambia — the president there came into office in —
through a democratic process where young people turned out in record
numbers to vote.  And he is doing a lot to address what he needs to do
around good governance.  And so, each of them has a commitment to that,
and I wanted to highlight that.   
       
A lot of the method to the approach for this trip and for the work going
forward is about public-private partnership.  And in order for that to
make sense and work for all the partners, there has to be an
infrastructure that is about rule of law, that is about good governance,
that is about an explicit intention to fight corruption.  Because
otherwise, the economic investment that these countries want just can’t
happen because it doesn’t make business sense for those who would
invest.   
       
And so, talking with them about these issues and highlighting what’s
happening on the continent is important.  And it’s also important
because I think there are a lot of stereotypes about what’s happening on
the continent and who are African leaders and how do they lead.  
      
 And so, to bring whatever capacity I have to bear on highlighting the
work that is happening that is about working toward democratic reforms
was important.  
      
MR. YOUNG:  Great.  I want to talk a little bit about that very thing:
the public-private partnerships.  When I was there in Ghana, in Accra, I
got to go by David Adjaye’s studio, Adjaye Associates.  And, of course,
David Adjaye helped design this building.  
      
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.   
       
MR. YOUNG:  So it was wonderful to see him and what they’re up to now,
building hospitals across the country through all sorts of innovation,
which reminded me of your speech at Black Star Plaza, where you
mentioned African innovation.   
   
But you didn’t just speak about it.  Later, you announced $8 billion —
that’s billion with a “B” — of private and public investments to the
continent.  And you issued a call to action to the private sector.  Why
is this important, these next steps?  What do you see down the road for
this?  
      
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  So — well, there’s a backstory to it, which partly
is that, early in our administration, I had a focus on what was
happening around the northern part of Central America — Honduras,
Guatemala, El Salvador — because of the irregular migration that we were
seeing.   
      
And we created a public-private partnership that ended up — we ended up
getting commitments of over $4.2 billion for those three countries in
that region.  
       
And as a result of that work — (applause) — thank you.  And so, as a
result of that work, already we have 4 million people in the — in —
online than — that had not been, 1 million people in the banking system
that had not been.   
      
So, I knew it works — because we tried it and it worked.  So, it was
always my intention: Let’s take that to the continent of Africa.   
   
So, I literally got on the phone and called a bunch of the partners
there and then more, and said, “Hey, we’re going to take this approach. 
We have a model that’s worked.”  Many of them knew about it if they
hadn’t been a part of it.  And to a one, they said, “Count us in.”  
        
So, Microsoft, HP, Cisco, MasterCard, Visa, Ford Foundation, MacArthur
Foundation, Melinda Gates all said yes.   
        
And so, through this, we then got 8 bil- — pulled together $8 billion,
$7 billion which is focused on climate.  So, that’s resilience,
adaptation — right? — all that we need to do there.  And $1 billion on
the women’s inclusion piece.   
        
And it is not only U.S. investment; African private sector leaders are a
part of this.  Because let’s be clear also: There are very successful
private sector leaders on the continent who have already been doing the
work.  And we are partnering then — (applause) — with them on this
engagement.  
   
 And — and so it culminated in a convening where I had 30 of them
represented at a meeting that we did the last day that we were on the
continent in Lusaka.  And we had a two-hour meeting where we talked
about a number of things.   
      
We talked about the importance of digital inclusion, but let’s make sure
that we are making it accessible and affordable.  Let us talk about
human rights and continue to make that a point of emphasis because it is
critical if we are talking about equitable outcomes and making sure no
one is left outside or left behind, much less suppressed.   
  
You know, we talked about the importance of metrics in terms of our
analysis of our effectiveness.  So, for example, back on the piece about
women — that it is important that we understand this is not only about
inclusion of women, it’s also about leadership.  Right?  
   
Because we can let every — you know, let all the women in the room — if
you just want to go with a metaphor of a room — right? — who’s not in. 
You can let everybody in.  But then — and other people are leading? 
Like, let’s make sure that we’re also focused on women as leaders and
cultivating their leadership.  Right?  (Applause.)    
   
So, these are the kinds of things that came out of that, but an $8
billion already committed to this approach.  And — and it’s very
exciting, because the — the exponential benefit of that is going to be
much bigger than that $8 billion.  And that’s just, so far, what we’ve
gotten.  Yeah.  
   
MR. YOUNG:  Thanks.   
   
MS. NABONGO:  So, I follow you on social.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  (Laughs.)  
   
MS. NABONGO:  And I saw that picture: “how it started and how it’s
going.”  (Laughter.)   
   
So, if you guys haven’t seen, her picture from your first visit to
Zambia as a child.   
   
(Points to photo of the Vice President on projector screen.)  Yes,
that’s how it started.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  That’s how it started.  (Laughs.)  
   
MS. NABONGO:  How — how it’s going.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I don’t know where — how it’s going.  But that — I
mean, well, here we are.  
   
MS. NABONGO:  Yes, how it’s going.  (Points to photo of the Vice
President on projector screen.)  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Oh, there it is.  (Laughter and applause.)  
   
MS. NABONGO:  I love that.  
   
So, you first visited as a child.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  
   
MS. NABONGO:  What was it like to return now not only as an adult, but
in an official capacity as Vice President?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  It was, you know — the President of Zambia greeted
me and said, “Welcome home.”  (Laughter and applause.)  
   
And — so my grandfather, my mother’s father, was — went to Zambia — went
and — he and my grandmother and my aunt, actually, lived in Lusaka
because, out of solidarity with the independence movement when Zambia
gained independence, my grandfather went on behalf of the Indian
government to help this newly independent country get situated.  And so,
they lived in Lusaka, and we went to visit them there.   
   
And, you know, my grandfather was probably one of my favorite people in
the world.  He — well, first of all, because I was the eldest
grandchild, so he convinced me I was his favorite.  (Laughter.)  
   
But — but my grandfather — you know, those independence movements — you
know, that was my connection to it in many ways in terms of a personal
connection.  And he would always talk about the importance of fighting
for freedom.  He would talk about the importance of an independent
people.   
   
Because, of course, when we’re talking about these fights against
colonization — right? — these — there was there was a through-line: the
importance of the people running and the people ruling and governing for
themselves, the importance of fighting against corruption.  
   
And, you know — so I used to talk a lot with my grandfather from my
earliest days where I think I understood a little bit of it.  And then,
as I got older, I understood a lot of it.   
   
And so, to go back there and then we — we found the plot where they
lived.  It’s now been — a new building is there.  
   
But also, my aunt worked with — she’s an OB-GYN — and she worked at the
— at the hospital down the street, delivering babies at — it was then
called Lusaka Hospital-something.  It’s now changed its name.  It’s a
teaching hospital now.  
   
But — so I called my aunt to ask her.  And she said, “Well, you should
check because one of my best friends lived down the street.  And he and
I would walk to the hospital together, and we then did a bunch of stuff
over their careers.”  So I asked her his name.  It turned out he ended
up being the Minister of Health for Zambia later and was responsible for
reform of the healthcare system.  
   
So, when we went to Lusaka, my team found his daughter, and I met with
her.  And it was just the most special thing.  And so, we talked.  And
she’s actually writing a book about her father and his significance to
the independence in present-day Zambia on the healthcare system piece of
it.  
   
So, there was so many pieces of that trip that were about, you know,
everything from a bilateral meeting with the president to talk about
security issues and democracy.  And we talked about, for example,
another big issue affecting a lot African countries, which is debt and
how we must address that and be aligned.   
   
And, by the way, we stand — we’ve been very clear — and the IMF and
everywhere else — that there should be bilateral participation in terms
of restructuring the debt issues that a lot of these countries face. 
But it was everything from that to meeting the daughter of a colleague
of my aunt’s and — and what that meant for, I think, she and I, in terms
of just full circle — how things work out sometimes.  
   
MS. NABONGO:  Thank you for sharing.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  
   
MR. YOUNG:  Well, I’m struck about you talking about Zambia and your
return there.  But I was also struck — coming to Ghana, just from the
time I got off the plane, riding in cabs from the airport or down the
street, there were billboards of you everywhere.  And there was such
welcome I felt for you in your visit.  How did you experience that?  And
what’s your takeaways from the trip?  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, I was obviously very honored and humbled
about what it meant.  And it was such a wonderful trip for all the
reasons we have discussed and more.  
   
But here’s my takeaway.  And it’s where I started.  I am extremely
excited, not just optimistic — excited about this future.  I encourage
everyone to really make sure you understand — and I don’t mean any —
you, you, you — but just we understand what’s happening on that
continent.  It is so exciting.  
   
For example, there is, right now, technology that originated on the
continent that they’ve used drones and drone technology to deliver
critical medical supplies in a fraction of the time it otherwise was
taking.  And that technology that was created on the continent is being
replicated by different countries on the continent and right here in the
United States.  Technology that was created there is being used here.  
   
Not to mention, if you look at the range, Afrobeats.  (Applause.)  I
hope y’all have seen my Spotify lists.  (Laughs.)  
   
But — because we didn’t even talk about that.  We went to a studio. 
It’s called Vibrate Studio.  And these — I mean, talented, incredible —
there it is.  So and — there’s Sheryl and Idris — and we were all
hanging out.  And that’s the — that’s it.   
   
And then you go in, and that’s the woman who actually runs it.  And
there — it’s a studio — and there — and so what she’s done is created —
so it’s also a community center and it’s also a skate park.  So it’s
actually — skateboarding is there too.  And she’s created this community
center.  
   
And obviously, so much about technology helps people — you know, they
just go — you can go on YouTube and learn how to play an instrument.  So
I met musicians there who were self-taught because of technology.  And
they’re doing incredible work that is, of course, influencing the world
in terms of not only technology and science, but also in terms of
culture, in terms of entertainment, in terms of music.  It’s all
happening there.  
   
And so my — my feeling about the trip was: Whatever we were able to do
with us all being there together, because we were all there together, to
highlight — and maybe for some who didn’t know, now you know —
(laughter) — what is happening on that continent and reordering and
repositioning or at least thinking about the next era in this
relationship.  
   
And it is about a relationship that is based on the optimism and the
excitement that we should all have about what is happening there, how it
will affect us here, but also based on the intertwined history, based on
the demographics I mentioned at the beginning — why we must think of it
as an imperative to engage as partners in investing in the future of the
globe and doing that by understanding the connection to that and the
continent of Africa.  
  
MR. YOUNG:  Amen.  (Applause.)  
  
MS. NABONGO:  Amen.  I’m so inspired.  
  
MR. YOUNG:  Did you have any last words you wanted to leave us with?  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I just — I want to encourage us all, like I said,
to just keep — I mean, the diaspora is phenomenal.   
   
One of the things that we have done, also, af- — coming out of the
Africa — U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit — and we — and you hosted us here
for so much of that, where I stood on this very stage with the president
of Ghana for the YALI meeting that we had — the Young African Leaders
Initiative.  (Applause.)  Right?   
  
So, let us continue to use our voices in the context of the diaspora, in
— in the context of having any concerns about the — the role of the
United States of America, in terms of our own, much less global,
security and prosperity.  Let us have an interest in uplifting it if we
have any level of excitement at all about the future and what that could
look like based on what we do right now.  
  
That’s what I would ask that we all take away from this moment and — and
from our level of — of interest and exploration about all of these, in
terms of the potential.  It is great, and I’m very excited.   
  
And so, we’re just going to keep, you know, doing this work every day. 
I had a bunch of meetings today about what we’re doing by way of
follow-up.  And I’m very excited about — and thank you for hosting us,
again, for this conversation.  
  
MR. YOUNG:  Thank you, Vice President.  
      
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  
  
MR. YOUNG:  Let’s give another round of applause.  Thank you. 
(Applause.)
