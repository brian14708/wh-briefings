Washington, D.C.

The last two years, I’ve joined many of you for the Congressional Club
Spouses Luncheon. And I’ve talked about learning to navigate the unique
role of being a political spouse. I promised myself I would never waste
the platform I’ve been given.  
   
Many of you know that challenge well.  
   
But looking at this crowd of accomplished and diverse leaders from
across our country, I’m thinking not of the power of one voice, but of
many.  
   
Last month, I visited New Orleans to tour the Louisiana Cancer Research
Center with Senator and Dr. Cassidy. And I learned about the ways their
state is coming together, across party lines, to address disparities and
save lives. And that includes Dr. Laura Cassidy’s efforts to help make
breast cancer screenings affordable.  
   
Cancer touches us all.  
   
Everyone in this room knows someone who has wrestled with this disease,
maybe even lost someone to it.  
   
Cancer doesn’t care who you vote for. It’s not a red or a blue issue.
It’s a human one. And it takes all of us to stop it.  
   
That’s why this event and this organization matter so much.  
   
We can collaborate, share good ideas and best practices. Together, we
can get people the information they need to prevent cancer before it
happens, and catch it early if it does.  
   
Here on the Hill, you are setting the course for our future.  
   
But you don’t have to be elected to make a difference. We all have a
role to play, including spouses.  
   
Because we serve Americans, too.  
   
We see their hearts and hopes. We witness the small miracles of
compassion and generosity between neighbors. We know what can happen
when communities come together, how much can change when we work towards
a cause that’s bigger than ourselves.  
   
Fighting cancer is that cause. And you don’t have to do it alone.  
   
Joe and I reignited the Biden Cancer Moonshot, our White House
initiative to build a world where cancer is not a death sentence. Where
we help patients and their families navigate this journey. Where we stop
cancer before it starts. Where we catch it early and people live longer,
healthier, happier lives.  
   
Because this is personal to us. And we’re excited to work with Congress
and everyone here.  
   
I’ve been to many communities in your states to see how you are saving
lives, and how we can be a partner to you in that work. And the people
in this room, members of the Congressional Families Cancer Prevention
Program, will be your allies too.  
   
They have so many resources, so if you’re looking for more ways to get
involved, they can help.  
   
Together, through the Biden Cancer Moonshot, we can bridge party lines
and state lines, to end cancer as we know it.  
   
It’s ambitious. But it’s also within our reach.  
   
For Joe and me, this is the mission of our lives. And we are ready and
proud to work beside you.  
   
Thank you.
