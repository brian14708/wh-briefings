State Dining Room, The White House

Welcome everyone! It’s a pleasure to be with you to preview this state
dinner.  
   
From my mother, I learned that setting a table can be an act of love.
With just fresh flowers and a set of candles, she could turn an ordinary
dinner into a magical moment that stayed with us long after the dishes
were cleared away. Once I had my own family, I did my best to keep that
tradition alive.  
   
From my husband, I learned that politics is personal. It’s about finding
the common threads of humanity that connect us, that transcend distance
or difference, and building on those shared values.  
   
We hope to bring those two ideas together as we welcome President Yoon
and Mrs. Kim, honoring the 70 years of our alliance with symbols and
moments of beauty that reflect both of our countries.  
   
From the painted animals representing both countries that greet our
guests, to the swirl of colors in the table décor that mirrors the South
Korean flag, to the mix of symbolic flowers throughout—peonies,
hibiscus, azaleas, and orchids—we hope to showcase the harmony of our
cultures and our people intertwined. Guests will enjoy their meal
beneath the boughs of cherry trees, a shared symbol of the renewal of
spring.  
   
And perhaps nothing better represents the harmony of our cultures than
the guest chef who has designed our menu, Chef Edward Lee. His style of
cuisine reflects his Korean family and the influence of his New York
upbringing and Kentucky home. Chef Lee creates meals that are both
familiar and surprising, a fusion of different worlds that finds a
perfect balance. We’re honored to have his incredible talent alongside
our White House chefs.   
   
Finally, the evening will conclude with something distinctly American:
musicals. Broadway stars will perform renditions of iconic songs,
showcasing the craft and creativity of our country.  
   
Every detail of this dinner has been thoughtfully planned by a team of
people from across our government. So I want to thank the White House
residence, our social team, and the State Department staff who have been
working so hard to make this visit meaningful.  
   
When the President and I have traveled to the Republic of Korea in the
past, we have been welcomed with open arms. It’s my intention to bring
as much warmth and joy to President Yoon and Mrs. Kim Wednesday evening.
We hope to honor both the people of their home nation and the
generations of Americans who share their roots.   
   
Now I will turn it over to our Social Secretary, who has guided this
process, Carlos Elizondo.
