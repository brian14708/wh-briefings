*Nashville International Airport  
Nashville, Tennessee*  
  
(April 7, 2023)

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  So the district court in the abortion medication
decision came down today.  I haven’t read it yet, so I’m going to do an
analysis of it.  But as a general matter, I’ll say that there is no
question that the President and I are going to stand with the women of
America and do everything we can to ensure that women have the ability
to make decisions about their healthcare, their reproductive healthcare,
in — in a manner that is — is what they need, and they decide that, not
their government.  
  
I’ll also say about this case, as a general matter, that it is — it is
contrary to what makes for good public health policy to allow courts and
politicians to tell the FDA what it should do.  
  
This is a drug that the FDA approved as safe 20 years ago and has been
proven to be safe for 20 years.  So this is a dangerous precedent, and
I’ll have more to say after I review the decision in its entirety.  
  
Thank you.
