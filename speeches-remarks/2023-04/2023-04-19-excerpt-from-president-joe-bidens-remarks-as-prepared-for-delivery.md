While I’m here in this union hall with you, the Speaker of the House
Kevin McCarthy went to Wall Street two days ago to describe the MAGA
economic vision. It was the day before Tax Day. Do you think he told the
wealthy and powerful that it was finally time to start paying their fair
share of taxes? No.  
  
Do you think he told billion-dollar companies to stop stashing profits
in tax havens and shipping jobs overseas? No.  
  
Instead he proposed huge cuts to important programs that millions of
working- and middle-class Americans count on. All the while he and MAGA
officials are separately pushing more tax giveaways that overwhelmingly
benefit the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations.  
  
Folks, it’s the same old trickle-down dressed up in MAGA clothing. Only
worse.
