Farmleigh House  
Dublin, Republic of Ireland

TAOISEACH VARADKAR:  Mr. President, really good to welcome you again to
— to Farmleigh.  I was saying that we — we last met here, I think, back
in 2017, in a different time.  That was a private visit.  
   
But it’s wonderful to have you back in Ireland.  And I think the visit
has been going extremely well, and you very much grace us with your
presence.  And look forward to the meeting later on.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, it was great to see you in — on St. Patrick’s
Day.  It was great to see you in Washington.  You know, I think there is
a — there really is an opportunity to make serious progress not just
because of the accords that were signed 25 years ago, but I mean just in
terms of the way you’re leading Ireland.   
   
Ireland is moving in the way that is taking its place in the world, that
is working on helping countries around the world that are dealing with
starvation.  And the way you‘ve welcomed — and I know it’s not easy —
welcomed Ukrainians here, and the leadership you’ve shown.  
   
And I just think that it feels so good to be able to have this emerging
and stronger and stronger relationship between the United States and
Ireland.  I think our values are — are the same, and I think our
concerns are the same.   
   
So I’m really looking forward to continuing to work with you.  
   
TAOISEACH VARADKAR:  Thank you.  And look forward la- — later on to
hearing about your visit to Belfast and your — your meeting with the
party leaders.  We’re — we’re very keen to see the Good Friday Agreement
institutions functioning again.  And Prime Minister Sunak and I are
going to be working together on that.  
   
But really want to thank you and your administration and your country’s
leadership when it comes to Ukraine, because I never thought in my
lifetime that we’d see a war of this nature happen in Europe again.   
   
And democracy and liberty and the things that we believe in are on
retreat — are in retreat in large parts of the world.  And if it wasn’t
for American leadership and if it wasn’t for America and Europe working
together, I don’t know what kind of world we’d live in.   
   
So we — we really do appreciate your — your leadership and your personal
leadership, both in terms of securing peace in Ireland, but also in
trying to protect democracy and liberty here in Europe.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, I think what you and Prime Minister Sunak worked
out in terms of the other accords was — was very valuable as well.  So
I’m looking forward to talking to you about a lot of this in detail.   
   
Thank you.
