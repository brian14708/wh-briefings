PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Welcome to Prime Minister Modi’s Washington home. 
(Laughter and applause.)  
   
I’ve been doing thi- — please have a seat.  I’ve been doing this a long
time, but I don’t ever remember anybody getting a warmer welcome than
this guy right here.  
   
Good evening, everybody.  
   
Twenty years ago, as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
I made clear that if the United States and India grew to be the closest
friends and partners in the world, the world would be a safer place.  I
believe that even more today now that I’m President.  
   
Mr. Prime Minister, Jill and I have had a wonderful time with you today
during your truly productive visit.  And tonight, it’s fitting — a
fitting way to celebrate the great bonds of friendship between India and
the United States that will long endure.  
   
As many of you know, these bonds stretch back to America’s earliest
days.  In 1792, our first president, George Washington, established one
of the first consulates in Kolkata, nestled along the Bay of Bengal — a
hub of commerce and culture.  Home to more Nobel laureates, I might
note, than any — than any other (inaudible) city — including the great
poet-philosopher Tagore.  And he wrote two national anthems, India and
Bangladesh, and influenced great American thinkers as well.

Over 100 years ago, Tagore sent his son to a college here in America. 
During his visit here, he traveled the country.  And of the wisdom, he
said — and he wrote in his life, “In the bustle of all our work, there
comes this cry: Take me across and where — where the mind is without
fear, where the mind is led forward to ever-widening thought and actions
into that heaven of freedom,” end of quote.  
   
As two great democracies in the bustle of our work, India and the United
States hear the cry and the call of destiny to take our nations in the
world forward to a future worthy of our dreams — a future of greater
prosperity, opportunity, liberty, equality for all, and for the good of
the world.  Because it’s only when every person can grasp their fullest
potential that we as nations can achieve our highest purpose.  
   
And may we always remember that it’s our people — our people that give
our partnership strength.  From all the backgrounds and beliefs, they
inspire us, challenge us, tell us the truth, and push us forward. 
They’re the reason our democracies endure, evolve, reflect, and renew,
generation after generation.  
   
I’ve seen in my visits to India and I see in the diaspora here in
America — in the arts, education; in the media, law, medicine, and
science, and business — businesses of every size; in spelling bee
champions; even in cricket clubs across the country, including back in
my home state of Delaware; and a record number of Indian Americans in
Congress, who are here tonight — Ro, Ami, Raja, Shri, Pramila, and — you
know — well, I won’t go on.  (Laughter.)  
   
I have a great working relationship with all of you.  In fact, after her
critical leadership on one of the legislative victories, I called
Congresswoman Jayapal’s mother in India to thank her and wishing h- — a
happy Diwali.  It was an incredible moment.  I think she wondered, “Who
in God’s name is calling me?”  (Laughter.)  
   
As I said this morning, we see the pride of the community in our
incredible Vice President.  Thank you, Kamala.  Thank you, thank you,
thank you.  (Applause.)  
   
Mr. Prime Minister — oh, I better get that translated.  
   
Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for your partnership and your friendship. 
And to all — to all, please join me in a toast — but I don’t know if we
have any glasses.  (Laughter.)  
   
Please join me in a toast.  Here it comes.  The good news for both of
us: Neither of us drink.  (Laughter.)   
   
(Referring to Prime Minister Modi’s glass.)  That is what?  Ginger ale? 
Okay.  (Laughter.)  
   
Mr. Prime Minister, I had an Irish grandfather named Ambrose Finnegan. 
And he used to say that when you give a toast and you don’t have any
alcohol in your glass, you must do it with your left hand.  (Laughter.) 
You think I’m kidding?  I’m not.  (Laughter.)  (The interpreter begins
providing a translation.)  (Laughter.)  That wasn’t in the script.  
   
A toast to our partnership, to our people, to the possibilities that lie
ahead, to two great friends, two great nations, and two great powers. 
Cheers.  
   
(President Biden offers a toast.)  
   
The floor is yours.  (Applause.)  
   
PRIME MINISTER MODI:  (As interpreted.)  President Biden, First Lady Dr.
Jill Biden, distinguished guests, good evening.   
   
First of all, I thank President Biden for this wonderful dinner today. 
My special thanks to Dr. Jill Biden for her personal efforts and
attention in making my visit a success.  I would also like to express my
gratitude to her for the magnificent organization of today’s event.   
   
Yesterday evening, you opened the doors of your house to me.  I’m deeply
grateful to you for this special gesture, for your friendship and warm
hospitality.  
   
I know your hospitality has moved your guests to sing.  I wish I too had
the singing talent.  (Laughter.)  I would have also sung for you all. 
(Laughter.)   
   
Mr. President, this evening is made special by the presence of the
people of our two countries, bringing the values of democracy and
diversity to life.  They are our most precious assets.  
   
When we met in Japan for the Quad Summit, you mentioned a problem that
you were facing.  Well, looking at the vast experience of your long
public life, I’m sure that you must have resolved the problem.  I hope
you were able to fit in everyone who wanted to come to dinner tonight. 
(Laughter.)  
   
You gathered a group of exceptionally talented and remarkable people
tonight.  I must commend you for that.  All these people symbolize so
much about the India-U.S. relations: our energy, our dynamism, and our
potential.  
   
Indian Americans have come a long way in the U.S.  They are proud of
India’s values, democratic traditions, and culture and have always found
a respectful place in America’s melting pot.  Indian Americans have
played a significant role in further strengthening the inclusive society
and economy of the U.S.   
   
Be it hospitals or hotels, universities or research labs, gas stations
or logistics, management or IT, they are making their mark everywhere. 
And now some of them are even in the White House.  (Applause.)  
   
With every passing day, Indians and Americans are getting to know each
other better.  We can pronounce each other’s names correctly.  We can
understand each other’s accent better.  Kids in India become Spider Man
on Halloween.  (Laughter.)  And America’s youth is dancing to the tune
of “Naatu, Naatu.”  (Laughter.)   
   
Amidst the love for baseball, cricket is also getting popular in the
U.S.  The American team is trying its best to qualify for the Cricket
World Cup to be held in India later this year.  I wish them good luck
and success.  (Laughter.)  
   
Mr. President, for over five decades, through all the sweeping changes
in the world, you’ve worked hard in the service of your nation and the
entire humanity.  You’ve turned every adversity into strength, loss into
resolve, challenge into a mission.   
   
I first met you nearly a decade ago when you were the vice president,
and I see the same commitment and intensity even today in you.  You are
soft spoken, but when it comes to action, you are very strong.  
   
And I know that as an educationist, Dr. Jill Biden has made a tremendous
contribution in this journey.   
   
Friends, President Biden and I had some very wide-ranging and deep
conversations today.  I think our teams got tired of taking notes.  And
yet, it felt like we were running out of time.   
   
I don’t want to speak too much about India-U.S. relations, because I
know this is my fifth speech for the day — or maybe it’s the sixth.  As
you can see, I really have lost count.  (Laughter.)  
   
Mr. President, in 2014, when you had hosted a banquet for me, at that
time I was observing in nine-day religious fast.  And I remember you
were asking me and asking me again and again what I could eat during my
fast.  (Laughter.)  But it was not possible for me to eat anything, and
you were quite concerned about it.  Well, today I’m making up for it. 
All that you desired at that time with so much affection is being
fulfilled today.  (Laughter and applause.)  
   
I know everybody is eager to have dinner, looking at looking at today’s
special menu.  I know the effort made by Dr. Biden in very delicately
curating today’s menu.  But there’s one more thing left to do.  Please
join me in raising a toast.   
   
(Speaks English.)  A toast to our wonderful host, President Biden and
Dr. Jill Biden.  A toast to good health, prosperity, and the pursuit of
happiness.  To liberty, equality, and fraternity.  And to the
everlasting bonds of friendship between India and the United States.   
   
Cheers.  
   
(Prime Minister Modi offers a toast.)  
   
Thank you.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Enjoy your meal.
