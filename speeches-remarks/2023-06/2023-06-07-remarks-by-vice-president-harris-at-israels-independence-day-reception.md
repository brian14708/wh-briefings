7:30 P.M. EDT  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good evening, everyone. 
Good evening.  Good evening.  Thank you.  Please have a seat.  Good
evening.  Good evening.   
   
And thank you, Montana, and for using your platform in such an important
way.  
   
Ambassador Herzog and Mrs. Herzog, it is so good to be with you again. 
And I thank you always for the extraordinary leadership that you provide
and the friendship that is very heartfelt.  And, of course, I send best
to your brother, who I have spent time with as well.   
   
It is wonderful to be with everyone tonight.  To the members of Congress
who are here; the leaders from our administration, including Small
Business Administrator Isabel Guzman; to the distinguished guests from
Israel and throughout the United States; and, of course, with us tonight
is my husband, the first Second Gentleman of the United States —
(applause) — and the first Jewish spouse of a President or a Vice
President in the history.  (Applause.)   
   
And he’s been such an incredible leader in so many ways.  And this, of
course — this fact, this historical fact, has led to a lot of other
firsts, including the first mezuzah on the front door of the Vice
President’s Residence.  (Applause.)  The first menorah lit in the
residence.  (Applause.)  And the first Passover Seder hosted at the
residence.  (Applause.)  All of which are a great source of pride for
Doug and me and our entire family, as I know it is for many who have
celebrated with us over the years.   
   
So, moving forward, I will say that I want to thank everyone who is here
and to recognize that tonight we gather to, of course, celebrate the
75th anniversary of the State of Israel.  Truly a remarkable
milestone.   
   
For millennia, a homeland for the Jewish people was just a dream.  A
dream that lived in the hearts of generations of Jews.  A dream that was
sustained through displacement and discrimination, through struggle and
sacrifice, and through one of the most horrific atrocities in the
history of the world.   
   
Yet, as a famous quote from Theodor Herzl reminds us, “If you will it,
it is no dream.”  (Applause.)  And the story of Israel over the past 75
years has proven this time and time again.   
   
I remember as a young girl growing up in the Bay Area in California,
collecting donations on behalf of the Jewish National Fund.  And for
those of you who — I will date myself — who are old enough, you will
remember those little blue boxes, which we would walk around asking
people to please donate so we could plant trees in Israel. 
(Applause.)  
   
And yet, that act of us as children and young people was about so much
more.  It was about our sense of connection to the importance of
building the State of Israel, helping the Jewish people thrive, dreaming
together and willing the dream into reality.   
   
Years later, as an adult when I visited Israel for the first time, I saw
the incredible results of these efforts, these collective efforts: an
extraordinary country built, as the ambassador has mentioned, on
ingenuity, creativity, and determination.   
   
As Israel developed over the decades, the United States has been a proud
and steadfast partner.  As has been noted, from President Harry Truman’s
recognition of the State of Israel 11 minutes after Ben-Gurion declared
independence, through Republican and Democratic administrations, and
through today under the leadership of President Joe Biden: The United
States has an unbreakable bond with the State of Israel.  (Applause.)  
   
A bond that I have been so very proud to work to strengthen throughout
my career in public service, whether it be as District Attorney of San
Francisco, Attorney General of California, a United States senator, and
now as Vice President of the United States.   
   
At the core of the U.S.-Israel relationship is America’s ironclad
commitment to the security of Israel.  This commitment — (applause) —
this commitment endures not only because it is in America’s strategic
interest, but because it is the right thing to do.  (Applause.)  
   
And this is why I was proud to vote for unprecedented security
assistance to Israel, almost $4 billion per year, every year that I
served in the United States Senate.  And this is why our administration
continues to provide this assistance and added another $1 billion in the
wake of the 2021 conflict with Hamas.  
   
And know this: Whether replenishing Iron Dome, working together to
develop a new laser defense system, or countering Iran and its proxies,
the commitment of the United States and its commitment to Israel’s
security will remain unwavering.  (Applause.)  
      
Our administration believes that in order to promote the security of
Israel, the region, and the United States, we must continue to create a
more integrated and interconnected Middle East.  That is why we will
continue to build on Israel’s peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan, and
on Israel’s historic agreements with the UAE, Bahrain, and Morocco. 
Also, understanding this — (applause) — all is to support Israel’s
normalization with countries in the region and beyond.   
  
As we do that, the Biden-Harris administration will continue to work
toward a world where Israelis and Palestinians can live safely and
securely and enjoy equal measures of freedom, prosperity, and
democracy.  And we believe that the best way to achieve this goal is
through two states.  (Applause.)  
  
We also believe that for Israel to be secure and for the Jewish people
everywhere to be safe, we must stand up and fight back against
antisemitism wherever and whenever we see it.  (Applause.)  
      
As I frequently have said and as our national strategy on antisemitism
makes clear, when Jews are targeted because of their beliefs or
identity, and when Israel is singled out because of anti-Jewish hatred,
that is antisemitism, and that is unacceptable.  (Applause.)  
      
And under President Joe Biden and our administration, America will
continue to stand for the values that have been the bedrock of the
U.S.-Israel relationship, which includes continuing to strengthen our
democracies, which, as the ambassador has said, are both built on strong
institutions, checks and balances, and, I’ll add, an independent
judiciary.  (Applause.)  
      
And I believe no discussion of the U.S.-Israel partnership would be
complete without highlighting the collaboration between our nations in
science, technology, and medicine.  
  
The ingenuity and creativity that made Israel strong has allowed Israel
to be known as the “start-up nation.”  And as Israeli innovation has
spread around the world, it has benefited all of humanity.   
  
As a daughter of California, with a lifelong passion for water policy, I
have long admired Israel for its innovation in agriculture, water
management, and clean energy.  
  
The founders of Israel — (applause) — the founders of Israel pioneered
irrigation techniques that brought water to desert farms.  Israel
pioneered desalination technology, which I saw firsthand at the Sorek
desalination plant.  And now, Israeli start-ups are using AI and
cutting-edge technology to pioneer solutions to address food insecurity
around the world.   
  
Israel is a nation full of innovators, entrepreneurs, and visionaries,
whether on autonomous vehicles, cybersecurity, or fintech.  It is clear
Israel helps point the world toward the future.  (Applause.)  
      
So I will conclude by looking toward the future and quoting one of my
favorite lines from the Talmud, a line that inspired an extended
discussion during our first Seder at the Vice President’s residence.   
  
It’s says, and I’ll quote, “It is not your duty to finish the work, but
neither are you at liberty to neglect it.”   
  
I’m going to repeat: “It is not your duty to finish the work, but
neither are \[we\] at liberty to neglect it.”   
  
While Israel and the United States have achieved so much together, there
is still so much more work to do.   
  
Previous generations willed the dream of Israel into reality and
established enduring bonds between our nations and our people.   
  
And now, for our generation, we have the baton in the long relay race of
history, and it is then up to us to strengthen these bonds even
further.   
  
President Biden and I look forward to the next 75 years of progress and
partnership.  And so, congratulations on this momentous anniversary. 
And let us celebrate all that our nations have achieved together and all
that is yet to come.   
      
Thank you all.  (Applause.)
