  \ with Women Ahead of the One Year Anniversary of the Dobbs\_Decision"

The Blue Room, The White House

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you all for being here today.   
  
Nearly one year ago, the *Dobbs* decision took away women’s
constitutional rights—their ability to make their own health care
decisions. Today, 18 states have abortion bans in effect. And the
consequences of these bans go far beyond the right to choose.  
  
Women are being denied access to medications that treat arthritis and
cancer—even when they aren’t pregnant.   
  
Survivors of rape and incest are being forced to travel across state
lines for care. Doctors have stopped providing the care that they know
is best for their patients because they don’t know which procedures are
legal.   
  
And like those who are with us today, far, far too many women are
experiencing devastating consequences to their health, their fertility,
and their lives. Turned away from emergency rooms. Delayed treatments.
Mourning loss, while barely surviving the resulting infections.   
  
The *Dobbs* decision was devastating. And Joe is doing everything he can
to fight back. But the only way we can ensure that every woman has the
fundamental freedoms she deserves is for Congress to make the
protections of *Roe v. Wade* the law of the land once again.   
  
So, we’ve got to make our voices heard—for the women whose lives are on
the line, and for the fathers and brothers, and husbands and sons, who
love them. We need men in this fight, too.  
  
Today, we are joined by four women who are doing just that—speaking up
about their experiences. I know that it isn’t easy to relive what you’ve
been through. But stories like yours are how we shed light on the cruel
and devastating consequences of these bans. So, I want to thank you all
for your candor and your courage.   
  
And now, we’re going to have a conversation led by Jen Klein, the
Director of our Gender Policy Council, who has worked tirelessly on this
issue.
