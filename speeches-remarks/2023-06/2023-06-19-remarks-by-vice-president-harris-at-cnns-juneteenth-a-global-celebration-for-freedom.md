THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good evening, everyone.  Good evening. 
(Applause.)  Good evening.  And Happy Juneteenth.  (Applause.)

So, tonight, with joy, we gather with friends and family to celebrate
America’s newest national holiday.  (Applause.)

So when I served in the United States Senate, I was proud to co-sponsor
a bill to make Juneteenth a federal holiday.  (Applause.)  And as Vice
President, it was my honor to stand beside our President, Joe Biden, as
he signed the legislation that finally made that dream a reality. 
(Applause.)

Today, Americans from all walks of life come together to celebrate
Juneteenth to honor Black excellence, culture, and community —
(applause) — to remember our nation’s full history, and to celebrate one
of our founding principles, the principle of freedom.  (Applause.)

America is a promise — a promise of freedom, liberty, and justice.  The
story of Juneteenth, as we celebrate it, is the story of our ongoing
fight to realize America’s promise — not for some, but for all. 
(Applause.)

So as we gather tonight, let us remember the words of the great Coretta
Scott King: The fight for civil rights must be fought and won with each
generation.  She reminds us that our freedoms will not be permanent
unless we, in each generation, are vigilant to protect them. 
(Applause.)

So let us all stand together as Americans to teach and honor our
history, to protect our liberty, and to continue the fight for freedom. 
(Applause.)

Thank you.  May God bless you.  And may God bless the United States of
America.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you.

And now it is my honor, as a proud HBCU graduate, to welcome to the
stage a group of incredible performers from our Divine Nine.  Have a
good evening.  (Applause.)
