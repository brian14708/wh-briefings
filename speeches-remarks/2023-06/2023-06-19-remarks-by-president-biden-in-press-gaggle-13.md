Q Mr. President, have you spoken to Secretary Blinken?

THE PRESIDENT: No, I’ve spoken with — I’ve communicated through Sullivan

trail here.

Q Do you feel like progress was made during this meeting?

THE PRESIDENT: I don’t “feel.” You know it’s been made. You don’t have
to ask it that way. You can ask how much progress has been made.

Q Mr. President, what do you think about Governor DeSantis being in
Sacramento, the same place he sent migrants?

THE PRESIDENT: It’s hard to comment on things like that.

Q What can the federal government do to help San Francisco’s fentanyl
