President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with Prime Minister Frederiksen

 The leaders discussed our unwavering support for Ukraine as it defends
itself against Russia’s brutal war of aggression.  President Biden
welcomed Denmark’s provision of significant security assistance to
Ukraine and its leadership in training Ukrainian pilots.  They discussed
their efforts as NATO Allies and close partners to strengthen
transatlantic security, which will be further enhanced by the conclusion
of a bilateral Defense Cooperation Agreement.  They also talked about
their shared work to bolster economic prosperity, increase energy
security, and address the impacts of climate change.
