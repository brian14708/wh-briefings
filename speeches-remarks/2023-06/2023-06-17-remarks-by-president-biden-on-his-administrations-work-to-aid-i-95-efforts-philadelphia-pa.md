THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, folks.  We just finished a — an aerial tour of —
survey of I-95 and — from the tanker truck explosion, the damage done.  
   
To the people of Philadelphia, I want to say that we’re with you.  We’re
going to stay with you and — as this is rebuilt — until it’s totally
finished.  And we’re going to try to do that in as quick a time as
possible.  
   
And I told the governor there’s no more important project right now in
the country, as far as I’m concerned.  I’m directing my team — not
figuratively, but literally — to move heaven and earth to get it done as
soon as humanly possible.  
   
So, since Sunday morning, we’ve worked closely with Governor Shapiro,
Senators Casey and Fetterman, and Representative Boyle — it’s his
district — and Mayor Kenney to provide the necessary federal assistance
to support an all-hands-on-deck response to this crisis.  And it is a
crisis.  
   
And I want to thank these officials for working collaboratively,
effectively, efficiently with each other and with our federal team.  
   
I also want to thank the fi- — first responders who dealt with the
immediate aftermath and the workers on site.  We saw some of them today
as we flew over the site.  They’ve been working 24/7 to clear the
debris.  
   
Within hours of the crash, officials from the U.S. Department of
Transportation were on the ground, supporting Pennsylvania officials to
get the site cleared and be able to start the rebuilding.  
   
The immediate release of $3 million — it was called “quick release”
emergency funds — were made to offset the cost of repairs.  
   
This is just a down payment, obviously.  It’s a lot more than that. 
You’re going to be getting a lot more federal funding out the door in
the coming weeks.  
   
Additionally, Pennsylvania has already received $8.9 billion from the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, including $6.5 billion for transportation
projects, which gives the governor some flexibility to move existing
state funds to this project right away, knowing that this money is in
the — in the bank.  
   
Also, union crews have been hard at work 24/7 since the crash. 
Operating engineers, the laborers, the carpenters, cement finishers,
teamsters, and the ironworkers are going to help rebuild.  And they’re
doing — they’re doing it right now.  
   
And folks here know that the crews finished demolition on Thursday,
ahead of schedule, and now they’re working on emergency repairs to
quickly and safely reopen the roadway to traffic.  
   
The federal government — I’ve committed we’re going to reimburse 100
percent of this phase of the work in well over the first 200 days.  And
then, after that, 90 percent of the work.  
   
We’ll be here until the end.  We won’t leave until it’s finished.  
   
And that’s why I want to — I asked Mayor Landrieu, who runs my operation
relative to the infrastructure legislation, to lead the effort.  He
knows, as mayor, what it takes — Mayor Kenney, as you know — to get this
done.  He — New Orleans never had any problems like tornados and
hurricanes and floods and the like.  But all kidding aside, he’s on it —
on this every day.  
   
We’re using materials made of recycled glass, manufactured here in
Delaware County, Pennsylvania.  And the design of the project is
incredibly innovative in order to get this work done in record time.  
   
We’re also working with local officials to redirect traffic, minimize
congestion, and — along alternative routes.  
   
Look, I grew up not very far from here, just across the line in
Pennsylvania — I mean from Pennsylvania — in Claymont, Delaware.  I know
how important this stretch of highway is not just to Philly but to the
entire Northeast Corridor and to my home state.  
   
Over 150,000 vehicles travel on it every day, including 14,000 — 14,000
trucks.   
   
It’s critical.  It’s critical to our economy, and it’s critical to our
quality of life.  
   
We’re going to continue to do everything we can within our power to get
this back open as quickly and easily as possible.  
   
We’re not leaving until it’s done.  And we’re going to get this done,
God willing, in record time.  
   
I’m looking forward to hearing more from the folks on the ground in — in
a moment.  
   
And now, I’m going to turn it over to the governor, who is doing one
hell of a job.  He gets tired of my calls, I think, but he’s doing a
hell of a job.  
   
Thank you.  
   
Gov.
