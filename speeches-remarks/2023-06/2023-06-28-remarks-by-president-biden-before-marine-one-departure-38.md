Q    Senator Tuberville is not budging on Pentagon promotions.  Senator
Tuberville is not budging on Pentagon promotions.  
   
Q    Mr. President, was Prigozhin — was Prigozhin looking to capture
military leaders?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  He’s not budging on it, as I understand, from my
colleagues.  It’s totally inappropriate.  It’s outrageous.  
   
Q    But he says the Defense Department should not be paying for
abortion travel.  Your response?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  He doesn’t know what he’s talking about.   
   
Q    Was Prigozhin looking to capture military leaders?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  That remains to be seen.  
   
Q    President Biden, (inaudible) escalating in Ukraine?  Why not engage
with Russia in meaningful talks to try to deescalate the whole situation
in Ukraine?  You’re sending F-16s, sir.  
   
Q    Mr. President, has Putin been weakened by what happened in
Russia?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Absolutely.  
   
Q    To what extent has Vladimir Putin been weakened by recent events?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  It’s hard to tell, but he’s clearly losing the war in
Iraq \[sic\].  He’s losing the war at home.  And he has become a bit of
a pariah around the world.  And it’s not just NATO; it’s not just the
European Union.  It’s Japan.  It’s — it’s — you know, it’s 40 nations.  
   
Q    President Biden, how involved — President Biden, how involved were
you in your son’s “Chinese shakedown” text message?  Were you sitting
there?   
   
Q    Mr. President —  
   
Q    Were you involved?  Were you involved?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, I wasn’t.  And I don’t —  
   
Q    Do you think Vladimir Putin is —  
   
Q    Were you?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No!  
   
Q    Mr. President —  
   
Q    Do you think Vladimir Putin is weaker today than he was before all
those events?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I know he was — is.  
   
Q    Will you give Congress your bank records, President Biden?  Will
you give Congress —  
   
Q    Is the worst of the inflation over?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Let me put it this way: I’ve been hearing every month
there’s going to be a recession next month.  The consensus is: Two
thirds of the economists and the major leaders in the banks think we’re
not going to have a recession.  I don’t think we will either.   
   
But I tell you one thing: In addition to the — the prices that — going
to con- — what a recession constitutes — we’re bringing down prices
across the board for people.  That’s what I’m going to be talking about
today.  
   
Q    A week ago, sir, you said you didn’t know “what the hell Bidenomics
is.”  Sir, can you tell us today what it is?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Sure I didn’t, because the first time I heard it used
was by you guys in the press.  
   
Q    Can you comment on Sweden’s succession in NATO?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’d rather not speak to (inaudible) right now.  
   
Q    Why no new policy announcement with the branding?  Why no new
policy announcements with the branding?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Wha- —  
   
Q    With the Bidenomics branding.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, look, you guys branded it.  I didn’t.  That’s — I
never called it “Bidenomics.”  And so, I was asked the question: Why did
I —  
   
Q    Your economic team is calling it “Bidenomics.”  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, wait.  Let’s get it straight.  The first time it was
used was in the Wall Street Journal.  Okay?  I don’t go around beating
my chest, “Bidenomics.”  So, the press started calling it
“Bidenomics.”  
   
Q    Do you not like it, sir?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, I like it.  It’s fine.  Yeah, it’s fine, because it
is my policy.
