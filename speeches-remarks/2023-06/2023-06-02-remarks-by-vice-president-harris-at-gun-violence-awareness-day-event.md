THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Hi, everyone!  (Applause.)  Hi, everyone.  Good
afternoon.  Good afternoon.  
   
Can we give it up for Jada?  (Applause.)  And, you know, I will tell
you, I’m so honored to be here, in particular with all of the young
leaders like Jada, because you all are what this is all about.    
   
And we are so proud of you, and we care about you, and we want you to
soar.  And we have a deep and profound sense of responsibility to allow
you to dream and to be, and to be safe.  And so that’s why we are all
here together today.  
   
I want to thank Secretary Miguel Cardona for the work that you do every
day.  (Applause.)  
   
And to all the state and local elected leaders, to my friend Angela
Ferrell-Zabala — where are you? — thank you for your leadership.  
   
And Moms Demand Action, Students Demand Action — (applause) — thank you
all.  Thank you all.  
   
So, we’re all here today for a simple reason: Every person and every
child deserves the opportunity to fulfill their dreams and live up to
their God-given potential.  
   
Every family, in every community, should have the freedom to live and to
thrive.  
   
And we know none of that is possible — true freedom is not possible if
people are not safe.  (Applause.)   
   
In a civilized society, the people must know they can shop in a grocery
store, walk down the street, or even sit in a classroom and know that
they will be safe from fear and from violence.  
   
And so that is why we are all here today: to mark Gun Violence Awareness
Day and to address the moment that we are in.  
   
Our nation is being torn apart by gun violence, and torn apart by the
very fear of gun violence.  
   
It is tragic that every day in the United States of America, that there
are parents who offer a prayer after dropping their child off at school
that their child will make it home safe and alive, who fear the worst
every time they see a text from their child’s school.  
   
It is a shame that in our country today teachers have to start off the
school year introducing \[sic\] and introducing a child — instructing a
child on how to barricade the classroom door.  
   
That kindergarten students practice lockdown drills and rehearse how to
turn off the lights and hide quietly in a closet.  
   
And that, just last year, students at this school — and thousands of
others across our nation — had to walk out of class simply to demand
action to save lives.  (Applause.)   
   
All of this that leads to, as Jada has put it, and I quote, “a permanent
state of fear and outrage” for our students.  
   
And everyone here, because this is a room full of leaders — everyone
here knows that in this moment in our country, the number one cause of
death of the children in America is gun violence.  
  
The number one cause of death for the children of America is gun
violence.  
   
In this very moment in our country, one in five Americans has lost a
family member to gun violence.  One in five.  
   
In the 153 days of this year, there have been more than 260  
mass shootings.  
   
And because of everyday gun violence in communities  
across our nation, every single day, on average, 120 Americans are
killed with guns.  
   
And as we all know, while this violence impacts all communities, it does
not do so equally.  
   
Black Americans are 10 times more likely to be victims of
gun <s>violence</s>\[homicides\].  Latino Americans, twice as likely.  
   
Folks, we cannot normalize any of this.   
   
These are not just statistics or another headline.  These are the lives
of our children, of loved ones, of parents and siblings and our fellow
Americans.  
   
Here in Virginia, it is a six-year-old boy who has access to a gun, and
shoots and wounds his teacher just a few months ago in Newport News.  It
is the three student athletes who were shot and killed at UVA last
fall.  It is the 32 students and faculty who lost their lives at
Virginia Tech.   
   
I will tell you, as a former courtroom prosecutor and former elected
District Attorney, I prosecuted homicide cases.  I have seen with my own
eyes what a bullet does to the human body.  I have held hands with
parents who have lost a child.  I have tried to comfort children who
were traumatized by the loss of a parent or a sibling.  
   
And as someone who has fought my entire career to try to end this
violence, I know some of the answers are pretty straightforward. 
Solutions do exist.  (Applause.)  Solutions do exist.   
   
It just requires elected leaders in the United States Congress and in
state legislatures to pass commonsense reforms.  (Applause.)  To simply
exercise courage.  (Applause.)  Common sense.   
   
So here’s the thing: It is reasonable that you might want to know before
someone can buy a gun whether they have been found by a court to be a
danger to themselves or others.  Common sense would suggest background
checks and red-flag laws might avoid that danger.  (Applause.)  Common
sense.   
   
And by comparison, it makes no sense, as some would suggest, to require
teachers to carry firearms.  (Applause.)  Because understand what that
would mean: We’re going to have a second-grader look up at the front of
her classroom and see her teacher strapped with a gun?  Again, it’s just
common sense for us to believe teachers should focus on teaching —
(applause) — and children should focus on learning.  (Applause.)  Common
sense.  
   
And consider weapons of war, weapons that were designed to kill a lot of
people quickly.  It’s just common sense to believe that they have no
place on the streets of a civil society –(applause) — and that is time
to renew the assault weapons ban.  (Applause.)   
   
And on the subject of gun safety laws, it is a false choice — it is a
false choice to suggest that we have to choose between either supporting
the Second Amendment or passing reasonable gun safety laws. 
(Applause.)  We can do both.  We can do both.  (Applause.)  
   
And the majority of NRA members support background checks for all gun
purchases.  (Applause.)  We just need leaders to step up and show some
courage.  (Applause.)   
   
And thanks to so many here, in 2020 we saw that people in our nation
stood in line to vote, and they elected President Joe Biden and me vice
president.  (Applause.)   
   
And because of that work, because people voted, people stood in line,
people registered folks to vote — our young leaders said, “I might not
be able to vote, but when you vote, think about me and who represents my
interests.”  And because of all of that, we were then able to pass the
first significant piece of federal gun safety legislation in 30 years —
thanks to you all.  (Applause.)  And most noteworthy about that:
bipartisan gun legislation.  Bipartisan.  (Applause.)     
   
Democrats and some Republicans came together, backed by a majority of
Americans, and you — you made that happen.  Because of your voices,
extremist so-called leaders and the gun lobby could not stand in our
way, not even those just a few miles away from here at the headquarters
of the NRA.  (Applause.)  
   
But let’s be clear: We have more to do.  So, let us continue to fight,
to make sure the voices of students and parents and teachers and
preachers will not be silenced.  (Applause.)  Let us make sure.  Let us
make sure that the voice of the people will be heard, that the voice of
the people will not be discouraged, will not be deterred, and that we
will not tire.  
  
Because the bottom line is this: We love our country.  We love our
country.  (Applause.)  And I believe — I believe, especially in this
moment, that the strength of our nation depends on each of us,
especially our young leaders.  (Applause.)  Especially you.  
  
So — so, specifically to the students of John Lewis High School —
(applause) — specifically to you, I don’t need to tell you Congressman
John Lewis fought his whole life for the civil rights of all people. 
(Applause.)  I was so honored to work with him.  And I will tell you
that — I think we all do believe; I certainly do — that the right to be
safe is also a civil right.  (Applause.)  
   
So, to the young leaders, I don’t need to tell you; you know this: John
Lewis was only 23 when he spoke during the March on Washington. 
(Applause.)  And he was 76 when he led a sit-in at the U.S. House of
Representatives to demand action to end gun violence.  (Applause.)  The
great John Lewis — the great John Lewis taught us it is never too early
or too late to join this fight.  (Applause.)  
   
Recall — recall the Parkland students were in high school when they
marched for their lives and inspired a national movement.  
   
Maxwell Frost — (applause) — was 15 when he joined the movement to end
gun violence, and now he is the first Gen Z member of the United States
Congress.  (Applause.)  
   
And two of the most recent national heroes in this movement, the two
expelled members of the Tennessee Three — (applause) — the Justins — are
both in their twenties.  
   
So, to our young leaders, I say: We hear you.  We support you.  And we
need you.  
  
We are all in this together.  And so, together, we must fight.  And when
we fight, we win.  (Applause.)  
   
Thank you.  God bless you.  And God bless the United States of America. 
Thank you all.  (Applause.)
