Private Residence  
Greenwich, Connecticut

6:08 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Please, have a seat.  First of all, Stephen, sir, thank
you very, very much for the hospitality.  Just what you all need to do
in early June, with graduations going on: show up, have to get dressed
on a Friday, then maybe even Saturday.  Who knows.  (Laughter.)  Anyway
—  
   
And I want to thank all my colleagues from the Senate and the House, and
the governor.  I think you have — and I mean this sincerely — I think
you have the most consequential delegation in the United States
Congress.  I really mean it.  And you’ve got a governor who is really
first rate.  They know it, and they know what they do.  They know how to
get things done.  And they’ve been great, great allies.  
   
And, folks, everyone here — we wouldn’t be — I wouldn’t be here,
standing here as President of the United States, without a lot of you in
this room.  You’ve — I — I never raised a lot of money when I was
running before, whether I was vice president or whether I was a senator
or — you know, I was — I did all right.  
   
But this last time out, many of you — I raised more money than I think
anybody has ever raised in small contributions as well — I mean,
literally millions of dollars.  And it allowed me to be able to say what
I thought, do what I thought was the right thing to do, and be
straightforward about it.  
   
So, thank you.  It makes a gigantic difference.  
   
(Referring to the handheld microphone.)  Is this thing working or should
I put it down?  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  It’s working.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  It’s working.  
   
Well, look, so far, so good, in terms of the — just a few facts and then
maybe we can just mingle and you can ask me whatever you want, talk
about anything you want to talk about.  
   
You know, I’ve — I’ve met with a lot of world leaders.  My background
going into this job, I guess, was mostly constitutional issues and
foreign policy.  And I’ve met the vast majority of the heads of state in
the past.  And when I was vice president, that was my job.  When I was
Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, it’s what I spent most of
my time doing.  
   
And there were two objectives I had.  You may recall when I announced
for president last time — when you were helping me, many of you — I
indicated that I thought there were three things that had to be done.  
   
One, we had to restore the soul of this nation — the sense of decency,
honor; some sense of constitutional, institutional structure — again.
 We had sort of — we had, I think, devolved to a point where we hadn’t
been in a long, long, long time.  
   
And — and so — and I said, “So, I want to restore the soul of the
country, number one.”  Number two, I wanted to build the economy from
the middle up, the bottom up.  Because when that happens, the wealthy do
very well and everybody has a shot.  And in the trickle-down economy,
not a lot trickled down to my gran- — my pop’s — my dad’s kitchen
table.  But —  
   
And, number three, I said I wanted — and I got legitimately and
understandably criticized — I said I wanted to unite the country. 
Because in a democracy, we can’t function if we can’t unite.  We need
consensus in order to run this great country by the very nature of our
institutions and our structure.  
   
And — and so, that’s what we set out to do.  With your help, we’ve — I
think we’ve gotten a lot of it done.  
   
For example, with regard to restoring the sense of decency and honor,
people are — it’s not — not gotten — it’s not as vitriolic — with
notable exceptions — as it has been.  I think things are moving a
little.  I think people thought when we — when we took on the very
hard-right members of the House of Representatives dealing with the debt
ceiling, I think people were surprised — surprised that we were able to
pull together enough people on both sides to come up with a rational and
a serious budget proposal.  
   
My first two years, I reduced the de- — my administration reduced the —
the debt by 1- — $1.7 trillion — more than any president has in American
history — in the first two years.  
   
We’ve created over 13 million 400 thou- — I think it’s 13-450 million
jobs — more than any president has in the first four years of any
administration.  
   
And it’s not about — it’s about giving people a shot — giving people an
even shot.  
   
We also put ourselves in a position where we have done more on the
environment, I think, than — I think it’s fair to say — than any
president ever has.  And the reason I say that is because we’re in a
situation where, if you’re —  
   
I’m — again, I was warned not to make a — a 20-minute speech here, so
I’m not going to do that.  But I want to just give you a few, as they
used to say, factoids.  
   
Number one, we were able to pass and maintain — keep in play, no matter
what the other team tried to take away — $369 billion in environmental
money for the environment.  
   
Of that, we’ve reduced by — by the year 2030, we’re going to reduce 50
to 52 percent of all emissions — all emissions.  We’re in a situation
where the — we’re in a situation where we’re going to move in a
direction that, by 2030, we’re going to have 75 percent of all the
energy we produce renewable energy.  By the year 30- — 2035, the United
States is on path to do 100 percent renewable energy.  
   
We’re — conservation — we’ve conserved more land and water than any
administration has in American history.  We’ve conserved the most — for
example, in Alaska alone, we’ve been able to preserve and make sure the
9 — excuse me, 9 million acres.  In Minnesota, the Boundary Waters, 250
million — thousand acres.  
   
The — you know — anyway, I won’t go through it all, but we’ve done a
great deal.  We — for example, one of the things I tried very hard to do
— and everybody was saying we couldn’t do anything in a bipartisan way —
is not just the partisan side but the traditional — how can I — not
enemies, but adversaries.   
   
One — a lot of people thought in the very beginning, when I didn’t
announce my green plan, that somehow I was backing off of what I had
said before.  Well, what I was doing was meeting with the auto industry
and the autoworkers and the laborers to convince them that it’s
overwhelmingly in their interest to support these environmental
changes.  
   
Well, to make a quick analogy — point, this — tomorrow, I’m going up to
Philadelphia to have every major labor union in the country endorse me —
every one.  And yesterday, every major environmental group endorsed me —
every single one.  (Applause.)  
   
Because we figured out it’s in the mutual interest.  The jobs lie in the
future.  The jobs — not on all the — that doesn’t mean we’re not going
to need some oil and gas and — for a while.  But it does mean that we’re
going to funda- — make a fundamental shift.  
   
And — for example, when I go to these COP meetings — these — these
meetings relating to international efforts to deal with the environment
worldwide, whether it was in Cairo or the — wherever it is.  And guess
what?  We’re now on a path that we’re going to be able to take out — we
got agreement last time out with all the major countries — over 100
countries — that they will deal with what — they’re referred to as those
really terrible — terrible, terrible — how can I say it? — just
everything from methane to all the worst of all chemicals going into the
air.  
   
Well, you know, we got a — I proposed at one of those meetings with the
— the six — there are seven major nations in the world economies — that
we all agree to get rid of methane by the year 20- — well, we’re moving
that way.  Methane is four, five, six times more damaging to the
environment than, for example, just greenhouse gases.  And we — we talk
about it all the time.  
   
We are — you know, we’re in a position where we have 50 factories now in
America making electric batteries and increasing the production.  We’re
not where China is now, but we’re making significant progress.  
   
We have — we’re going to have twice as many charging stations as when I
began.  And by the year — by the time we finish the transition to
electric vehicles, we’re building 500 thou- — 500,000 charging stations
nationwide so you can go across the country like you could — every gas
station you needed was available to you.  Well, same thing here.  
   
And one of the things that I think — and I’m going to end here — is that
I’ve tried to bring together traditional adversaries because I think the
world has changed.   
   
There’s a famous poet named — and I was quoting Irish poets, and my
colleagues would always kid me because they say I’m doing it because I’m
Irish.  That’s not the reason.  I do it because they’re the best poets
in the world.  (Laughter.)  
   
But Seamus Heaney, who’s — I mean, he’s passed away but I’m friends with
his wife — he wrote a poem called “The Cure of Troy.”  And there was a
sentence, and he says, “All is changed…” — “All is changed, changed
utterly.  A terrible beauty has been born.”  
Well, a terrible beauty has been born.  We have an opportunity to make
significant progress off of it.  The idea that finally — I don’t hear —
if I were here in this living room with your friends three years ago,
you would have had a lot of friends who would say they doubted whether
there was a real environmental crisis, that there really was a serious
problem.  
   
Do you know many people saying that these days?  They may say “In my
interest, I don’t want to do that.”  But do you know anybody who says
there’s not an environmental crisis?  
   
There was an article in the New York Times three Mondays, ago; there was
one again, I think, four days ago — pointing out where the state of
Texas — state of Texas has more solar and wind energy.  I think it’s 70
percent of all their energy produced by solar and wind because it is
significantly cheaper.  Cheaper.  Cheaper.  Not just because it is — it
is environmentally more — more friendly, but it’s cheaper.  
   
And guess what they’re doing?  The legislature is trying to get rid of
it because they want to do the bidding of the oil companies.  
   
We’re going to need oil for a while.  We’re going to need gas.  We’re
going to — but nothing like we consume now.  Nothing.  
   
But it’s working, and that’s bothered some people that it’s working.  
   
But the other point I want to make is that it’s the same way in bringing
together the world.  And I’ll end with this.  
   
I get both credit and blame for keeping NATO united.  The fact is that
when I — we supported Ukraine, and all my colleagues in here did as
well.  We supported Ukraine.  The concern was because we — Putin was
certain — and I’ve known him for 28 years, almost 30 years, only having
met with him — last time I met with him for any period of time was two
years ago in Geneva.  But I know him.  
   
And he was confident — confident that he could break the West; we would
not stay together because NATO had never been — had — was having some
serious rifts internally about what to do in Europe.  Well, guess what? 
Ask any NATO leader.  NATO is more united today than it has been any
time in the history of NATO — in the history of NATO.  That’s good for
America.  
   
And, by the way, when I went and told people that we’re — I was going to
bring Japan along — when’s the last time Japan would have an interest in
seeing what peace in Europe and supply — (audience members laugh) — no,
I’m serious.  Think about it.  Well, guess what?  Became close friend —
I used to always kid Barack, as the Governor knows.  And we’d — I met
with him every morning at nine o’clock for eight years when I was vice
president.  And I’d start off and say — he’d start talking, and I would
say, “All politics is personal, Barack.”  
   
It’s personal with heads of state.  It’s personal with — with dealing
with colleagues.  It’s personal.  And you have to build trust.  
   
Well, now you have — you have Japan significantly increasing their
defense budget; Japan supporting Ukraine in Europe because he knows that
there’s no such thing as a major war in Europe that will not affect all
the world.   
   
You have him finally making — which no one believed, but when I talked
to him at length about why he had to get together with South Korea and
settle a 50-year difference they had about women — the way they were
treating women — well, they’ve worked it out.  They’re now dealing with
one another.  
   
The point is that these moments of change, I think we have opportunities
to not only change the direction but to change the order of things in
ways that are better for the moment.   
   
I’ll end with this.  The — how can I say?  Before I decided to run in
2020 — and I had decided not to run initially, until we saw what
happened down in Charlottesville, Virginia.  And that young woman was
killed.  And the former President was asked, “What do you think?”  Said
there were good people on both sides.  
   
Well, you know, not figuratively, literally, my grandchildren asked for
me — we have a tradition in my family, for real — it’s only been
exercised about 10 times since I’ve been alive — where any child can ask
for a family meeting.  And it’s taken seriously.  Not a joke.  And you
can have a family meeting to discuss what’s — and if the family wants,
they (inaudible).  
   
And so, I got a call from my daughter — was in her last year at Columbia
Law School, my granddaughter.  And I got a call from my number two
granddaughter, who was a senior at Penn at that time.  And then I had
one who was a junior.  Anyway.  I have four granddaughters and a
grandson.  
   
And they all came to me.  That was — got the call on Thursday; we met on
Saturday.  And they said — because they knew I was thinking of running,
but I knew it was going to be an ugly campaign.  And I didn’t — wonder
whether I wanted to put the family through that again.   
   
And they said, “Pop…” — they started at age; the oldest one spoke
first.  And now we said, “Pop…” — named after my deceased daughter — I
said — said, “Pop, you know Dad wants you to run.  Will you — you’ve got
to run.  You’ve got to do it.”  And they all went down their reasons. 

And I got to my grandson.  My wife doesn’t like me telling this part,
but I think it’s important.  My little grandson, who was then a soph- —
in eighth grade, almost going into ninth, and he took out — he said, “We
know it’s going to be tough, Pop.” 

And the reason — you know, I mean, think about it: Their entire life,
their grandfather is either senator, vice president and/or — well,
senator at that time or vice president, and their dad had been attorney
general.  And so their whole life, they — they understood the politics,
just like if you’re — I — I never knew what the hell a mortgage was.  If
my dad were a banker, I would have known was a mortgage was when I was
nine years old.  (Laughter.)

So he took out his cell phone.  He said, “We know it’s going to be ugly,
Pop.”

And there was a photograph on — online.  There was a picture that was
online put out by someone — who did it, I didn’t even look — of me
walking out of the church with a military cord on, carrying my dead son
with the American flag on it and my hand on the flag, and then my hand
on my little grandson around his chin.  And the head- — the — the chyron
at the bottom said, “Biden molests another child.”  Said, “We know it’s
going to be ugly, Pop.”

Well, the truth is, I think the American people are a lot better than we
give them credit for.  I think they’re focusing.  I think they’re
looking hard.  I think they’re deciding what they have to do.  
   
And I think that’s going to cross — across the board.  We hear these
numbers about so many people are not going to move.  I think people are
— are looking for it.  I think they sense there’s real opportunity.  But
they don’t know exactly what it is yet. 

And that’s my responsibility.  Everything we passed — we’ve done polling
on since it’s passed — it’s overwhelmingly popular.  It’s
overwhelmingly.  The CHIPS and Science Act, which created literally $300
billion in direct investment, creating tens of thousands of jobs. 

We’re in a situation where there’s a trillion two hundred billion
dollars in — in money for new environmental, not — excuse me, not just
environment, in- — in- — in- — industrial capacity.  How can — how can
you be the most powerful and successful nation in the world with a
second-rate econ- — a second-rate infrastructure?

We used to be number 1 in the world; we’re now number 14 in the world. 
There’s things — and this creates jobs, and it changes the environment
and changes people’s attitudes. 

And so there’s a lot we’ve done.  And I think we just got to let many
people know we’ve done it and be straight with people.  Just be as
straight as we can about what we’ve done and what we haven’t done. 

And one of the things I decided to do was — this time out, when I ran
last time — was to say what I thought was on my mind, because there
wasn’t anything worth anymore to — just to keep the job. 

No, I — I mean, it sincerely.  There’s nothing noble about it.  I’ve
just been doing this so damn long, I’m not going to — (laughter) — fo- —
but for real. 

And I think that’s how your delegation is, by the way.  I think when
push comes to shove, they’d rather say — rather than move on something
they don’t believe, to say “no” and take the risk of losing.  Because I
think we underestimate that people reward political courage.  They
reward courage. 

And so, I think that one of — you know, and we have four or five major
issues in this campaign, from what’s happening to freedom, women’s right
to choose, what we’re doing in freedom in education, freedom —

I mean, did you ever think you’d go through a time when the number two
contender on another team was banning books?

I mean, you know — anyway.  I’m talking too much now.  (Laughter.) 

So, anyway, I can’t tell you how much I appreciate your help.  Any
questions you have for me, anything you want to talk about, I’m happy to
do it.  I’ll give it to you straight. 

And — but I really am optimistic about America’s prospects, not because
of me, and I mean that sincerely, but because we have a new generation
of young people — young people who are the best educated, the most
decent, the most engaged, the most involved generation in American
history.  That’s why I’m optimistic, for real.

And think of the periods of time and these inflection points where the
decisions made in a four-, five-, six-, seven-year period set the — set
the stage for what the next four or five decades are going to look like.

Well, the post-war period is over.  We’re in a different world.  And we
have gigantic opportunities, and we just have to have the courage and
remember: This is the United States of America.  There is nothing,
nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we decide to work together.  I
mean it.  I believe that with every fiber of my being.

I can’t think of a single thing we’ve ever set our mind to do as a
nation that we haven’t been able to accomplish eventually. 

So there’s a lot I’m hopeful for that two-year-old.  I’m hopeful for
that two-year-old, that long before they’re 30.  Okay?  And I’m 34 years
old.  (Laughter.)

Anyway, I’m going to hush up.  Thank you for listening, and I’m happy to
talk.  (Applause.)
