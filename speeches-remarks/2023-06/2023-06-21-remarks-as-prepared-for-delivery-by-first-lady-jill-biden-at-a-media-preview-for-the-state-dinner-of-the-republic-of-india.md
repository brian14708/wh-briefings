State Dining Room, The White House

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome everyone! It’s a pleasure to be with you.  
   
When we come together around a table, to break bread and share
stories—when we sit shoulder to shoulder, and speak heart to heart—we
find the invisible threads that tie us to one another. We see the
possibilities those connections bring.   
   
It’s a lesson I learned from my mom: that with a handful of fresh
flowers and a set of candles, an ordinary dinner could become a magical
moment—the laughter and joy and kind words staying with us long after
the dishes were cleared away. And I try to bring that same spirit to the
events we host here.   
   
With this Official State Visit, we are bringing together the world’s
oldest and the world’s largest democracies. After years of strengthening
ties, the U.S.-India partnership is deep and expansive as we jointly
tackle global challenges. But our relationship isn’t only about
governments. We’re celebrating the families and friendships that span
the globe—those who feel the bonds of home in both of our countries.    
   
As some of you may know, Prime Minister Modi is a vegetarian. So, we
asked chef Nina Curtis—a plant-based pioneer—to work with our White
House chefs and create a stunning vegetarian menu. Guests will have the
option to add fish to their main course, as well.   
              
Tomorrow night, guests will walk across the South Lawn into a pavilion
draped in rich greens with saffron colored flowers at every table: the
colors of the Indian Flag. And on the transparent sides, those
colors—and the strength and heritage they represent—frame the iconic
scenery and symbols of our nation, our democracy and our history: the
White House and the Washington Monument.   
   
Inside, each table arrangement is warm and unique. We hope guests feel
as if someone has set that table just for them—because we have.   
   
After dinner, we’ll have the opportunity to hear one of our nation’s
incredible talents: Grammy award winner, Joshua Bell.   
   
His performance will be followed by Penn Masala, a South Asian acapella
group from the University of Pennsylvania, who are bringing a little
piece of my hometown to the White House, along with songs inspired by
the sounds of India.   
   
Finally, after the last plates are cleared–with new connections forged,
and old ones strengthened—guests will end their evening walking across a
moonlit lawn. There they will be greeted by hundreds of glowing lanterns
guiding them home, illuminating their pathway with all the warmth and
love and laughter we hope they take away from our time together.   
   
Now, normally the press comes and you look at these beautiful plates of
food our chefs have prepared, and get almost close enough to touch
it—but you don’t get to try it. So today, I’ve asked our chefs to
prepare a few small bites of tomorrow’s menu—to thank you for taking the
time to be with us today.   
   
Every detail of this dinner has been thoughtfully planned by a team of
people from across our government. So, I want to thank the White House
residence staff, our social team, and the State Department staff who
have been working so hard to make this visit meaningful.  
   
Now I will turn it over to our Social Secretary, who has guided this
process, Carlos Elizondo.
