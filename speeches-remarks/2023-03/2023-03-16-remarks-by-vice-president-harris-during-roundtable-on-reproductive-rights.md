title: "Remarks by Vice President Harris During Roundtable on Reproductive\_Rights"

*Grand View University  
Des Moines, Iowa*

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, good afternoon, everyone.  It is good to be
back in Iowa and, in particular, to be with these extraordinary
leaders.   
   
You are local leaders.  You are state-wide leaders.  You are national
leaders on so many issues and, in particular, on the issue that we are
convened to discuss, which is the right that every person in our nation
should have to be able to make decisions about their own body and their
life.  
   
We have this conversation in the context of an action by the highest
court in our land, last year — the United States Supreme Court — where
the United States Supreme Court took a constitutional right, that had
been recognized, from the people of America, from the women of
America.   
  
And what we have seen then is, sadly, what we predicted would happen in
the months that have followed that decision, where people around our
country are concerned, afraid, confused, desperate, in many ways feeling
very alone in terms of what are their options and what are their rights
since that decision came down from the Court.   
   
And even before, we have seen states in the United States of America
that have been proposing or passing laws that would criminalize
healthcare providers, literally laws that provide jail time for a doctor
or a nurse who does what they took an oath to do, which is to treat
their patients in a way they believe is in the best interest of their
patients.   
  
We have seen what I would consider and do consider, as a former
prosecutor, to be an immoral approach to survivors of rape or incest
where, in states, there is even no exception after an individual has
survived such an act of violation to their body and then, by their
state, being deprived of the ability, after that, to make other
decisions about their body.  It’s immoral.   
  
And let’s be clear: On this issue, one does not have to abandon their
faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be
telling her or any individual what to do with their body.   
  
Let them make that decision if they choose with their priest, with their
pastor, with their rabbi, with whomever.  But the government should not
be telling her what to do with her own body.   
  
So this is the issue that we are discussing.   
  
In the months since that decision, it has also become clearer — in a way
that we knew then, but much more clear now — this is not only about
reproductive health, this is about basic healthcare.   
  
Look at what we are seeing in terms of litigation that is occurring
right now in Texas where politicians are asking a court of law to undo a
decision by the FDA that was made on the basis of peer review of the
work of medical health professionals 20 years ago that deemed a
particular medication, mifepristone, to be safe.  
  
And I’d ask anyone that when you’re thinking about what this might mean,
for context, look in your medicine cabinet, because what a doctor has
prescribed to you — likely to help with issues that are with
chemotherapy drugs, or asthma, or blood pressure pills or insulin — that
medication your doctor has prescribed probably was able to be prescribed
because the FDA approved it through a scientific and medical analysis.  
   
So let us understand the significance of this challenge to an FDA
decision and why, as a perfect example of this point, we should all
understand that these attacks go beyond reproductive health.  
  
And that is where we find ourselves at this moment in time in our
country.    
   
We also know that Iowa is on the frontline in this fight, not unlike the
United States as a whole.  In Iowa, the leaders at this table know, the
latest numbers tell us 61 percent of Iowans — the majority of Iowans —
do not support these attacks on reproductive rights.   
   
What we know in Iowa is that there is an attorney general who has joined
attorneys general around the country who are asking the court to
overturn an FDA-approved medication, mifepristone.  There are attorneys
general around the country, including here, who are attempting to tell
pharmacies to not dispense abortion medication in the state.  
   
At the core of these issues is a foundational issue for our country. 
And it is the principle that we are founded on which says that we each
are entitled to freedom and liberty in its most basic manifestation. 
And is this not about freedom and liberty the ability to make these
decisions about one’s own life?  
   
And so I would say to extremist so-called leaders who purport and
profess to hail themselves as a beacon of freedom and opportunity: It is
important to understand what freedom and opportunity means to real
people every day — which calls into question whether we’re on the same
page about what freedom means.  
   
But I do believe, for the majority of Americans, it means the ability
and the freedom to make decisions about their body, the future of their
family, and their life.  
  
So, with that, I thank all the leaders who are here today.  I’m looking
forward to our discussion.  I will say that, on this and so many issues,
we must continue to also build the coalitions — because we are seeing in
many states where there is an attack on reproductive healthcare, there
is also an attack on LGBTQ rights, there is also an attack on voting
rights, the freedom to love the person you love, the freedom to have
access to the ballot box.  
   
And so let us continue, in this fight for these essential principles,
also build the coalition around all of the people who understand what is
at stake.  And in that way, as we build the coalition, let us remind
people that they are not alone and that we’re all in this together.  
   
So with that, I thank you all, and I thank Senator Wahls for moderating
our discussion.  
  
(Conversation begins.)  
   
(Conversation concludes.)  
   
IOWA SENATOR WAHLS:  And that brings our open-press portion of the
discussion to a close.   
   
Q    Madam Vice President, what is the administration’s plan of action
if the Texas court does overrule the FDA on abortion medication?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, let’s just first recognize where we are,
which is, again, that a group of elected politicians are attempting to
use the court of law to implement a political agenda that would undo the
veracity and significance of a medical decision by the FDA about a
medication — a decision that was made 20 years ago.   
   
Understand also, the FDA has been approving medication for over 85
years, not only for this medication but for insulin, for asthma
medication, for medication for high blood pressure, for chemotherapy
medication.   
   
Understand what this means.  There is so much about this issue that
really does attack very fundamental issues and principles.   
   
And on the fundamental issue at play with that court case is our public
health system as a whole.  If politicians can start using the court to
undo doctors’ decisions, imagine where that could lead.  
   
So we take this very seriously.  And we are prepared to do whatever we
may and can if the court rules in a way that is contrary to what we
believe is in the best interest of the public health of America.  
   
                        END
