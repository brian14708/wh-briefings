*The Mix  
Accra, Ghana*

THE VICE PRESIDENT:   Well, greetings, everyone.  It is my immense
pleasure to be with these extraordinary leaders and to engage in the
conversation that we will have this afternoon.  
   
This is an esteemed group of entrepreneurs who happen to be women and
happen to be doing extraordinary work that really is a model for the
potential of all people, but in particular for our girls and women.  
   
And so, I’m very honored to be with each of you today.  And I thank you
for all that you do and for taking this time.  
   
This group of leaders, their — their work ranges from healthcare, to
agriculture, to retail, to the culinary arts.   
   
And, as many of you know, I have spent a majority of my career fighting
for the health, the safety, and the wellbeing of women and girls.  
   
As Vice President of the United States, that work has extended abroad. 
In fact, in almost every trip that I have taken — international trip —
from Guatemala, to South Korea, to here in Ghana, I have convened women
leaders so I could hear from them and hear their stories in a way that
we can then reflect on the role that we have as the United States to
uplift those stories and to collaborate and partner as — as much as we
can and also to talk about the status of women in our world.  
   
Because I do believe that a real measure of the condition of our globe,
much less of each of our respective countries — a real measure of the
status of our wellbeing is going to be reflected by the status and the
wellbeing of women.  
   
And so, for all of these reasons, these conversations are very
important.  Because the wellbeing of women will be a reflection of the
wellbeing of all of society.  
   
As I have said — and actually spoke yesterday in the speech that I gave
— I do strongly believe women must be able to fully participate in
economic, political, and social life.  And they must be able to
participate equally, including in leadership roles.  
   
Our belief is that the empowerment of women is rooted in the concept of
freedom — in the concept of freedom, a concept that is true to this
country and to the United States.  
   
And when I talk about freedom in the context of our conversation today,
it is not only the freedom from harm or violence or want, it is the
freedom to create one’s own future unobstructed, unimpaired.  
   
And I know there are many factors that will impact a woman’s ability to
survive and thrive.  And one of those factors in particular that is the
main subject of our discussion is women’s economic empowerment.  
   
When we lift up the economic status of women, we lift up the economic
status of families, of communities — and all of society benefits.  
   
And I have seen firsthand an extension of those benefits that relates to
the safety of women when they have economic power — their ability to
choose the environment in which they live and to leave an environment
that may be harmful to them.  
   
I have seen how economic empowerment of women has a direct impact on
their health and, by extension, the health of their family and their
community.  
   
The economic empowerment of women relates directly to the ability of
that person to engage in innovation in a way that makes real the
aspirations, the vision, and the dream that she naturally has.  
   
And of course, there’s a direct correlation between policies that are
directed at the economic empowerment of women and the general prosperity
of societies.  
   
And this is especially true when we think about the digital economy.  As
I said yesterday, digital services are essential to 21st-century
economies, and digital inclusion drives growth for all people.  Yet,
there is a gender divide in the world.   
   
So, today, to help address this, I am pleased to announce here with
these leaders that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, together with
our administration, will establish the Women in the Digital Economy
Fund, which is a $60 million global fund, which, among other things,
will address access, affordability, digital literacy, and gender
inequality.  
   
In addition, the Gates Founda- — Foundation is investing an additional
$40 million to support these goals.  
   
Beyond this commitment, I am also pleased to announce a series of other
significant private sector commitments alongside U.S. government
efforts.   
   
In total, these investments represent more than $1 billion that is being
dedicated to advance women’s economic participation across the African
continent.  
  
These investments spanned from sources that are in the technology
sector, financial services sector, and healthcare industries, and will
help to do predominantly three things: help digitize women-owned small
businesses and entrepreneurs; provide access to capital, healthcare, and
education; and combat gender-based violence.  
  
Now, I want to be clear about this approach.  There is a subtle but
profound difference between an effort to increase women’s inclusion and
the correlated effort that must be intentional to increase women’s
leadership.  
  
The focus here is on both inclusion and leadership, understanding that
women must have the opportunity and the access to all that is necessary
to achieve their goals, their desire, their potential to also lead.  
  
So the investments that I have outlined, we believe, will help build a
future where women are not just treated equally but are able to thrive,
where women have the opportunity to lead, and a future, simply put,
where there will be no barriers for the ability of women to participate
in the economy, where they can enjoy freedom from violence and equal
access to healthcare and education, and where they can shatter every
glass ceiling.  
  
And what we know about that is to shatter a glass ceiling is not without
effort and sometimes some pain.  Am- —  
  
PARTICIPANT:  (Inaudible.)  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Right.  Amen to this, right?  (Laughter.)  
  
But, oh, isn’t it worth it?  And none of us have achieved the status and
the place that we are at now without a lot of people believing in the
potential and supporting that.  And that, as it all remains, is the
essence and the spirit behind our approach to invest in the natural
potential that exists.  
  
So I look forward to talking today with these leaders, and this
discussion is only the beginning.  
  
So, with that, I’m going to thank Ambassador Palmer, as well.  I have
asked her and she has agreed that, going forward, she will, through the
United States Embassy here, continue this conversation by establishing
what we have named the Ambassador’s Advisory Council for Women
Entrepreneurs.  That deserves applause.  (Applause.)   
  
 So, with that, we are going to thank the press for their
participation.  And I will, though, mention in front of the press that
the ambassador intends, with this advisory council, to — to create
regular convenings of women entrepreneurs and those who support women
entrepreneurs, and to do that work throughout this country in a way that
is designed to support, uplift, and help.  
  
So, with that, thank you all.  And I thank the press.
