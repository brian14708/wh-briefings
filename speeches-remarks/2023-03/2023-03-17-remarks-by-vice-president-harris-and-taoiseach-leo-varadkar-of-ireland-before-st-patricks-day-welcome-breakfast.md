*Vice President’s Residence  
*Washington, D.C.**

VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Good morning, everyone.  Good morning and
welcome and Happy St. Patrick’s Day.   
   
I am honored — Doug and I — the Second Gentleman — are honored to
welcome the Taoiseach and Mr. Barrett to the Vice President’s
Residence.  You’ve been here before.  It is a great honor of ours, as
the United States, to know that we have an enduring relationship not
only with Ireland but with its leaders.  And so welcome to you both. 
Welcome to you both.   
   
We are joined today by many dignitaries, including a member of the
Cabinet: Secretary of the Veterans Affairs Administration, Secretary
McDonough.  And to all of you, welcome, welcome, welcome.   
   
I am excited that we are resuming this tradition of recognizing and
welcoming the Taoiseach on the occasion of St.  Patrick’s Day to the
United States.   
   
As you all know, Vice President Biden — this was one of his most
particular joys as Vice President.  (Laughter.)  And as you all know, he
is quite exuberant in that joy, and I now have caught the bug. 
(Laughter and applause.)  
   
And our two countries, as we know — and the Taoiseach and I were able to
discuss a bit before we came in — our two nations have such a deep,
long, and enduring history together.  And that is through our people,
and it is through our traditions, and it is through our common values
and priorities as it relates to international rules and norms and where
we stand in solidarity on so many issues — including, most recently, the
issue of Ukraine and what we must do to stand together, joined with our
allies, to speak out against Russia’s unprovoked aggressions in
Ukraine.   
   
When I think of the relationship between our nations, we also — and the
President will speak about this later today when he meets with the
Taoiseach — cherish the hard-earned and -won peace in Northern Ireland
from the Good Friday Agreement.  And it marks its anniversary, of
course, this April.  And it is something that we take quite seriously
and the President has been quite outspoken about, in terms of our
commitment.   
   
And as President Biden has said, the Windsor Framework is an essential
step to ensure peace and progress and to ensure that it is strengthened
and preserved.   
   
I know that the President will discuss these matters with you later. 
And as you and I spoke privately, again, he takes these issues very
seriously.   
   
Today is also, of course, a day to celebrate the longstanding
relationships and the great pride that we, as Americans, take in our
Irish roots.  (Laughter.)   
   
In the mid-19th century, thousands of Irish immigrants made their way —
I will speak now as a point of personal privilege — made their way to
California — (laughter) — during the Gold Rush.  
   
And as many of you know, most of my career I spent in San Francisco,
which has a long and strong pride in its Irish roots.  And — and I will
say that the Irish and the immigrants who came generations ago have
shaped the history and the culture of the United States, but I will
speak in particular about California and its impact there.   
   
In 1867, many of you may know, more than a decade before New York or
Boston elected an Irish mayor, San Francisco elected Frank McCoppin of
County Longford.  (Applause.)  Yes, I am happy to educate everyone here
— (laughs) — about these relationships.  
   
And one of my favorite stories is of Kate Kennedy.  Originally from
County Meath, she led the Equal Pay for Equal Work campaign in 1874 in
California.  And, of course, just this week — or last week — we here in
the United States celebrated Equal Pay Day.  Longstanding relationships
and commitment based on common values and priorities.   
   
And let us fast forward, then, to 2023.  Again, I will make a California
reference.  (Laughter.)  At the Oscars earlier this week, Irish talent
was nominated for 14 awards and took home two wins.   
   
And then, yesterday, it is my understanding the Taoiseach visited my
alma mater, Howard University, to celebrate and strengthen programs
between the students there and the Smurfit Business School in Dublin.   
   
So, through this and many other exchanges, including the — the pride
that both Ireland and the United States take in the relationship between
Frederick Douglass and Ireland, we show that through the years, through
generations, this is a strong and enduring relationship that makes us
all very proud.   
   
And so, with that, Happy St. Patrick’s Day.  I will now raise a glass to
toast the Taoiseach, Mr. Barrett, and all of you on St. Patrick’s Day. 
Happy St. Patrick’s Day.  Cheers.  
   
(A toast is offered.)  
      
Okay, the Taoiseach is now going to speak.  Thank you.  
   
TAOISEACH VARADKAR:  Good morning, everyone.  Vice President Harris;
Second Gentleman, Mr. Doug Emhoff; distinguished guests and friends.  As
we come together this St. Patrick’s Day morning in the breaking of
bread, we enact what is a most ancient and enduring expression of
friendship honored across cultures.   
   
So, thank you very much, Madam Vice President, for inviting Matt and me
to be here in your beautiful home and for continuing that very special
tradition which was initiated by President Biden when he was resident
here.  
   
As doctors and as proud members of the LGBT community, allow us to say
how inspired we’ve been by your personal advocacy for marriage equality,
particularly in relation to Proposition 8, and also your defense of the
Affordable Health Care Act.   
   
From — from Stonewall to Sacramento to San Francisco, America has led
the way when it comes to LGBT equality.  I don’t think I would be here
today were it not for what America did.  And I know you’ve been such a
strong ally for our community in that regard.  Thank you for that. 
(Applause.)  
   
I also want to recognize your role in defending the Affordable Health
Care Act in particular.  And we’ve a similar program in Ireland called
Sláintecare.  We’re abolishing hospital charges; capping the cost of
prescription medicines; abolishing doctor fees — doctor’s fees for
children, for seniors, and for those on modest incomes; and we’re
phasing out private practice in public hospitals.   
   
So, I think on those agendas, we have much in common and also much to
do.   
   
This year, as you know, we’re marking many anniversaries in Ireland: 25
years since the Good Friday Agreement, 50 years since we joined the
European Union, and 100 years since we joined the League of Nations.  
   
And the international landscape has changed dramatically in the sweep of
time.  For Ireland, however, one relationship has endured throughout:
our close and deep bond with these United States.  And we’re always
grateful for that.   
   
So, Madam Vice President, today I want to acknowledge the central role
which the U.S. has played in the peace process on our island, driving it
forward at critical points, when few others had the influence to do
so.   
   
To mark this, Madam Vice President, my delegation and I are presenting
you with an Irish silver bell as a token of our appreciation and as an
emblem of the principles that our countries hold dear: peace and
freedom.   
   
Of course, I’m also conscious of the special resonance that a bell has
here in the United States, with the world-renowned Liberty Bell, a
symbol of your freedom and independence, of hope and equality —
principles that will inspire us for the next 25 years.   
   
As we look to the future, the agreement reached between the EU and the
UK, which you mentioned earlier — the Wes- — the Windsor Framework — has
the potential to restore very good relations between Ireland and the UK,
and to restore relations and institutions of the Good Friday Agreement:
the All Party Assembly, the power-sharing Executive, and the North/South
Ministerial Council.   
   
It should also hop- — help to open a new chapter in relations between
the EU and the UK.   
   
We’re not quite there yet.  But I think with good faith on all sides —
and we have that — and the help of our continuing friends here in
America, we can get there.  
   
Madam Vice President, as we work to underpin peace in Ireland, we cannot
be struck by its abs- — cannot not be struck by its absence in other
parts of the world.   
   
And most especially, we think of the extraordinarily brave people of
Ukraine, who’ve endured more than a year of suffering at the hands of
Russian invaders.  And we stand with them for as long as it takes.  
   
Russia’s war is a threat to the international order on which we all
rely.  It’s an affront to human decency.  And we will work together to
hold its perpetrators to account.  
   
And again, I want to thank you for the leadership that the U.S. has
shown on this issue.  And thank you, Madam Vice President, on behalf of
Ireland and all of Europe, for your leadership on this most important
matter.   
   
*Go raibh míle maith agaibh.* Thank you again for the very warm welcome,
for your kind hospitality here.   
   
*La Fhéile Pádraig sona daoibh go leir*.  Happy St. Patrick’s Day to you
all.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  
   
                               END
