title: "Press Call By Vice President Harris on Reproductive\_Rights"
---
 
*Via Teleconference*

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining.  I’m
convening this call to talk about the latest attacks on reproductive
rights.  Needless to say, these attacks are extreme and they are
endangering the lives of women and people in our country.  And the
impact, frankly, goes far beyond reproductive healthcare.   
   
The President and\* I believe in the fundamental American value that all
people should exercise and have the freedom and liberty to make
fundamental decisions about their lives.  And that includes the freedom
for women to make decisions about their own healthcare and their bodies,
and not the government.   
   
Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, extremist so-called
leaders in states around the country have proposed and passed new
extreme laws to ban abortion and criminalized healthcare providers, or
have moved to enforce old laws on the book, many including no exception
even for rape or incest.   
   
Just last week, Florida Republican state legislators introduced a bill
to ban abortions after six weeks.  That is before many women even know
they’re pregnant.  There are 4 million women of reproductive age in
Florida, and the consequences would reach far beyond Florida because
think about the geography.   
   
Notably, more than three quarters of the women living under abortion
bans in the United States live in the South.  Currently, Florida has a
15-week abortion ban — meaning that, for many, Florida is their closest
option for care.  A six-week ban would function as a regional ban,
wiping out access to care in the South.   
   
This issue is about women’s autonomy, their freedom to decide whether
and when to have children.  These laws also endanger women’s health,
putting their lives in jeopardy.    
   
Last week, a group of five courageous women filed a lawsuit against the
state of Texas.  These women almost lost their lives when they were
denied healthcare because of the state’s abortion ban.    
   
I’m grateful to have met with one of the plaintiffs, Amanda, and many of
you may know her story.  She was pregnant, and her water broke
prematurely.  And she went to seek medical care and was repeatedly
denied treatment.  Only after she developed sepsis, which almost killed
her, did the hospital finally treat her.  Imagine.  These women are
fighting for basic right-to-life-saving healthcare.   
   
Even as women fight for their lives in the face of the Texas abortion
bans that currently exist, so-called leaders in Texas continue to try to
restrict access to reproductive healthcare.   
   
I also want to take a minute to discuss the bigger picture.  This goes
beyond reproductive healthcare, as I said earlier.  It — and in that,
these attacks jeopardize the ability of all Americans to make their own
healthcare decisions.   
   
Think — for example, there is currently — and this is what this is — an
unprecedented attack on medication, which the FDA approved 20 years
ago.  So, this is an attack on a medication which the FDA approved 20
years ago.  And they approved it based on science, peer review, and a
consensus within the medical professional community that it is safe and
effective.   
   
The FDA has approved thousands of medications over the last 85 years,
from chemotherapy drugs to asthma medicine to blood-pressure pills to
insulin.  So, think about this in that context.  Think about it in the
context of the fact that —  
   
Just looking — look — look inside your medicine cabinet.  Just picture
for a minute looking inside your own medicine cabinet.  For the average
American, they will find medicine that the FDA determined to be safe and
effective, that has helped them alleviate pain or improve their quality
of life or help them in some medically necessary way.   
   
But if extremists and politicians can override FDA approval and remove
one medication from the shelves — in this case, abortion medication —
one must ask: What medication is next?  
   
So, there is also some good news, which is that the majority of
Americans do not support these attacks on reproductive rights.  And that
is why, during the last election cycle, wherever this issue was on the
ballot, reproductive freedom won in both red states and blue states,
from Kentucky to California.   
   
And as I have traveled the country, I have seen firsthand the power of
state and local leaders fighting to defend reproductive rights.   
   
For example, in Michigan, Governor Whitmer and state and local leaders
have led the way to defend reproductive freedom in that state.  And last
November, Michigan was one of the states where voters protected
reproductive rights in their state constitution.   
   
In Wisconsin, where a law from 1849 remains on the books banning
abortion, Governor Evers has repeatedly called on the
Republican-controlled legislature to repeal it.  And on April 4th,
Wisconsin voters will cast ballots in an election for the State Supreme
Court, which will directly impact the fate of that state’s 174-year-old
ban.   
   
Finally, President Biden and I agree: This fight will be won only when
we secure reproductive rights for every person in every state.  Congress
must therefore pass a bill that defends freedom and liberty by putting
the protections of Roe v. Wade into federal law, and President Biden
will sign it.   
   
But I thank you all, and I’m happy to take your questions.   
   
Q    Yes, Vice President Harris, Alex Carr here from the theSkimm.  On
the topic of medication abortion, if a federal judge in Texas rules that
mifepristone should be restricted nationwide, how is the White House
prepared to respond immediately?  And what support will they lend to
abortion providers and people seeking abortions?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thanks, Alex.  So first, let’s just outline some of
the attacks on abortion medication.  For example, there is the lawsuit
in Texas, which was filed in November of last year.  And there,
anti-abortion activists challenged the FDA approval of mifepristone,
which as I said earlier, was granted 20 years ago.  The FDA approved it
20 years ago based on science.  And this could result — this lawsuit
could result in the medication becoming unavailable across the
country.   
   
Think about January of this year when 22 Republican AGs wrote to the FDA
urging the FDA to reverse its decision that mifepristone is safe to
dispense in telehealth or to be picked up with a prescription at a
retail pharmacy.   
   
And then last month, 20 Republican AGs wrote to CVS and Walgreens
threatening the companies with legal consequences if they sell
medication abortion by mail in their state.    
   
So, to level set: First of all, medication abortions account for a
majority of all abortions in the United States.  And mifepristone,
again, has been on the market for 20 years, has been deemed by the FDA
to be safe and effective.   
   
These attacks are not only an attack on a woman’s fundamental freedom to
make decisions about her own body, but really it’s — it really,
fundamentally is also an attack on the scientific process that is
crucial for public health.   
   
The FDA has approved thousands of other medications over the last 85
years.  So, think about what this means if extremists and politicians
can override an FDA approval and remove any medication that they deem to
be politically, for some reason, susceptible or deserving of attack —
that they could remove it from your medicine cabinet.  The implications
in terms of public health policy are profound.   
   
In terms of our administration, to your question: We’ve been focusing on
getting access to the — to medication abortion since day one.  And so,
when the Supreme Court, in the Dobbs decision, did what they did, the
President, in an executive order, directed Health and Human Services to
identify potential actions to protect and expand abortion care,
including medication abortion.  
   
The Attorney General has already made clear that states may not ban
mifepristone and that they can’t — as that basis of banning it because
they disagree with the FDA’s judgment.  Our administration will continue
to support legal access and do what we need to do to make sure that
women get accurate information about what is safe and what is legally
available to them.  
   
I, on that point, will say that I appreciate that we are doing this call
because a concern that I have and have had throughout these months has
been also the level of misinformation and disinformation that is out
there that I believe is designed and meant to confuse individuals and
healthcare providers and others about what the law is and what are the
rights that individuals and others have on this issue.    
   
So, thank you for that question.   
   
OPERATOR:  And if you wish to ask a question, please press one then
zero.   
    
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I’m going to venture to say you’re on mute —
(laughter) — whoever that is.  If you think you’re asking a question, I
can’t hear you.    
   
Q    Hi, thanks for doing this call.  I know you ment- — brought up
Michigan and I (inaudible) noted the ballot approval there.  I wondered
if, you know, there — where you think some of those states that did
approve, you know, changes to state law last fall — you know, kind of
where they go in the future?   
   
You know, in Michigan, there’s some questions about the ballot language
and about whether regulations are allowed, kind of, post-viability.  You
know, there’s still a parental consent law on the books there.  I was
just wondering if you had any thoughts about kind of what should come
next in some of those states.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’ll say, as a general matter — you know,
because each state has its own nuance, so I’ll just speak — speak to
your question as a general matter.  
   
One, there is still the challenge of getting correct information to
individuals, which is the point I just made in the last Q&A.  That’s
still critically important, because in a state like Michigan — and there
are others that have passed and into their law and into — or into their
constitution these protections — we’ve got to make sure that everyone
knows about it.   
   
Because, again, if you look at the map of the United States on this
issue, it’s like a — it’s a real quilt.  It’s like a patchwork, in terms
of each state having some different nuances that leaves people in
general with a bit of confusion about their rights.  So, there is
that.  
   
There is the work that also needs to happen to recognize that not each
state that has maintained protections for people to make decisions about
their own body — not each state is equal in terms of the resources they
have.  But they are, each one of them, usually in a neighborhood, often
in a neighborhood where surrounding states have restricted rights, and
so people are traveling to their state.   
   
And that presents, as you can imagine, a burden on the resources that
that state has — that the state has — the state that is receiving
folks.  So, that’s another issue of concern that I have heard be
expressed by states, but also a concern that we have, which is there are
certain states that can afford to perhaps put more resources into it,
and there are some states that cannot but are still keeping an open door
to the women who travel there seeking help.    
   
And then there is the issue of — of just what needs to continue to
happen in these states and all of the states, which is about encouraging
the coalition around the intersection between issues that are voting
rights issues, issues that are about protecting the rights and the
wellbeing of members of the LGBTQ+ community.  There is the work that we
need to do to build up the coalitions around what we’re seeing in
certain states, which is that where there is an attack on one of those
rights, there are attacks on the other rights.  And that’s part of the
conversation that I’ve been having as we travel around the country.   
   
Because, you know, I look at Michigan — to your point, they’re — the
leaders there, starting with the governor, are doing extraordinary
work.  And when you look at it, it also was in combination with another
important thing that needs to happen in all the states, which is to
encourage the younger leaders to own their — to give them the space to
be able to lead on this issue.  And — and we’ve seen that happen in
various places around the country.    
   
And I applaud Governor Whitmer and others for holding those leaders up —
the younger leaders up to allow them to also help frame and shape this
movement.    
   
And I guess that’s the final point I’ll make here for this question,
which is, this is a movement.  And I said that from the earliest days,
even after the leaked decision.  This is a movement.   
   
And we who are part of this movement stand on the shoulders of all those
folks of every gender who fought for and ultimately got Roe v. Wade. 
And we got to pick it up and understand that it’s not going to be
resolved overnight until Congress acts.   
   
And therefore, what’s happening in the states is going to have a direct
and huge impact on how people are experiencing this issue.  
   
Q    Yes.  Hi, Madam Vice President.  Thank you so much for this call. 
I am with the Black Information Network.  And I was just interested in
knowing from your perspective what — what are the implications of these
restrictions for African American women, especially considering the high
maternal mortality rate that Black women face?   
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  This is a very real issue.  You know, I said before
— I’ll say — I’ll say, again, you know, I would challenge the hypocrisy
of people who say they care about life and then ignore the maternal
mortality crisis.  Right?  And you know — everyone on this call knows —
we are looking at a case, in the United States of America, where Black
women are three times as likely to die in connection with childbirth. 
Native women are twice as likely to die.  Rural women, one and a half
times as likely.   
   
And when we dive into this issue, in particular when it relates to Black
and Native women, we know that one of the big factors there is racial
bias.  That when that woman walks into the hospital or the clinic, she
is just not taken as seriously.   
   
We know a related issue for all of the women affected by maternal
mortality is also poverty.  You know, look, poverty is
trauma-inducing.   
   
And so, when you think about the factors that contribute to those awful
outcomes, in terms of maternal mortality, that — the stressors have to
be taken into account, and we have to talk about that.    
   
And again, then you overlay that with — for example, what I’ve said
earlier about using the example of Florida in terms of what that
six-week ban would mean, in terms of that region of the country.  I
don’t have the stats in front of me, but I can tell you that it’s pretty
well discussed that when you look at, for example, maternal mortality
rates and how those coincide with states that have restricted
reproductive health rights, you will see that there is a huge parallel,
meaning that those states that are restricting reproductive access —
health access on this issue are also the states where you’re seeing
pretty high rates of maternal mortality.    
   
So, your point is — is a very important one, which is that we have to
understand the correlation and — and paint the full picture about what
these policies are and what they aren’t and the effect that they are
having across the board on reproductive health.  Which is the point,
isn’t it?  That’s why we’re talking about reproductive health.   
   
By the way, I will also add: Part of the work that we’ve been doing —
and I’ve been doing this work since I was in the Senate, as you know —
but I am very proud of our administration for really highlighting the
issue of maternal mortality.   
   
We’ve — we’ve elevated it to the stage of the White House, and part of
my focus has also been on what we need to do to train healthcare
providers.  And I’ll tell you that, in particular, some of the best
trainers on this issue will be doulas and — and what they know in terms
of also the associated issue on everything we have discussed this
afternoon, which is about the dignity and wellbeing of all people in our
country.
