*Emintsimadze Palace  
*Cape Coast, Ghana**

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you all for the warm
welcome.  Your Royal Highness.  Madam Minister.  
  
Well, the first thing I will say is I will now officially appoint a
liaison.  The Ambassador to Ghana, who is here with us — I have now
appointed you, Madam Ambassador, to be an official liaison to His
Highness and to this extraordinary group of global leaders, and then let
us figure out the next steps.  
      
But I do appreciate the points that you have made.  And there is an
unmistakable tie and bond.  And all relationships that are good
relationships are founded on trust and consistency and reciprocity.  And
so, I appreciate the points you have made, and we will follow up with
your request.  
      
How could I dy- — deny a request from my host?  (Laughs.)  I have been
raised properly, you know.  (Laughs.)  
      
But it is my honor, and with my husband and our delegation, to be here. 
And I appreciate the accommodations and the effort that you have made to
welcome us so warmly.  
  
I, too, believe that we must remember history for many reasons,
especially in the face of, at times, those who would attempt to deny
it.  And we must teach it, but teach it also with an understanding that
it should teach us not only about our past, but about our destiny and
our future, that we must learn from it in a way that we make the
ancestors proud and understand the broad shoulders upon which we stand. 
(Applause.)  
      
So, I thank you for the spirit with which you have welcomed me and my
husband and our delegation.  I request your — your ability for me to see
the lands that you oversee and to visit the — the place that you have
not mentioned but the place I will go next.   
      
And — and I must say that there is so much that you, Minister, and Your
Highness have mentioned about Ghana and, by extension, the continent
that gives me an incredible sense of optimism.   
      
And the work that you have done here, in terms of prioritizing and
having such success with education, is something that in my own country
of the United States and around the globe we know must be a greater
priority for all of us.  And that includes using that education as a way
to help people around the globe understand the connections and the
interconnections and the interdependence, by extension.  
      
So, I am honored to be here and to be with you.  And I look forward, as
you greeted me, to saying this will not be the last time we meet or
speak.  And I, again, thank you for the warm welcome.  And to everyone,
thank you for the welcome.  (Applause.)
