*Paramus, New Jersey**

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Please have a seat.  Good afternoon,
everyone.   
   
Inez, thank you for that introduction.  That means a lot.  It really
does.   
   
And, you know, my mother had many sayings, and one of them is — she
would say to me, “Kamala, you may be the first to do many things.  Make
sure you’re not the last.”  And so much of that spirit is captured in
your introduction of me, and I thank you for that.   
   
And to the family, the Tallaj family, for all you do.  My goodness, I —
everyone here knows this family, and they are a family who live a life
of service to community, to country; a life of service to optimism
around what is possible.   
   
You know, I often say that I think that is the spirit behind the
strength of our country and, for so many of us, our families: the
ability to see what can be, unburdened by what has been, and then to
pursue and achieve that.   
   
So, I’m very honored to be with you today.  Thank you for welcoming us
into your beautiful home and for all you do.   
   
Henry Muñoz, he has been — so, the vice chair of the DNC — this is a
very important position.  The title says it all.  But as we all know, we
can all have titles.  The reality is that — the question is: What do you
then do with the title?  
   
And he is relentless.  You travel all over our country.  He was just
with my husband yesterday in Texas, hosting — you’re seeing my husband
more than I do, by the way, these days.  (Laughter.)  
   
But I’ve seen you for years do what you do.  And you really never
stopped believing in what we must do as an expression of our love of our
country and our belief in the future of our country.  So, can we please
also applaud Henry Muñoz?  (Applause.)  
   
So, to everyone here, it is good to see you.  And I thank you.  I have a
sense of who is here.  I’ve read many of the biographies of who is
here.  And — and I briefly had a chance to meet each of you.  And what
an extraordinary group of leaders.   
   
So, to take your time to have this conversation this afternoon means a
lot because there are a lot of things that you could be doing with this
moment, given the communities that you serve and the work that you
do.   
   
So, I’ll get right to it.  I love our country.  I believe in it.  I
believe in all of the foundational principles that led us into being.  I
believe in the importance of freedom and liberty and equality and
justice.  I do believe, in fact, that one of the greatest expressions of
love for our country is to fight for us to fully realize the ideals of
our country.   
   
And I know the work that everyone does here is the work in pursuit of
just that.  This is a room predominantly of physicians, healthcare
providers, people who have dedicated your lives and have taken an oath
to do one thing: to uplift the condition of human life, to alleviate
suffering, to recognize the dignity in all people and our role in
preserving and guaranteeing that dignity.  What a noble pursuit.   
   
And so, I think about this moment in time in the context of all of us
being in these positions at this particular and unique moment in time. 
And then, what becomes our duty?  And what will history say?  And what
would our children say about what we did at this moment, as we occupied
these positions of leadership?  
   
I travel the world as Vice President.  I have now met with over 100
world leaders — presidents, prime ministers, chancellors, and kings. 
And I talk, as you can imagine, about many things, including the
importance of democracy, the importance of upholding international rules
and norms.   
   
And I also talk about the fact that we, in many ways, are living in
unsettled times, where we see a war in Europe, in terms of Ukraine;
where we see, most recently, the highest court in our land, the United
States Supreme Court, which just took a constitutional right that had
been recognized from the people of America, from the women of America;
where we see attacks on voting rights in our own backyards.  Issues that
we thought were well settled.  
   
Not to mention what the pandemic meant.  What it meant in terms of the
extraordinary loss of life, loss of normalcy.  People lost their jobs. 
And what all of these, in combination, have meant to where we are today
not only as a nation, but globally.   
   
And that brings me to you.  Because one of the things I know about the
leaders in this room is that you have been tireless in being motivated
by a sense of optimism, about the power of an individual, in connection
with their community, to actually uplift people and bring stability and
bring a sense of continuum when so many external forces suggest that
maybe we can’t take anything for granted.   
   
I know the work of the people in this room, and I can’t thank you enough
for what you did during the height of an unforeseeable crisis during the
pandemic to bring stability and to bring help to so many people who
needed it.   
   
The President and I came into office in an election in 2020 that was
during the height of the pandemic.  And I will tell you, I’m so happy to
be here now, because in the first year — mostly in the first year — of
our administration, we couldn’t travel because it was during the height
of the pandemic.  And we held countless meetings, talking with doctors,
talking with healthcare providers about what do you need, because you
are on the ground.  What do you need so that we, in collaboration, can
focus on the health and the wellbeing of our nation?  
   
And I know what you all were dealing with: an uncertainty in the first
days about what did this pandemic mean, what was the nature of it, and
then trying to convince the communities that you serve that they could
trust a healthcare system and, by extension, their government and their
country to see them and give them what they need.  
   
And it was the conversations that our administration — the President and
I, and so many of us — I know that Xavier Becerra has been here and will
continue to travel the country — the conversations that we all had that
resulted in a lot of the work that we were able to achieve together,
both in terms of convincing and reminding communities they could trust
that the vaccine would work; both in terms of what we needed to do to
listen to how there’s a direct connection between healthcare and dignity
and the wellbeing of communities and the empowerment of people.   
   
It was because of the conversations that we had with so many in this
room that we knew that too many of our con- — our citizens and our — and
our neighbors and our family members are suffering from diabetes.  We
knew Latinos are 70 percent more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes,
African Americans 60 percent more likely.  I mean, anyone in here, raise
your hand if you have a family member who has diabetes.   
   
And having these conversations, we also knew that, in particular, we had
so many seniors all over the country who were making a decision to
either pay rent or buy food or be able to pay for their insulin, which
you prescribe because you know it will save their life.   
   
And because of the conversations we had, a lot of them born out of the
first days of our administration, we said we’ve got to deal with this,
because it’s about the dignity and wellbeing of people.   
   
And it is because of the work that we did together that we now have
capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors in America.  This
is a gamechanger.   
   
But because of the collaboration, because of the kind of work that so
many of you here do as professionals who are grounded in the community,
being a voice for people who often feel left out or overlooked, we were
able to give voice to this important issue.   
   
And because we did collectively — because elections matter, coordination
matters — we were able to do that as an administration.   
   
And then you all know what came next.  Eli Lilly said they’re going to
bring down and cap the cost of insulin not only for seniors, but for
everyone who needs it.   
   
This is an example of why I remain so optimistic about our ability to
see what is possible and then fight to get there, and to understand the
interconnection between the work of people in this room and the work
that happens through elected offices that can — when they see and
understand the people, can do good work that has a direct impact and
makes a difference in terms of uplifting the strength and wellbeing of
community.   
   
The work that we have done as an administration in these last two years
included recognizing that so many of our communities — in particular
Black, brown, poor, and rural communities — didn’t have access to
high-speed Internet, highlighted during the epidemic of the pandemic. 
Highlighted — unsettled times.   
   
How about the fact that, you know, one thing that we, as parents, always
thought: We could send those kids to school.  And all of a sudden, “Oh,
boy, we got to figure out how to…”  We got to figure out how to honor
our teachers better — (laughs) — when we realized we had to figure out
how to teach our kids and go back to fifth-grade math.   
   
And when we figured out and then were reminded: Lots of our communities
didn’t have access to high-speed Internet.  And what history, in a short
while, is going to tell us about the significance of those lost days in
the educational process of so many of the children in our country.   
   
So, the pandemic highlighted an issue that has long been an issue, which
is the need to make sure all people in our country have access to
high-speed Internet as an extension of a right — like we think of that
we electrified the country, that everyone should have access to
high-speed Internet if they are not only to survive, but to thrive.  
   
Because of an election and because people got out to vote, and we said
we would be committed to this, we now, through the infrastructure law
that we were able to pass in a bipartisan way, are on track to ensure
that every family and person in our country has access and can afford
high-speed Internet.   
   
What does that mean?  (Applause.)  It means access to education for our
children.  It means telemedicine.  In so many ways, the pandemic was an
accelerator, right?  It just — it accelerated, it made faster what we
knew we needed to do in terms of access for people, including access to
healthcare and thinking about how telemedicine will allow that to
happen.   
   
I don’t need to tell so many in this room where you might have tried to
get the community that you treat and your patients to say, “It’s as
good.”  In many cases, “Eh, I don’t want to do that.  I like coming into
the office.”  But because they had to.   
   
But here’s what the pandemic highlighted then: For our seniors who did
not have access or could not afford access to high-speed Internet,
they’d have to go to the local public library and sit in the corner of a
public library and try to have a private conversation with their
healthcare provider.  Where’s the dignity in that?  So, by making sure
everyone has access to high-speed Internet because we decided we have to
get this done with a sense of urgency, we are now on the road that that
doesn’t have to happen.   
   
Telemedicine — connected to the need to get everyone access to
high-speed Internet, connected to a national conversation that we need
to have in a much more forceful way, which is the need to address mental
health in our country.  (Applause.)  
   
So, let’s connect the dots.  We came in and said we’re going to get this
broadband issue done.  We have gone through a pandemic.  We have shown
telemedicine can work.  And we have now a heightened need for mental
healthcare in our country.   
   
I always say, when I’m talking to a group that are not all of the
educated physicians who are here — I say, “You know, the problem with
the way we’ve been dealing with this as a country is we act as though
healthcare starts from the neck down.  What about healthcare from the
neck up?  Mental health.”  
   
But here’s the thing we also know: So many of us — culturally, many of
the people in many communities, it’s a stigma.  “I’m fine.  I don’t need
it.  I’m fine.”   
   
So, what does that mean into — in connection with — what does that mean
in connection with high-speed Internet?  Well, think about this. 
Instead of them being seen by their neighbors going into the community
mental health clinic — worried about “Who’s going to see me if I walk in
there, because only crazy people go there,” I say in quotes — now people
can get mental healthcare through telemedicine.   
   
Think about what a gamechanger this is going to mean.  And in the
privacy of their own home, where the — the professional giving them that
care could also live across the country, so they don’t have to worry
about running into them in church on Sunday.  These are going to be
gamechangers.   
   
Think about the work that we did because we were elected and people said
around our country, “You need to deal with the issue of lead pipes.” 
Because in places around our country, there are children — in fact, over
— over half of children in America under the age of six are exposed to
lead poisoning.   
   
Let’s put this in perspective, again, about the work that so many here
do in terms of thinking about your work in the context of equity.  Lead
pipes.  Well, lead pipes were everywhere in our country.  It wasn’t
exclusive to poor communities, communities of color, rural communities. 
Happen everywhere.   
   
But if you’re living in a community that has a high rate of
homeownership, you might have some equity in the house.  You find out
there’s lead in those pipes?  You take some equity out, you change the
pipes.   
   
But they’re all — the majority people who are living paycheck to
paycheck and barely can afford a $400 unexpected expense.  What does
that mean for them?  Doesn’t this raise an issue of equity?  Because
isn’t this, after all, a public health issue?  Isn’t this, after all, an
issue we should all be concerned about?  Because not only is it a public
health issue, meaning the health consequences of drinking water from
lead pipes — that toxic water, it also is a public education issue.   
   
Why do you say that?  I’ll tell you why.  You all know it has been well
established that it results also in — the effects of that lead poisoning
have an impact on learning ability.  But what we have done is now passed
legislation where, within the next nine years, we’re going to get rid of
all lead pipes in America.   
   
And the point of the policy there and the perspective was: It’s a public
health issue.  It’s a public education issue.  And therefore, we should
not require an individual to be able to afford to remove those pipes. 
That is a responsibility and an appropriate responsibility for
government charged with public health and public education.  And that’s
the perspective we took.  And that’s why we are doing this work.   
   
Back to the point that elections matter, especially in terms of how we
think about what is in the best interests of the public health and the
public wellbeing.  So these are just some examples of what we have been
able to accomplish in the last two years.   
   
Not to mention the jobs that are going to be created because of all of
the work that needs to be done.  A lot of them union jobs, a lot of them
jobs that are going to require the apprenticeship programs of the IBEW
and all of these folks.  The work that is going to be about building
back up communities.   
   
So, I am here to thank you for your leadership and collaboration, seeing
the connections between the work that each of us does in a way that, in
collaboration, benefits so many people that none of us will ever meet,
people who will never know our names but will be forever impacted
because of a perspective that says: We must focus on communities.  We
must focus on the needs of families.  That we must see people in their
full relief and think about how we can uplift their condition, which
will (inaudible) to the benefit of all of us.   
   
So I thank you all for your support of this event this afternoon.  There
was good work that has been happening.  There is more work to be done. 
And we’re all in it together.   
   
And I thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)
