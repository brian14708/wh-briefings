Q    Mr. President, come talk to us about guns.  
   
Q    Mr. President, have you spoken to any of the families of those who
lost loved ones in Nashville?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, I’m working on that now.  
   
Q    Have you spoken to the police chief, sir?  Can you tell us about
those conversations?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I spoke to the police chief.  I spoke to the two
officers that went in and saved the lives.  I’ve spoken to everyone but
the families, and I haven’t done that yet.  
   
Q    Can we ask about Israel?  How concerned are you about the health of
democracy there in Israel?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Like many strong supporters of Israel, I’m very
concerned.  And I’m concerned that they get this straight.  They cannot
continue down this road.  
   
And I’ve sort of made that clear.  I — hopeful — hopefully, the prime
minister will act in a way that he is going to try to work out some
genuine compromise.  But that remains to be seen.  
   
Q    Are you inviting Prime Minister Netanyahu to the White House, sir? 
Do you believe he’ll be coming to Washington?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Not — not in the near term.  
   
Q    Did you speak to him on the phone?  Did you speak to him on the
phone in the middle of all this?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, I — I did not.  I delivered a message through our
ambassador.  
   
Q    Will you meet with Speaker McCarthy on the bu- — will you speak —
meet with Speaker McCarthy if he doesn’t put a budget out?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t know what we’re going to meet on.  But I’m —  
   
Q    He outlined some points today.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  The deal was we each put down our budget.  
   
Q    On the banking crisis, are you — what is your thought about how
much you can get accomplished in terms of regulatory reform in
Congress?  And how much can you do executively through power?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think we’ve done what we need to do
executively.  I feel confident things are settling out.  The — the
markets seem to be responding.  And so —  
   
But I’m not sure whether we get much legislative change.  But we’re
looking at that as well.  
   
Q    Northern Ireland — a question on Northern Ireland.  Northern
Ireland has increased its terrorism threat level to “severe.”  How
concerned are you about that?  And will it impact your plans to visit?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, they can’t keep me out.   
   
Q    You mentioned in Canada last week that you were concerned about a
further deterioration, indicating what would happen with diaspora
throughout the hemisphere.  What is your specific concern?  What are you
afraid is going to happen?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Loss of life among people who are being negatively
impacted by the gangs, number one.  
   
Number two, people get hurt in mass migrations.  And I worry about that
as well.   
   
Q    Mr. President, can you tell us anything more about your
conversation with Senator Hagerty, when it comes to any action
potentially on gun violence prevention legislation?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  There’s nothing really to tell.  I expressed my concern
and asked if there was anything I could do to be of help.   
   
And I understand from — from some folks he’s a fairly reasonable guy,
and I hope something comes of it.  
   
Q    On banking then — just to go back to banking, you don’t anticipate
doing anything more, sort of, unilaterally from the executive side of
things?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, it’s not over yet.  We’re watching it very closely. 
I think my team has handled it very well so far.  And rather than get
ahead of myself here, I think let’s let things move the way they are.   
   
Q    On the gun — on the gun issue, Mr. President, you’ve continued to
call for an assault weapon ban.  It’s — it’s —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  It’s called exposure.  Exposure.   
   
You know, when people say, “Why do you keep doing it?  It’s not going to
happen.”  Expose those people who refuse to do something.  So, I’m going
to keep calling it out, remind people that they’re not acting.  They
should act.   
   
I mean, think about this.  I mean, you know, people are beginning to see
— they have on television now these emergency room doctors showing what
happens when a bullet enters a body when it’s from a revolver or from
another gun.  It goes in a straight line and goes out.   
   
But what happens now with that assault weapon — with a AR-15 — it goes
in the body and it explodes in the body, and it goes in at a
significantly higher speed.   
   
So, in every way, it’s just — I mean, as I said when I got the first
bill passed, I confronted some hunters and fishermen in Delaware when I
was walking through the areas in southern Delaware, pushing this.  And I
said, “How many deer are wearing a Kevlar vest, you know?”  
   
I mean, really — I mean, just think about it.  You can’t own a machine
gun.  Well, the idea you can’t lock this up?  Give me a break.  You
can’t own a bazooka.  You can’t —  
   
I mean, it just — I mean, there’s nothing absolute about any amendment. 
And this is ridiculous.   
   
And it’s all about money — big, big, big money.  
   
Q    Are you planning to visit Nashville, sir, in the aftermath of this
tragedy?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, that’s underway now.  We’re trying to figure that
out — is what helps the most.  
   
Q    And are you planning to visit Mississippi, sir, in the — for the
tornado aftermath?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  
   
Q    Yes?  
   
Q    On the banking thing, does it — does it change your thinking about
who needs to go into that vice chair job at the Fed?  
   
You know, Sarah Bloom Raskin and Saule Omarova had to withdraw their
nominations.  They were tough on regulation.  Is this job even more
important — the vice chair nomination — now?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, it’s been important from the beginning.  That’s
why I appointed them — or tried to appoint them.  
   
Q    But for the vice chair — for the Fed — to replace —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  We’re talking about it.  No, I know.  
   
And — but that’s underway right now.   
   
Guys, we got to get going.   
   
Q    On Israel, just one follow.  On those who say that America
shouldn’t be involved in domestic politics and shouldn’t be interfering,
how do you respond to that with —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  We don’t want to interfere.  It’s a little bit like if
all the things — things are exploding in America.  
   
What do you think would happen if, all of a sudden — well, I know — I’m
not going to even speculate.  
   
Anyway, we’re not interfering.  They know my position.  They know
America’s position.  They know the American Jewish position, the Amer- —
anyway.  
   
Q    Do you believe that Prime Minister Netanyahu is going to go ahead
with the judicial overhaul?  
   
AIDE:  Thank you.  
   
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.
