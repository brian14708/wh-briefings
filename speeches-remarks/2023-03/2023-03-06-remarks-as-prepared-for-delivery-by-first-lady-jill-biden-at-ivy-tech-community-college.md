  \ College"

Thank you, Lane, for that introduction and for sharing your story with
us.  
   
Mayor Murphy, Congressman Mrvan, and Jane, your commitment to programs
like this one is so important, and we’re grateful for your leadership.  
   
Good afternoon, it’s great to be back at Ivy Tech. I know it’s exam
week, so I’m grateful that so many of you have chosen to spend your
study break time here! Thank you to Dr. Ellspermann and all of you for
welcoming us today.   
   
Two years ago, my husband, President Biden, made a promise to rebuild
the middle class. And you know what does exactly that? Community
colleges. As Joe has said, they provide the “best career training in
America.”  
   
Community colleges are flexible and meet students where they are. And
they offer programs tailored to the communities that they serve. A high
school education just isn’t enough for so many of the jobs of the
21<sup>st</sup> century. But there are great careers out there that can
be found with associate degrees, certificates, or other job
training—paths that don’t require four years of college.    
   
Today, I had the opportunity to see the Flex Lab where students are
training for careers in clean energy. They are building solar power
systems and being trained to operate wind turbines. They’re learning to
wire homes and fix downed power lines. This program is giving them good
paying jobs and protecting the planet for the next generation.  
   
I also met Sandy, the first woman to graduate with her Technical
Certificate in Electric Line Technology. She enrolled at the college at
age 45 and, thanks to the certification she received here, she’s been
working at NIPSCO for 12 years.  
   
Sandy, it’s amazing to see you forging this incredible career for
yourself. You’re what this is all about—and why we’re here today.  
   
Dual enrollment courses, Registered Apprenticeships, community colleges
partnering with businesses to train workers in growing industries. These
aren’t Democrat or Republican ideas. They’re American ideas championed
by leaders from both parties. And for many years, they’ve helped
students from all communities—red and blue, rural and urban, and
everywhere in between—get the training they need for the jobs of the
future.  
   
And now, we have something else to add to the equation: millions of jobs
in infrastructure, clean energy, and manufacturing that are being
created by my husband Joe and his Administration. Jobs just waiting to
be filled by students like you—if we can build the pathways you need.   
   
Your President, and the leaders of the Departments of Labor and Energy,
understand that. It’s my honor to be joined by Deputy Secretary of
Energy Dave Turk—who has been a partner and friend to Joe since his time
in the Senate. And of course, our next Secretary of Labor, Julie Su.
Julie is going to have the chance to use her decades of experience to
help so many others find the American dream for themselves. Thank you
both for joining me today.  
   
Career-connected learning that starts in high school, provides access to
two years of community college, and connects to great jobs is the future
of our workforce. It’s how we grow our economy from the bottom up and
the middle out. And Joe is bringing together his entire Administration
to make that future a reality.  
   
Across the country, we’re seeing programs like this one bridge the gap
between what students learn and the careers they will find. And we need
more communities to follow Ivy Tech’s lead. Because when they do, all
students, no matter their background, will have the chance to follow
their passions and find a pathway to a great job.  
   
And together, we’ll be able to fundamentally transform what it means to
make a living and make a life here in America.  
   
Thank you.
