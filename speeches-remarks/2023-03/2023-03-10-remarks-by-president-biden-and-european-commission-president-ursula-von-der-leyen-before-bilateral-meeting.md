Oval Office

2:12 P.M. EST  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Okay.  Well, Madam President, welcome back to the
White House.  Welcome back to the Oval Office.  And it’s — it’s always
good to see you.  You’ve been doing an incredible job.

Two years ago, we committed to a new era of understanding between the EU
and the U.S.  I told you then that times have changed from the previous
administration and that we view the EU as a great addition to security
and economic security.  And I thought we could benefit all our peoples,
and I think we have.  I think we have.

And we stood with the brave people of Ukraine, providing security
assistance and implementing historic sanctions that cut off Putin’s
ability to fund and to fight his war in Ukraine and to make it harder
for him.

We supported Europe’s energy security.  I remember you and I talking
about launching the joint task force and whether or not we’d be able to
provide enough liquefied natural gas.  We supplied twice as much as we
thought —

PRESIDENT VON DER LEYEN:  Indeed.

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  — we could.  It worked.  It worked.

PRESIDENT VON DER LEYEN:  This is really good.

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  It worked.   
   
And at the same time, we’re driving new investments to create clean
energy industries and jobs, and make sure we have supply chains
available to both our countr- — our continents.  And the idea — under
that idea is it underpins our — our Inflation Reduction Act, and it lies
at the heart of the — your Green Deal Industrial Plan in the EU.  So,
hopefully, we can talk a little bit about that today.

And finally, I want to thank you for your leadership on the Windsor
Framework, which has protected the hard-earned peace that existed on the
Good Friday — proceeds from the Good Friday Agreement, which I think has
probably surprised a lot of Europeans how strongly so many Americans
feel about that negotiated agreement.

And, Madam President, the steps the U.S. and the EU are taking over the
last few years has increased energy security, its — our economic
security, and, I would argue, our national security.

So, today, I look forward to talking about all that with you and
anything you’d like to talk about.  
PRESIDENT VON DER LEYEN:  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  It’s a
pleasure to be here and an honor to be back again.  And it’s good to
come back here because we are not only partners; the European Union and
the United States are good friends.  And this could be felt throughout
the whole work that we’re doing together.

Indeed, you helped us enormously when we wanted to get rid of the
Russian fossil fuel dependency by — you helped us enormously by
delivering more LNG, helped us through the energy crisis.

We are, as partners, strongly supporting together Ukraine, that fight
for freedom and independence.  We’re making Russia pay for its atrocious
war.  We’re strongly aligned in defending our values.

And indeed, today, I think we will also discuss the Inflation Reduction
Act, and I think it’s great that there is such a massive investment in
wind and clean technologies now. Indeed, we want to match it with the
Green Deal Industrial Plan.

So, plenty of topics — topics to discuss together.  Thank you very much,
again.

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  I look forward to doing that.

PRESIDENT VON DER LEYEN:  Thank you.

PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you.  Thank you.
