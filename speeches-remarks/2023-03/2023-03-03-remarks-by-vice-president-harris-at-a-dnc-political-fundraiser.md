title: Remarks by Vice President Harris at a DNC Political Fundraiser

*Ryan Tract Neighborhood Private Residence  
*Hillsborough, California**

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Hi, everyone.  Hi, everyone.  Have a seat.  Have a
seat.  Happy afternoon, everyone.   
   
Where is Eleni, the lieutenant governor?  And happy birthday.  Happy
birthday.  And she is also officially the governor today in the absence
of the governor.  So happy birthday, Madam Governor.  (Laughter.)   
   
And it is good to see everyone.  Stefanie, where is she?  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Right here.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And John, thank you so much — Gia and James also —
for hosting us yet again.  Yes, four years ago.  It feels like almost
yesterday, but we are all here.  I remember it was pouring rain and —  
   
And we have all, so many of us — I look around this room — been on this
journey together for such a long time.  And I could literally go around
each table and talk about you.   
   
From the first days that I ran for District Attorney of San Francisco,
when the room was very small.  It grew over the years; it kept growing. 
But you always remember who was in the small room at the beginning.  So,
thank you all so very much for the love and the support.   
   
And, Chris Korge, thank you for the work that you are doing.  I see
Chris everywhere.  I know you live in Florida, but, honestly, I see you
all over our country.  You have been doing such incredible work
reminding the people in our country about why we have so much at stake
and also why we should celebrate the work that has been accomplished
because of what we stand for.  So thank you, Chris, for everything you
do.  You make it look effortless, and I know it is not.  Can we please
acknowledge his leadership?  (Applause.)  Thank you.  
   
And to my husband, thank you for everything.  (Laughter.)  
   
So, it is so good to be home.  I — we just flew in, and it was — it was
great.  We had a group of folks who showed up at the airport as we
landed on the tarmac, on Air Force Two.  And in just driving — just
flying in over the bay — you know, it’s always nice to go home.  It just
— there’s a physical reaction that you just have even though you don’t
realize it’s just going to descend upon you.  And so, it is good to see
all of you.  It is good to be home.   
   
And the people in this room really do understand what is at stake every
year, including this year and next year, when we think about the future
of our country.  So thank you all.   
   
So, you know, the way I think about it is this: The work that you each
did in 2020 was the work of standing up for all that is important when
we talk about the significance and the strength of democracy.  There was
so much about the incredible hard work that happened in 2020 to elect
Joe Biden President and me Vice President that was about a fundamental
faith in the significance of a democracy and democratic principles.   
   
And so, the work that you all did then has produced, over the last two
years, incredible yield, in terms of the benefit to the people of our
country and, dare I say, people around the world.  So I do want to start
my comments by thanking you for what you did then.   
   
Because on the basis of that hard work and the success that came from
it, over the last two years, we have done transformational work —
transformational work.  And in that way, we’ve got great momentum.   
   
So let’s reflect on the work that happened.  Let’s think about it in the
context of what we said the American people deserve and need, in terms
of issues that relate to a democracy.   
   
Stefanie, you talked about that Doug was in Europe.  I just came back
from the Munich Security Conference.  I was there speaking on the stage
at the Munich Security Conference.  It was my second speech; the first
one a year ago, five days before Russia’s unprovoked invasion of
Ukraine.   
   
And this trip was to solidify all the work we did over the past two
years, with a heavy emphasis on the last year, to restate and reaffirm
America’s leadership around the strength of the Alliance in NATO, but
also America’s leadership to stand up for fundamental principles that
are about international norms and rules, such as sovereignty and
territorial integrity.   
   
This administration uniquely did that in a way it would not have
happened before.  We brought the Allies together.  Think about it.  For
those of us who remember and think about these things, in the last, you
know, four years, people were openly questioning the validity and the
reason for being of NATO.  They were questioning the meaning of its very
existence.   
  
And because of the work we did — because of who Joe Biden is, who our
administration is — we brought the Allies together, to stand firm and
solid in the face of this unprovoked aggression.  So much so that we are
now — (applause) — we have now not only reinforced the significance of
the Alliance, we are on the verge of welcoming Finland and Sweden. 
(Applause.)  Those two leaders who I met with when I was in Munich.  
  
Think about where we are.  Think about where we are in terms of the
momentum that we have built up in our own country around, again,
fundamental issues like what it means to have leadership that recognizes
the need to invest in a nation, not only for the needs of today but the
needs of our future.  
  
We were able to help get passed what we call a Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law that is investing billions of dollars in upgrading America’s
infrastructure.  Yes, roads and bridges.  But also, for example, making
sure that everyone in our country finally has access to high-speed
Internet.  
  
Why is that a big deal?  Well, the pandemic made clear if you’re a
parent why that’s a big deal, in terms of the need for your children to
have access to high-speed Internet, because that might be the only way
they can receive an education.  
  
The pandemic made clear why everyone, regardless of where they live,
should have access to high-speed Internet, because if you’re a senior
and you live in a rural community and you can’t get your — to your
doctor, you can benefit from telemedicine.  But why should you have to
go to the public library and sit in the corner of a public library to
talk with your doctor instead of having access to high-speed Internet in
your home so you can do that in the privacy of your home?  
  
The work we’ve done that has been about finally removing lead in pipes. 
That is no small issue.   
  
I have been spending a lot of time around our country.  And you would be
shocked at the number of places that still are battling with that, where
the grandparents — the grandmothers and grandfathers in those
communities have been fighting for years, saying, “This is toxic water. 
It is having an impact on the health of our children and their capacity
to learn.”  And nothing was done.  
  
And because of what you all did in 2020 and us now being in office,
taking these things seriously, we are going to remove all of these pipes
over the course of the next, probably, eight, nine years.  
  
What we have done on the issue of the climate crisis.  This Bay Area, I
proudly say — sometimes with a bit of bravado — is the, if not a,
birthplace of the movement around recognizing the significance of
protecting this beautiful Earth upon which we live.  
  
We have collectively, between the infrastructure law and the Inflation
Reduction Act — I’ve done a little math on this — we’re probably looking
at about a trillion dollars of investment over the next 10 years to
address the climate crisis around adaptation and resiliency and — and
this is transformational — jumpstarting a new economy, a clean-energy
economy for the benefit not only of the people of our country but the
world.  
  
When I was at Munich, after I gave that speech, I took some questions. 
And one of them was to address and then explain the impact of this
investment globally.   
  
Well, think about it.  Over a trillion dollars, which means then it’s
going to spur private investment, so it will be exponentially more,
which means an investment, for example, in clean energy — increasing the
supply of clean energy, not only for our country but around the globe. 
That’s going to bring prices down.  
  
It’s going to be about an investment in innovation and technology.  
      
We do that very well here in the Bay Area.  We understand what that
means.  Because when we put the investment in these creative approaches,
everyone benefits.  
  
This work is transformational.  
  
Think about what we did in saying “Cap insulin at $35 a month.”  Whereas
before, our seniors were literally looking at bankruptcy, whether they
pay rent or pay for food or afford what a doctor prescribed in the
interest of the quality of their life.  And it is now capped at $35 a
month.   
  
And if everyone had noticed, this week, the pharmaceutical industry is
bringing down the cost for everyone — (applause) — because it just took
that kind of nudge — (laughter) — to make clear this should be done and
it can be done for the benefit of everyone.   
   
Think about what we have done in terms of making clear that small
businesses are part of the heartbeat of our economy.  And it’s something
I’ve been working on in a very substantial way.   
   
I love small businesses.  Let me just pause to say that.  I mean, small
— and which there are many here.  (Laughter.)  This is — you know, and
our community is a community of families who — intergenerational small
businesses.  Right?   
   
And so, I don’t need to tell anybody here: Our small-business leaders
are not only business leaders, they are civic leaders.  They are
community leaders.  They are part of the fabric of a community.  They
are the ones who will mentor.  They are the ones who will hire locally. 
They are the ones who will train.  
   
We have grown more small businesses in the last two years than any
two-year period in the history of our country.  Because the work we have
been doing has been not only about looking out for small businesses
during the height of the pandemic, but, actually, when I was in the
Senate, I was responsible, with a couple of my colleagues, for getting
12 billion extra dollars into the community bank — CDFIs — to support
and encourage not only small businesses to open, but to grow.   
   
And we are now getting private investment into those community banks as
well.  And as a result, we are seeing a burgeoning growth of small
business in communities around our country.   
   
And small businesses, by the way, employ half of America’s workforce. 
These are just some of the examples of what we have been doing.   
   
And we have been true to all that we care about, talking about and
standing up for American values.  American values. Like the importance
of a foundational principle: the freedom and the right of all people to
make decisions about their own bodies.   
   
In the face of a Supreme Court that took a fundamental right, a
constitutional right from the people of America, from the women of
America.  And we have been standing firm, talking about and owning and
walking the talk about what it means to fight for foundational
principles that are a reflection of what we call American values, such
as freedom and liberty.  This is the work we’re doing.   
   
The work we are doing is to talk about the importance of being
reasonable — rejecting the idea that you need to push for something that
ends with an exclamation point, when the American people just want
practical solutions to the challenges we face.  
   
We passed the first meaningful piece of smart gun safety legislation in
30 years to address — (applause).  But there’s still more work to be
done.   
   
And as we have said, as Joe Biden has said as one of the original
authors of the assault weapons ban, we still got to get that renewed and
see that through.   
   
And so, that brings me to, then, the point about why we again come
together: because we know that our work is not done.  We have much more
to do.   
   
But we’ve got great momentum.  We’ve got some really good material to
talk about why elections matter and why it is important to stand up for
foundational values in a way that we know is not only a reflection of
who we are but also is the way that we actually strengthen our nation
for the benefit of the world.   
   
Because — I’ll end my comments with this — I have by now met with over
100 world leaders — prime ministers, presidents, chancellors, and
kings.  They have come to our house — our temporary public housing in
Washington, D.C.  (Laughter.)  I met with them in our travels around the
world.   
   
When we walk in those rooms, representing the United States of America,
we walk in those rooms chin up, shoulders back.  And when we walk in
those rooms — I don’t need to tell anybody here — we have interactions
with people who are watching everything we do to see: Is America still a
leader not only in terms of economic strength and security, but as a
democracy?   
   
And the work we have done over the last two years, has reaffirmed who we
are as a country, especially when the preceding four years created
doubt.   
   
And so, we must continue this work for the benefit of the people of our
country but as an example, also, for the benefit of people around the
world.   
   
And so, that brings me to my last point: That is the impact that each of
you has had.  You have had an impact on people that you will never meet,
who will never know your name.  But the work that we do supporting these
approaches and these standards and these principles is critical to who
we are and to our future.   
   
So, with that, I thank everyone for all that you have done.  Thank you. 
(Applause.)
