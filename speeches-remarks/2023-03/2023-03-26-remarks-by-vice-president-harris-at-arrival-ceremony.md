*Kotoka International Airport  
*Accra, Ghana**

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.   
   
AUDIENCE:  Good afternoon!  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Thank you for the warm welcome,
all our young leaders — all the leaders.  Thank you for this warm
welcome on behalf of my husband, the Second Gentleman of the United
States — and, of course, we bring you greetings from the President of
the United States, Joe Biden, and the First Lady, Jill Biden.  
   
What an honor it is to be here in Ghana and on the continent of Africa. 
Today begins a weeklong journey, first here in Ghana, then on to
Tanzania, and then Zambia.  
   
On behalf of the President and our entire nation, we bring you
greetings, and we are looking forward to this trip as a further
statement of the long and enduring and very important relationship and
friendship between the people of the United States and those who live on
the continent of Africa.  
   
I’m very excited about the future of Africa.  I’m very excited about the
impact of the future of Africa on the rest of the world, including the
United States of America.  
   
When I look at what is happening on this continent and the fact that the
median age is 19 years old — and what that tells us about the growth, of
opportunity, of innovation, of possibilities — I see in all of that
great opportunity not only for the people of this continent, but the
people of the world, especially when we understand that by the year
2050, we believe one in four people on Earth will be on the continent of
Africa.  
   
So I am here to address some of the issues that relate to the
partnership between this continent, its people, and the people of the
United States, and to reinforce the work that we will continue to do
together, be that on addressing the climate crisis, to supply chains, to
our work together on international rules and norms.  
   
In particular on this trip, I intend to do work that is focused on
increasing investments here on the continent and facilitating economic
growth and opportunity, specifically in the areas of economic
empowerment of women and girls, empowerment of youth entrepreneurship,
digital inclusion, and to support the work that must be done to increase
food security, including adaptation to the effects of the climate
crisis.  
   
I look forward to my meetings with President Akufo-Addo, President
Samia, and President Hichilema.  We will build on the previous meetings
I have had with each of them to strengthen democracy and good
governance, promote peace and security, build on long-term economic
growth, and strengthen our business ties.  
   
I also look forward, during this visit, to meet with entrepreneurs and
artists and students and farmers to witness firsthand the extraordinary
innovation and creativity that is occurring on this continent and
inspiring the world.  We have a lot of work ahead of us.  
   
And, again, I’m so very excited to be here, and I thank you all for the
very warm welcome.  Thank you.  (Applause.)
