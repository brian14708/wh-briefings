Q    Mr. President, is there any — is there any action that you can take
on guns?  Or do you think it’s all up to Congress at this point?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I have gone the full extent of my executive authority to
do, on my own, anything about guns.  
   
Q    Will you — will you consider-  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  The
Congress has to act.  The majority of the American people think having
assault weapons is bizarre; it’s a crazy idea.  They’re against that. 
And so, I think the Congress should be passing the assault weapons
ban.   
   
I want to remind you, the last time we passed the assault weapons ban,
violent shootings went down, mass shootings went down for 10 or however
many years it was — 9 years.  And so-  
   
Q    So what can you do?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  So I can’t do anything except plead with the Congress to
act reasonably.  
   
Q    Will you consider traveling to Nashville to meet with members of
the community?  Will you consider traveling to Nashville to meet with
members of the community?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, I’ve spoken with everyone down there, from the
mayor, to the senators, to all the players.  I spoke to the chief of
police today.  I’ve spoken to all of them.   
   
What I don’t want to do — I’ve been through many of these myself, as you
know, all the way starting way back to the mass shootings (inaudible).  
   
Thank you.
