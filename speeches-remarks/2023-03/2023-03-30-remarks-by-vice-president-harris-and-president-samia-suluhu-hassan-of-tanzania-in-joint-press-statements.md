*Ikulu  
*Dar es Salaam, Tanzania**

2:22 P.M. EAT  
   
TANZANIAN OFFICIAL:  Hello, Your Excellency, President of the United
Republic of Tanzania, Samia Suluhu Hassan; Honorable Kamala Harris, Vice
President of the United States of America; distinguished guests; members
of the press.  Good afternoon.  
   
Madam Vice President, you’re warmly welcomed to Tanzania, the beautiful
land of Kilimanjaro, Serengeti, and Zanzibar, just to mention a few.  In
front of you are journalists — local journalists and international
journalists — from different organizations who are ready to hear your
remarks.  
   
President Samia Suluhu Hassan, *karibu sana.*  
   
PRESIDENT SAMIA:  Thank you so much.  Your Excellency Kamala Harris, the
Vice President of the United States of America; senior government
officials from Tanzania and the United States; members of the press: A
very good afternoon.  
   
Today, Tanzania has made another historic milestone with two female
leaders, the Vice President and a President, meeting here at the State
House in Dar es Salaam.  And to put a shirt on top of all this, the
meeting takes place during this very important month, Women’s History
Month.  Much.  
   
What an inspiration and a testimony to Tanzanian young girls.  I truly
thank you, Madam Vice President, for honoring my invitation and coming
to visit me.   
   
*Karibu sana*.  You’re welcome — very much welcome.  
   
Madam Vice President and dear sister, I thank you for accepting, as I
said, my invitation and putting Tanzania — placing Tanzania among the
country — priority countries to your visit in Africa.  It is also a
demonstration of a country’s desire to invigorate its relation with
Africa, a very important move and something we have always sought to
pursue.  
   
Your visit speaks volumes of our existing bilateral relations in various
fields of occupation.  High-level visits by our various officials have
continued to cement further this relations.   
   
With your visit, I’m sure Tanzania and I — Tanzanians are now anxiously
waiting for President Joe Biden’s visit in Tanzania.  And please kindly
convey our greetings and our invitation that Tanzania is waiting to host
him.   
   
It is truly a delight to host you here.  *Karibu sana*.  Welcome to
Tanzania.   
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Thank you.  
   
PRESIDENT SAMIA:  I hope you know some few Swahili words, at least
*karibu.  Y*ou know what *karibu*, means, yeah?  Yeah?  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Yes.  
   
PRESIDENT SAMIA:  *Jambo*?  *Safari*?  All those Swahili words.  I hope
you know them.  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  (Inaudible.)  
   
PRESIDENT SAMIA:  Yeah.  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  I know that one.  
   
PRESIDENT SAMIA:  Oh, okay. Great.  (Laughter.)   
   
Your Excellency, for over six decades, Tanzania has been a beneficiary
of invaluable support from the United States of America.  The support
has greatly contributed to our national efforts to improve the lives and
livelihoods of our people here.   
   
We appreciate the U.S. support in complimenting Tanzanians’ development
in Davos, in different sectors such as health, education, water,
sanitation, agriculture, food security, natural resources,
infrastructure development, human rights and democracy, and good
governance, of course.  
   
For instance, in health or health sector, HIV and TB are no longer
life-threatening to our people.  HIV/AIDS infection has greatest reduced
from a prevalent of 7.2 percent in 2012 to 4.7 in ’16, ’17.  But it has
been reducing further by ‘21.  
   
The new TB infection have reduced from 306 people per thousand to 208
per thousand people, while pregnant women who are infected with HIV are
now sure — are assured of giving birth and raising the child free from
HIV infection.   
   
And these are those — all the efforts of PEPFAR.  So, thank you very
much.  
   
Through your support, malaria deaths, which were (inaudible), have now
been reduced from 7.7 million in 2015 to 3.5 million in 2021.  So we
have gone halfway, and I’m sure, with more efforts, we are going to
reduce further.  
   
Our goal is toward having a malaria-free society.  We count on such
program to achieve this — our — this goal.  And we’re ready to support
interested investors who want to establish manufacturing plants in
Tanzania for a manufacturing era in RVs and insecticide bed nets.  We
are very keen on such investors.   
   
And this is because we want to shorten the supply chain.  If they’re
producing in Tanzania, then the supply could be very easy.  
   
Madam Vice President, as the world is grappling with food insecurity due
to drastic climate effects, Tanzania is grateful to the U.S. government
for reinstating it to the food — the Feed the Future program — Feed the
Future Initiative.  This move have come at an opportune moment, given
our national agenda, of boosting agriculture-led economic growth by
transforming this sector.   
   
So the government of Tanzania commends the initiative and commitment by
the government of United States of America towards strengthening ocean
governance and sustainable utilization of blue economy resources in
Tanzania.  
   
I’m informed that our dear gentleman is going to launch the U.S. project
on Respect the Ocean.  Or in Swahili, we say “*Heshimu Bahari*,” Respect
the Ocean.   
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Right.  
  
PRESIDENT SAMIA:  Today, afternoon.  
  
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  He is.  
  
PRESIDENT SAMIA:  I think he’s doing it now.  
  
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Yes.  
  
PRESIDENT SAMIA:  This will indeed complement our efforts in promoting
blue economy-related policies and initiatives in Tanzania.  
  
We particularly welcome cooperation in following areas: fishing,
especially deep-sea fishing; aquafarming; salt mining; gas exploration;
blue tourism; and marine transportation.  These are the potential areas
of investments in Tanzania with a blue economy.   
  
Tanzania still enjoys several other assistance interventions from the
great people of United States of America, such as the African Growth and
Opportunity Act — AGOA.  
  
We request for an early renewal of AGOA because it’s only — it is only
through business — the business and trade is growing only through AGOA. 
And so we are requesting an extension of at least — we are aware that
this program is going to terminate in 2025.  But the African countries —
Tanzania, one of them — we’re requesting for an extension of at least 10
years so that the investors who are now investing in Tanzania, taking
advantage of that market, have to be sure of the availability of the
market.  So if we go up to 2030, that would be great for us.  Thank you
so much.  
  
Madam Vice President, acceptable democratic space has been a major
concern of my government.  We have endeavored to build a democratic
state that upholds transparency and respect of the rule of law.  And in
this connection, I’m grateful to the President Joe Biden for inviting me
to participate in the Summit for Democracy in 2023, which I did
virtually.  
  
This invitation sends a clear message that the fathers of democracy
recognize our efforts in building a democratic nation.  
  
As an important partner in our pursuit for democracy and good
governance, this recognition from the U.S. leadership means a lot to the
government and the people of the United Republic of Tanzania.  
  
Madam Vice President and members of the press, it is our firm belief
that this visit will not only offer an opportunity for our country to
strengthen the existing relation, but also will provide a platform to
explore new areas of cooperation.   
  
And I understand we have signed some of the memorandum of
understanding.  Have we signed already?  Yes?  Some of the memorandum of
understanding.  And these include port cooperation.  We have signed on
commercial dialogue and information communication technology.  We have
also signed on — yeah, information communication technology, commercial
dialogue, and port cooperation — three of them — of which each one is
having a lot in it.  I think the technical teams are going to work on
them, and we’ll see how we start working on them after identification of
the issues in the MOU.   
  
My most important request now is to ensure full implementation of those
agreements.  Madam Vice President, I take the liberty of assuring
Tanzanian — the commitment of the government of Tanzania in honoring
those agreement.  So I took the liberty of assuring on behalf of fellow
Tanzanians.   
  
And last but not least, the issue of visas to facilitate the movement of
people, goods, and services between our two countries.  And in this
respect, Tanzania welcomes the readiness of the government of the United
States of America to review the existing visa status to enable the
citizens of our two nations to benefit for a long-duration visa.   
  
We believe, under this arrangement, our two countries will register a
significant increase in trade, tourism, and investment.   
  
And in conclusion, I take this opportunity to reaffirm Tanzania’s
commitment to further promoting our bilateral relation with the U.S. —
USA — for mutual benefit of our two countries and people.   
  
Madam Vice President, thank you once again for visiting me and my
country.  And I look forward to fruitfully discussion together.   
  
Please, you may proceed.  
  
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Thank you, Madam President.  Thank you. 
(Applause.)  
   
Well, I thank you for the warm welcome to Tanzania.  
   
PRESIDENT SAMIA:  Thank you.  You’re welcome.   
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  It was my honor to host you at the White House
in April of last year and then to meet again in December of last year at
the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit.  
   
PRESIDENT SAMIA:  Yes.  Yes.    
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  And both times you invited me to visit your
beautiful country, and I’m glad to have been able to make the trip and
to see you today.  
   
PRESIDENT SAMIA:  Thank you.  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  So thank you for the warm welcome.     
   
The U.S.-Tanzania relationship has deep and historic roots.  President
Kennedy met with Julius Nyerere in 1961, several months before your
nation’s independence.  
   
Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama all have traveled here in
recognition of our strong partnership.  
   
And thanks to the progress of your administration, you have made a
champion — you have been a champion in terms of democratic reforms in
this country and, in that way, have expanded our partnership.  And so
today, then, is part of the strengthening of the relationship between
our two countries.   
   
And under your leadership —  
   
PRESIDENT SAMIA:  Yes —  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  — I have full confidence that we will be able to
do just that.   
   
PRESIDENT SAMIA:  That’s my commitment.  Thank you.  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  And the Biden-Harris administration is committed
to strengthening this relationship going forward.   
   
Today, we will discuss many topics; we have discussed a few already. 
But the topics we will continue to discuss include the issue as you have
raised of democracy and good governance.  We will discuss and continue
to discuss the issue of long-term economic growth for Tanzania, the
climate crisis, and then regional and global challenges.  
   
On the subject of democracy and good governance: As I said in Ghana,
polling tells us the vast majority of Africans support democracy over
other forms of government.  This reflects a shared desire between us.   
   
And the United States will continue to work alongside democratic
governments in support of democratic aspirations and the democratic
aspirations, in particular, of the people of this continent.  
   
Madam President, under your leadership, Tanzania has taken important and
meaningful steps.  And President Joe Biden and I applaud you.  
   
PRESIDENT SAMIA:  Thank you.  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  You have been open to working with the political
opposition.  We have discussed that.   
   
You have lifted the ban on political party public rallies.  You worked
to improve the freedom of the press.  And just yesterday, you
participated, as you mentioned, in the Summit for Democracy.  
   
On the subject of economic growth, good governance delivers
predictability, stability, and rule of law, which businesses need to
invest.  
   
Working together, it is our shared goal to increase economic investment
in Tanzania and strengthen our economic ties.   
   
PRESIDENT SAMIA:  Yes.    
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  To do so, I am pleased to announce a series of
new initiatives:  
   
One, the Export-Import Bank will sign an MOU with Tanzania, which will
facilitate up to $500 million in U.S. exports to Tanzania in the areas
of transportation, infrastructure, digital technology, and clean energy
projects.  
   
PRESIDENT SAMIA:  Yes.  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Two, we are launching a new partnership on 5G
technology and cybersecurity.  As I have been making clear on this trip
to the continent, I believe that the innovation and ingenuity that is
taking place here on the continent will shape the future of the world
and will benefit the world.  
   
In Tanzania alone, thanks to your leadership, Madam President, and
partnership with the private sector, work is currently underway to build
the first-of-its-kind processing facility on the continent for minerals
that go into electric vehicle batteries.  This will deliver
battery-grade nickel to the United States and global markets as soon as
2026.  
   
This project is an important and pioneering model, using innovative and
low-emission technology and high labor standards.  
   
Importantly, raw minerals will soon be processed in Tanzania, by
Tanzanians.  It will help address the climate crisis, build resilient
global supply chains, and create new industries and jobs.   
   
There is so much potential for growth here.  So our administration is
now working with partners to identify additional opportunities for
critical minerals from the region to be processed in this new
facility.  
   
On the issue of security, I thank you for Tanzania’s contribution to
peace and security in the region.  You and I will discuss the impacts of
Russia’s war in Ukraine on food supplies and how we can best support
Tanzania’s efforts toward climate adaptation and resilience.  
   
We will also highlight and I will highlight the important work you have
done to support the women in Tanzania as a historic female leader on the
continent.   
   
As I have said many times, women around the world must be able to fully
participate in economic, political, and social life.  And they must be
able to participate equally, including in leadership roles.  
   
When you lift up the economic status of women, you lift up the economic
status of families, of communities, and all of society benefits.  
   
And yesterday I was proud to announce more than $1 billion in public-
and private-sector commitments to support the empowerment of women on
the continent.   
   
My last point is to commend the Tanzanian government for its transparent
response to the Marburg virus.  Your continued coordination and
information sharing with international partners has been critical to
contain the spread of the virus.  
   
Our governments remain in close contact, and our work together builds on
decades of collaboration on public health issues.  
   
Through USAID, we plan to provide another $1.3 million to support your
response efforts.  And we are providing personal protective equipment to
help Tanzanian responders.  
   
On all of these issues, Madam President, our administration looks
forward to working with you and to continuing to strengthen the
relationship between the United States and Tanzania.   
   
And I thank you for the warm welcome again.  Thank you.  
   
PRESIDENT SAMIA:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)
