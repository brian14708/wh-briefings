THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning, everyone.  Before I leave for California,
I want to briefly speak about what’s happening to Silicon Valley Bank
and Signature Bank.   
   
Today, thanks to the quick action of my administration over the past few
days, Americans can have confidence that the banking system is safe. 
Your deposits will be there when you need them.   
   
Small businesses across the country that had deposit accounts at these
banks can breathe easier knowing they’ll be able to pay their workers
and pay their bills.  And their hardworking employees can breathe easier
as well.   
   
Last week, when we learned of the problems of the banks and the impact
they could have on jobs, some small businesses, and the banking system
overall, I instructed my team to act quickly to protect these
interests.  They have done that.  They have done that.  
   
On Friday, the government regulator in charge, the FDIC, took control of
Silicon Valley Bank’s assets.  And over the weekend, it took control of
Signature Bank’s assets.   
   
Treasury Secretary Yellen and a team of banking regulators have taken
action — immediate action.  And here are the highlights:  
   
First, all customers who had deposits in these banks can rest assured —
I want to — rest assured they’ll be protected and they’ll have access to
their money as of today.  That includes small businesses across the
country that banked there and need to make payroll, pay their bills, and
stay open for business.   
   
No losses will be — and I want — this is an important point — no losses
will be borne by the taxpayers.  Let me repeat that: No losses will be
borne by the taxpayers.  Instead, the money will come from the fees that
banks pay into the Deposit Insurance Fund.   
   
Because of the actions of that — because of the actions that our
regulators have already taken, every American should feel confident that
their deposits will be there if and when they need them.   
   
Second, the management of these banks will be fired.  If the bank is
taken over by FDIC, the people running the bank should not work there
anymore.   
   
Third, investors in the banks will not be protected.  They knowingly
took a risk and when the risk didn’t pay off, investors lose their
money.  That’s how capitalism works.   
   
And fourth, there are important questions of how these banks got into
these circumstances in the first place.  We must get the full accounting
of what happened and why those responsible can be held accountable.  In
my administration, no one, in my view — no one is above the law.   
   
And finally, we must reduce the risks of this happening again.  During
the Obama-Biden administration, we put in place tough requirements on
banks like Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, including the
Dodd-Frank Law, to make sure the crisis we saw in 2008 would not happen
again.   
   
Unfortunately, the last administration rolled back some of these
requirements.  I’m going to ask Congress and the banking regulators to
strengthen the rules for banks to make it less likely that this kind of
bank failure will happen again and to protect American jobs and small
businesses.   
   
Look, the bottom line is this: Americans can rest assured that our
banking system is safe.  Your deposits are safe.   
   
Let me also assure you: We will not stop at this.  We’ll do whatever is
needed on top of all this.  
   
Let’s also take a look — a moment to put the situation in a broader
context.  We have made strong economic progress in the past two years. 
We’ve created more than 12 million new jobs — more jobs in two years
than any President has ever created in a single four-year term. 
Unemployment is below 4 percent for 14 straight months.  Take-home pay
for workers is going up, especially for lower- and middle-income
workers.  And we’ve seen record numbers of people apply to start new
businesses — more than 10 million of them — more than 10 million
applications over the last two years starting businesses.   
   
Now we need to keep the program — this progress going.  That’s what
swift action that my administration, over the past few years, is all
about: protecting depositors, protecting the banking system, protecting
the economic gains we have made together for the American people.   
   
Thank you.  God bless you.  And may God protect our troops.  See you in
California.
