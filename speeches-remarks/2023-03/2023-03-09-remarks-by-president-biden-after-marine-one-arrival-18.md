Q   Mr. President, have you spoken to Leader McConnell?

THE PRESIDENT:  I’ve spoken to the family.  I think he’s going to be all
right, he’ll be good.

Q    What did you say to the family?

Q    Mr. President, on Chairman Xi’s remarks and the foreign minister’s
remarks this week, they were rather sharp and definitive going after the
United States.  What’s your read on what that means?

THE PRESIDENT:  Not much.

Q    Republicans say your budget is dead on arrival.  “Why introduce
it?”  What do you say to them?

THE PRESIDENT:  Watch me.

Q    What areas do you think you can find compromises with — with the
Republicans?

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’ll see what their budget is.  I’m ready to meet
with him tomorrow if he shows me his budget.
