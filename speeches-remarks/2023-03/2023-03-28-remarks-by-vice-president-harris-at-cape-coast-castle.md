*Cape Coast Castle  
*Cape Coast, Ghana**

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  So, being here was — was immensely powerful and
moving, when we think about how human beings were treated by the
hundreds of thousands in this very place that we now stand, the crimes
that happened here, the blood that was shed here.  
   
There are dungeons here where human beings were kept — men, women, and
children.  They were kidnapped from their homes.  They were transported
hundreds of miles from their homes, not really sure where they were
headed.  And they came to this place of horror — some to die, many to
starve and be tortured, women to be raped — before they were then
forcibly taken on a journey thousands of miles from their home to be
sold by so-called merchants and taken to the Americas, to the Caribbean
to be an enslaved people.   
   
We don’t know the numbers who died on their way to this place, the
numbers who were killed during that passage on the Atlantic.  The horror
of what happened here must always be remembered.  It cannot be denied. 
It must be taught.  History must be learned.   
   
And we must then be guided by what we know also to be the history of
those who survived in the Americas, in the Caribbean — those who proudly
declare themselves to be the diaspora who then came out of — in, often,
many situations — odds that were designed to break them, to demoralize
them, to crea- — create systems and situations that were to make them
feel like less than humans, less than full human beings.   
   
But yet, they survived.  And they tell another history — a history of
endurance, a history of faith, a history in believing what is possible,
a history not only that tells about the ability that each individual has
to survive, but to thrive.   
   
And so, all these stories must be told.  All these stories must be told
in a way that we take from this place — the pain we all feel, the
anguish that reeks from this place.  And we then carry the knowledge
that we have may gained here toward the work that we do in lifting up
all people, in recognizing the struggles of all people, of fighting for,
as the walls of this place talk about, justice and freedom for all
people, human rights for all people.   
   
So, that’s what I take from being here.  The descendants of the people
who walked through that door were strong people, proud people, people of
deep faith; people who loved their families, their traditions, their
culture, and carried that innate being with them through all of these
periods; went on to fight for civil rights, fight for justice in the
United States of America and around the world.   
   
And all of us, regardless of your background, have benefited from their
struggle and their fight for freedom and for justice.   
   
Thank you.
