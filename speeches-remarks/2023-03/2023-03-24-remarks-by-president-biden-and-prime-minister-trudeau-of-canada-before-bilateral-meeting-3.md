PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU:  What a real pleasure it is to welcome President
Biden to Ottawa — back to Ottawa.  It’s so great to see you, Joe.   
   
Obviously, we’ve been working closely together over the past few years
on how to build strong economies for everyone in our two countries and
around the world, how to continue our fight against climate change and
prepare a stronger economic future for everyone, but also how we deal
with changing geopolitical security contexts and how we continue the
important work of keeping our citizens safe and standing up for our
values everywhere around the world.  We have no greater friend and ally
than the United States.  
   
And it’s always a — always a real pleasure to be able to welcome you and
to sit down with you.   
   
(Speaks in French.)  (No translation provided.)  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  It’s been too long between meetings.  I think in 2016
I was here.   
   
And, you know, the one great thing — and I tell other world leaders that
I meet with when they ask about the geopolitical circumstances of the
world — I say, “We’re lucky.  We have Canada to our north.  We share
these values — all the values are the same.”  We disagree in degree on
things occasionally, but there’s no fundamental difference in the
democratic values we share, and it really makes a big difference.   
   
And so, it’s an honor to be here.  We have a lot to talk about.  And I —
I think we’re going to — I think we’re going to get a lot done today.   
   
PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU:  Thank you very much.
