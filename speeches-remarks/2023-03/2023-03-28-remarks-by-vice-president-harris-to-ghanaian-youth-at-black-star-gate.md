*Black Star Gate  
*Accra, Ghana**

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Hello!  Hello, Ghana!  (Applause.)  I am incredibly
honored to be with you here in Ghana and to the people of this
incredible continent, to the people of Ghana, and to all the young
leaders with us today — students, entrepreneurs, activists, advocates. 
It is my extraordinary honor to be with you.  
   
So, I don’t need to tell you the median age on the African continent is
19.  By 2050, one in four people in the entire world will be on this
very continent.  One in four.  That, of course, means what happens on
this continent impacts the entire world.  
   
Seeing all of you here today makes me so optimistic and excited about
this future — the energy, the dynamism, and the potential that each of
you embody.  And that is why I am here today.  
   
As President Joe Biden said at the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit last
December, we’re all in on Africa.   
  
We are all in — (applause) — because African nations play such a
critical role on issues of global importance, issues that matter to the
American people and to the world.  Issues like food security, the
climate crisis, public health, and resilient supply chains.  
   
We are all in — because African leadership is critical to global peace
and security, and African nations are essential partners at the United
Nations and in support of international rules and norms.  
   
We are all in — because the fates of the American people and of America
and the continent of Africa are interconnected and interdependent.  
   
We are all in — because there are longstanding ties between our people. 
We have an intertwined history, some of which is painful and some of
which is prideful, and all of which we must acknowledge, teach, and
never forget.  (Applause.)  
   
Because of this history, this continent, of course, has a special
significance for me personally as the first Black Vice President of the
United States of America.  (Applause.)  
   
And this is a history, like many of us, that I learned as a young child
— stories, cultures, and traditions passed down from generations.  In
addition, this continent has a personal meaning for me because my
grandfather and other members of my family worked in Zambia in the 1960s
alongside a newly independent people.  
   
I was fortunate enough to visit them in Zambia as a young girl.  The
values that guided my relatives when they were there, and the legacy of
their efforts, remain a source of pride for my entire family and
continue to animate my work today.  
   
So, then, what does it mean that the United States of America is all
in?  
   
It means that the United States is committed to strengthen our
partnerships across the continent of Africa — partnerships with
governments, the private sector, civil society, and all of you. 
Partnerships based on openness, inclusiveness, candor, shared interests,
and mutual benefits.  
   
And to be clear, America will be guided not by what we can do for our
African partners, but what we can do with our African partners. 
(Applause.)  
   
Together, we will address the challenges we face and the incredible
opportunities ahead.   
  
And today, I will speak about one particular area of opportunity:
investment in innovation.  
   
Innovation I believe to be the pursuit of what can be unburdened by what
has been.  Innovation results in one’s ability not only to see, but to
do things differently.  New methods, new products, new approaches, new
ideas.  We innovate to be more effective and to solve problems.   
   
From the invention of new technology, to the origin of social movements,
innovation has come about by challenging the premise, questioning the
status quo, and bold thinking.  
   
And so to the young leaders here today, you, by your very nature, are
dreamers and innovators.   
   
And so, to you I say: It is your spark, your creativity, and your
determination that will drive the future.  And with that then, African
ideas and innovations will shape the future of the world.  (Applause.)  
   
And so we must invest in the African ingenuity and creativity, which
will unlock incredible economic growth and opportunities, not only for
the people of the 54 countries that make up this diverse continent, but
for the American people and people around the world.  
   
So the Biden-Harris administration and the American people stand ready
to partner with you, to help accelerate the innovation and
entrepreneurship that is already underway.  
   
Let’s look, for example, at what is happening across the continent in
technology, science, agriculture, and clean energy, where innovation is
solving local problems and global problems.  
   
Just think, before Venmo or Apple Pay, there was M-PESA in Kenya, a
mobile phone payment service that revolutionized the digital financial
system.  
   
Right now, African nations are pioneering the delivery of healthcare
supplies by drone in Rwanda.  (Applause.)  This has reduced the delivery
time for emergency blood supplies.  
   
In Ghana, this service has delivered more than 9 million vaccines,
including those for COVID-19.  (Applause.)  This service has expanded to
Kenya and Nigeria and Cote d’Ivoire and recently to the United States,
in North Carolina, Arkansas, and Utah.  
   
In South Africa, part of the world’s largest radio telescope is under
construction, which will help answer some of the biggest questions of
humanity, about galaxies, about gravity.  
   
In Tanzania, plans are underway to build the first facility of its kind
on the continent to process minerals that go into electric vehicle
batteries.   
   
We see water-based farming in Kenya, battery energy storage systems in
Malawi, and fintech startups in Nigeria.  
   
African ideas and innovation innovations shaping the world, all of which
fuel our optimism and hope.   
   
Yet we must also be candid about the challenges — from security concerns
in the Sahel, to droughts and floods exasperated by the climate crisis,
and barriers to economic growth both on a macro and micro level.  
   
We must tackle these challenges and find ways to accelerate opportunity,
growth, and stability.   
   
And I believe we must be intentional to make progress in three key
areas: the empowerment of women — (applause); digital inclusion; and
good governance and democracy, all of which are a focus of my visit to
the continent and going forward, and all of which have the potential to
create even more innovation, innovation that will unlock new jobs, new
industries, and exponential growth.  
   
So let us agree: Women around the world must be able to fully
participate in economic, political, and social life.  (Applause.)  And
they must be able to participate equally, including in leadership
roles.  It is a key to maximizing global growth and opportunity.  
   
However, we see gender disparities around the world, including in the
United States — disparities we must all address on the continent of
Africa.   
   
We know women grow a majority of the food, yet they are less likely to
own the land they farm.  They represent a majority of frontline
healthcare workers, but face disparities in health outcomes.  
   
Women are entrepreneurs yet have limited access to capital and markets. 
They are peacemakers and bridge builders yet continue to be
underrepresented at the tables where decisions are being made.  
   
And there are many factors that impact a woman’s ability to survive and
thrive.  One of those is economic empowerment.  And when we lift up the
economic status of a woman, let’s be clear, we lift up the economic
status of her children, her family, her community.  The entire economy
benefits.  (Applause.)  
   
So know that the United States of America will work alongside our
partners each and every day to close gender gaps here and around the
world.  
   
And, ultimately, our belief is that the empowerment of women is rooted
in the concept of freedom.  Not just freedom from violence or want, but
freedom to create one’s own future, a freedom we desire for all
people.  
   
The second area where we must together make progress is in the digital
economy.  Whether you are a student relying on virtual courses, a farmer
relying on an app for an early warning about extreme weather, or a
small-business owner looking to sell goods online, digital services are
essential to 21st century economies.   
   
There are places on the continent of Africa that lead the world in
digital solutions yet other places on the continent that lag behind.  
   
Expanding access to the Internet drives growth and creates opportunity
for innovation.  And once people are online, they have greater access
then to education, greater access to information, and greater access to
financial services — which is why the United States will double down on
our effort to mobilize billions of dollars in public and private capital
from the United States, the continent of Africa, and around the world,
in order to expand Internet access for the benefit of all people here on
the continent.  (Applause.)  
   
To this end, the partnership between the public and private sectors is
essential.  Partnerships that combine the experience and expertise of
the private sector with the reach and capacity that only governments can
provide.  
   
Together, we can unleash growth and opportunity that far exceeds what
either the public or private sector can achieve on its own.  And the
United States is committed to build these types of partnerships to
increase digital inclusion on the continent.  
   
And finally, to create inclusive economic growth and to advance
innovation we must continue to support and invest in good governance and
democracy.  (Applause.)  
   
Good governance — well, it delivers predictability, stability, and rule
of law, which is what businesses need to invest and what benefits all of
society.  And good governance is a key attribute of a good democracy.   
   
Recent polling tells us the vast majority of Africans support democracy
over other forms of government, which reflects our shared desire for
freedom and opportunity, transparency, and accountability for free and
fair elections, the orderly transition of power, and the protection of
fundamental human rights.  
   
Indeed, this is a priority for the American people, and it is a global
priority.  The United States will continue to work alongside democratic
governments and in support of democratic aspirations of the people of
this continent.  
   
In demonstration of this partnership this week, our administration is
co-hosting the Zambia — in Zambia — the Summit for Democracy, an
opportunity to learn from each other and strengthen democratic
institutions.  
   
And I will say, while democracy is always a work in progress, including
in my own country, the American people will always stand with those
yearning for more freedom.  (Applause.)  
   
And let us be clear that innovation thrives in a democracy.  New ideas
thrive where freedoms thrive.  Free thinking leads to problem solving.  
   
And so, I believe, acting together with intention, we can make progress
in these three areas: the empowerment of women, digital inclusion, and
good governance and democracy.  
   
And just let us take a moment to imagine the future — a future where
women are not just included, but also lead.  (Applause.)   
   
Imagine a future where every person is connected to the digital
economy.  A future where every young person trusts that their voices are
heard.  A future that is propelled by African innovation.  
   
So as we leave here today, let us consider then our shared future.  Know
the United States will remain a steadfast partner for progress.   
   
I am more optimistic than I have ever been about the future and the
future of the continent of Africa and, by extension, the world, not only
because of the work we undertake in government, not only because of the
investments in the private sector.  I am optimistic about the future of
the world because of you — the woman who will shatter every glass
ceiling — (applause); the entrepreneur who will identify the next
digital breakthrough; the activist who will fight for the dignity of
every human being — students and scientists, athletes and artists,
farmers and fishers; and the young innovators who will solve problems
that we haven’t yet identified with solutions we can’t even yet
imagine.  
   
So all of this to say: You, and in particular the young leaders here,
you have a role to play.  And together, we have a role to play.  So,
then, let us dream with ambition and lead with conviction.  
   
Thank you very much.  (Applause.)
