*Vice President’s Ceremonial Office  
*Eisenhower Executive Office Building**

1:40 P.M. EST  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Secretary Marty — *Marty Walsh*. 
(Pronounced in Boston accent.)  (Laughter.)  
   
I just — I was a little late coming over because the President and I had
our — our regular lunch today, and we talked about many things.  And we
talked about you.   
   
Marty Walsh and those of us who have worked with him and had the
blessing of having that time with him know he is a genuine, true fighter
for working people in America.  And he not only cares, he is extremely
effective in fighting for working people in America.   
   
And through the many stages of your career and your work on behalf of
working people and families, you have shown time and again how
leadership should think of the dignity of work, and therefore, be
committed to the dignity of workers.   
   
And I have seen it firsthand in the work that we have done, as you have
said, through this task force.  From day one, our President said we’re
going to create a structure around this administration, in terms of
going deep into the issues.  
   
And we’re going to start, first, with ourselves.  We’re going to look in
the mirror, as the administration that is over this federal government,
and look at the condition and the wellbeing of federal workers.  And
Marty Walsh, front and center, took this by the reins and did the
elbow-grease work of ensuring that we would bring our Cabinet together,
that we would bring agencies together, that we would get on the ground
and make sure that we were being relevant on a daily basis to the people
who work for the largest employer in the country — the federal
government.  
   
And as a result of Marty’s work, we have seen — I’ve got just some of
the numbers: The Department of Labor is on track to meet the goal of 1
million new apprenticeships by 2025.  We have recovered over $520
million in back wages.  It’s a big deal.  We have protected pensions for
millions of workers and retirees.  And this is just — I could go on and
on about what you have done and who you are.   
   
And so we are so fortunate to have had a Secretary of Labor in you.  And
as I’ve said to you many times: People around our country, who may not
know your name and who you may never meet, are forever benefitted
because of your service.  
   
So I want to just ask everybody to applaud our Secretary of Labor. 
(Applause.)  
   
So on the — on the — the subject of the meeting today, as Secretary
Walsh has said, this task force has been working for two years on a
number of issues that have been about reinforcing the importance of
protecting workers’ ability to engage in collective bargaining, what we
must do to make sure that people are well informed of their rights and
also their access and their invitation to be a member of a union.  
   
We have been doing the work of informing the federal workforce, but by
extension their family members and the public in general, about the
benefits of union membership.  And as the Secretary has said, there are
many, and we know that.   
   
There is the work that is about being a part of a union that is about
having an advocate for wages, for benefits, for making sure that the
workplace is safe.   
  
But there is also the community that is so naturally, and almost
uniquely, formed in the context of union membership that allows a worker
to understand that they are not alone and that there are — that they
have a family of colleagues who will stand with them in terms of their
collective goals that is not only about the quality of their work and
what they hope to achieve, understanding the dignity of their work, but
what they are able to achieve on behalf of their family.  
  
And so, today, this meeting is an extension of all of the work that we
have done thus far and, as the Secretary has said, in particular to
highlight the role of employers.   
  
And we were very intentional about wanting to uplift the examples of
employers who have embraced the importance of union labor and who have
done the work then of facilitating and organizing, but who also can
speak to the business model that benefits from union labor, as the
Secretary has said: increased productivity; increased morale; and a —
you know, we call it “esprit de corps,” the — the spirit of the
workforce; results, as we have seen over and over again, from this kind
of approach.  
  
Some of the numbers I have is that, for example, in union manufacturing
facilities, they’re up to 10 percent more productive than those that are
not.  
  
When you look at union workplaces, you see lower turnover than other
workplaces.  And states with the highest union density have the lowest
turnover rates.  
  
There’s empirical evidence of all these points that we know anecdotally
and just based on our own experiences.  
  
Union workplaces are safer.  Thirty-four percent fewer workplace safety
violations take place in union workplaces.  
  
So the benefits are there — in terms of the business reason — to
accommodate, facilitate, and support this kind of approach to workers
and, again, the dignity of their work.  
  
And I want to thank all of you who are here for spotlighting the
importance of this.  
   
For example, you know, Ford.  So, the partnership between UAW and Ford
has — is the partnership that is an example of one of the oldest
apprenticeship programs that exists anywhere.  And what they do in terms
of facilitating the training, the upskilling of the workforce and how
that results then, of course, in greater productivity, but also
enhancing then the work that is being done, especially as we move into
new economies, such as a clean energy economy.  
  
I’m talking all over the world about this.  I was just in Munich a
couple of weeks ago, talking about clean energy economy.  We’re opening
up a whole new economy, bringing new workers into it, which is going to
allow for the American that — for the United States of America to be
more competitive on the global stage, but it also means what we need to
do to partner up with IBEW and UAW to make sure that we build the skills
that are necessary to enter this new economy in a way that we are
competitive and strong.  
  
So, I’m so glad that everyone is here today to talk about this.  But I
do believe that the work that is happening around this table and, by
extension, around our country is not only for the benefit of individuals
and their families and their communities, but strengthens us as a
nation, strengthens our economy.  And it puts us on track to continue to
be able to compete and be a role model around the globe.  
  
So, with that, I thank everyone for being here.  And why don’t we get
started?
