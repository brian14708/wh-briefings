East Room

11:22 A.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  What a good morning.   
   
Yesterday, the United States Senate took the additional step toward
passing the bipartisan infrastructure bill.  It’s a bill that would end
years of gridlock in Washington, and create millions of good-paying
jobs, and put America on a new path to win the race for the economy in
the 21st century  
   
A historic investment in roads and rail, in transit and bridges, in
clean energy and clean water.  It will enable us to not only build back,
but build back better than before the economic crisis hit.  
   
I want to thank the bipartisan group of senators for working together
and the committee chairs for raising their ideas and concerns with me
and Vice President Harris and members of our Cabinet.  
   
As we did with the Transcontinental Railroad and the Interstate Highway
System, we’ll soon, once again, transform America and propel us into the
future.  
   
This bill makes key investments to put people to work all across the
country — in cities, in towns, in rural communities, small towns, big
towns, coastal — along the coastlines, and on plains.  It covers the
nation.  And it’s going to put America to work in good-paying union
jobs, building and repairing our roads, bridges, ports, airports.  
   
And, you know, once this bill passes the Senate, I know that body will
move toward establishing a framework for the remainder of my Build Back
Better agenda — giving tax cuts to the middle class by investing in
childcare and home care for seniors, critical investments to combat
climate change and to build a clean energy future — vital steps needed
to bring down the cost of healthcare and so much more.   
   
And we’re going to do it without raising taxes by even one cent on
people making less than $400,000 a year.  
   
And here’s another important part of the bill: Ninety percent of the
jobs created by this legislation will not require a college degree. 
Ninety percent.  It’s a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America.  
   
Which brings me to another piece of good news this morning:  We learned
that the economy created 943,000 new jobs in July — 943,000.  And the
unemployment rate fell by a half a percent to 5.4 percent.  
   
Now, while our economy is far from complete and while we have —
doubtlessly we’ll have ups and downs along the way as we continue to
battle the Delta surge of COVID, what is indisputable now is this: The
Biden plan is working, the Biden plan produces results, and the Biden
plan is moving the country forward.  
   
We’re now the first administration in history to add jobs every single
month in our first six months in office, and the only one in history to
add more than 4 million jobs during the first six months.  
   
Economic growth is the fastest in 40 years.  Jobs are up.  The
unemployment rate is the lowest since the pandemic hit.  Black
unemployment is down as well.   
   
Why?  Because we put in place the necessary tools early in my presidency
— the COVID vaccine — the COVID-19 vaccine plan, the American Rescue
Plan — to fight the virus and fight the economic mess we inherited.  As
a result, we’ve been able to make progress on both fronts against grave
challenges.  And we have — we put in place the tools to prevent this
Delta variant wave of COVID-19 from shutting down our small businesses,
our schools, and our society.  
   
You know, when we first got to office, the COVID-19 crisis and economic
crisis were unrelenting and devastating for people.  And as a nation, we
didn’t have to the tools to deal with either.  Nearly 4,000 Americans
were dying each and every day to the virus.  Four thousand a day.  The
economy had been wiped out.  We were down 10 million jobs from where we
were before the pandemic.  We were in a dark winter with real concerns
about what spring would bring.   
   
But then we got to work.  We passed the American Rescue Plan shortly
after I was sworn in.  That gave us the tools to fight the pandemic and
rebuild our economy, and it produced results.  
   
To beat the pandemic, we ramped up testing and protective equipment. 
And we bought it — we brought — we actually went out and bought enough
vaccine so that every single, solitary American could be vaccinated.   
   
And because of the help of everyone, from the military to civilian
efforts, we carried out one of the most difficult logistical challenges
in our nation’s history to get 220 million shots into people’s arms in
first 100 days in office.  Two hundred and twenty million.   
   
Over the past seven months, we’ve cut COVID-19 deaths by 90 percent.  As
of today, 193 million Americans have gotten at least one vaccination
shot, including over 70 percent of adults over the age of 18.  A hundred
and sixty-five million Americans are now fully vaccinated.  
   
Because of our success with the vaccination effort, this new Delta
variant wave of COVID-19 will be very different — be able to deal with
than the one that under- — that we under- — was underway when I took
office.    
   
And, yes, cases are going to go up before they come back down.  It’s a
pandemic of the unvaccinated.  I know I’ve said that constantly, and
others have as well.  The vaccation \[sic\] of the unvaccinated.  You
know, and it’s needless — taking a needless toll on our country.   
   
You know, we have, roughly, 350 million people vaccinated \[doses
administered\] in the United States and billions around the world, and
virtually no one has died because of that vaccinations.  But even so,
the impact is going to be very different than what happened last
January.  
   
Today, about 400 people will die because of the Delta variant in this
country — a tragedy because virtually all of these deaths were
preventable if people had gotten vaccinated.   
   
But seven months ago today, almost 4,000 people died on that very day
from COVID-19.  Four thousand versus four hundred.  That shows how much
our vaccination progress has already done to protect us from the worst
of the new Delta COVID-19 wave.  
   
Likewise, the American Rescue Plan has given us the economic tools we
need to protect our recovery against the worst impacts of the Delta
virus: 1,400 checks into pockets — $1,400 checks into the pockets of
millions of American; help to keep folks in their homes; help to put
food on the table.  
   
Remember those long lines we used to talk about?  People lined up in
their cars for hours just to get a box of food put in their trunk.  
   
Help to small businesses so they could keep the lights on, their doors
open, and their employees on the job.  Because states were losing
revenue.  They were having to lay off essential workers.   
   
Well, the aid to states and cities and counties and Tribes, it kept
essential workers going — police officers, firefighters, educators on
the job.   
   
Funding for schools to reopen, and ventilation systems, sanitation
services, protective equipment to keep students and staff safe.  
   
And as we vaccinated America, we developed our economic tools to help
our economy recover.   As a result, in the past three months, we’ve
created, on average, 832,000 new jobs per month since sworn in.  That’s
compared to five thou- — 50,000 jobs in the last three months of the
previous administration.  
   
Look, even so, my message today is not one of celebration.  It’s one to
remind us we got a lot of hard work left to be done, both to beat the
Delta variant and to continue our advance of economic recovery.  We all
know what it starts with.  As I’ve said again and again, this is a
pandemic of the unvaccinated.  So we have to get more people
vaccinated.  
   
I said well over — what’s the number again?  I have to remind myself —
350 million Americans have already been vaccinated \[doses have been
administered\].  They’re doing fine.  
   
I’m pleased to report that, the past week, we’ve seen the first-time
vaccinations in America go up by 4 million people getting vac- — 4
million shots.  That’s more than we’ve seen in a long time.   
   
I want to thank the governors.  I listened to the governor of Maryland
today on the — on the television.  He’s doing a heck of a job. 
Democratic governors as well, Republican governors — they’re getting the
word out.

Look, as you all know, I’ve put in place new incentives and requirements
to encourage vaccinations.  For example, federal workers will be asked
to attest to their vaccination status.  Anyone who does not attest or is
not vaccinated will be required to wear a mask no matter where they
work, test one or two times a week, socially distance, and generally
will not be allowed to travel for work.  
   
There will be more to come in the days ahead.  And once again, I want to
thank the local leaders and the private sector leaders who are imposing
vaccine requirements.  
   
America can beat the Delta variant, just as we beat the original
COVID-19.  We can do this.  So wear a mask where recommended.  Get
vaccinated today.  All of that will save lives, and it means we’re not
going to have the same kind of economic damage we’ve seen when COVID-19
began.  
   
But we aren’t stopping there.  The American Rescue Plan was built
knowing the recovery would take time and that there’d be ups and
downs.  
   
So, let me outline today six specific actions people will see over the
next few weeks to make sure that we fight the Delta variant and wait for
the new vaccinations to be finished and keep our economy strong.  
   
First, thanks to the latest middle-class tax cut in a long time, the
next monthly check — that is the Child Tax Credit — in the next month —
next nine days, checks are going — all going out to almost 40 million
families with children — in nine days, beginning next month — the middle
of this month, I should say.  
   
On August 15th, for example, a family with two young kids under the age
of seven is going to get a check for $600 paid immediately.  And they’ll
get a check next week — next month for $600, et cetera.  If you’re a
family with two kids between the ages of 7 and 17, you’re getting a
check for $500 — $250 per child.  And that will continue month after
month.  
   
Second, I’ve looked ahead — we’ve looked ahead, and now schools have the
resources they need to safely re-open as the schoolyear starts again so
that every child can be in school full time, safe, in this year.  
   
Third, we provided, months ago, states and localities with $45 billion
in their coffers — the state and localities — to help renters and
landlords to keep people in their homes and keep their local economy
strong.  That money has to get out now.  I’m urging all local
(inaudible) to get that money out.  
   
And we’re going to send more help to small businesses on Main Street so
the Delta variant doesn’t cause them to lay off employees and shutter
their doors.   
   
There’s something called the Paycheck Protection Program.  It’s a loan
program — forgivable if a small business kept their employees on the job
and their doors open.  We’re now in the process to forgive those loans
for small businesses who are doing the right thing, putting them in a
better position to keep their businesses going.  
   
Fifth, if anyone is worried about getting health insurance during the
pandemic, there’s help today.  For those who get their health insurance
through the Affordable Care Act, we’re covering more people with more
extensive benefits, with premiums that average 40 percent lower.  If you
don’t have insurance, you can still sign up under the Affordable Care
Act through August the 15th.  Just go to HealthCare.gov today.  
   
And sixth, we’re going to lower the prices on everything from
prescription drugs to hearing aids by allowing businesses to compete,
which will give them more choices at lower costs.  
   
For example: You’re not going to have to go to a doctor to get a
prescription to get a hearing aid.  You’re going to go right to the
counter of the store and buy it over the counter.  
   
The bottom line is this: What we are doing is working.  But don’t take
my word for it.  Forecasters on Wall Street project: Over the next 10
years, our economy will expand by trillions of dollars and will create 2
million more jobs a year — good-paying jobs.  
   
But we just have to keep going.  And it’s simple.  That means: Get
vaccinated, please.  It’s safe.  It works.  It will save lives and maybe
save your life.  As I’ve said before, this is a pandemic of the
unvaccinated.  So, please, get vaccinated.  
   
We can get this done.  We just have to stay the course.  And we just
have to remember who we are.  You’ve heard me say it before: We’re the
United States of America.  There’s not a single thing — nothing — beyond
our capacity when we do it together.   
   
God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops.  And have a good
weekend.  Thank you.
