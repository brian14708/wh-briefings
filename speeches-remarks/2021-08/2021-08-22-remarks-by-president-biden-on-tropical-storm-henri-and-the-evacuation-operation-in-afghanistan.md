title: "Remarks by President\_Biden on Tropical Storm Henri and the Evacuation Operation\
  \ in\_Afghanistan"

Roosevelt Room

4:19 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  After a series of meetings throughout
the weekend with my national security team, I want to update the
American people on our ongoing evacuation operation in Afghanistan.  
   
But first, I just was briefed by the FEMA Administrator, who is here
with me today — Ms. Criswell — about the flash flooding in Waverly,
Tennessee, and surrounding areas in Tennessee.  
    
I want to begin by expressing my deepest condolences for the sudden and
tragic loss of life due to this flash flood.  
   
I know we’ve reached out to the community and we stand ready to offer
them support.  I’ve asked the Administrator to speak to Governor Lee of
Tennessee right away, and we will offer any assistance they need for
this terrible moment.  
   
Let me also say a few words about what is — what is now Tropical Storm —
not hurricane — Henri, which made landfall at approximately 12:15 this
afternoon in Rhode Island.  
   
Henri is impacting much of the Northeast right now, and I want to talk
about our efforts to prepare and respond to this storm.  
   
We have been closely monitoring Henri’s progress and making the
necessary preparations.  Fortunately, it’s no longer a hurricane; it’s
been downgraded to a tropical storm.  And we are taking it seriously,
though, because of the size and the storm’s surge and the rainfall it’s
producing.  It’s also — it’s also impacting an area of the country that
has already experienced heavy rainfall over the past several days.  
   
And while New Englanders are used to dealing with some tough weather,
this storm has the potential for widespread consequences across the
region, with significant flooding and power outages that could affect
hundreds of thousands of people.  
   
And so, we’re doing everything we can now to help these states prepare,
respond, and recover.  
   
I can’t think of anyone better to lead this operation than — than Deanne
Criswell of the — of FEMA.  She’s — before she headed up FEMA, she led
the emergency response in New York City, and she was one of the key
federal officials leading our response to Superstorm — Superstorm
Sandy.  She knows this area very, very well and knows what is needed
better than anyone.  
   
Yesterday, I talked with the Administrator and each of the governors in
the key states most likely to be affected.  I urged them to take
advantage of the assistance FEMA can offer in advance and committed to
doing everything we can to support their communities through the storm
and afterwards.  
   
FEMA has already pre-positioned resources in the region to speed our
ability to respond, including food, water, and lifesaving communications
equipment, as well as generators.  
   
In close cooperation with the electrical sector, preparations are in
place to address significant power outages.  And resources and support
is staged at the edge of this storm to be able to move quickly in to
help.  
   
Thousands of additional line crews and vegetation-clearing crews from
other states and from Canada are already heading toward the impacted
states in New England, ready to serve as — move in as soon as it’s
feasible.   
   
They’ll clean up fallen trees, help local utilities repair damaged
lines, and restore electrical service as fast as possible.  
   
I want to thank these crews for their commitment to helping their fellow
citizens in time of need.  
   
I’ve already approved — I’ve already approved emergency declarations for
Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New York, which activates funds and means
we can — we can get in there and help as soon as this extreme weather
has moved through.  
   
We don’t know the full extent of the storm’s impact today, but we are
acting to prepare for and prevent damage as much as possible, and to
speed help to affected communities so they can recover as quickly as
possible.  
   
I also want to encourage everyone to do their part to prepare.  Follow
the guidance from their local authorities.  Some places have already had
heavy rains and winds and dangerous storm surges.   
   
Henri is going to continue to move across much of the Northeast, so it
is important to monitor it closely and be prepared in your home and your
community.  Make sure you have the supplies for your entire household,
including necessary medications and food, water, battery-powered radios
in case of extended power hour outera — power outages.   
   
And don’t forget that you may need to seek shelter while you’re battling
the Delta vir- — variant and the COVID-19.  So, wear a mask and try to
observe social distancing.  
   
And to everyone across the country, don’t get caught by the next storm. 
Get vaccinated.  Get vaccinated now.  Protect yourself and your family
against COVID-19.  It’s going to be a vital part of emergency
preparedness this year — for the remainder of this year.  
   
Now, let me turn to Afghanistan.  
   
I’ve continued to make progress since I spoke to you on Friday.  We have
moved thousands of people each day by U.S. military aircraft and
civilian charter flights.  
   
A little over 30 hours — in a little over 30 hours this weekend, we’ve
evacuated an extraordinary number of people, as I will detail in a
minute: about 11,000 individuals.  That number will change day to day as
the air and ground operations in Kabul vary.   
   
Our first priority in Kabul is getting American citizens out of the
country as quickly and as safely as possible.  At my direction, the
State Department continues to reach out to the remaining Americans we
have identified by phone, e-mail, and other means to ascertain their
whereabouts and their plans.   
   
We’re executing a plan to move groups of these Americans to safety and
to safely and effectively move them to the airport compound.   
   
For security reasons, I’m not going to go into the detail of what these
plans entail, but I will say again today that I have said before: Any
American who wants to get home will get home.  
   
We’ve also been evacuating the citizens of our NATO Allies and our
partners, including their diplomats, their embassy staff who remain in
Afghanistan and to get them back to their homes as well.  
   
And as we do this, we’re also working to move our Afghan allies, who
stood with us side by side, and other vulnerable Afghans such as women
leaders and journalists, out of the country.  
   
As of this morning, we have evacuated nearly 28,000 people since August
the 14th, on both U.S. and coalition aircraft, including civilian
charters, bringing the total number of people we have evacuated since
July to approximately 33,000 persons.  
   
In one 24-hour period this weekend, 23 U.S. military flights — including
14 C-17s, 9 C-130 flights — left Kabul carrying 3,900 passengers.  We
see no reason why this tempo will not be kept up.  
   
During the same period, our military facilitated another 35 charter
flights carrying an additional nearly 4,000 evacuees to other countries
that are taking — that are taking them out.  
   
Altogether, we lifted approximately 11,000 people out of Kabul in less
than 36 hours.  It’s an incredible operation.  
   
Let me be clear: The evacuation of thousands of people  
from Kabul is going to be hard and painful no matter when it started and
when we began.  It would have been true if we had started a month ago or
a month from now.  There is no way to evacuate this many people without
pain and loss, of heartbreaking images you see on television.  It’s just
a fact.  My heart aches for those people you see.   
   
We are proving that we can move, though, thousands of people a day out
of Kabul.  We’re bringing our citizens, NATO Allies, Afghanis who had
helped — in fact, has helped us in the war effort.  But we have a long
way to go, and a lot could still go wrong.   
   
But to move out 30,000 people in just over a week, that’s a great
testament to the men and women on the ground in Kabul and our armed
services.  
   
It also reflects a tireless diplomatic effort.  In order to keep a
steady flow of planes taking off from Kabul and maximize our evacuation
capacity, we have quickly stood up an unprecedented global effort and
established a series of processing stations in third countries.  
   
In short, we’re not flying them directly to their country, we’re flying
to these processing stations where we’re working with more than two
dozen countries across four continents.  
   
I’ve secured agreements — we’ve secured agreements with the Gulf, Ce- —
excuse me — across the Gulf, in Central Asia, and in Europe, including
processing centers in Qatar, Germany, Kuwait, Spain, and elsewhere that
allows us to sort and process these evacuees.  
   
This transit — these transit centers provide a safe place for the SIV
applicants and other vulnerable Afghanis and their families to complete
their paperwork while we conduct security screenings and background
checks before they continue on to their final destination in the United
States or in another country — one of our NATO Allies, as well.  
   
And so, from Asia to Africa, from Europe to Western — to the Western
Hemisphere, nations are making generous offers to support resettlements
efforts.   
   
And I’ve been in personal contact with the leaders of many countries,
including Qatar, Germany, Spain, Italy, the UAE, and others — they’re
making vital contributions — to thank them for their support and to
discuss how we can continue to coordinate our efforts in Afghanistan,
moving forward.  It’s the reason why I continue in contact with them.  
   
And I want to, again, thank all of our partners for their continued —
continuing to stand together.  
   
We’ve also activated the first stage of what’s referred to as the “Civil
Reserve Air Fleet” to help with the onward movement of evacuees from
these transit centers.  Our military aircraft and others will get them
to these centers, but then we’re going to get the Civil Reserve Fleet —
it’s a program that’s designed — that was designed in the wake of the
Berlin Airlift after World War Two — to use commercial aircraft to
augment our airlift capacity.  This is a voluntary program for our
commercial airlines, and we’re grateful for those airlines and the U.S.
carriers who are supporting this.  
   
This effort will only use three or four planes from each of the major
carriers’ vast fleet of aircraft, so there should be no effect, or a
minimal effect, on commercial air travel.  And we’ll stay in close
coordination with our partners to mitigate any impact.  
   
These Civil Reserve flights will be helping facilitate  
the safe movement of people from staging locations and transit centers,
like Qatar and Germany, to the United States or to a third country. 
None of them will be landing in Kabul.  Now, the American aircraft part
of this will not be going to any country but the United States.   
   
As this effort unfolds, I want to be clear about three things.   
   
One, planes taking off from Kabul are not flying directly to the United
States.  They’re landing at U.S. military bases and transit centers
around the world.  
   
Number two, at these sites where they’re landing, we are conducting
thorough scrutiny — security screenings for everyone who is not a U.S.
citizen or a lawful permanent resident.  Anyone arriving in the United
States will have undergone a background check.  
   
Number three, once screened and cleared, we will welcome these Afghans,
who helped us in the war effort over the last 20 years, to their new
home in the United States of America.  Because that’s who we are. 
That’s what America is.     
   
You know, I’ve been touched by the outpouring of support  
that we’ve seen from communities and organizations across America
mobilizing to support these efforts.  
   
So many of these Afghans stood bravely by U.S. troops in Afghanistan. 
And now the United States, including veterans groups, refugee
resettlement agencies, religious organizations, and so many others, are
standing with our Afghan allies.  It exemplifies the best of America.  
   
And I want to say, again, just how difficult this mission is and how
dangerous — the dangers it poses to our troops on the ground.   
   
The security environment is changing rapidly.  There are civilians
crowded at the airport, although we have cleared thousands of them.  We
know that terrorists may seek to exploit this situation and target
innocent Afghans or American troops.  
   
They’re maintaining constant vigilance to mon- — we’re maintaining the
constant vigilance to monitor and disrupt threats from any source,
including the likely source being ISIS — ISIS-K, the Afghan affiliate
referred to as “ISIS-K.”  But we are under no illusions about the
threat.  
   
I said on Friday, ISIS-K is a sworn enemy of the Taliban, and they have
a history of fighting one another.  But every day we have troops on the
ground, these troops and innocent civilians at the airport face the risk
of attack from ISIS-K from a distance, even though we’re moving back the
perimeter significantly.  
   
We’re working hard and as fast as we can to get people out.  That’s our
mission.  That’s our goal.  And our determination to get every American
citizen home and to evacuate our Afghan allies is unwavering.  
   
We continue to see not only enor- — the enormous scope and scale of the
effort, we will see the individual lives that are affected.  The
families that are desperate to get home to their loved ones in America. 
The communities of veterans who have mobilized to try and help their
former interpreters get to safety.  The frightened Afghans who aren’t
sure what to do.  
   
To state the obvious, it’s heartbreaking.  We’re all seeing it.  We see
it.  We feel it.  You can’t look at it and not feel it.   
   
Nothing about this effort is easy, but the women and men of the United
States Armed Forces are acting bravely and with professionalism and with
a basic human copassio- — compassion.   
   
I want to offer my profound thanks to our service members on the ground
in Kabul, and to all those at U.S. bases around the world who are
welcoming and caring — and caring for these evacuees.  
   
And to all the diplomats and civil servants who are working around the
clock to rescue American citizens, the citizens of our Allies, our
Afghan partners, vulnerable Afghans — such as women leaders and
journalists — what we are doing is extraordinary, and you have to think
of the — of all they’re doing.  It’s thanks to the people who, from all
over the world, who are helping this effort.  
   
I just want to thank you, and I’ll keep you informed every day as we
move forward.  
   
May God protect our troops and our diplomats and — who are serving in
harm’s way.  
   
Now I’ll take a few questions.   
   
Darlene, from the Associated Press.  
   
Q    Mr. President —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  
   
Q    Thank you.  We’re nine days away from the August 31st deadline. 
Will you extend that deadline?  Or what — what is your thought process
on extending the evacuation operations?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  There’s discussions going on among us and the military
about extending.  Our hope is we will not have to extend, but there are
going to be discussions, I suspect, on how far along we are in the
process.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Mario Parker, Bloomberg.  
   
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  Just to piggyback off the August 31st
deadline, you told the G7 in Cornwall — you promised them support, back
in June.  If they ask for a larger — or a longer American presence past
the August 31st deadline, what will you tell them on Tuesday, sir?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I will tell them that we’ll see what we can do.  Look,
we are working closely with the G7.  I’ve spoken with most of the
leaders of G7.  I’ll be doing a conference with them, I think, Tuesday —
I’m not certain — and we’ll have that discussion.   
   
But we are — we already have helped get out diplomats from other
countries.  We’ve already helped get out citizens from other countries,
and we’ll continue to do that.  
   
Q    And, Mr. President, it sounded like that the — you’ve extended
operations into Kabul, outside of the airport.  Is that correct?   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  What I’m not going to do is talk about the tactical
changes we’re making to make sure we maintain as much security as we
can.   
   
We have constantly — how can I say it? — increased rational access to
the airport, where more folk can get there more safely.  It’s still a
dangerous operation.   
   
But I don’t want to go into the detail of how we’re doing that.  
   
Andrew from the Wall Street Journal.  
   
Q    Thanks, Mr. President.  Our reporting on the ground shows that
Afghans with the proper paperwork are still having trouble getting to
the airport.  Some say they feel abandoned by the U.S.  U.S. embassy
staff still haven’t — some U.S. embassy staff that are Afghan haven’t be
able to — haven’t been able to make it into the airport as well.  Why
isn’t the U.S. doing more to allow Afghans into the airport — to ensure
access to the airport?  And are you still opposed to setting up an
extended perimeter around the airport to help ease that access?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Number one, I think you’re going to see they’re going to
get out.   
   
Number two, we have made a number of changes, including extending the
access around the airport and in the safe zone.  And we’ve done a number
of things, again, I don’t want to get into detail about.  
   
But the fact is that more and more of the groups we urgently want to get
out of Afghanistan, starting with American citizens and the folks who
worked in the embassies and personnel with our allies, as well as the
Afghans who helped them and worked in those embassies, as well as those
who helped them on the battlefield as well — we are working diligently
to make sure we’ve increased the ability to get them out.  We’ve changed
the gate operations and a whole range of things.  And that’s why we’ve
been able to significantly increase the number of people we’re getting
out.  
   
Q    And will the Taliban agree to an extension past August 31st?  Have
you discussed that with them?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  We’ve discussed a lot with the Taliban.  They’ve been
cooperative in extending some of the perimeter.  That remains to be seen
whether we ask that question.  
   
Ed, fire away.   
   
Q    Thanks, Mr. President.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t want you jumping over that (inaudible).  
   
Q   Just following up on Andrew’s question.  Because the United States
is now negotiating with the Taliban over airport access and such, do you
now trust them?  
   
And then a question on the public response.  A new poll, out today shows
Americans wanted to withdraw from Afghanistan, but they disapprove of
the way you’ve handled it.  The poll also found that based in part of
what transpired over the last week, a majority of Americans — and
forgive me, I’m just the messenger — no longer consider you to be
competent, focused, or effective at the job.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I haven’t seen that poll.  
   
Q    It’s out there, from CBS this morning.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  
   
Q    What would you say to those Americans who no longer believe that
you are doing the job?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Look, I had a basic decision to make: I either withdraw
America from a 20-year war that, depending on whose analyses you accept,
cost us $150 million a day for 20 years or $300 million a day for 20
years; who — and I — you know I carry this card with me every day — and
who — in fact, where we lost 2,448 Americans dead and 20,722 wounded. 
Either increase the number of forces we’d keep — we keep there and keep
that going, or I end the war.  And I decided to end the war.  
   
As I said the other day: You know, the only reason we were in
Afghanistan is this is the place from which bin Laden attacked the
United States of America.  Had this been in another Middle Eastern
country where he could have easily had moved from, we would have never
gone to Afghanistan.  
   
So, the question is, when is the right time to leave?  Where are our
national interests?  Where do they lie?   
   
And the idea that we are in a situation where we cannot recognize that
terrorism has metastasized around the world, and the need for us to
focus in other parts of the world which create an even greater danger of
an al Qaeda-like operation beginning, it can’t be ignored.  And we are,
as you well know — because you follow this — we are in a number of
places where we’re doing that without permanent basing American forces
there.   
   
So, I — I think when this is over, the American people will have a clear
understanding of what I did, why we did it.  
   
And — but, look, that’s the job.  My job is to make judgments.  My job
is to make judgments no one else can or will make.  I made them.  I’m
convinced I’m absolutely correct in not deciding to send more young
women and men to war, for a war that, in fact, is no longer
warranted.   
   
Q    On the question of the Taliban though, do you have a — do you trust
them now?  Do you have (inaudible)?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t trust anybody, including you.  I love you, but,
you know, there’s not a lot of people I trust to —  
   
Look, the Taliban has a — the Taliban has to make a fundamental
decision: Is the Taliban going to attempt to be able to unite and
provide for the wellbeing of the people of Afghanistan, which no one
group has ever done since before dealing — for hundreds of years.  And
if it does, it’s going to need everything from additional help, in terms
of economic assistance, trades, and a whole range of things.   
   
The Taliban has said — we’ll see whether they mean it or not — they’re
seeking legitimacy.  They’re seeking legitimacy to determine whether or
not they will be recognized by other countries.  
   
They have told other countries, as well as us, they don’t want us to
move our diplomatic presence completely.  But they — so, all of this is
all just talk now.  All just talk now.   
   
And so, so far, the Taliban has not taken action against U.S. forces. 
So far, they have, by and large, followed through what they said, in
terms of allowing Americans to pass through, and the like.   
   
And I’m sure they don’t control all of their forces.  It’s a ragtag
force.  And so, we’ll see.  We’ll see whether or not what they say turns
out to be true.  
   
But the bottom line is this, folks: Look, at the end of the day, if we
didn’t leave Afghanistan now, when do we leave?  Another 10 years? 
Another five years?  Another year?   
   
I’m not about to send your son or your daughter to fight in
Afghanistan.  I don’t see where that is in our overwhelming interest.   
   
And to talk about how our interests are going to be impacted: Let me
tell you, you’re sitting in Beijing or you’re sitting in Moscow — are
you happy we left?  (Laughs.)  They’d love nothing better for us to
continue to be bogged down there, totally occupied with what’s going
on.   
   
So, the idea this is — I think that history is going to record this was
the logical, rational, and right decision to make.   
   
So, thank you all so very much.  Thank you.  
   
Q    Do you support the sanctions against the Taliban?  The British are
— the British are calling for sanctions.  They’re going to discuss
sanctions on Tuesday.  Would you support sanctions against the Taliban
under certain conditions?  On Friday, you mentioned “harsh conditions”
if they misbehaved.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  The answer is “yes.”  It depends on the conduct.   
   
Thanks.
