THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Thank you, Vice President Harris.   
   
Folks, not even during the Civil War did insurrectionists breach the
Capitol of the United States of America, the citadel of our democracy —
not even then.  But on January the 6th, 2021, they did.  They did.   
   
A mob of extremists and terrorists launched a violent and deadly assault
on the People’s House and the sacred ritual to certify a free and fair
election.   
   
It wasn’t dissent.  It wasn’t debate.  It wasn’t democracy.  
   
It was insurrection.  It was riot and mayhem.  It was radical and
chaotic.  And it was unconstitutional.  And maybe most important, it was
fundamentally un-American — an existential threat and a test of whether
our democracy could survive, whether it could overcome lies and overcome
the fury of a few who were seeking to thwart the will of the many.  
   
But while the attack on our values and our votes shocked and saddened
the nation, our democracy did survive.  It did.  Truth defeated lies. 
We did overcome.  
   
And that’s because of the women and men of the U.S. Capitol Police, the
Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, and other law
enforcement officials who we honor today.  
   
Speaker Pelosi, who led the effort in the House; Senators Klobuchar and
Blunt, the co-sponsors of the legislation in the Senate; and to all my
colleagues — Pat Leahy and House members as well that are here: Thank
you.  Thank you.    
   
Today, I’m signing into law the bill you sent me that awards the
Congressional Gold Medal to the United States Capitol Police, the
Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, and other law
enforcement for their service in defense of our democracy on January the
6th.  
   
To all of them, on behalf of a grateful nation, thank you, thank you,
thank you for protecting our Capitol.  Maybe even more importantly, for
protecting our Constitution and saving the lives of duly elected members
of the Senate and the House and their staffs.    
   
In these moments when we’re still debating — these were tragic hours
back then — you stood in the breach.  You did your duty — a duty to
defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.  The events that transpired were surprising but
not your character or your courage, Chief, and all your men and
women.   
   
I didn’t grow up with any of you, but I know you.  You’re just like all
the women and men I grew up with — particularly, at that time, it was
men — in Scranton and Claymont, places where — the neighborhood I lived
in — you became a cop, a firefighter, or a priest.  (Laughter.)  I
wasn’t qualified for any of them — (laughter) — so here I am. 
(Laughter.)  
   
But, look, all kidding aside, I got to know you.  You’re the same ones,
after a ballgame in a visiting field, that come walking out of the gym
if you won, and you may get jumped by the other team or their
supporters.  You may be all by yourself — the only one standing there
when you watch six people jump one of our teammates.  What the hell
would you do?  You’d jump in.  You’d jump in, knowing you’re going to
get the hell beat of you too.   
   
Police officers are not what you do; it’s who you are.   
   
I got to know you after 36 years in the Senate, 8 years as Vice
President.  You’re always there.  
   
It’s not a joke.  It’s not some hyperbole to suggest “duty, honor,
service.”  That’s who you are.  That’s who your dad was.  It’s who your
dad was.   
   
And America owes you a debt we can never fully repay.  
   
But I know receiving this award is bittersweet.  On that day, more than
140 law enforcement officers suffered physical injuries, an untold
number suffering emotional toll.  Fifteen of you were hospitalized and
others were lost forever.  May their souls rest in peace and rise in
glory.  
   
I know each time you put on that shield in the morning or whenever you
show for work, your families wonder whether they’re going to get a call
that day — a call they don’t want to receive — hoping you come home
safely.   
   
And it breaks my heart.  It breaks the heart of the nation to remember
that you were assaulted by thousands of violent insurrectionists at the
Capitol of the United States of America.  
   
Jill and I would never have thought we’d have to join you in the Capitol
Rotunda not once, but twice.  Once to hiron \[sic\] — to honor Officer
Brian Sicknick, who lost his life.  And a second time to honor Officer
Billy Evans, who lost his defending the Capitol as well.  Both gave the
full measure of their devotion to the country at the United States
Capitol.  
   
Their families are here today.  I know from similar — (applause) — yes,
we should clap for the families.  (Applause.)  I know, like others may
know, from personal experience, getting that phone call.  It’s nice to
be honored and have those who you lost remembered, but it’s tough to be
here because it brings back everything like it happened 10 minutes
ago.  
   
So, I offer you not only our condolences, but recognize your courage,
the courage of your children.  And you have our most profound
gratitude.  
   
You know, the fallen, in my view, are casualties of a struggle,
literally, for the soul of America — a struggle that they didn’t start,
a struggle we didn’t seek, and a struggle that, by the grace of God,
we’ll win.  
   
As I said, I know this is a bittersweet moment.  As proud of Brian and
Billy as you are, it still brings back pain — the moment it happened.  
   
And also, we also offer our prayers to the families of the Capitol
Police Officer, Howard Liebengood.  Those who have been around a while,
we knew his dad.  We knew his dad well.  He was Secretary of the United
States — Sergeant of Arms of the United States Senate.  
We also pray for the families of the Metro Police Officer, Jeffrey
Smith.   
   
For anyone out there facing trauma, for anyone still struggling, please
know there is help available.  
   
My fellow Americans, the tragedy of that day deserves the truth above
all else.  We cannot allow history to be rewritten.  We cannot allow the
heroism of these officers to be forgotten.  
   
We have to understand what happened — the honest and unvarnished truth. 
We have to face it.  That’s what great nations do, and we are a great
nation.  
   
In the past weeks and months, we’ve heard the officers themselves — some
of whom are here today — describe what happened: the threats, the
violence, the savageness.  
   
When asked what he was fighting for, Officer Hodges, who is here today,
stated it eloquently — one word: “Democracy.”  
   
My fellow Americans, let’s remember what this was all about.  It was a
violent attempt to overturn the will of the American people; to seek
power at all costs; to replace the ballot with brute force; to destroy,
not to build.  
   
Without democracy, nothing is possible.  With it, everything is.  
   
So, my fellow Americans, we must all do our part to perfect — perfect
and to preserve our democracy.  It requires people of goodwill and
courage to stand up to the hate, the lies, the extremism that led to
this vicious attack.  
   
It requires all of us working together — Democrats, Republicans,
independents — on behalf of the common good to restore decency, honor,
and respect for our system of government.  
   
And above all, it requires all of us to remember who we are at our best
as a nation, as we see in the law enforcement officers who are here
today — the best of our nation.  
   
The Congressional Gold Medal awards today will be housed in four
locations.  Two medals will be displayed at the U.S. Capitol Police
Department in Washing- — and the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police
Department so that every morning, as you officers walk by, seeing those
medals, they’ll remember the heroism of their colleagues and the
importance of their work.  
   
The third medal will be displayed at the Smithsonian Museum with a
plaque honoring all law enforcement that protected the Capitol on
January 6th, so all visitors can understand what happened that day.  
   
And the fourth one will be displayed at the Capitol itself, to remind
all who served and currently serve there and all who visit the honor and
the service of those who protect and preserve all of us.  
   
I will now ask Speaker Pelosi, if she’s able — not able, willing —
(laughter) — and Senator Klobuchar and Senator Blunt, Chief Contee and
Chief Manger, and the other officers here today to join me as I sign
this bill into law.  
   
May God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops and all those who
serve watch over our democracy.  
   
(The bill is signed.)
