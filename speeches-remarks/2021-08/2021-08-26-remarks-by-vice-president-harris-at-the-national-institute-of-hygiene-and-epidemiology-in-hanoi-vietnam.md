National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology  
Hanoi, Vietnam

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, I — first of all, I want to thank the
Vietnamese — your Office of Health and Hygiene that’s, obviously, a lot
of work to do.  And as I’ve mentioned, we as the United States are very
thankful to the Vietnamese for coming through when we needed support
early on in the pandemic; I think was about April of 2020.  We needed
help with PPEs, and Vietnam sent them.   
  
We have already donated 5 million, and this now is a delivery of an
additional 1 million, for 6 million doses of the vaccine.  This is
probably one of the — if not the number one issue, in terms of a
challenge facing Vietnam right now.    
  
And this donation, and it is a donation — there are no strings attached;
it is free — is an expression of America’s support to Vietnam and the
Vietnamese people.  And this is on top of the 500 million doses of
vaccines that President Biden has pledged that we will send around the
world.  This is, obviously, what is morally right to do.  And it is,
obviously, also a public health issue, and really speaks to the
importance of the relationships and the partnerships that we have as
Americans around the world when it comes to dealing with this crisis,
which is the global health crisis.  
  
So, we’re very proud to see that this delivery has made it here and will
get into the arms of the Vietnamese people.
