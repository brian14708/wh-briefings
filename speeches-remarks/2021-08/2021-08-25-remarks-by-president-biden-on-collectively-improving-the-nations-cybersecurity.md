THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you all for being here to discuss the core
national security challenge we’re facing, the American people are
facing, and — and our economy is facing with cybersecurity.   
  
We’ve seen time and again how the technologies we rely on — from our
cell phones to pipelines, to the electric grid — can become targets of
ha- — hackers and criminals.   
  
At the same time, our skilled cybersecurity workforce has not grown fast
enough to keep pace.  We’re about — the estimates many of you have given
us and we’ve concluded are — on our own — about a half a million
cybersecurity jobs remain unfilled.   
  
That’s a challenge, but it also is a real opportunity.  And I’ve made it
— this a priority for my administration from the outset.   
  
And in May, I issued an executive order to modernize our defenses and
improve our federal government’s cybersecurity.  Because of that order,
government will only buy tech products that meet certain cybersecurity
standards, which will have a ripple effect across the software industry,
in our view, ultimately improving security for all Americans.  
  
We’ve launched a 100-day initiative to improve cybersecurity across the
electric sector.  That initiative has already resulted in more than 150
utilities that serve 90 million Americans being deployed.  And we’re
committing to deploy cybersecurity technologies that are — that are
extending that initiative as — to gas pipelines as well, next.  That’s
where we’re going.  
  
And because cybersecurity is a global issue, we’ve also rallied G7
countries to hold nations who harbor ransomware criminals
accountable.   
  
And, I might add, I had a — a summit with Vladimir Putin and made it
clear to him that we expected him to hold them accountable as well,
because they know where they are and who they are.  But that’s another
issue we will not be discussing so much today.   
  
We updated NATO cyber policy for the first time in seven years.  And
today, my team is hosting a meeting, bringing together 30 of the nations
— 30 nations to step up in their fight against ransomware.   
  
But the reality is, most of our critical infrastructure owned and
operated — is owned and operated by the private sector, and the federal
government can’t meet this challenge alone.  
  
So I’ve invited you all here today because you have the power, the
capacity, and the responsibility, I believe, to raise the bar on
cybersecurity.   
  
And so, ultimately, we got a lot of work to do.   And thank you all very
much.  And thank the press for being here.  We’re going to go private
now.  
  
Q    Mr. President, if Americans are still in Afghanistan after the
deadline, what will you do?  Sir, what will you do if Americans are
still there after the deadline?  No?  Okay.  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  You’ll be the first person I’ll call.  
  
Q    Please call them.
