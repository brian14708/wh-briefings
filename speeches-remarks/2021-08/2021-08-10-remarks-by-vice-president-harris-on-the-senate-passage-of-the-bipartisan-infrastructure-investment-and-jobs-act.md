title: Remarks by Vice President Harris on the Senate Passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure
  Investment and Jobs Act

East Room

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Please have a seat.  Good
afternoon, everyone.   
  
The President has been clear that every day, in every way, our
administration will work on behalf of the American people.   
  
And this has been true as we delivered historic relief through the
American Rescue Plan to families and small businesses, as we continue
the fight to pass legislation to protect and strengthen the sacred right
to vote, and as we continue the work to strengthen our nation’s care
economy.   
  
And this is true today, because today we move one step closer to making
a once-in-a-generation investment in our nation’s infrastructure. 
Today, Democrats, independents, and Republicans in the United States
Senate passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.   
  
So, let me describe just a little bit about why this bill is so
important.  It is an investment in the roads and bridges we drive on
every day to get our kids to school.  It is an investment in the public
transit we rely on to get to work.  It will mean people in our nation
won’t have to drink water from lead pipes or go to a fast food parking
lot to get high-speed Internet.   
  
This bill will also establish a national network of electric vehicle
chargers — the President has been fighting for for a long time — and
build toward a national fleet of electric school buses.   
  
And the way I see it: An investment in infrastructure, it provides
people with what they need to get where they need to go.  This bill that
passed the Senate today gives people what they need to get where they
need to go.   
  
And it will do that while also creating millions of good union jobs for
our nation’s workers.  It will do that while also helping our nation’s
businesses compete worldwide.   
  
And so, just so we are clear: We are not going to raise middle-class
taxes to pay for it, because that’s what the President promised and that
is what we must deliver.  
  
This afternoon, I was proud to preside over the Senate vote.  And I want
to thank the senators who worked together to pass this bill.  I also
thank the members of the House, who will now work to get this bill to
the President’s desk.   
  
And, first and foremost, we would not be here today were it not for the
leadership of our President, Joe Biden.  Mr. President, from the very
start, you welcomed ideas, you welcomed debate, you welcomed Democrats
and independents and Republicans to meet with us in the Oval Office.   
  
In those meetings, I watched as you listened.  In those meetings, you
deliberated.  You were determined to bring all sides together and to
deliver real results for the people of our nation.   
  
And I know that even after this vote, our work will not stop.  Even when
you sign the bill into law, our work will not stop.  We will never stop
working on behalf of the American people.   
  
So, thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you.  Thank you.   
  
And now it is my great honor to introduce the President of the United
States, Joe Biden.
