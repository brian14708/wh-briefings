THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you so very, very much.  You know, I — I
know you have a sense of it, but I don’t think you’ll appreciate until
you get home how proud you made America — not just the winning more
medals than anyone, and you may end up with as many gold before this is
over as China.   
   
But here’s the deal: You really represented America.  You represented
the soul of the country, whether it was was — I mean, I thought when —
when you were getting knocked down by an — an opponent on track and you
ba- — you stop and then go back and pick him up and walk through the
finish line with him — come on.  That’s — that’s what America is
supposed to be about.  And you represented every single thing that we
stand for.  You really did.   
   
And I just think that — you know, look, it wasn’t just — for a lot of
the ath- — a lot of you, it wasn’t just your athletic ability; it was
your moral courage — the courage you showed, the courage of those who
were under real pressure and intellec- — and pressure — psychological
pressure and being able to, like — like what Katie Ledecky — what
Ledecky did.  She wasn’t under the pressure; she just went out and won. 
She just won everything that was in front of her.  And I — I don’t know
if she’s online — I can’t see her — but, Katie, if you’re on here, I
realize that you can probably swim a mile quicker than most people could
run a mile.  It’s just amazing all — just all you’ve done.   
   
And, you know, when we talk about — all of us — like Simone Biles.  I
mean, the courage you had to get back up on that beam after — at the
very end, and you still win the bronze.  I mean, you showed everything
about who we are as a people.   
   
And watching your families — watching your families was as exciting
almost as watching you guys.  I mean, they were  
overjoyed.  And they were — I mean — and — and I don’t think there’s
harder Olympics to get — get ready for.  You guys are — you know, you’re
— you practiced for four years.  You got ready and then COVID hit, and
you had to wait another year.   
   
And I just think you’re — I just can’t tell you how — you know, you
remind us of what an amazing country we are, and you make us look so
good as a country.  These are the things that people look at around the
world, more than anything that I do as your President or other people do
in public life.  They get the impression of who we are as Americans —
who we are.  And you’re — and you handled yourself with such grace and
such — such — such decency.  It just — you made me so damn proud.   
   
THE FIRST LADY:  And I — I wanted — I wanted to just say thank you for
the warm welcome that I received when I went to Tokyo.  And so I saw a
first: I saw the three-on-three basketball game.  Everything —
everything I saw, we won.  I was so — I was so happy.  And I saw the
soccer game, and I saw the swimming, and I saw softball.  And it was
just — I mean, it was so exciting just to watch — just to watch you
compete.   
   
And like Joe said, you did it with such dignity and grace with all that
you’ve been through these past few years — you know, the training and
waiting and waiting.   
   
And — and we just — you know, as the President and First Lady, I mean,
we just could not feel more proud of all of you and everything you did
in representing our country.  And the — and all Americans feel the exact
same way.   
   
When you come home, you’ll see everybody is glued to their TVs to see
what’s going to happen next.  And you made us proud, and I want to thank
you so much.   
   
And it was just great.  I couldn’t talk to a lot of you, but at least I
could wave from the sidelines and — and represent our country.   
   
So, thank you for the opportunity, for allowing me to — to be there to
represent you.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  And, by the way, the Japanese Prime Minister is a very
smart guy.  He’s a friend.  I know him.  But he asked Jill to come and
represent the country —  
   
THE FIRST LADY:  (Laughs.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  — not me.  So, you know, he really knows what he’s
doing.  He knows how to get things done.   
   
But I — I just can’t tell you, you all — you just made our hearts
swell.  Not a joke.  You restored the soul of America in so many ways. 
You really, really did.  That’s not hyperbole; that’s a fact.   
   
But I need a promise from all of you: You’ll all come see us in the
White House in the fall.  We’ll set a date you — and I’d love to have
you all come to the White House if you’re — if you’re willing to do
that, so the nation can see and I can brag more on you.   
   
And the amba- — you know, our ambassador to the United Nations is Linda
Thomas-Greenfield — was there.  But I just want you to know she’s got —
I don’t know, ju- — you’re just incredible.  I mean —  
   
THE FIRST LADY:  Can’t wait to see you.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  That’s a fact.  We’re probably keeping you
too long already.  But there’s about 10 events I’d like to talk about,
but I’ll wait until you get to the White House.  
   
MS. HIRSHLAND:  Well, thank you President Biden and First Lady Dr.
Biden.  And I’d love — I know we have so many of Team USA athletes on
the line, but I’d love to take just a moment and introduce you to — to
three special athletes.    
   
The first is track and field star, and four-time  
Olympian, Kara Winger, who will serve as our closing ceremony
flagbearer, carrying our flag as they march this evening to close the
ceremony.   
   
So, Kara, can I ask you — tell us how it feels to walk with the flag
tonight, to know that’s what’s coming up for you today.  
   
MS. WINGER:   I really — thank you, Sarah.  First of all, happy to be
here.  I really can’t even imagine still what it’s going to be like to
walk into that stadium with the flag.   
   
I’ve had more disappointment in my career than victory, and to be voted
on by this incredible Team USA for this honor is more amazing than I can
put into words.   
   
So just incredibly honored, very excited, really amazed that I get to
have this closure moment because these teammates voted for me in my last
Olympic Games since I’ve never been on that podium.  
   
But I’m so proud to represent them because it’s such an honor that they
chose me.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  They picked you because of your character, kid.  
   
THE FIRST LADY:  Yeah.  
   
MS. WINGER:   It’s — it’s wild.  It’s the biggest honor of my life.  I’m
so, so proud.  Yeah.  Thank you.  
   
MS. HIRSHLAND:  Wow, terrific.  Congratulations.  And — and, Mr.
President, I can vouch for her character.  You’re exactly right, she’s
an amazing woman.   
   
Let’s talk about someone else whose character is pretty extraordinary
and move to track and field athlete Isaiah Jewett.  Isaiah caught our
attention from his act of sportsmanship after being tripped in the
qualifying round of his 800-meter heat.  His moment of kindness is one
we will all remember.   
   
Isaiah, can you take us through a little bit about what happened?  
   
MR. JEWETT:  Hi, yes, of course.  First, I would love to — I just want
to address — love you guys.  Big fan — love what you’re doing.  I’d love
to come to the White House too.  Just want to throw that out there.   
   
But — (laughter) — in the — in terms of the race: I don’t know, I was
really feeling pretty good about the race and how I was executing, and I
felt like I was really into the zone.   
   
And then, as soon as I came into the turn, I felt a knee hit my foot,
and it made me trip over my leg.  And then, when I tried to recover, I
felt another foot hit me again.  And I knew, like, as soon as I got onto
the ground, like my dreams of getting to the final and placing were
done.   
   
And I felt kind of hurt for a second while I was laying down.  And I
actually looked at the other runner, and I saw how defeated he looked. 
And, for some reason, I just felt like, “In some way, I want to help
out.  In some way, like, this is — this is bigger than me.  Like, I know
that he’s been here a couple of times, and this is probably a couple of
his last ones.”   
   
But I just wanted to do whatever I could to say, like, “Hey, man, it’s
okay.  Let’s — let’s finish this race together.”  Like, I wanted to be
some type of hero and show that, you know — just some good sportsmanship
at the end of the day, because I felt like that’s what’s important —
like not dwelling on these thing — not dwelling on these problems that
happen, but finishing what we started and making sure everybody is
okay.   
   
Because at the end of the day, we’re all people and we all go through
the same nervousness and we all go through the same pains.  So might as
well finish what we started and just be happy that we’re actually here
in the moment because not a lot of people made it here.  
   
So, I was just so happy in the fact that I was able to be a hero to a
lot of people and even just be at the Olympic Games.  It’s just such a
blessing, even to be here talking to you guys.  It’s just such a
blessing meeting all you guys.  And sorry if I’m rambling on.  It’s just
so crazy being in the present —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Come on.  
   
MR. JEWETT:  — in the present moment of, like,  
this Olympics, like just seeing different people and competing and being
noticed.  And that’s what I really loved about being heard and being
shown, like, your true character.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Isaiah, let me say something.  
   
THE FIRST LADY:  He’s our — you are our hero.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  And, by the way, Isaiah — all kidding aside — America,
when it leads the world leads not by the example of our power, but by
the power of our example.  That’s the God’s truth, and you are an
epitome of that.  And we thank you for it.   We thank you for it.    
   
MR. JEWETT:  (Inaudible.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  On the power of our example.  I really mean it.  It had
profound impact around the world.  It really did.  
   
Thank you.  
   
MR. JEWETT:  Thank you.  
   
MS. HIRSHLAND:  Speaking of profound impact, our last athlete really
needs no introduction.  Simone Biles exemplifies what it means to be a
true Olympic champion.   
   
We have been blown away by Simone’s accomplishments in the gym, and are
now forever inspired and grateful to her for prioritizing mental health
and wellbeing, and continuing to serve as a role model for Team USA and
for the country.  
   
Simone, thank you for being here.  How does it feel to be home?  
   
MS. BILES:  Yes, hi.  It feels amazing to be home.  It’s been a long
journey.  The Olympics was not how I expected it to go, but putting my
mental and my physical health first will probably be one of my greatest
accomplishments.  
   
If you would’ve asked me in my younger years, I would have probably been
too stubborn.  But at that point, I knew that I just had to take a step
back, let the other girls go up and do their job.  And I’m very proud of
the way they handled everything, especially last minute with me having
to step back.  
   
But to have mental health be talked about more in sports is really nice
because, at the end of the day, we are humans before athletes.   
   
So, it is nice to be back home, though, yes.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you’ve set an example.  I really mean it, Simone. 
I mean — you know, one of the things that Mrs. Biden — Jill and I have
worked on is we work with a lot of soldiers who are coming home with
post-traumatic stress.  And they’re like you athletes.  They’re — you —
you never say no, you never give up, you never say you can’t do it, you
just keep going.   
   
MS. BILES:  Right.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  But — and so for — for a military person to say “I need
help” is incredibly, incredibly difficult, but it shouldn’t be.  It’s
just — it’s — it’s no different than if you broke your finger or broke
your arm or had a physical injury.   
   
And you’re one of the greatest athletes in the world.  You had the
courage — no, I really mean it.  I’m not — I’m not (inaudible).  
   
MS. BILES:  Thank you.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  You had the courage to say, “I need some help.  We need
some help.  I need some time.”  And you gave an example to everybody. 
And guess what?  You got back up on that damn beam.  And, by the way,
you know, what frightens me the most is the beam.  
   
MS. BILES:  Yes.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I — I always thought I was a pretty good athlete.  I was
a pretty good baseball and football player, and I — you know, in high
school.  My Walter Mitty dream was playing in the pros.  You think I’m
kidding.  I’m not.  I had to give it up because I — you know, I become
President.  What the hell?  I settled.  
   
MS. BILES:  (Laughs.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  But all kidding aside — all kidding aside, it was — it’s
just amazing to watch you all, and just to watch even those of you who
did not get involved in a particularly focused iss- — you know,
dilemma.  But just the way you treated one another.  Just the way you
could see it.   
   
I guess you knew the cameras were on you in all the events that are
watching you get in and out of the pool, on and off the track, on and
off the high — the parallel bar — the uneven parallel bar.  I mean, all
of it.   
   
But I’ll tell you what, doing a flip on a four-inch beam is my idea of
going to purgatory.  I’ll tell you —  
   
MS. BILES:  (Laughs.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  — I’ll try almost anything else before I try that. 
Anyway.  
   
THE FIRST LADY:  So, you brought us joy, and I think this country has
really been through just — you know, has needed healing.  And I think
that all the athletes in the games really brought Americans together and
brought us joy again.  And for that, I thank you.  
   
And I have to mention, I love that we have so many moms on the screen,
you know, holding their babies.  So that’s so great to see that too,
that — I think there are 10 moms who competed, so good for you.  Good
for you.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  God love you all.  
   
David, you could smile, man.  It’s okay.  David Hughes, I see you on the
— how come you haven’t smiled yet?   
   
THE FIRST LADY:  (Laughs.)  There you go.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  There you go.  Thank you, man.  You’re a hell of an
athlete.  You’re one hell of an athlete.   
   
Anyway, I should get going.  I can get myself in trouble here.  But I
(inaudible) in trouble for things I say, I know.  No one ever doubts I
mean what I say; the problem is I sometimes say all that I mean.   
   
Well, anyway.  But thank you, thank you for the joy, the pride, the hope
— the hope you gave us all.  That’s what you did, you gave people so
much hope.  Thank you.  
   
See you in the White House.   
   
THE FIRST LADY:  See you in the White House.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thanks.  
   
MS. HIRSHLAND:  Thank you so much for being with us.  
   
THE FIRST LADY:  Thanks.  Thanks, Sarah.  
   
MS. HIRSHLAND:  We’ll see you soon in the White House.  
   
THE FIRST LADY:  Yeah.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  We’re counting on it.
