THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Jill and I are — thank you for joining
us today.  And we’re — we have a special guest, as you can see to my
left here.  
  
And I’m thankful to our friends at the White House Historical
Association and the National Park Service for helping us deliver
thousands of commemorative eggs to vaccination sites in communities and
healthcare centers all across America.  
  
Easter is a day of joy, when we celebrate resurrection and renewal.  But
this year, we know many are still going without the familiar comforts of
the season.   
  
The virus is not gone, and the second year in a row most will be apart
from their families or friends and a full congregation to fill us with
so much joy.  But the Scripture tells us, “Joy cometh in the morning.”  
  
As we celebrate the renewal of this season, we know that longed-for dawn
is almost here.  We will rebuild our nation.  We will reengage and
reimagine what we can be.  We’ll remember that with faith, hope, and
love, anything is possible.  And we look forward to next year when the
White House will ring with joy the season once again and there’ll be an
Easter Egg Roll, God willing.  
  
May God bless you all.  May God protect our troops — and take care of
the Easter Bunny.  (Laughter.)  
  
Thank you all very, very much.
