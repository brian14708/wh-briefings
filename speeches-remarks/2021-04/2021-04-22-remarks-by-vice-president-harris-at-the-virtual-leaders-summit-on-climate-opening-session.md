     THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Your Excellencies, distinguished leaders, and
esteemed colleagues from around the world: Welcome to this historic
Leaders Summit on Climate.  
  
     I want to thank you for being here and for your leadership.  I have
spoken with a number of you about the climate crisis.  We have talked
about the scarcity of water, we have talked about the need to build
resilience, and we have talked about the importance of investing in
clean technologies.   
  
Together, of course, we come from very different places, but we share
this common concern and this common threat.  Here in the United States,
the storms hitting our Gulf Coast are worse every year.  The wildfires
in my home state of California have grown in intensity.  And, of course,
no nation or region is immune — whether it is Western Europe, where heat
waves have made it very difficult to stay indoors, while risking a
health risk; or the Pacific Islands, where rising sea levels threaten to
encroach on the land and homes of lifelong residents; or in Central
America, where, last year, two major hurricanes devastated entire
communities.   
  
     As a global community, it is imperative that we act quickly and
together to confront this crisis.  And this will require innovation and
collaboration around the world.  It will require the use of renewable
energy and new technologies.  And it will give each of our nations the
opportunity to build healthier communities and stronger economies.  
  
Here, we believe tackling climate change, improving communities, and
creating jobs can occur simultaneously.  And we must recognize the
importance, of course, of justice in the work that we do.  The
communities hardest hit by climate change are the same communities
harmed by wealth and gender inequality, toxic air pollution, and so much
more.  This truth holds around the world.  
  
So I urge all of us to focus on these communities, including indigenous
communities, and consider their insight and experience in our efforts
moving forward.  They are critical leaders in this fight.  
  
Friends, the health of our communities, the wellbeing of our workers,
and the strength of our economies depend on what we do now.  And I can
think of no one more committed to achieving our collective goals than
President Joe Biden.  
  
The President was one of the first members in the United States Congress
to take on the issue of climate change.  And on of first day in office,
he led the fact that we would rejoin the Paris Agreement.  And the
President is just getting started as we work to tackle this crisis while
creating clean energy jobs across our nation.  
  
It is now my great honor to introduce the President of the United
States, Joe Biden.
