THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Madam Vice President.  
   
Good morning to all of our colleagues around the world — the world
leaders who are taking part in this summit.  I thank you.  You know,
your leadership on this issue is a statement to the people of your
nation and to the people of every nation, especially our young people,
that we’re ready to meet this moment.  And meeting this moment is about
more than preserving our planet; it’s also about providing a better
future for all of us.   
   
That’s why, when people talk about climate, I think jobs.  Within our
climate response lies an extraordinary engine of job creation and
economic opportunity ready to be fired up.  That’s why I’ve proposed a
huge investment in American infrastructure and American innovation to
tap the economic opportunity that climate change presents our workers
and our communities, especially those too often that have — left out and
left behind.   
   
I’d like to buil- — I want to build a — a critical infrastructure to
produce and deploy clean technology — both those we can harness today
and those that we’ll invent tomorrow.  
   
I talked to the experts, and I see the potential for a more prosperous
and equitable future.  The signs are unmistakable.  The science is
undeniable.  But the cost of inaction is — keeps mounting.   
   
The United States isn’t waiting.  We are resolving to take action — not
only the — our federal government, but our cities and our states all
across our country; small businesses, large businesses, large
corporations; American workers in every field.   
   
I see an opportunity to create millions of good-paying, middle-class,
union jobs.   
   
I see line workers laying thousands of miles of transmission lines for a
clean, modern, resilient grid.   
   
I see workers capping hundreds of thousands of abandoned oil and gas
wells that need to be cleaned up, and abandoned coalmines that need to
be reclaimed, putting a stop to the methane leaks and protecting the
health of our communities.   
   
I see autoworkers building the next generation of electric vehicles, and
electricians installing nationwide for 500,000 charging stations along
our highways.   
   
I see engine- — the engineers and the construction workers building new
carbon capture and green hydrogen plants to forge cleaner steel and
cement and produce clean power.   
   
I see farmers deploying cutting-edge tools to make soil of our — of our
Heartland the next frontier in carbon innovation.   
   
By maintaining those investments and putting these people to work, the
United States sets out on the road to cut greenhouse gases in half — in
half by the end of this decade.  That’s where we’re headed as a nation,
and that’s what we can do if we take action to build an economy that’s
not only more prosperous, but healthier, fairer, and cleaner for the
entire planet.   
   
You know, these steps will set America on a path of net-zero emissions
economy by no later than 2050.  But the truth is, America represents
less than 15 percent of the world’s emissions.  No nation can solve this
crisis on our own, as I know you all fully understand.  All of us, all
of us — and particularly those of us who represent the world’s largest
economies — we have to step up.   
   
You know, those that do take action and make bold investments in their
people and clean energy future will win the good jobs of tomorrow, and
make their economies more resilient and more competitive.   
   
So let’s run that race; win more — win more sustainable future than we
have now; overcome the existential crisis of our times.  We know just
how critically important that is because scientists tell us that this is
the decisive decade.  This is the decade we must make decisions that
will avoid the worst consequences of a climate crisis.  We must try to
keep the Earth’s temperature and — to an increase of — to 1.5 degrees
Celsius.   
   
You know, the world beyond 1.5 degrees means more frequent and intense
fires, floods, droughts, heat waves, and hurricanes tearing through
communities, ripping away lives and livelihoods, increasingly dire
impacts to our public health.  
   
It’s undeniable and undevi- — you know, the idea of accelerating and the
reality that will come if we don’t move.  We can’t resign ourselves to
that future.  We have to take action, all of us.   
   
And this summit is our first step on the road we’ll travel together —
God willing, all of us — to and through Glasgow this November and the
U.N. Climate Conference — the Climate Change Conf- — Conference, you
know, to set our world on a path to a secure, prosperous, and
sustainable future.  The health of communities throughout the world
depends on it.  The wellbeing of our workers depends on it.  The
strength of our economies depends on it.   
   
The countries that take decisive action now to create the industries of
the future will be the ones that reap the economic benefits of the clean
energy boom that’s coming.  
   
You know, we’re here at this summit to discuss how each of us, each
country, can set higher climate ambitions that will in turn create
good-paying jobs, advance innovative technologies, and help vulnerable
countries adapt to climate impacts.  
   
We have to move.  We have to move quickly to meet these challenges.  The
steps our countries take between now and Glasgow will set the world up
for success to protect livelihoods around the world and keep global
warming at a maximum of 1.5 degrees Celsius.  We must get on the path
now in order to do that.   
   
If we do, we’ll breathe easier, literally and figuratively; we’ll create
good jobs here at home for millions of Americans; and lay a strong
foundation for growth for the future.  And — and that — that can be your
goal as well.  This is a moral imperative, an economic imperative, a
moment of peril but also a moment of extraordinary possibilities.   
   
Time is short, but I believe we can do this.  And I believe that we will
do this.   
   
Thank you for being part of the summit.  Thank you for the communities
that you — and the commitments you have made, the communities you’re
from.  God bless you all.   
   
And I look forward to progress that we can make together today and
beyond.  We really have no choice.  We have to get this done.
