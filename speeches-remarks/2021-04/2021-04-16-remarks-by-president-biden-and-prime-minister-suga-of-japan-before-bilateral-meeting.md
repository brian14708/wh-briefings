PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, I’m honored to have Prime Minister Suga here. 
Yoshi and I have had some private time together, both lunch and tea, and
it’s great to have him with us.  
   
As you know, this was the first foreign leader to visit me in my
presidency.  And I’m really pleased to welcome such a close ally and
good partner.   
   
The United States and Japan have a big agenda ahead of us.  And we are
two important democracies in the Indo-Pacific region, and our
cooperation is vital, in my view — and I think in both our views — to
meeting the challenges facing our nation and ensuring the future of the
region to remain free and open and prosperous.   
   
So I’m looking forward to speaking with the Prime Minister.  And our
teams are — are tackling a shared agenda.  We — we are ready to — ready
to get to work.   
   
So welcome, Mr. Prime Minister.  As we say in the body I used to work
in, the United States Senate, “I yield the floor” to the Prime
Minister.  It’s all yours, Yoshi.  
   
PRIME MINISTER SUGA:  (As interpreted.)  Thank you very much.  Thank for
you for accepting me as the first foreign leader under your presidency. 
My deepest gratitude to you.  
   
And yesterday, there was a shooting in Indianapolis, so I heard, and —
causing much casualty.  I would like to express my condolences to the
victims and my sympathies to the families.  Innocent citizens must not
be exposed to any such violence.  
   
Freedom, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law are the universal
values that link our alliance that is prevalent in the Indo-Pacific, and
this is the very foundation of prosperity and stability of the region
and the globe.  And the importance of such values has heightened to
unprecedented level.   
   
And upon my visit to the United States, I wish to reaffirm the new and
tight bond between us.  And in order to realize a free and open
Indo-Pacific, there are many common challenges as well as emerging
global issues, including COVID-19 and climate change.  I wish to spend
time with you to again confirm the close ties between our two
countries.  
   
And thank you again for accepting us.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you being here.  Thank you for your
sentiments.
