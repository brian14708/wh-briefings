THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good evening.  First, I want to thank the jury for
their service, and I want to thank Mr. Floyd’s family for
your <s>steadfadnest</s> \[steadfastness\].  
  
Today, we feel a sigh of relief.  Still, it cannot take away the pain. 
A measure of justice isn’t the same as equal justice.  This verdict
brings us a step closer.  And, the fact is, we still have work to do.  
  
We still must reform the system.  Last summer, together with Senator
Cory Booker and Representative Karen Bass, I introduced the George Floyd
Justice in Policing Act.  This bill would hold law enforcement
accountable and help build trust between law enforcement and our
communities.  This bill is part of George Floyd’s legacy.  
  
The President and I will continue to urge the Senate to pass this
legislation — not as a panacea for every problem, but as a start.  
  
This work is long overdue.  America has a long history of systemic
racism.  Black Americans — and Black men, in particular — have been
treated, throughout the course of our history, as less than human.  
  
Black men are fathers and brothers and sons and uncles and grandfathers
and friends and neighbors.  Their lives must be valued in our education
system, in our healthcare system, in our housing system, in our economic
system, in our criminal justice system, in our nation.  Full stop.  
  
Because of smartphones, so many Americans have now seen the racial
injustice that Black Americans have known for generations — the racial
injustice that we have fought for generations; that my parents protested
in the 1960s; that millions of us, Americans of every race, protested
last summer.  
  
Here’s the truth about racial injustice: It is not just a Black America
problem or a people of color problem.  It is a problem for every
American.  It is keeping us from fulfilling the promise of liberty and
justice for all, and it is holding our nation back from realizing our
full potential.  
  
We are all a part of George Floyd’s legacy, and our job now is to honor
it and to honor him.  
  
Thank you.    
  
And now, it is my great honor to introduce the President of the United
States, Joe Biden.
