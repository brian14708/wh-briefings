title: "Remarks by President\_Biden on Gun Violence\_Prevention"
---
 
Rose Garden

\*\*Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.

THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Kamala — Madam Vice President.  Thank you
very much.   
   
You know, we’re joined today by the Attorney General, Merrick Garland,
who I’ve asked to prioritize gun violence.  It’s also good to see the
Second Gentleman, who is here.  And it’s good to see the First Lady, Dr.
Jill Biden, who cares deeply about this issue as well.   
   
And I look out there and I see so many members of Congress who have led
in this fight.  So many of you who have never given up.  So many of you
who are in — absolutely determined, as Murph and others are, to get this
done.   
   
We got a long way to go.  It always seems like we always have a long way
to go.  But I also — today, we’re taking steps to confront not just the
gun crisis, but what is actually a public health crisis.  Nothing —
nothing I’m about to recommend in any way impinges on the Second
Amendment.  They’re phony, arguments suggesting that these are Second
Amendment rights at stake from what we’re talking about.   
   
But no amendment — no amendment to the Constitution is absolute.  You
can’t yell crowd — you can’t <s>tell</s> \[yell\]\* “fire” in a crowded
movie theater and call it freedom of speech.  From the very beginning,
you couldn’t own any weapon you wanted to own.  From the very beginning
that the Second Amendment existed, certain people weren’t allowed to
have weapons.  So the idea is just bizarre to suggest that some of the
things we’re recommending are contrary to the Constitution.   
   
Gun violence in this country is an epidemic.  Let me say it again: Gun
violence in this country is an epidemic, and it’s an international
embarrassment.  (Applause.)   
   
You know, we saw that again.  Last night, as I was coming to the Oval
office, I got the word that, in South Carolina, a physician with his
wife, two grandchildren, and a person working at his house was gunned
down — all five.  So many people — so many of the people sitting here
today know that well, unfortunately.  You know, they know what it’s like
when the seconds change your life forever.   
   
I have had the — the pleasure of getting to meet, in awful
circumstances, many of you — many of you who’ve lost your children, your
husbands, your wives.  You know, they know what it’s like to bury a
piece of their soul deep in the Earth.  We understand that.   
   
Mark and Jackie, I want to tell you: It’s always good to see you, but
not under these circumstances.   
      
I want to say, before I introduce the rest of the folks, is, you know,
what — a lot of people have not been through what they’ve been through —
don’t understand.  It takes a lot of courage to come to an event like
this.  They’re absolutely, absolutely determined to make change.   
   
But Mark and Jackie, whose son Daniel was a first grader at Sandy Hook
Elementary School.  Daniel loved sports — loves outdoors sports, getting
muddy.  
   
I see my friend Fred Guttenberg.  His daughter, Jaime, was a freshman at
Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School.  She was an accomplished
dancer.  
   
I see Brandon Wolf, who — the shooting at the — at the impulse — at the
Pulse club — nightclub.  He survived, but his two best friends died.   
   
Greg Jackson, who was just walking down the street when he was caught in
the crossfire of a gunfight.  
   
And, of course, I see a close friend of Jill’s and mine, Congresswoman
Gabby Giffords, who is here.  Who was — who was speaking with her
constituents in front a grocery store in her state when she was shot and
a member of her staff was killed.   
   
You know, they’re here, and their pain is immense.  And, you know, what
a lot of you — hopefully many of you — don’t know is if you’ve gone
through a trauma, no matter how much you work to make sure others don’t
go through it, every time you show up at an event like this, it brings
back when you got that phone call.  It brings back the immediacy of what
happened at that moment.   
   
So I genuinely mean it: Thank you.  Thank you for having the courage —
the courage to be here, the courage to continue this fight.  Senator
Blumenthal understands it.  A lot of the folks out here understand it. 
But it takes real courage, so thank you.     
   
To turn pain into purpose and demand that we take the actions that gives
meaning to the word “enough.”  Enough.  Enough.  Enough.  Enough. 
Because what they want you to know, what they want you to do is not just
listen.   
   
Every day in this country, 316 people are shot.  Every single day.  A
hundred and six of them die every day.  Our flag was still flying at
half-staff for the victims of the horrific murder of 8 primarily Asian
American people in Georgia when 10 more lives were taken in a mass
murder in Colorado.   
   
You probably didn’t hear it, but between those two incidents, less than
one week apart, there were more than 850 additional shootings — 850 —
that took the lives of more than 250 people, and left 500 — 500 —
injured.  This is an epidemic, for God’s sake.  And it has to stop.   
   
So I’m here to talk about two things: first, the steps we’re going to
take immediately, and, second, the action that needs to be taken going
forward to curb the epidemic of gun violence.  
   
I asked the Attorney General and his team to identify for me immediate,
concrete actions I could can take now without having to go through the
Congress.   And today, I’m announcing several initial steps my
administration is taking to curb this epidemic of gun violence.   
   
Much more need be done, but the first — first, I want to rein in the
proliferation of so-called “ghost guns.”   These are guns that are
homemade, built from a kit that include the directions on how to finish
the firearm.  You can go buy the kit.  They have no serial numbers, so
when they show up at a crime scene, they can’t be traced.   
   
And the buyers aren’t required to pass a background check to buy the kit
to make the gun.  Consequently, anyone — anyone from a criminal to a
terrorist can buy this kit and, in as little as 30 minutes, put together
a weapon.  
   
You know, I want to see these kits treated as firearms under the Gun
Control Act, which is going to require that the seller and manufacturers
make the key parts with serial numbers and run background checks on the
buyers when they walk in to buy that package.   
   
The section \[sic\] action we’re going to — the second action we’re
going to take — back in 2000 — the year 2000, the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, and Firearms released a report on its investigations into
firearms trafficking in America.  The report was of pivotal value.  It
was an important tool for policymakers when I was in the Senate and
beyond, at all levels, to stop firearms from being illegally diverted
into dangerous hands.   
   
Today, with online sales and ghost guns, times and trafficking methods
have changed, and we have to adjust.  We also have to ask the Justice
Department to release a new annual report.  This report will better help
policymakers address firearms trafficking as it is today, not what it
was yesterday.   
   
A third change: We want to treat pistols modified with stabilizing
braces with the seriousness they deserve.  A stabilizing brace — you’re
going to (inaudible) — essentially, it makes that pistol a hell of a lot
more accurate and a mini-rifle.  As a result, it’s more lethal,
effectively turning into a short-barreled rifle.  That’s what the
alleged shooter in Boulder appears to have done.  
   
I want to be clear that these modifications to firearms that make them
more lethal should be subject to the National Firearms Act.  The
National Firearms Act requires that a potential owner pay a $200 fee and
submit their name and other identifying information to the Justice
Department, just as they would if they went out and purchased a silencer
for a gun.   
   
Fourthly, during my campaign for President, I wanted to make it easier
for states to adopt extreme risk protection order laws.  They’re also
called “red flag” laws, which everybody on this lawn knows, but many
people listening do not know.  These laws allow a police or family
member to petition a court in their jurisdiction and say, “I want you to
temporarily remove from the following people any firearm they may
possess because they’re a danger.  In a crisis, they’re presenting a
danger to themselves and to others.”  And the court makes a ruling.   
   
To put this in perspective, more than half of all suicides, for example,
involve the use of a firearm.  But when a gun is not available, an
attempt at suicide — the death rate drops precipitously.  States that
have red flag laws have seen and — seen a reduction in the number of
suicides in their states.   
   
Every single month, by the way, an average of 53 women are shot and
killed by an intimate partner.  I wrote the Violence Against Women Act. 
It’s been a constant struggle to keep it moving.  We know red flag laws
can have a significant effect in protecting women from domestic
violence.  And we know red flag laws can stop mass shooters before they
can act out their violent plans.   
   
I’m proud — “Excuse the point of personal privilege,” as we used to say
in the Senate — I’m proud that the red flag law in my home state of
Delaware was named after my son, Attorney General Beau Biden — our son;
excuse me, Jill — who proposed that legislation back in 2013.   
   
I want to see a national red flag law and legislation to incentivize
states to enact their own red flag laws.  Today, I asked the Justice
Department to publish a model red flag legislation so states can start
crafting their own laws right now.  Just like with background checks,
the vast majority of Americans support these extreme risk protection
order laws, and it’s time to put these laws on the books and protect
even more people.  The Attorney General will have more to say about this
in a moment.   
   
Additionally, we recognize that cities across the country are
experiencing historic spikes in homicides, as the law enforcement can
tell you.  The violence is hitting Black and brown communities the
hardest.  Homicide is the leading cause of death of Black boys and men
ages 15 to 34 — the leading cause of death.   
   
But there are proven strategies that reduce gun violence in urban
communities, and there are programs that have demonstrated they can
reduce homicides by up to 60 percent in urban communities.  But many of
these have been badly underfunded or not funded at all of late.  
   
Gun violence in America — for those of you who think of this from an
economic standpoint listening to me — estimated to cost the nation $280
billion –- let me say it again — $280 billion a year.  They said, “How
could that be, Joe?”  Hospital bills, physical therapy, trauma
counseling, legal fees, prison costs, and the loss of productivity.  Not
to mention the psychological damage done to the children who live in
these cities, watching this happen, knowing someone it happened to.   
   
This gun violence in our neighborhood is having a profound impact on our
children, even if they’re never involved in pulling the trigger or being
the victim of — on the other side of a trigger.  
   
For a fraction of the cost of gun violence, we can save lives, create
safe and healthy communities, and build economies that work for all of
us, and save billions of American dollars.   
   
In the meantime, much of it, as Senator Cicilline knows, is taxpayer
money.  
   
Finally, the Bureau of Alcobol \[sic\] — Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms,
the key agency enforcing gun laws, hasn’t had a permanent director since
2015.  
   
Today, I’m proud to nominate David Chipman to serve as the Director of
the AFT.  David knows the AFT well.  He served there for 25 years.  And
Vice President Harris and I believe he’s the right person, at this
moment, for this important agency.  
   
And I’ve said before: My job, the job of any President, is to protect
the American people.  Whether Congress acts or not, I’m going to use all
the resources at my disposal as President to keep the American people
safe from gun violence.  But there’s much more that Congress can do to
help that effort.  And they can do it right now.  
   
They’ve offered plenty of thoughts and prayers — members of Congress —
but they’ve passed not a single new federal law to reduce gun violence. 
Enough prayers.  Time for some action.  
   
I believe the Senate should immediately pass three House-passed bills to
close loopholes that allow gun purchases — purchasers to bypass the
background checks.  The vast majority of the American people, including
gun owners, believe there should be background checks before you
purchase a gun.  
   
As was noted earlier, hundreds of thousands of people have been denied
guns because of the background checks.  What more would have
happened?   
   
These bills, one, require background checks for anyone purchasing a gun
at a gun show or an online sale.  (Applause.)  
   
Most people don’t know: If you walk into a store and you buy a gun, you
have a background check.  But you go to a gun show, you can buy whatever
you want and no background check.  
   
Second thing is to close the Charles- — what’s known as the “Charleston”
loophole.  Like people here, I spent time down at that church in
Charleston.  What happened is someone was allowed to get the gun used to
kill those innocent people at a church service.  If the FBI hasn’t com-
— didn’t complete the background check within three days.   
   
There’s a process.  If wasn’t done in three days, according to
Charleston loophole, you get to buy the gun.  They bought the gun and
killed a hell of a lot of innocent people who invited him to pray with
them.  
   
And three, reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which — the
so-called — close — (applause) — the “boyfriend” and “stalking”
loopholes to keep guns out of the hands of people found by a court to be
an abuser and continuing threat.  
   
I held over a thousand hours of hearings to pass the Violence Against
Women Act, and one thing came through.  If, in fact, a stay-away order —
an order preventing the abuser from coming in a certain distance of the
person he has abused or she has abused — and now the idea that they can
own a weapon when they have a court order saying they are an abuser?   
   
These are some of the best tools we have right now to prevent gun
violence and save lives.  But all these bills, they had support of both
Democrats and Republicans in the House.  And universal background checks
are supported by the vast majority of the American people and, I might
add, the vast majority of responsible gun owners.  
   
So let me be clear: This is not a partisan issue among the American
people.  This is a view by the American people as an American issue. 
And I’m willing to work with anyone to get these done. And it’s long
past time that we act.   
   
Now, I know this has been a hobbyhorse of mine for a long time — got it
done once.  We should also ban assault weapons and high-capacity
magazines in this country.  (Applause.)  
   
For that 10 years we had it done, the number of mass shootings actually
went down.  Even law enforcement officials have told me and told other
champions of this legislation they sometimes feel outgunned by assault
weapons with large-capacity magazines.   
   
There’s no reason someone needs a weapon of war with 100 rounds, 100
bullets that can be fired from that weapon.  Nobody needs that.  Nobody
needs that.  
   
We got that done when I was a United States senator.  It wasn’t easy
going up against the gun lobby, but it saved lives.  And we should also
eliminate gun manufacturers from the immunity they received from the
Congress.  (Applause.)  
   
You realize — again, the people here — because they’re so knowledgeable
out here in the Rose Garden.  But what people don’t realize: The only
industry in America — a billion-dollar industry — that can’t be sued —
has exempt from being sued — are gun manufacturers.   
   
Imagine how different it would be had that same exemption been available
to tobacco companies who knew — who knew and lied about the danger they
were causing — the cancer caused and the like.  Imagine where we’d be.  
   
But this is the only outfit that is exempt from being sued. If I get one
thing on my list — the Lord came down and said, “Joe, you get one of
these” — give me that one.  (Applause.)  Because I tell you what, there
would be a “come to the Lord” moment these folks would have real
quickly.  But they’re not.  They’re not. They’re exempt.   
   
I know that the conversation about guns in this country can be a
difficult one.  But even here, there’s much more common ground than we —
anyone would believe.  There’s much more common ground.  
   
Everything that’s being proposed today is totally consistent with the
Second Amendment.  And there’s a wide consensus behind the need to take
action.  
   
I know that when overwhelming majorities of Americans want to see
something change that will affect their lives and it still doesn’t
change, it can be demoralizing to our fellow citizens.  It can feel like
our entire political process is broken.   
   
I know it’s painful and frustrating that we haven’t made the progress
that we’d hoped for.  But it took five years to get the Brady bill
passed, and it took even more years to work to pass the assault weapons
ban.  And it saved lives.   
   
No matter how long it takes, we’re going to get these passed.  We’re not
going to give up.  We have an opportunity to fulfill the first
responsibility of government: to keep our people safe.  And in the
process, we can show the world and show ourselves that democracy works,
that we can come together and get big things done.  
   
When I look around and see such brave survivors sitting out here in the
Rose Garden, public servants who devoted their lives to dealing with
this, advocates who feel strongly and are pushing every day to make the
rational changes, and courageous parents and family members, I know that
progress, even in this most difficult of issues, is possible.  
   
So, folks, this is just the start.  We’ve got a lot of work to do.  But
I know almost every one of you sitting in the garden here; none of you
have ever given up.  We’re not going to give up now.   
   
The idea that we have so many people dying every single day from gun
violence in America is a blemish on our character as nation.  
   
Let me say to all of you: God bless you, but most importantly, the
memory of all many of you have lost to this senseless gun violence.   
   
And now I’d like to hand it over to the Attorney General for him to
speak and make some comments.  And I hope I get a chance to see some of
you after this is over.   
   
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. (Applause.)
