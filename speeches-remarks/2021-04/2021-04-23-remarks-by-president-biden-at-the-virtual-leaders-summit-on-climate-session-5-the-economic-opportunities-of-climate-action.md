East Room

9:43 A.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, welcome back.  Thank you all again — all the world
leaders who’ve joined us — thank you for joining.  And, John, thank you
for putting this together.   
   
We’ve made great progress, in my view, so far.  And I’m grateful to all
the leaders who have announced new commitments to help us meet the
existential threat of climate change.  This summit is a start — a start
of a road that will take us to Glasgow for the U.N. Climate Change
Conference in November where we’re going to make these commitments real,
putting all of our nations on path to a secure, prosperous, and
sustainable future.   
   
Today’s final session is not about the threat of climate change poses;
it’s about the opportunity that addressing climate change provides. 
It’s an opportunity to create millions of good-paying jobs around the
world and innovate — in innovative sectors — you know, jobs that bring
greater quality of life, greater dignity to the people performing those
jobs in every nation.   
   
For a line-worker, electricians, utility workers — laying transmission
lines, connecting battery storage, and making our electric grid more
modern.  For automotive workers — building electric cars, trucks, and
buses.  Skilled workers installing and charge — charging stations to
accommodate them throughout our countries.   
   
Construction workers, engineers, insulators — upgrading our schools and
commercial buildings, and constructing new energy-efficient homes. 
Manufacturing — manufacturing workers building nuclear and carbon
capture technologies, solar panels, and wind turbines.   
   
And people working in the fields that we haven’t even conceived of yet —
on forms \[sic\] — on farms and on factories and in laboratories and
universities with things we haven’t even thought of so far.   
   
This is — this challenge and these opportunities are going to be met by
working people in every nation.  And as we transition to a clean energy
future, we must ensure that workers who have thrived in yesterday’s and
today’s industries have as bright a tomorrow in the new industries as
well as in the places where they live, in the communities they have
built.   
   
When we invest in climate resilience and infrastructure, we create
opportunities for everyone.  That’s — that’s at the heart of my Jobs
Plan that I proposed here in United States.  It’s how our nation intends
to build an economy that gives everybody a fair shot.   
   
As you heard in the last session, it requires investing in innovation. 
That’s why I’ve asked the Secretary of Energy — my Energy Secretary,
Jennifer Granholm, who you saw earlier — to speed the development of
critical technologies to tackle the climate crisis.   
   
No single technology is the answer on its own because every sector
requires innovation to meet this moment.  You know, this critical effort
is going to propel the most impactful breakthroughs at home and around
the world and lower the cost of — we’re paying now for polluting the air
so badly.  We’re going to move to net zero in a transition in all
countries.   
   
Now, look, every country will need to invest in new clean energy
technologies as we work forward and — to deal with net-zero
emissions.   
   
I am also very proud to announce the United States is again becoming a
key leader in Mission Innovation — we helped launch the program during
the Obama-Biden administration — a pact between the world’s largest
economies to ramp up investments in clean energy research and
development.   
   
And today, America is once again stepping into the leadership role.  We
will be joining and a partner — for the nations and efforts to
decarbonize critical sectors across the board, including industrial
sector, where we’ll join with Sweden and India, and leadership — in the
Leadership Group for — for Industry Transition; the power sector, where
we’ll work alongside of the United Kingdom to spread progress and speed
it up toward a carbon-free power system both here and around the world;
and in agriculture — the agricultural sector, where we’ll launch the
Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate with the United — with the
United Ara- — United Arab Emirates and other partners.   
   
We also — I’m very heartened by President Putin’s call yesterday for the
world to collaborate and advanced carbon dioxide removal.  And the
United States looks forward to working with Russia and other countries
in that endeavor.  It has a great promise.   
   
This is a moment for all of us to build better economies for our
children, our grandchildren, and all of us to thrive — to thrive in —
not just now, but beyond for the next generations.  
   
Nations that work together to invest in a cleaner economy will reap
rewards for their citizens.  The United States is committed — we are
committed to making those investments to grow our economy here at home
while connecting with markets around the world.   
   
For example, we’re launching a new Global Partnership for Climate-Smart
Infrastructure.  This will create good-paying jobs here in America by
supporting development of new clean infrastructure in our partner
countries.   
   
These are the sort of partnerships that are going to be good for all of
us.  And I think they’ll have additional benefits just with us working
together.   
   
And today, I’m excited to welcome my counterparts in Spain, Nigeria,
Vietnam, and Poland to share their thinking on how to realize the
economies — the economic opportunities of the climate response.   
   
And we’re going to be joined by labor, and business, community leaders
from around the world to talk about what’s happening in their
communities around climate-related jobs.   
   
And I’m pleased to be joined by Secretary Buttigieg, Ambassador Tai, and
National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy, the chair of my National Climate
Task Force.  
   
I look forward to our conversation and making more progress — more
progress throughout today.  Thank you.  
   
(The virtual discussion commences.)  
   
(The virtual discussion concludes.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, John, thank you.  As we close this historic
summit, I want to take a moment to thank the world leaders and all the
participants from around the globe who have joined together to confront
the existential threat of climate change.  There’s no threat like it.   
   
Over the last two days, I think we made some important progress.  In the
spirit of increasing efforts to address climate change globally, we’re
launching an initiative to help developing countries strengthen their
climate efforts while achieving their development goals.  And that’s
going to mean money.   
   
Yesterday, I announced the United States made a new commitment, under
the Paris Agreement, to cut our emissions by 50 to 52 percent by the end
of this decade.  And we’ll get there by investing in American workers,
American jobs, American infrastructure, and building a stronger and more
resilient economy.   
   
We also welcome ambitious targets announced this week by two great
partners.  My good friend, the Prime Minister of Japan, Prime Minister
Suga, announced that Japan will cut emissions by up to 60 — excuse me —
50 percent below the 2013 levels, almost doubling their current
target.   
   
Prime Minister Trudeau, another good friend, from Canada, will reduce
emissions by as much as 45 percent below the 2005 levels.   
   
These announcements came on top of a demonstrated leadership and strong
existing targets set by the European Union and the United Kingdom.  And
together, these commitments mean that half of the world’s economy is now
committed to — to pace the action that we need to — at a pace we need to
limit warming to 1.5 degrees — an amount beyond which scientists tell us
— have said 1,000 times — all of us could be at a point of no return.   
   
We also heard encouraging news — announcements from Argentina, Brazil,
South Africa, and South Korea.  I’m looking forward to working with
India’s Prime Minister Modi in a new partnership to achieve our climate
and energy goals, making this a core pillar of our bilateral
cooperation.   
   
And the commitments we’ve made must become real.  Commitment without us
doing it — it’s just a lot of hot air.  No pun intended.   
   
You know, we must implement these commitments, accelerate them, and
innovate and invest in order to reach them.  And we need to work
together, once again, to build a clean energy future that delivers good
jobs and overcomes the threat of climate change — investing in
innovation and in our people, raising our ambitions, ensuring every
nation does its part.   
   
And we’ll meet again in Glasgow in November for the U.N. Climate
Conference.  I believe we’re going to meet those moments.  I think we’re
going to meet the moment that we’ve all been talking about to make this
commitment and to keep the commitment.  It’s an economic imperative.  I
think it’s a moral imperative to future generations.   
   
Here in America, there’s never been a challenge we couldn’t meet if we
put our minds to it and did it together.  I hope your countries feel the
same way.  I know we can do this.  I know we can do this.  
   
Thank you for your commitment.  Thank you for joining the summit.  And
thank you for stepping up to confront this crisis before it’s too late. 
I know we can seize the opportunities of a cleaner, stronger, and more
resilient economy and deliver the benefits to people in each — each of
our nations.   
   
So I look forward — I look forward to working alongside you to confront
the climate crisis, to build a better world for all of our children and
grandchildren.  We’re going to do this together.   
   
Thank you all.  And may God bless you.  And let’s get to work.  Thanks
again.
