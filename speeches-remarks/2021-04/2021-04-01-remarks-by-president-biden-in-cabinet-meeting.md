THE PRESIDENT:  Well, again, thank you all for coming together to form
this historic Cabinet.  This is the first in American history that the
Cabinet looks like America.  That’s what we promised we were going to
do, and we’ve done it.

I’m grateful that the Senate acted in a bipartisan way, at a modern
record speed, to get the Cabinet confirmed.  It’s hard to believe, but
we are among the quickest formed of all the Cabinet members being —
being put in place.

We have a lot to discuss, but while the press is here, I want to make
one announcement:

Yesterday, in Pittsburgh, I laid out my vision for rebuilding America
with the American Jobs program.  And while most of the Cabinet will have
a role in helping shape and press the Jobs Plan, today I’m announcing
that I’m asking five Cabinet members to take special responsibility to
explain the plan to the American public.

Working with my team here in the White House, these Cabinet members will
represent me in dealing with Congress, engage the public in selling the
plan, and help work out the details as we refine it and move forward.

These five members will be Pete Buttigieg, Jennifer Granholm, Marcia
Fudge, Marty Walsh, and Gina Raimondo.  And I think — I want to thank
them in advance for the role they’re going to play with this added
assignment I’m asking them to take on.  And we’ll be discussing that
today and among other things.

And one of those other things — our administration — is a commitment to
Buy American, the plan we’re putting forward to make sure that when the
government is spending taxpayers’ money, that they’re spending it on
American-made goods of American corporations and American employees.

Today I’m directing every member of the Cabinet — I mean this sincerely
— every one — to take a hard look at their agency’s spending and make
sure it follows my Buy American standard, which we set out in January. 
I’m going to ask you all to report back to me at the next Cabinet
meeting. 

And now we’ve got a lot of business to do, to get done.  And I thank the
press for being here, but I’ll talk to you all later. 

Thank you.
