Q    Mr. President, quickly: Do you think the worst is behind us with
COVID-19?

THE PRESIDENT:  I think if everyone continues down the road we’re on
now, it will be behind us.  But it’s not over yet.  We’re in a situation
where we — I believe, by the end of this summer, we’ll have a
significant portion of the American public vaccinated. 

I’m going to be making a speech when I leave here.  There’s no place to
do it here, but back at the White House, we’re going to announce how far
down the road we are in terms of the number of people vaccinated with at
least one shot. 

I think before another 25 days, we’ll probably have somewhere in excess
of 200 million shots that have been administered.  And the good news is:
A clear, overwhelming majority of people over the age of 65 have gotten
at least one shot.  And that’s the most susceptible age bracket. 

And the good thing also: All these strains you’re hearing about, you
should not worry.  They are more virulent, and they are — some are more
dangerous, but the vaccines work on all of them.  So the idea is, don’t
think that means you shouldn’t get a vaccine.  That increases the need
to get one quickly, because that’s how we’re going to beat this.  And
you’re going to beat it.

But keep wearing a mask.  Soci — wash the hands and socially distance,
which I’m not doing.  (Laughter.)  I’m going to get in trouble here.  Is
this your second shot?

PARTICIPANT:  Second shot.

THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, we’re set.  (Laughter.)  I’ve had two as well.  So —

Well, thank you.
