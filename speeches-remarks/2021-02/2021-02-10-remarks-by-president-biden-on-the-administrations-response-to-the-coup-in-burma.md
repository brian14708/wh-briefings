THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you for being here on short notice.  I’m going to
be very brief, but I — because the Vice President and I are heading over
the Pentagon for an extensive briefing and to make some comments, as we
did at the State Department.  So I’m going to be going from here to
there, and you’ll get me there as well.  
  
I want to say good afternoon, everyone.  I wanted to give you an update
on the latest regarding our response to the military coup in Burma.  
  
As you know, the assault on Burma’s transition to democracy remains an
issue of deep bipartisan concern.  We’ve consulted at length, for
example, with Senator McConnell, who’s had a very keen interest in this,
and his team.  And we welcomed their helpful insights.  
  
We’ve also been in close contact with our allies and partners around the
world, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, driving vigorous
diplomatic outreach to help coordinate an international response to what
happened.    
  
A strong and unified message emerging from the United States has been
essential, in our view, to encouraging other countries to join us in
pressing for an immediate return to democracy.   
  
Last week, the United States helped bring together the U.N. Security
Council, which issued a strong statement in support of Burmese
democracy.  And this week, we will use our renewed engagement on the
Human Rights Council to strengthen the world’s commitment to human
rights in Burma.  
  
Today, I again call on the Burmese military to immediately release the
democratic political leaders and activists and — that they’re now
detaining, including Aung San Suu Kyi.  And she is — and also Win Myint,
the President.  
  
The military must relinquish the power it seized and demonstrate respect
for the will of the people of Burma as expressed in their November 8th
election.  
  
So today, I’m announcing a series — a series of actions that we’re
taking to begin imposing consequences on the leaders of the coup.  The
U.S. government is taking steps to prevent the generals from improperly
having access to the $1 billion in Burmese government funds held in the
United States.  
  
And today, I’ve approved a new executive order — (coughs) — excuse me —
a new executive order enabling us to immediately sanction the military
leaders who directed the coup, their business interests, as well as
close family members.  
  
We will identify a first round of targets this week.  And we’re also
going to impose strong export controls.  And we’re freezing U.S. assets
that benefit the Burmese government, while maintaining our support for
healthcare, civil society groups, and other areas that benefit the
people of Burma directly.  
  
And, finally, as protests grow, violence against those asserting their
democratic rights is unacceptable, and we’re going to keep calling it
out.  The people of Burma are making their voices heard.  And the world
is watching.  
  
We’ll be ready to impose additional measures, and we’ll continue to work
with our international partners to urge other nations to join us in
these efforts.  
  
So I thank you all.  I wanted to have that statement before I got in the
vehicle to go out to the Pentagon.  And I’m sure I’ll see some of you at
the Pentagon.  Thanks for coming over on such short notice.  Thank
you.
