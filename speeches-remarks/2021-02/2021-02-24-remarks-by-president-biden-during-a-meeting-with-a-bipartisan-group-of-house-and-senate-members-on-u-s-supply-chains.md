THE PRESIDENT:  Folks, we’re going to have a meeting today to talk about
the critical supply chain — critical supply chain issues that we — that
affect us all, affect this country. 

The last year has shown the vulnerability we have with some of the
supply chains, including the PPE that we needed badly, but had to go
abroad to get.  And there are current strategies — and these little
chips here for automobiles, I didn’t realize how many billions of chips
are in here — but causing some lines to slow down and people not being
laid off, but at least to shorten the shifts.

And so we’re going to talk about that.  John Cornyn and the bipartisan
group here put together an effort last year that I think was a pretty
good effort, dealing with how to deal with these chips, but there’s
other aspects of shortages as well.  That’s what we’re going to talk
about.  And it’s nice to have everybody down here, and — on a subject
matter we all agree on, and figure out how we get it all done.

So thank you all for coming on in, and I appreciate it.
