On February 23, President Joe Biden will participate in his first
bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. In this virtual
event, the President will highlight the strong and deep partnership
between the United States and Canada as neighbors, friends and NATO
Allies.  The meeting will be an opportunity for the two leaders to
review joint efforts in areas of mutual interest such as the COVID-19
response, climate change, and the economic ties that bind our countries,
as well as the deep people-to-people bonds we share.    
  
President Biden and his Cabinet will also meet virtually with Canada’s
Ministers on a range of bilateral and global issues.
