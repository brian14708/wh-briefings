THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everybody.  Thanks for coming in.  I’m fortunate
to have today a group of leading governors and mayors of both political
parties to talk about the COVID plan that we’ve put forward, and their
needs and their ideas and their recommendations on how to proceed. 

And the American Rescue Plan is — has multiple pieces.  The most
important piece, in my view, is making sure we give them enough capacity
to deal with the virus in their states and how we’re going to do that.

But equally consequential is the need to help the states economically,
in terms of everything from unemployment to being able to make sure that
they’re able to get kids back in schools and what role the federal
government should play in helping getting that done.

And, you know, if — these folks are all on the frontlines.  They’ve been
dealing with this crisis from day one.  It’s — I’m not making a
political statement; it just it’s taken a while to adjust.  They’ve been
left on their own, in many cases.

I think some have found what I found when I got here: that what we
thought was available, in terms of everything from vaccine to
vaccinators, was not the case. 

So I thank them for the work they did in their cities and their states
in order to respond to the crisis.  But I think it’s — and I’ve said it
plainly when I was running and as President — that I think the federal
government has a major role to play here.  But these are the folks that
are on the ground dealing with it every single solitary day.  And they
see the pain, and they see the successes when they occur. 

And what I really want to know about is what should that — the recovery
plan — should we have more or less of anything in it; what do they think
they need most; how to proceed.  Because as I’ve said before, you know,
governors and mayors — that’s a real job. 

I was a senator for years.  I got in a train every day and came to
Washington, D.C., and I’d get asked questions by the conductors and the
shoeshine guys and the ticket masters and — but every single day, these
folks are home.  Every single day, they’re meeting with their
constituents. 

We’re down here in Washington, and we meet with them.  I don’t mean to
belittle them at all, but it’s not the same as being on the ground.  And
so whenever I want to know what’s really happening, I want to talk — and
I’m not being solicitous — to governors and mayors.

And so thank you for being here.  And that’s what we’re going to be
doing today.  Thank you all.
