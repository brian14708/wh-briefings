Q Mr. President, Mitch McConnell says you’re in for a heck of a fight on
this one.

THE PRESIDENT: Mitch McConnell loves our programs. Did you see what
Mitch McConnel said? He told me he wasn’t going to get a single vote in
order to allow me to get, with the help of everybody here, that $1.9
trillion tax cut — I mean, excuse me, program to — for economic growth.

Look it up, man. He’s bragging about in Kentucky: “It’s a great thing
for Kentucky. It’s getting $4 billion to help poor.” It’s amazing. Check
out Mitch McConnell. You can even see it on TV.

Anyway, thanks. Thank you.
