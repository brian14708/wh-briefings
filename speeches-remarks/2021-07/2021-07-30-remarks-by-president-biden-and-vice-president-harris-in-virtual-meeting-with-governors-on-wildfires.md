South Court Auditorium

   
12:03 P.M. EDT      
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Jay, you’re beginning to convince the American people
there is a thing called “climate crisis.”  About time.  (Laughs.)  
   
GOVERNOR INSLEE:  Indeed.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you all for being here.  I’m going to make a
brief statement here and then we’ll get to ask the Vice President to say
a few words, get to some questions, and we’ll get down to business, if
that’s okay with you all.  
   
You know, one month ago, we convened the first of what will be a regular
presidential briefing on wildfire preparedness.  And we’re joined by
many of the governors who — we were joined by many of the governors who
are with us today, as well as experts from across the administration and
leaders from the electric utility sector.   
   
I said then that the threat of Western wildfires this year was as severe
as it’s ever been.  And in the past month, we’ve sadly seen the truth of
that being played out.   
   
Since our — our last meeting, the number of large, uncontained wildfires
has nearly doubled to 66 — 66 of those fires.  And the number of
firefighters on the job to battle them has tripled.  Over 3.4 million
acres have already burned.   
   
In Oregon, the Bootleg Fire has destroyed more than 400 structures,
including more than 160 homes.  In California, the Dixie Fire has grown
to over 220,000 acres and our firefighters are working in really rugged
and dangerous conditions and terrain.   
   
The number of states are experiencing the impacts of smoke from these
fires, degrading their air quality, not just where the fires are
burning, but all the states moving east — not all, but most.   
   
In short, we’ve got big, complex wildfires burning across multiple
areas.  And despite the incredible — and I’m not — this is not being
solicitous — the incredible bravery and heroism of our firefighters, our
resources are already being stretched to keep up.  We need more help,
particularly when we also factor in the additional nationwide challenges
of pandemic-related supply chain disruptions and our ongoing efforts to
fight COVID.   
   
We’ve had a few COVID clusters at our fire camps, which further limits
resources.  It’s just one more reason why it’s so darn important that
everyone get vaccinated, I might add.  
   
Sadly, we’ve also lost two brave firefighters in the last month in a
plane crash in Arizona, and five were seriously injured last week
battling the Devil’s Creek fire in Montana.   
   
It’s — to state the obvious, and you governors know it better than
anybody — it is really, really dangerous work, and it takes incredible
bravery to do it.  And these heroes deserve to be paid — and paid well —
for their work.  That’s why, last month, I was able to announce — and
it’s not paying that well, in my view, to be honest with you — immediate
action to make all federal firefighters making at least $15 an hour.  I
think they deserve more than that.  
   
We’re also working with Congress to make sure that our firefighters are
paid better permanently.  Permanently.  So far, FEMA has approved 20
Fire Management Assistance Grants totaling up to $100 million to help
states pay for the cost of fighting these fires.  
   
We’re also working with FEMA and the Defense Logistical Agency to get
ahead of this emergency supply chain challenges.  And we still have some
supply chain challenges relating to hoses and a number of other
things.  
   
We’re trapped — we’ve tapped additional aircraft from the Department of
Defense to aid in the fire detection and firefighting.  We also welcome
the support of our allies, from Australia, for example, sending a large
air tanker to which it’s going to begin flying missions this week.   
   
And last month, I also noted that the EPA would be launching an upgrade
app for mobile phones to easily share location-specific information with
the public about the effects of fire and smoke on air quality for them. 
It’s now even more important, because smoke from many of these fires
burning in the West and along the Canadian border is affecting air
quality in states across the country.   
   
As of today, the upgrade app — the upgrade AirNow app is live and ready
for use.  Folks in affected areas should download this important tool as
quickly as possible.   
   
I also encourage our states and county leaders to continue partnering
with FEMA, as many of the leaders on the scene today are leveraging our
Public Alert and Warning systems to communicate information directly and
quickly about — to the public about wildfires, evacuations, power
outages, and more.   
   
I know several of the governors’ states have used this system recently
and send — to send warnings of evacuation orders, and it has undoubtedly
helped people and, we don’t know for certain, but likely saved some
lives.   
   
But we’re in for a long fight yet this year, and the only way we’re
going to meet those challenges is by working together.   
   
Wildfires are a problem for all of us and we have to stay closely
coordinated in doing everything we can for our people.  That’s why I
asked the governors to join us — Democrats and Republicans alike — so
they can update me and the Vice President directly on what they need and
what we can possibly do more of.  And so we can discuss what’s needed
today — we have to meet an urgent danger at hand — a plan for what we
can do to make sure we’re better prepared next time.   
   
One of the important aspects of the — of the bipartisan infrastructure
deal that is before the Senate now is it includes billions of dollars —
billions of dollars — to strengthen wildfire preparedness, resilience,
and response.   
   
It includes funding for prevention efforts, like forest management, and
to restore millions of acres of high-risk areas to protect homes and
public water sources for drinking.  And — you know, and overlaying all
of this is the necessity to successfully confront climate change.  
   
We may — we have some significant changes we’re making in these two
pieces of legislation that, God willing, will pass in the next month or
so.   
   
But we can’t ignore how the overlapping and intertwined factors of
extreme heat, prolonged drought, and supercharged wildfire conditions
are affecting the country.    
   
And so, this is a challenge that demands our urgent, urgent action, both
today and, as you all know better than anyone else in the country, not
just today, but tomorrow, next year, and the year after.  
   
And so, I want to thank you, Governors, for your leadership during what
is an incredibly challenging period for all of you.  God, love you. 
You’re going through — anyway.  It’s —  
   
And I’d like to ask, now, the Vice President to make a few comments. 
And then, I have some questions for all and we get in a discussion, with
your permission.  Thank you.  
   
Vice President.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.   
   
We stand with you.  We stand with you, and this is a commitment from our
administration that we will not only stand with you, but stay in touch
with you, mostly to hear from you.  We know that the way that we can
help you manage and expand your capacity is through the partnership that
we have — the federal and state government, along with local
governments.  
   
This — this issue is ongoing.  Each year, as we have discussed, it gets
worse.  It affects real people — everything from children who are
breathing the smoke to parents who are up at night, concerned that they
may get an evacuation order at any — at any moment.  So, know that we
are here to maximize the federal capacity to support the states.  
   
I’m in D.C., but, of course, I’m a California girl and I care deeply
about this.  We — as I think I’ve shared with many of you, our family
has been under evacuation orders in the last couple of years.  And — and
our folks should not have to fear that they are — they are going to lose
their home, everything they have, much less risk their lives in these
moments.  
   
So, thank you all for your courage, for your leadership, and I look
forward to staying in touch with you.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  
   
Folks, I asked the staff — because I think it’s — I’ve had the great
honor of being, over the last 15 years, in your states and in the
wilderness areas and the national parks.  And I asked my staff to put
together maps where exactly where the fires are and the areas they’re in
and what they’re affecting.   
   
And so, I want to start off with you, Governor Gianforte, up in
Montana.  You have your hands full, man.  And I — looking at — at the
map, all away from, you know, Poverty Flats and Crooked Creek, all the
way up into Ruby and Hay Creek, and the other end of the state.  But the
big fires look like they’re in Trail Creek and Alder Creek — in those
areas that are significant.   
   
And I got — I have a simple question, and it’s a complicated one, but
what can we do for you that — that we’re just not getting done now? 
What additional help can we give you now that — that is not — not there
yet?  
   
I mean, cut through all the — all the jargon about, you know, all that
we policy wonks are talking about various programs.  Bottom line: What
do you need and can we help — you know, that we haven’t?  
   
GOVERNOR GIANFORTE:  Good morning, Mr. President, Madam Vice President. 
I want to thank you for the opportunity to join you, and I want to
answer your question because there are some things we can do to
collaborate and work closer together.  
   
Just to give a moment of background: As we meet this morning, our heroic
firefighters are confronting 19 largescale fires in Montana alone.   
   
And to put that in perspective: Just since January 1st, we’ve had 1,600
fires start in Montana and we’ve burned about 220,000 acres.  These
wildfires threaten the safety of our communities.   
   
That Poverty Flats fire that you mentioned, in the last week, burned
from initial start to 65,000 acres currently threatening 1,200
households out in the Big Horn County area, our first responders.  These
devastate our local communities and the costs keep mounting.  We’ve
spent — the state has spent $13 million since July 1st alone.   
   
It could have been much worse.  And this gets to your question, Mr.
President.  Without our state’s commitment — and we’ve shared this with
Forest Service and BLM, and they’ve been very cooperative — to
aggressive initial attack, Montana — without that commitment, we would
have had many more largescale fires.  And we ask that our federal
partners join us in applying this operating principle.  Whether it’s a
fire that starts on private, state, or federal land —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  
   
GOVERNOR GIANFORTE: — fires are easier to manage when they’re
smaller.   
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Mm-hmm.  
   
GOVERNOR GIANFORTE:  And when we get after them, we do much better.   
   
As we continue to confront this wildfire season, we’re also focused on
addressing Montana’s forest health crisis.  We published, earlier this
year, the Montana Forest Action Plan, which identifies 9 million acres
of forest land with significant forest health issues and an elevated
risk of wildfire.  Of those acres at risk, we found about 4 million
acres that would benefit most from cross-bounty \[sic\] — boundary
forest management.  
   
Given the need to actively manage our forests, I’ve charged our
Department of Natural Resources and Conservation to double the number of
acres it treats with active forest management this year at 25,000
acres.   
   
But this is just a starting point.  We’ll actively manage private,
state, and federal land with a variety of treatment types, including
thinning, logging, and prescribed burn.   
   
We’ve also invested in 14 different cross-boundary projects in Montana
this year.  These projects demonstrate the importance of working
together across ownership — ownership boundaries to create meaningful,
landscape-scale change.  And using funds from the state’s fire
suppression account and the Forest Service State and Private Forestry
Division, we’ll expand existing work and jumpstart new activities.  
   
But it’s not up, totally, to us.  We ask that our federal partners join
us in doing what needs to be done year-round to reduce the risk of
catastrophic wildfires.  
   
Of the 9 million acres at high risk, 60 percent of those are on federal
land.  This makes tools like the Good Neighbor Authority and stewardship
contracting more important than ever.  
   
The benefits are really clear: We have healthier forests, improved
wildlife habitats, more recreational opportunities, and more good-paying
jobs, and, most importantly, less severe wildfires.  Without active
forest management, we can’t be successful in our forest health
improvements.  
   
In closing, I just want to say — I want to thank our federal partners. 
We have good collaborative relationships here in Montana with the Forest
Service and BLM.  I also want to thank Governor Newsom and Governor Cox
for sending crews to help us deal with these fires that are currently
burning.  We have thousands of first responders on the frontlines, right
now, protecting our communities, natural resources, and livelihoods
across Montana, across the western United States.  
   
So many people have sacrificed, and I can’t thank them enough.  We can’t
measure it in dollars spent or acres burns — burned.  We have to keep
them and their loved ones in our thoughts and our prayers.  
   
I agree with you, Mr. President.  Now is the time to act.  I think it’s
all about aggressive initial attack and getting more proactive in our
forest management.  
   
Again, Mr. President, Vice President Harris, I want to thank you for
letting me join you today.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Greg, let me ask you another question, if I may. 
There’s press in the room, and lots of times, I know I do and we all do,
use terms which those of us who are in public office — whether it’s
President, Senator, Governor, et cetera — use, and I don’t think —
understandably, the American people don’t fully understand what they
mean.  And — and even I — sometimes the press has so much to cover, I’m
not sure they —  
   
You talked about the Forest Health Plan.  And talk about, as I say to my
staff all the time, in plain English, what’s that mean.  Explain a
little bit what that means.   
   
GOVERNOR GIANFORTE:  Sure.  So, we have many forests in Montana that
have not had good stewardship.  The growth has gotten to the point — I
can take you 10 miles west to the state capital in Helena and show you a
federal forest where 90 percent of the trees are standing dead.  They’ve
been killed by beetle when —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Right.  Right.  
   
GOVERNOR GIANFORTE:  And this really creates a tinderbox situation.  It
reduces habitat.  So. very — very little wildlife lives there.  And when
we get a lightning strike or a campfire out of control and a fire starts
in a forest like that, we put firefighters at risk.  They’re very hard
to control.   
   
The state has been very proactive.  We — the state has about 5 million
acres.  We’ve been very active in being stewards of those grounds.  And
when we thin a forest — this is not clear cuts —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Right.  
   
GOVERNOR GIANFORTE:  — but when we thin, when we remove excess fuels,
water comes back into surface streams, wildlife comes back into that
community.  And when wildfire goes through a managed forest, it doesn’t
then get into the crown.  It doesn’t burn as hot.  We don’t have the
devastation.  And structures aren’t threatened.  So everybody wins when
we have good stewardship of the forest.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s really important.  I — believe it or not, I knew
that.  But that’s really important for people to get it.  Because we
talk about thinning out the forest.  We’re talking about a lot of trees,
because of climate change as well, where you have bugs, insects, eating
up the trees as well, making things that — that are changing and killing
the forest themselves, and they become real tinder.  And it’s like, you
know, dropping a match in a — you know, in — almost like in a pool of
fuel.  
   
And so going in and cutting all that out is not the same as going in —
I’m glad you made the point of clear cutting — going in and just —  
   
So I — look, we do have, and we’re — I’m hopeful that we’re going to get
a lot of the infrastructure plan passed and the Recovery Act that has a
lot of money in here to help you all manage these forests and to have
much more money in there for the — for the Bureau of Land Management —
anyway — to be able to give you the help you need.  Because your state,
which I’ve been through, is a magnificently beautiful state.   
   
It’s — and, I mean — and the thing — you know, you — I come from the
state of Delaware.  And, you know, you had — we had more acreage burned
last year than the state of Delaware and Maryland combined — combined. 
For you all out in Montana, that ain’t (inaudible).  (Laughs.)  But I
want people to get a sense of how massive — how massive these fires are
and how they affect water systems and —  
   
Anyway, but that’s — I’m sorry to take your time, but I wanted you to be
able to explain that so people understand that are listening to this.   
   
Let me ask you — let me ask you, Governor Inslee: You know, you’ve been
talking about the impacts of environmental change for a long, long
time.  And one of the things — and I asked him to show me — to get me a
map of where all your fires are in your state.  And when you have
Delancy and Cub Creek 2 and Cedar Creek — I mean, they’re massive
fires.  Massive.   
   
And what are — you know, as you look at what’s transpired over the past
month and you look at the road ahead of this wildfire scene, what is
your biggest concern, Jay?  What is your biggest concern?  And again, I
ask you the same question: What is the thing we can do most?  I mean,
you go all the way from Delancy down to “Lil’ Crick,” as they say — in
the Creek — you know down in the southwest — southeast part of your
state.  What are — what are your biggest concerns?  
   
GOVERNOR INSLEE:  Well, first off, thanks for your leadership, Mr.
President.  It is so refreshing to have a President who really cares
about the Western Forest.  
   
My biggest concern might surprise you because all of the governors share
these immediate concerns.  We have a huge need for additional aerial
assets, additional dozer bosses so we can get our dozers into fire
lines.  We need new tra- — more trained people.  We do have an emerging
concern about our fuel supply for our aerial assets.  Everything we need
to fight forest fires is in dire need across the Western United States,
not just in Washington State.  We’ve had a thousand fires.  It’s burned
four times more at this time of year than normal.  We’ve had two and a
half times more acreage burn in the last decade than the previous.   
   
So those are the obvious concerns.  And everything you need to fight a
fire, we — we could use your help on.  And I think you’ve been totally
on top of this, and so I thank you for your leadership on all of these
things, including management issues.  There’s unanimity, there’s
bipartisan acceptance of the need for active management.  We’re acti- —
we’re managing our forests, just like Montana is, to try to get in and
reduce fuel.  
   
But here’s the surprising thing, when you asked me this question, or the
thing that I worry most about: The thing I worry most about is if, for
some reason, the Congress did not follow your leadership in this
reconciliation and infrastructure bills that allowed you to realize your
vision of creating millions of jobs while fighting climate change. 
That’s my biggest worry right now.  Because the fact of the matter is
there is nothing in human intervention against these fires while climate
continues to ravage our forest.  
   
You know, we used to think of these things are forests.  They really,
now, just fields of fuel, and they’re fields of fire with just one spark
because they’re so dry.  And that aridity creates something like
gasoline on the floor of our forest.   
   
There is only one way to prevent these forests from being gone in the
la- — in the next century effectively, to be totally unrecognizable, and
that is to succeed in following your vision in the reconciliation bill
for a clean energy standard, for a huge transition to the
electrification of our transportation fleet, to a civilian climate
corps.   
   
And so, I want to tell you we are going to be with you, as you stand
tall, while you negotiate this reconciliation bill to say, “Look, we
have to have those climate investments.  There is only one way to save
these forests from the ravages of climate.”   
   
Our own federal scientists have said that if we accept a one-degree
centigrade change, we’ll have 600 percent increase in these fires on a
regular basis.  We won’t recognize these forests as forests anymore
unless we succeed with your vision.  
   
So when you start having those discussions with Mr. Klain and Steve
Ricchetti and everyone else at the end of the reconciliation process,
you got to know you’re going to have an army behind you standing tall
for those things.  
   
Now, there’s some other small things that I’m talking to your staff
about, about having better independent assistance for towns like Malden
that burned down.  There’s some other coordination.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  
   
GOVERNOR INSLEE:  But that’s the thing that’s going to ultimately decide
whether these forests survive in the next century.   
   
Thanks for your leadership, Mr. President.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you for saying that.  But, you know, one of
the things that I say to all your colleagues: When I — when it was
proposed to me by some folks that we should have a Civilian Climate
Corps of thousands of young people trained to do these things and — at
first, it didn’t — you know, I said, “Yeah, yeah, that sounds good.” 
And then I started looking at it.   
   
And the truth of it is, it’s not fundamentally different, in terms of
the help it can provide across the board training a lot of these — I’m
talking about thousands of young people getting paid to be trained and
trained well for a very — it’s not — it’s not fundamentally different
than the Civilian Corps put together in the Depression that was — had a
different purpose.  They were building a building.  They were doing a
whole range of things.   
   
But I just think I’d encourage — and also, we’ll send it to all of you. 
But all you governors — Democrat, Republican — take a look at it and see
if you think I’m — you know, I may have — you know, as my mother would
say, my eyes are bigger than my stomach.  You know that I may have a
bigger appetite.  
   
But I — I really think it can — can be helpful.  And there — again, I
say to your colleagues, there’s a lot of money in here to be able to
deal with your immediate needs as well.  
   
But, anyway.  Thanks, Jay.  And I’ll get — I know you have this, but I
want to get —  
   
GOVERNOR INSLEE:  Thank you.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  — more of it to you.   
   
And, Gavin, I — or, Governor, you know, I applaud your your — your
establishing the Wildfire and Forest Resilience Task Force, which I’ve
learned is co-chaired by your Secretary of Natural Resources.  I think
it’s a great example of being able to coordinate federal, state, local
because this is getting real — this is — this is getting — this is —
this needs a lot of coordination.  
   
And I understand that PG&E, which provides electric to 17 million of
your folks — I understand they recently announced underground 10,000
miles of power lines.  Is that — is that true?  And what’s that going to
do to the cost of energy in your state?  And — I mean, because that’s
expensive stuff.  
   
GOVERNOR NEWSOM:  It’s a million to three and a half million dollars a
mile to —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  
   
GOVERNOR NEWSOM:  — underground in California.  Do the math on 10,000
miles.  
   
Of course, do the math on decades of neglect.  Ten thousand miles is a
drop in the bucket.  They have 106,000 miles of distribution line. 
Twenty-five thousand just in high-risk, fire-prone areas which will only
grow.  That’s a 10-year commitment.  It’s important, but I want to put
it in perspective.  
   
I also want to put something else in perspective.  Your eyes, Mr.
President, are not wider than your stomach.  California is proving your
theory.  Over a year and a half ago we established the Climate Corps in
this state.  It’s inspiring beyond words.  It’s also inspired the
philanthropic sector —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  It really is, isn’t it?  I mean, it’s not a joke.  It is
inspiring when you see it.  I mean, it’s incredible, I think.  But —  
   
GOVERNOR NEWSOM:  Absolutely.  And it’s the one thing this country needs
more than anything else, and that’s common experiences and to focus on
the things that bind us together, not just divide us.   
   
This transcends politics.  We have kids from urban and rural parts of
the state, across every conceivable difference, and they’re advancing
together in ways that truly are awe-inspiring.  
   
So, Mr. President, that’s — that’s a vision we can manifest.  We’re not
asserting it; we’re proving it.  
   
In a small way, you have the opportunity to do it in — at scale.   
   
Look, I just want to briefly — because there’s so many of us — a quick
update.  We’re blowing past every record, and not in a good way.  We’re
at over 5,700 fires year-to-date.  We suppressed 59 just yesterday with
some initial attacks.  Over half a million acres already burned in
California.   
   
To put in perspective — a record-breaking year.  Last year, we were at
130,000 acres burned.  We’re at 504,000 as I speak to you today.   
   
Here’s the answer to your question.  And forgive me for being so pointed
again, respecting your time, but I want to be a little bit more
specific.  
   
Jay referenced it obliquely.  Please pay attention to this fuels issue. 
We had to get our National Guard to get some emergency fuel supplies for
our aerial fleet a week ago.  This is a major issue, and it’s not just
impacting our aerial suppression strategies on the West Coast.  It’s
increasingly, as you may know, impacting commercial aviation.  It is a
major issue.   
   
Number two, we just simply need more boots on the ground.  We can’t do
without you.  We’ve got 7,400 people — 7,400 already.  We’re not in fire
season.  Fire season in California is late September, October, into
November.  We’re in July.  We already have 7,400 personnel actively
working to suppress fires.  
   
Last year, the federal government asked us for over 5,000 mutual aid
support that we could not provide.  That gives you a sense of what the
federal government wanted from California last year to send to other
states.  That should give you a sense of how far behind we are with
federal support.  
   
We have four DC-10s, Mr. President.  Four.  Now, DC-10s aren’t the
answer to every problem.  They don’t fly over 35 knots.  They have
restrictions; there are legendary restrictions.  But the reality is
there is four for the country, and we’re competing.  They’re all
contracted.  We compete with you.  We compete with other states.  We
don’t even have access right now to DC-10s.   
   
We lost that 747 — that iconic 747 — that now has been converted to a
cargo plane.  You’ve seen that in Australia, not just across the West
Coast.  That’s now been grounded by a private contractor.   
   
We are the largest civil aviation fleet for firefighting in the world —
California.  We do not come close to having the tools in the air that we
need.  We need your support to su- — to dramatically increase the aerial
support, in addition to boots on the ground.  
   
Final two quick points: Every year, we’re competing — and you have a lot
of legislators that have been doing heroic work in Democratic states,
governors — and Republican states — trying to get access to the Pentagon
satellite technology for early detection.  It’s been a game changer for
us.  And we’re getting it on a year-to-year basis, but it’s hard.  Every
year, we fight to get a one-year extension on that access to a critical
tool of technology.  
   
I’d encourage you to help us so we’re not just fighting every year for
something that I think you would support and the Pentagon, at the end of
the day, final analysis will approve.   
   
But here’s the final thing, and it’s the elephant in the room.  I was
with Governor Sisolak two days ago in his state of Nevada.  The reason
why is we had a fire that was on federal property.  Fifty-seven percent
of the forest property in California is federal, just three percent
under California jurisdiction.  Three percent.  Fifty-seven percent
under U.S. Forest Service.  U.S. Forest Service is spectacular.  We have
deep admiration and respect, but there’s a culture that, too often, is,
“Wait and see.”  We can’t afford that any longer.  This was a federal
fire.  They waited.  And what we saw is the fire took off because we
didn’t put enough initial assets.   
   
Greg was making an oblique point here.  I want to be a little bit more
explicit: We need your help to change the culture, in terms of the
suppression strategies, in this climate, literally and figuratively, to
be more aggressive on these federal fires.  
   
That fire bled into Nevada and, obviously, impacted not just our two
states, but deeply impacted the redundancy of this concern that comes
out every year around jurisdictions and incident command and the
imperative that we’re all on the same page, in terms of those initial
attack strategies.  
   
So, forgive me for being longwinded, but I wanted to get those clear —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, no that’s — that’s why we’re doing this.  I want to
find out what — what’s the greatest concerns you have.  
   
And I will — when this meeting is over, I will be on the phone with the
Department of Defense and talking about the access to satellite
capability.  
   
And — but — I’m looking down the list here.  All right, I will follow up
with you, Gov — or the Vice President will; she has a mild interest in
California — with all the points you just raised, and I — and I do
appreciate it.  
   
Now, I want to get to each one of you, but we’re going to ask the — I
think now is the time the press is going to leave the room.  Am I
correct?  
   
(Press is ushered out.)
