Oval Office

2:20 P.M. EDT  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, I’m honored to welcome the Prime Minister. 
We’ve known each other for some time.  And welcome to the White House,
welcome to the Oval, Mr. Prime Minister.   
   
Iraq has been a vital part for the — partner of the United States for
some time now in the Middle East.  And we’ve en- — I’ve engaged deeply
in Iraq for my entire career back in the Senate, as Vice President, and
as President.  And I’ve worked with Iraq to — and matter of fact, my son
Beau was in Iraq for a year with the Am- — with the Army National
Guard.   
   
And the sacrifices that so many — so many have made to build the
U.S.-Iraq partnership has been real, and it’s consequential.  And my
administration is committed to strengthening that partnership, Mr. Prime
Minister.  
   
And the U.S-Iraqi Strategic Dialogue is about commitments that expand
our cooperation on issues like healthcare, climate, energy.  For —
matter of fact, I wanted to tell you: I was told you — the half a
million — 500,000 — doses of COVID vaccine we’re sending — I was told
you were told they wouldn’t come for a while.  They’ll be there in a
couple of weeks.  
   
PRIME MINISTER AL-KADHIMI:  Thank you.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  They’ll be there quickly.  And — and, you know, we
support strengthening Iraq’s democracy, and we’re anxious to make sure
the election goes forward in October.  And we’re also committed to our
security cooperation.  Our shared fight against ISIS is critical for the
stability of the region.  And our counterterrorism cooperation will
continue, even as we shift to this new phase we’re going to be talking
about.  
   
I’m looking forward to consulting with the Prime Minister today.  We
have a lot to talk about.  He’s been a good friend.  And I’m anxious to
get going.  
   
Floor is yours, sir.  
   
PRIME MINISTER AL-KADHIMI:  Thank you, Mr. President.  It’s a great
honor to be here today with our American friends.  We have strategic
partnership.  I’m happy to be here in Washington to discuss the future
of our nation and how to improve this relation between our two
countries.  
   
America, they help Iraq.  Together we fight to defeat Daesh — ISIS.  And
I’d like to thank the American people on behalf of all Iraq’s people.  
   
Mr. President, I thank you for all the blood and treasure that America
has given for a free and democratic Iraq.  
   
Today, our relation is stronger than ever.  Our partnership exists for
economy, the environment, health, education, culture, and more.  
   
I’m looking forward to work with you, Mr. President, to bring our two
countries more closer for benefit of Iraq and United States.  
   
God bless our two countries.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you.  Thank you, folks.  
   
(Cross-talk by reporters.)  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa.
 Hang on a second.  If you want to talk about Iraq, ask me a question
about Iraq.  
   
Q    How many troops would you like to see in Iraq by the end of this
year?  And how does the relationship changes, considering this is the
last strategic dialogue that you have with Iraq and the Prime
Minister?  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  This most recent dialogue you mean.  
   
Q    Correct.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, we’ve been talking a lot.  Our foreign
ministers, our Cabinet members have been talking.  We’re looking forward
to seeing an election in October.  We’re working very hard with the
Iraqi government to make sure the U.N. and the GCC are — we have
oversight; that there’s — these are full and fair elections.  
   
I’ve been in — I’ve been in contact with Kadhimi.  I have — anyway, I
think things are going well.  Our role in Iraq will be as a — dealing
with not — it’s just to be available, to continue to train, to assist,
to help, and to deal with ISIS as it — as it arrives.  But we’re not
going to be, by the end of the year, in a combat mission.  
   
Q    Mr. President, Veterans Affairs.  Mr. President, Veterans Affairs
is going to have a mandate for its healthcare —  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  You are such a pain in the neck, but I’m going to
answer your question because we’ve known each other for so long. It has
nothing to do with Iraq.  
   
Q    I take that as a compliment, Mr. President.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  (Laughs.)  I’ll answer your question.  Yes, Veteran
Affairs is going to, in fact, require that all docs working in
facilities are going to have to be vaccinated.
