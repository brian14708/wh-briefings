Q    Do you have a plan to invite Polish President to the White House? 
Polish President.    
  
THE PRESIDENT:  The Polish President?  
  
Q    Yes.  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  No I haven’t yet.   
  
Q    Should Americans expect more — should Americans expect more
guidelines coming up, more restrictions because of COVID?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  In all probability. And, by the way, we had a good day

Q    Mr. President, you had talks with Russia in Geneva on arms
control.  Are you satisfied with those talks — how those went?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  They’re in process, and I’m hopeful.  
  
Thank you.
