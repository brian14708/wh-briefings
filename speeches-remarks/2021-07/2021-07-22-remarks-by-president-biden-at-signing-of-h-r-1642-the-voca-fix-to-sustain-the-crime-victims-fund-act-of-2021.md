East Room 

3:18 P.M. EDT   
   
(“Hail to the Chief” is played.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Every time I hear that, I wonder when he’s
coming.  (Laughter.)  Please, everybody sit down.  Thank you.  
   
Let me begin by doing something no speaker should ever do — by
apologizing.  I got a little tied up in that other office I work in,
Pat, and I apologize for keeping you waiting because I know you’re all
as equally busy as I am.  And I want to thank you.  
   
Today, I think is a day of hope.  And I mean that.  A day of hope and
healing for victims or crime and organizations that support those
victims of crime.  
   
And I want to thank the Vice President and the Second Gentleman,
Senators Durbin — I think he’s here; I thought I saw him.  Senators
Durbin and Baldwin and Grassley and Graham and Murkowski. 
Representatives Nadler and Fitzpatrick and Jackson-Lee and Wagner and
Scanlon.  And everyone who has helped make possible this moment,
including so many of you who are here today that I haven’t mentioned.  
   
When someone commits a crime, it’s — it’s not enough to bring the
predator to justice; we also need to support the victims.  And it’s
something that, way back — 150 years ago, when I was Chairman of the
Judiciary Committee, we spent a lot of time working on and setting up
victims’ funds.  That’s what this Crime Victims Fund does.   
   
In many years of working on the issue, I’ve visited an awful lot of
domestic violence shelters.  Every time I’d go into a city, I would
quietly — before I went to where I was supposed to be — quietly slip in
and spend time in a domestic violence shelter to speak to the people
giving the services of people getting the services.   
   
And, you know, many times, the body language that you’d see when you
walked in was one of the victims of crime finding themselves almost
curled up, Dianne, in a ball.  They were still suffering from a serious,
serious — not only physical abuse they received, but, quite frankly, the
emotional abuse.  And you can see the pain.  You can see the pain was
still with them, and you wondered when was this going to abate, no
matter what we did.  
   
According to the CDC — and I’m — I think Senator Feinstein remembers — I
got in trouble because when I was pushing the legislation, way back in
those days, I said, “I’m convinced that women who are victims of
domestic violence suffer from post-traumatic stress no different than a
solider being shot at regularly.”  You come home and every time your
significant other would come home, if dinner wasn’t ready, they smashed
your head against the wall.  There’s no — there’s no difference than
being shot at.   
   
And the CDFE \[sic\] — the CDC, two years later, came out and said,
“Survivors can experience mental health problems and such depression and
the symptoms of post-traumatic stress syndrome.”  Even before research
confirmed it, you could see it.   
   
And there are economic costs for survivors as well –medical costs, lost
productivity from work, and navigating the court system.  That’s why
Victims Compensation Program helps victims and their families cover the
costs they’d suffered from the crime.  They can — there can be
counseling and medical bills; lost wages because you couldn’t work;
paying for temporary housing for a family fleeing abuse; even fixing a
broken door kicked down by an abuser.  And, you know, the vast majority
of children out in the street are the children who are, in fact, the
children of abused women.  It can also be a long-term support survivors
need to heal, every time, in every single sense of the word.   
   
In 2019, these victim compensation funds went directly to over 230,000
victims — 230,000.  These funds also got to states, territories, and
Tribes to support thousands of victim services organizations.  These
organizations have provided services and support to over 13 million
survivors.   
   
And, by the way, last night, some of you heard me talk about the need
for more policing that understands the need for communities and
citizens.  These funds will also go to law enforcement agencies to
support training on how to respond to victims who have experienced
trauma.  
   
In 1984, I was proud to support the — the passage of the Victims of
Crime Act, and created — that created this fund.  I’m also proud to sign
the law that significantly strengthened it today.  This fund doesn’t
take a dime of taxpayers’ money; it uses fines and penalties paid by
convicted federal criminals. However, fines from what are called
“non-prosecutorial agreements” or defendant — or “deferred prosecution
agreements” did not go into this Victims Crimes Fund in the past.  
   
Since there’s been more and more of these agreements in recent years,
the fund is being depleted.  That meant dramatic cuts in the funding it
could provide for victims and for organizations to support these
victims.  
   
Between 2017 and today, the amount of money in these funds has gone down
92 percent, which has resulted in a 70 percent reduction in victims
assistance programs and grants.  This means that, for a lot of victims,
the help they need isn’t there any longer.   
   
When my son Beau was the Attorney General of the state of Delaware, he
took pride in getting more support more quickly to victims, especially
to protect and care for child victims.   
   
And I know that, as the San Francisco DA and the California Attorney
General, Vice President Harris expanded support for victims of crime and
launched one of the nation’s first medical centers focused on treating
childhood trauma caused by violence in a home or in a community.   
   
This bill is going to allow us to make — make sure that all the fines
and penalties that are from federal cases go into the victims — the
Crime Victims Fund to rebuild this fund, because it’s badly needed.   
   
This is going to enable us to provide more help and support to victims
of domestic violence, sexual assault, child abuse, trafficking, and
other crimes all across America.   
   
In order to provide more access and safety and services for victims of
gender-based violence, it’s long past time to re- — reauthorize and
strengthen the protections through the Violence Against Women Act. 
Please.  Please.  You know, you can — (applause).   
   
You know from experience you all can come together in a bipartisan,
bicameral way and to pass this bill.  We need to do the same thing to
reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act without further delay.  
   
You know, after these changes in the Victims Crime Act passed this week,
a leader from one of the state’s — state’s Coalition Against Domestic
Violence sent a letter to her national organization.  And she wrote
about working in the shelter where their ability to serve people rose
and fell based on the fundings of victim services.  She told the story
of a client she lost to domestic violence homicide because the budget
cuts left them without space at the shelter or staff needed to help this
particular woman.   
   
Upon learning about the law I’m about to sign today, she wrote, and I
quote — I quote, “I think about her every day.  This is going to be
truly lifesaving,” end of quote.  This is what you’ve done — truly
lifesaving.   
   
In closing, I want to thank those angels working on the frontlines to
help these victims, especially during this pandemic that’s made the work
both more difficult, more in demand, and more dangerous.  And I want to
thank the advocates who mobilized and bring together these important
changes in the law.   
   
There are thousands of people out there who may not know about the work
you did to get this bill passed, but they’ll know that they are getting
the help they need to put their lives back together and move toward
healing and toward justice.  I will now have the great honor of signing
the bill.  And I’d invite the sponsors to come on up and stand with me
if you’re willing.  (Applause.)  
   
(The act is signed.)  
   
This is one of those deals where what they did is literally, not
figuratively, going to change the lives of women and children and some
men out there.  So, thank you.  (Applause.)
