Q Mr. President, let me know if I can ask you a question.

THE PRESIDENT: Sure. (Laughter.)

Q Right now, sir?

THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.

Q With the most recent hack by the Russians, would you say that this
means that —

THE PRESIDENT: We’re not sure if it’s the Russians.

Q Okay with this most —

THE PRESIDENT: (Inaudible.) I got a brief on the — as I was on the
plane, that’s why I was late getting off the plane. I got a brief, and —

Q Do you know who it might be, sir?

THE PRESIDENT: I’ll be in better shape to talk to you about it — hang on
a second.

I’ll tell you what they sent me — okay? — that — the idea — first of
all, we’re not sure who it is for certain, number one. And what I did, I
directed the full resources of the — of the government to assist in the
response if we determine —

And the fact is that I directed the intelligence community to give me a
— a deep dive on what’s happened, and I’ll know better tomorrow. And if
it is, either with the knowledge of and/or a consequence of Russia, then
I told Putin we will respond. And — but —

Q You did tell him already, sir?

THE PRESIDENT: No. No. I haven’t called because we’re not — we’re not
certain. And the initial thinking was it was not the Russian government,
but we’re not sure yet. So —

Q Mr. President, do you think Sha’Carri — do you think Sha’Carri
Richardson’s ban — her temporary ban for marijuana, do you think that’s
fair, sir?

Q Could you tell us why you’re in Michigan today? What is it about
Michigan — coming on the eve of Independence Day, what brought you here?

THE PRESIDENT: Cherry pie.

Q Sir, do you think the ban is fair? Do you think her ban is fair for
marijuana?

THE PRESIDENT: Look, it’s the — the rules are the rules, and everybody
knows what the rules were going in. Whether they should remain that —
that should remain the rule is a different issue, but the rules are the
rules. And I was really proud of her, the way she responded.

And so — okay, thank you, guys.

Q Mr. President, one on Surfside. Did you have a comment on officials’
announcement today that they will have to demolish the remaining part of
the tower?

THE PRESIDENT:  No, I don’t.  I have not been briefed by FEMA on whether
or not that is — why is that they’ve reached that decision.
