St. Regis Hotel  
Surfside, Florida

4:29 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, folks.  Let me begin by saying that the
degree of cooperation between local, state, and federal officials down
here has been remarkable.   
   
I want to thank our FEMA Director for leading this national effort.  
But Governor DeSantis, Senators Rubio and Scott, Congresswoman Debbie
Wasserman Schultz, and Mayor Cava –- Cava — they’ve been — they’ve all
cooperated in ways that I haven’t seen in a long time.  And it’s really
a testament to — to what’s — how difficult things are down here.  And
it’s what, quite frankly, we miss a lot.  You know, we all — we’ve all
been working in tandem from the moment we got the news of the collapse
of the building.   
   
And I think my colleagues will tell you we cut through the bureaucracy. 
The one — the one order I gave federal folks was, “No bureaucracy.  Just
cut through it.  Get to whatever they need.”  
   
That’s why we’ve decided to cover, for example, 100 percent of the
search-and-rescue costs for the first 30 days.  Not done often but
necessary here, in my view.   
   
And FEMA is going to provide temporary housing and other urgent needs
for the survivors.  The State Department is expedi- — expediting visas
for family members from other countries — and there are from Latin
America, South America, Europe, Israel.  
   
And I want to give a special shout-out to the first responders —
International Association of Firefighters, one of the best organizations
in the country.  And I particularly want to thank the president.  Ed
came down from Boston, and he’s here with the entire — with the entire
group.   
   
You know, these folks are — these folks are always showing up, no matter
what.  They’re risking their lives.  You know, there’s that old
expression.  I know, the press that travels with me is tired of hearing
me saying it, but I’m not tired of saying it.  And that is — that old
expression — “God made man.  Then he made a few firefighters.”  They’re
remarkable, remarkable people.  There’s always — they’re always risking
their lives to save lives, as well as the police and other first
responders.  I got to meet with a whole bunch of them.   
   
And we are able to deploy nearly 500 personnel, including five other
search-and-rescue teams on the ground today here because of — our FEMA
Director ordered it.  
   
     I want to compliment FEMA and, I might add, all those folks who are
risking their lives to save lives, but also holding out hope that others
will be found.  Hope springs eternal.  
   
     When I talked to those first responders, I pointed out that they’re
under a great deal of stress and we should take advantage — they should
take advantage of the mental health facilities that are going to be
available.  Because, you know, we talk about our military suffering from
post-traumatic stress.  Well, seeing what they’re seeing and doing what
they’re doing, understanding how — how much trauma is involved, I just
don’t want them thinking that they should walk away from help if it’s
needed.  You know, they stand together, and it’s really impressive.   
   
And there’s also the need, in addition to state and local assistance, to
determine the cause of this collapse — and the adjacent buildings, how
safe they are.  
   
There are two outstanding concerns.  First, the remaining buildings may
collapse — the remainder of the building may collapse.  We need to
determine if it’s safe for first responders to return to the site to
continue their rescue mission.   
   
That’s being done right now.  And that’s why I asked the National
Institute of Standards and Technology — NIST — to investigate, to see if
it’s safe to go back and what caused the building to collapse in the
first place.  Because we’re committed not only to recover, but to
restore the safety across the board.   
   
But the other reason I came down was to meet with the families.  The
whole nation is mourning with these families.  They see it every day on
television.  They’re going through hell.  And those who’ve survived the
collapse, as well as those who are missing loved ones.  
   
I realize I’m a little late because I spent a lot of time with the
families — a whole lot of time.  And I apologize for taking so long to
get here, because I thought it was important to speak to every single
person who wanted to speak to me.  So, after what you all covered when I
opened up the — the meeting, I spent the remainder of the time, and I —
and such incredible people.   
   
I sat with one woman who had just lost her — her husband and her little
baby boy; didn’t know what to do.  I sat with another family that lost
almost the entire family: cousins, brothers, sisters.  And to watch them
and to — the — they’re praying and pleading that, “God, let there be a
miracle.  Let them be something happen for me that’s good.”   
   
Because I have, like many of you do, some idea what it’s like to suffer
that kind of loss so many of them are suffering.   
   
You know, they had basic heart-wrenching questions: “Will I be able to
recover the body of my son or daughter, my husband, my cousin, my mom
and dad?  How can I have closure without being able to bury them if I
don’t get the body?  What do I do?”  
   
Jill and I wanted them to know that we’re with them and the country is
with them.  Our message today is that we’re here for you, as one
nation.  As one nation.  And that’s the message we communicated.   
   
We’ll be in touch with a lot of these families continuing through this
process.  But there is much more to be done.  We’re ready to do it.   
   
And again, I thank the governor, I thank my colleagues, my — Senator
Scott and Senator Rubio, I thank Debbie Wasserman Schultz for their
total, complete cooperation.  There’s no — there’s no disagreement, no
bickering.  Everybody is on the same team.  It’s what America is all
about.  It’s about pulling together, leaving nobody behind.  And that’s
what made me feel — the one thing that made me feel good about this is
the — is a cohesion that exists.  There’s no Democrat or Republican out
there; they’re just people wanting to do the right thing for their
fellow Americans.   
   
So, may God bless the victims and their families.  And may God protect
our first responders.   
   
And I’ll take a couple questions right now.   
   
Q    Mr. President, what were you told today about the likelihood — you
said, “Hope springs eternal” — but that somebody will be able to be
pulled out alive from this?  And what were you able to convey to the
families about that possibility?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, look, first of all, the families are very
realistic.  They know the longer it goes — and one of the things that
the local FEMA personnel as well as the local first responders did is
they took all of the families to the site to see — to see what it looked
like up close.  And they’re all realists.  They all look, and they see
those floors just literally feet — cement upon cement upon cement.   
   
You know, I — when I talked to some of the families, some of the people
who did escape, survived, and got out, they talked about watching the
building collapse and watching as they were in the garage — one floor
come down — literally a whole floor on top of another floor.  They know
that the chances are, as each day goes by, diminished slightly.  
   
But at a minimum — at a minimum — they want to recover the bodies.  They
want to recover the bodies.  There’s a lot of very religious people who
are in there.  Members of the — the rabbis in the Jewish community were
talking about the need to make sure that they recover the body and be
able to bury them.  Give them — and, you know, the — anyway.   
   
So, I think they’re very realistic, Mike.  But — but I don’t think that
that, in any way, suggests that it’s too — that we should stop.  I think
that we should move on, continue to try to recover the bodies.  
   
In the meantime, that’s why NIST and others are determining whether or
not it’s safe to send the first responders back.  When they’d asked me
about this, I’d point out that the last thing they would want and we
would want is, in the process of trying to recover — and the possibility
— there’s still a possibility someone could be alive, someone could
still be breathing, someone could be there — that the last thing you
want to have happen is have that building collapse and kill 10, 20, 30,
50 firefighters or wound them, or first responders.  
   
So — but Mike, they’re — you know, they’re realistic.  I — it just
brought back so many — so many memories.  It’s bad enough — it’s bad
enough to lose somebody.  But the hard part — the really hard part is to
not know whether they’re surviving or not — just not have any idea.  
   
When the accident took my wife and my family, the hardest part was: Were
my boys going to get out?  Are they going to make it?  And not knowing. 
Not knowing, when you’re flying home from Washington to get the news. 
You know, you just don’t know.  So, it’s —  
   
But I was amazed — as you know, unfortunately, I’ve done a lot of these
circumstances where I’ve met with families who have had great loss.  And
what amazed me about this group of people was the resilience and their
absolute commitment, their willingness to do whatever it took to find —
to find an answer.  I walked away impressed by their strength.  And —  
   
And Nancy, Bloomberg — do you have a question?   
   
Q    Yeah —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I was told.   
   
Q    Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  What did you learn, if anything, about the
collapse of the building?  Is there anything more you learned from
investigators or the FEMA administrators (inaudible)?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, it’s underway.  I don’t — and the director of FEMA
is with me here.  We don’t have any firm proof of what’s happened. 
There’s all kinds of rational speculation about whether or not the
rebars are — were — were rusted; whether or not the cement — whether it
was limestone or not; whether or not —  
   
But a lot of the — a lot the families who survived talked about how
upset they were that, in the last years that they’ve been here, how
there was one condominium complex built across the street and a road was
purchased.  And while they were living there, they would hear the
drilling and they’d feel their building moving and shaking.   
   
There are all kinds of discussions about whether or not they thought
that water level rising — what impact it had.  And interesting to me — I
didn’t raise it — but how many of the survivors and how many of the
families talked about the impact of global warming.  How much — and they
didn’t know exactly, but they talked about sea levels rising and about
how — how there were — and — and the combination of that and the concern
about incoming storm — incoming tropical storms.   
   
And so — but I don’t think there is, at this point, any definitive
judgment as to why it collapsed and what can be done to prevent it from
happening and what other buildings may have to be inspected to determine
if they have the same problems.   
   
I’m supposed to head out and catch up with the governor.  So I want to
thank you all for taking the time.   
   
Q    Mr. President, can we ask you about two matters away from where we
are now?  The first is: While you’ve been speaking, a top associate of
the former President has been in a New York court, pleading not guilty
to various financial charges.  Do you have a reaction to that?   
   
And secondarily, if I can, does the Supreme Court’s ruling today on an
important voting rights decision add to the sense of urgency you feel
about pursuing voting rights legislation at this time?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I know nothing about the first circumstance because I’ve
been gone.  I don’t have any idea, so I’m not going to comment on that. 
And even if I did, I wouldn’t comment on an ongoing case if it’s an
ongoing case.   
   
With regard to the second point: I think I did get a summary on the way
down on the plane of the Supreme Court decision.  It is mildly positive,
in the sense that there’s a remedy available based on the particular
voting decision.   
   
I think that it is critical that we make a distinction between voter
suppression and suspension.  The ability of a state legislative body to
come along and vote — their legislature — vote to change who is declared
the winner, I find to be somewhat astounding.   
   
But the Supreme Court rule did not rule that way today, to the best of
my knowledge.  And — but I’ll have much more to say about that because I
plan on speaking extensively on voting rights and — as well as going on
the road on this issue.   
   
So thank you all very much.
