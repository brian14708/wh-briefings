(July 21, 2021)

8:01 P.M. EDT  
      
THE PRESIDENT:  How you doing, pal?  Good to see you.   
   
MR. LEMON:  Good to see you.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Good to see you.  
   
MR. LEMON:  How you been?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  (Laughter.)  
   
MR. LEMON:  It’s good to see you.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  It’s good to be back.  
   
MR. LEMON:  Yeah, you as well.  
   
So, listen, I’m going to get to the audience.  And I know you don’t want
to sit down, right?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No.  
   
MR. LEMON:  You’d rather stand here and talk to these guys.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m going to go out in the audience.  (Laughs.)  
   
MR. LEMON:  We’re going to get to the audience questions in just a
moment.  But I have a couple questions I want to ask you.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.  
   
MR. LEMON:  Because you know the pandemic is a big concern for everyone,
really, around the world —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Sure is.   
   
MR. LEMON:  — especially around America.  New cases are up three — you
know, three times since last month.  Right?  The pandemic is a big
concern.  Hospitalizations, death rising.   
   
So, you said last month that this — that the virus is in retreat.  Do
you still feel that way?  Is that still the case?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, the virus — look, here’s the — it’s real simple:
We have a pandemic for those who haven’t gotten a vaccination.  It’s
that basic, that simple.  Ten thousand people have recently died; 9,950
of them, thereabouts, are people who hadn’t been vaccinated.   
   
There’s a simple, basic proposition: If you’re vaccinated, you’re not
going to be hospitalized, you’re not going to be in an ICU unit, and
you’re not going to die.   
   
So it’s gigantically important that you act like — we all act like
Americans that care about our — our fellow Americans.  To get — there’s
legitimate questions people can ask — that they worry about getting
vaccinated — but the questions should be asked, answered, and people
should get vaccinated.   
   
But this is not a pandemic.  We’ve made sure that since I got in office,
we — we’ve inoculated over 160 million people; 85 percent of people over
the age of 50.  (Applause.)  Anyway.   
   
It’s frustrating.  
   
MR. LEMON:  But what do you say to people who are worried about a new
round of restrictions and mask mandates and so forth?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’m saying — look — (laughs) — it’s a little bit
like when I got elected.  You know, the — this pandemic was out of
control.  You know, we’ve lost more people in the United States — over
630-some-thousand people than in every major war we’ve ever fought, in
the United States of America.  And that’s come to a screeching halt for
those who’ve been vaccinated.  It really has.  Not a joke.  This is
overwhelming evidence to sustain that.   
   
And so, what I say to people who are worried about a new pandemic is:
Get vaccinated.  If you’re vaccinated, even if you do catch the “virus,”
quote, unquote — like people talk about it in normal terms — you’re in
overwhelm- — not many people do.  If you do, you’re not likely to get
sick.  You’re probably going to be symptomless.  You’re not going to be
in a position where you — where your life is in danger.   
   
So, it’s really, kind of, basic.  
   
Q     Well, let’s get to the questions, Mr. President.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  
   
Q     Okay.  I want to introduce you to Andrea Granieri.  She’s a
community resource director for a charter school.  She’s a Democrat
currently running for her local school board.  
   
Andrea, welcome.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  God love you.  The most important, thankless job in the
world: being on a school board.  
   
Q     Thank you.  So, here in Hamilton County, the vaccination rate
remains at about 50 percent — and you talked about the virus that’s
spreading.  Masks are seen less and less.  And, as you know, children
under age 12 still are not eligible to be vaccinated.  Schools are
working with all of this information as they think about reopening next
month.  As a school employee and as a parent to children under age 12,
what — I’m really concerned.  What is your message to those parents,
educators, and school districts?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I understand your concern.  I really do.  My children
are grown now, but my grandchildren — and I have one who’s only
one-and-a-half years old.  So, you know, I understand — number one.   
   
My message is that one of the reasons why — you remember the criticism I
got initially, saying, “Teachers should get vaccination, get in line
first.”  The vast majority of teachers are vaccinated, number one.   
   
Number two, the CDC is going to say that what we should do is, everyone
over the age of — under the age of 12 should probably be wearing a mask
in school.  That’s probably what’s going to happen.  
   
Secondly, those over the age of 12 who are able to get vaccinated — if
you’re vaccinated, you shouldn’t wear a mask.  If you aren’t vaccinated,
you should be wearing a mask.  
   
So it’s going to get a little bit tight in terms of, “Well, are mom or
dad being honest that, you know, Johnny did or did not get vaccinated?” 
That’s going to raise questions.  But I think what’s going to happen is
you’re going to see this work out in ways that people are going to know
in the community.  Everybody knows in the community whether or not
Johnny really did get the vaccination when he’s 15 or 17 years old.   
   
And so it’s going to — I think it’s — it’s a matter of community
responsibility, and I think you’re going to see it work through.   
   
MR. LEMON:  Well, let me ask — let me follow up on her question, asking:
When will children under 12 be able to get vaccinated?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Soon, I believe.  Now, look, one of the things that I
committed to do when I got elected — I said —  
   
MR. LEMON:  How soon is “soon,” Mr. President?  Not to —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I — and let me he- — let me finish the question —
the answer.  “Soon” in the sense that I do not tell any scientists what
they should do.  I do not interfere. (Applause.)  
   
And so they are doing — they are doing the examinations now — the
testing now, and making the decision now.  When they are ready, when
they’ve done all the scientific need to be done to determine children at
ages 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, they, in fact, are — all have different
makeups.  They’re developing.  They’re trying to figure out whether or
not there’s a vaccination that would affect one child that’s at such and
such an age and not another child.  That’s underway.   
   
Just like the other question, there’s a logical — and I’ve heard you
speak about it because you always — I’m not being solicitous, but you —
you’re always straight up about what you’re doing.   
   
And the question is whether or not we should be in a position where you
are — why can’t the — the — the experts say, “We know that this virus
is, in fact — it’s going to be…” — or, excuse me — “We know why all the
drugs approved are not temporarily approved, but permanently approved.” 
That’s underway too.  I expect that to occur quickly.  
   
MR. LEMON:  Well, that means — you mean for the FDA?   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  For the FDA.  
   
MR. LEMON:  Yeah.  So, what do you —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  The Federal Drug Administration.  
   
MR. LEMON:  You said that you’re talking to scientists, though, but what
— what are they telling you, Mr. President?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  What they’re telling me is, “Let us decide, based on
scientific data, in how we proceed.  Do it the way we would ordinarily
do it.”   
   
Look, for example, everybody talks about how, you know, this virus came
— this — this — the drugs that are designed to kill the virus came along
so quickly.  They’ve been working on it for two decades.  There’s
nothing quick about this.  It’s been over two decades.   
   
So people said, “I’m not taking a drug that was approved so quickly.” 
It’s been two decades.  The truth is we haven’t said it enough to people
to allay their feals \[sic\].  There’s nothing — their fears.  This is
nothing that just happened yesterday and they said, “Well, let’s take a
shot on this.”  And there’s a process.  Usually the process takes the
better part of a year or more to get some of these things decided.   
   
But the expectation — they’re not promising me any specific date — but
my expectation, talking to the group of scientists we put together —
over 20 of them, plus others in the field — is that sometime maybe in
the beginning of the school year — at the end of August, beginning of
September, October — they’ll get a final approval saying the FDA said,
“No, this is it.  It’s good.”  
   
But again, one last thing.  I — we don’t talk enough to you about this,
I don’t think.  One last thing that’s really important is: We’re not in
a position where we think that any virus — including the Delta virus,
which is much more transmissible and more deadly in terms of non —
unvaccinated people — the vi- — the various shots that people are
getting now cover that.  They’re — you’re okay.  You’re not going to —
you’re not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations.   
   
MR. LEMON:  Yeah.  I want to stay on the subject.  I want to get to Dr.
Nicole Baldwin.  She’s a pediatrician and a Republican.  
   
Dr. Baldwin, go ahead.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Doc, how are you?  
   
Q     Hi.  Thank you for taking my question, Mr. President.  I am a
pediatrician who utilizes social media to educate about health.  And I’m
very concerned about the rise in misinformation from the anti-vaccine
community that is eroding trust in lifesaving vaccines.  Spread of this
misinformation and declining vaccination rates could leave Americans
vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases in the future.   
   
So, what I want to know is: What is the White House doing to combat
medical misinformation and to restore America’s faith in science?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  What we’re doing is, number one, to restore America’s
faith in science is listen to the scientists.  (Applause begins.)  No,
I’m not joking.  (Applause.)  I mean, literally listen to the
scientists, and not interfere, not rush anything.  Just make — let the
scientists proceed, because they desperately want to get this right —
number one.  
   
Number two, you may have heard — I never get myself in trouble, as you
know, politically — (laughs) — but you may have heard that I was
critical of some of the things that are on Facebook, and it was that I
was attacking Facebook.  I wasn’t attacking Facebook.  There was a
report out saying that for that — something like 45 percent of the
overwhelming disinformation on Facebook comes from 12 individuals.  I
said: They’re killing people — those 12 individuals; that misinformation
is going to kill people.  Not a joke.  Not a joke.   
   
It’s like telling your kid, “I tell you what…” — four years old — “…when
you see a red light, cross the street.”  I mean, come on.  
   
And so, what we’re trying to do is use every avenue we can — public,
private, government, non-government — to try to get the facts out, what
they really are.  And one of the things, Doc, that’s happening, that I’m
feeling better about — I’m not being a wise guy now.  You know, you —
one of those other networks is not a big fan of mine.  (Laughter.)   One
you talk about a lot.  
   
But if you noticed, as they say in that southern part of my state,
“They’ve had an altar call,” some of those guys.  (Laughter.)  All of a
sudden, they’re out there saying, “Let’s get vaccinated.  Let’s get
vaccinated.”  The very people who before this were saying —  
   
So that — but that — I shouldn’t make fun.  That’s good.  It’s good. 
It’s good.  We just have to keep telling the truth.  That’s why — for
example, my wife just flew to Alaska today to do an event in Alaska
about making sure people understand and get vaccinated, talking about
COVID, et cetera.   
   
So it’s — you know.  And, by the way, there’s pockets.  If you notice,
there’s about — what? — four or five states that have close to 45
percent or whatever.  Don’t hold me to the exact number.  
   
MR. LEMON:  Lower than that, even.  In my home state of Louisiana, it’s
36 percent, and I think there are other southern states.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, but I mean, out of all the cases —  
   
MR. LEMON:  Yeah.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  — all the cases, a very overwhelming majority of those
cases are in four or five states.  And it’s just not — there’s nothing
political about this.  There’s no blue or red.  (Applause.)   
   
MR. LEMON:  Well, let’s bring in Christian Oliver.  He’s a Democrat.  He
works for the insurance industry.   
   
Christian, what’s your question?  
   
Q    Well, so, my wife Stephanie and I are newlyweds, as of this past
Saturday.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’d brag if I were you too.  (Applause.)  
   
As they say when they look at me and my wife: “You married up, kid.” 
(Laughter.)  
   
Q    (Laughs.)  Thank you.  
   
We require all of our guests and vendors to be vaccinated to ensure
safety.  We are African American, and in many of our communities, people
are against the vaccine.  A reason that stood out the most in regards to
our guests is that they don’t see the vaccine as being as safe as the
CDC put it — puts it out to be.  How are you working toward convincing
those in these communities that the vaccine is safe?   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  It’s really an important question because, in the
African American community, there is less of an uptake of the
vaccination.  Number one, there’s a reason for that: You know, you go
back just to even World War Two.  African Americans were used as
experimental; they were almost like guinea pigs in terms of ex- — they
were — anyway.   
   
And your mom and dad remember that, or your grandparents remember that. 
And so there’s a reason for people to think that, “I don’t know, I’m not
sure I trust.  I’m not sure I trust this.”  Plus, a lot of
disinformation on top of it.   
   
One of the things that we’re doing is what I’ve done — “we’ve” done,
excuse me — my team has done — is we’ve provided the ability to put in
African American communities the vaccine and those who are, in fact,
able to administer the vaccine, and people who are respected in the
community, in the vacc- — in those areas, particularly in areas where
you have public health commu- — public health centers, where you, in
fact, have people who are the folks who are really at the low end of the
economic scale, don’t have much access to anything.   
   
So we’ve taken literally mobile vans and people to the communities, to
the hardest-hit communities, and it’s beginning to have some impact. 
But we have to talk about it more.   
   
For example, I was just with — I get in trouble because my wife is a
Philly girl and a Philly fan, an Eagles fan.  I just hosted the Tampa
Bay Buccaneers.  And — and there’s a guy — there’s a quarterback there. 
What’s his name, man?  (Laughter.)   
   
Anyway, all kidding aside, you know, what we’re doing is getting people
of consequence, who are respected in the community — whether they’re
athletes, whether or not they are entertainers, whether they’re just
well respected.  And, by the way, one of the things I’ve gotten able to
get done: I’ve get — I have overwhelming support from the African
American clergy that I sort of come from, and my so- — support.  They
are opening up their churches for — as vaccination centers. 
(Applause.)  
   
MR. LEMON:  Can I ask you something, Mr. President?  Because, you know —
and, by the way, you got — I don’t know if you heard that you got
applause when you corrected the “I” for “we.”  And we’re talking about
“we,” and I think that’s —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, it is “we.”   
   
MR. LEMON:  — a commendable attribute to have.   
   
But even with my own family — I was just able to get with them.  I
haven’t seen my mom in a year and a half, except for two weeks ago.  I
hadn’t seen my family for two years since the last time they visited me
two summers ago.  But even within my own family — here I am on
television every night — there is ambivalence, there’s misinformation,
and there’s also mistrust in the system.  How do you fix that?   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think — you’re going to — this is going to seem
like a non-answer to start with.  One of the things I said when I ran
for office — it’s not Democrat or Republican again — is we got to
restore faith in government.  You got to get people to a point where
they trust government.   
   
And I made a commitment that when I made a mistake, I’d tell you I’ve
made mistakes.  And when I think I got it right, I’ll say it.  But I’ll
take responsibility for what I do and say.   
   
Part of it is just generally — (applause) — no, I don’t mean that — part
of it is, generally, raising confidence in elected officials.  Raising
confidence.  And I know this is going to sound like a non-answer to you,
but part of this is that, you know — you know because you’re one of the
most informed journalists in the country.  You know the criticism I got
when I said I’m going to unite the country.  They said, “You can’t unite
the country.”  Well, if we can’t unite the country, we can never get
some of these problems solved.   
   
And that goes to trust.  Why can’t you unite the country?  Why isn’t
there a willingness to trust?  Government trust is really at a — was at
an incredibly low ebb.  It’s coming up some.   
   
So with regard to your family in particular.  Part of it is not just
that they see you on television and trust you; the people who seem to
have the most impact are the — are, you know, that — for that
17-year-old kid, the kid that he or she plays ball with.  “You got the
vaccination?  Are you okay?  I mean, you seem…”  “No, it works.”  Or
you, you know — or the mom and dad, or the neighbor, or when you go to
church, or when you’re — no, I really mean it.   
   
There are trusted interlocutors.  Think of the people — if your kid
wanted to find out whether or not there were — there’s a man on the
moon, or whatever — you know, something, or, you know, whether those
aliens are here or not — you know, who are the people they talk to
beyond the kids who love talking about it?  They go to people they
respect, and they say, “What do you think?”  
   
And so they should be asking other people — the people there —
everything from their teachers to their ministers to the priest, to
people that they trust.  
   
MR. LEMON:  Well, part of it is that — don’t you think part of it is
that young people, especially those who are 30 — maybe 30, 40 and under,
they feel like they’re invincible; they haven’t faced mortality.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Isn’t it amazing we’re saying “40 or younger”? 
(Laughter.)  It’s hard to say, isn’t it?  
   
MR. LEMON:  It is.  But for them, you know, at first, the va- — at
first, the virus wasn’t affecting them as much.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  
   
MR. LEMON:  And so they may feel that they’re invincible.  And now that
this Delta variant is affecting them, maybe they’ll have a “come to
Jesus” of some sort.  I’m —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, by the way, I think that is — that’s happening. 
And, look, think about this:  This is the worst health crisis in 100
years.  As I said, more people have died than all our major wars
combined.  Think about that.   
   
If I told you that or you had told me that two years ago, I’d say, “Come
on.  That’s not going to happen in America.”  But it happened.  It
happened.  And people are unfortunately — some more slowly than others
—  
   
Now, by the way, remember when I first got elected, the issue was, well,
I said I was going to do a million shots a week, and people said, “Biden
can’t do that” or “Biden team can’t do that.”  And it was 2 million.  We
had trouble getting enough people — and people who wanted to get
vaccinated.  We’re opening up stadiums.  We’re getting 100,000 people
coming through.   
   
So, the vast majority of the American people said, “I understand.  I
want to get this vaccination.”  But now, when the — when it’s phased
off, either “I’m invincible, I’m young, I’m not going to get sick, it
won’t happen to me” — or whatever the reason — now they’re looking
around and they’re saying, “Whoa, boy.  In the community I live in,
there’s very few people who have gotten the vaccination.  This COVID is
much more transmissible; it’s really rising.  I better get some…”  
   
So, I think it’s gradually changing.  And you got a great dog there,
kid.  (Laughter.)  
   
Q    (Inaudible.)  (Off-mic.)  
   
MR. LEMON:  By the way, that is Danielle Lippi.  She’s a student here at
the university, and she’s a Republican.  She’s got a question for you. 
Go ahead, Danielle.  
   
Q    Yes.  Okay.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  But your dog is a Democrat — I can tell.  (Laughter and
applause.)  I’m teasing.  I’m teasing.  I’m a big dog person.  I’m
sorry.  
   
Q    Her name is Wonder.  (Laughs.)  
   
So, my question is: The economy is picking up significantly as it
reopens from the pandemic.  Are you concerned about the higher inflation
prices, especially as we see gasoline, automotive, and food prices
increase rapidly?  What is your administration doing to help prevent the
economy from overheating, such as the poor and middle class are not hurt
by the higher prices of goods in the long run?   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  First of all, the good news is the economy is picking up
significantly.  It’s rational, when you think about it.  The cost of an
automobile bill, it’s kind of back to what it was before the pandemic. 
We compare what the prices were for the last year in the pandemic, and
they are up.  They’re up because, in fact, there was not much to call
for.  
   
For example, automobiles: You know, you had the rental car companies
selling off their entire stock.  You found yourself in the same way with
automobile dealers.  And all of a sudden, now it’s coming back, and
we’re going to grow at 7 percent — is expected.  We created more jobs in
the first six months of my — our administration than any time in
American history.  No President has ever — no administration has ever
created as many jobs.  And all of a sudden, people are saying —
(applause) — no, I don’t say it — but it goes to the legitimate question
being asked about the concern about inflation.   
   
The vast majority of the experts, including Wall Street, are suggesting
that it’s highly unlikely that it’s going to be long-term inflation
that’s going to get out of hand.  There will be near-term inflation
because everything is now trying to be picked back up.  
   
And, by the way, that’s one of the reasons why I also signed an
executive order dealing with the whole idea of competition — you know,
the idea that we’re in a situation where there are so many companies who
are keeping people out of the competition.  For example, you have over
600,000 people out there signing — 6 million people signing a — I better
check the number — of — signing non-compete agreements.  Not because
they have any sta- — any secret, but because they were working for one
fast food restaurant, and they’re told they can’t get 10 cents more
going across town going to the other fast food restaurant.  Why?  To
keep wages down.  
   
And so what’s happening now is, all of a sudden, people are having
choices.  You know, I always thought the free market system was not only
that there’s competition among companies, but, guess what?  Companies
should have to compete for workers.  Guess what?  Maybe even pay more
money.  (Applause.)   
   
MR. LEMON:  So, you seem pretty confident that inflation is temporary. 
But if you’re pumping all of this money into the economy, couldn’t that
add to —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, look, here’s the deal: Moody’s, today, went out — a
Wall Street firm, not some liberal think tank — said if we passed the
other two things I’m trying to get done, we will, in fact, reduce
inflation.  Reduce inflation.  Reduce inflation — because we’re going to
be providing good opportunities and jobs for people who, in fact, are
going to be reinvesting that money back into all the things we’re
talking about, driving down prices, not raising prices.   
   
And so, it is — I sincerely mean this: Prices are up now, and they’re up
in — for example, you’re in a position where you’re trying to build a
house, trying to find two-by-fours and lumber.  Well, guess what? 
People stopped working cutting lumber.  They stopped doing it because
they — the unemployment was so down.   Now, all of a sudden, there’s
this need because people are coming back.  And guess what?  Instead of
paying 10 cents, you’re paying 20.  But you understand what I’m
saying.  
   
MR. LEMON:  Yeah.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  It relates to what, in fact, is now needed because we’re
growing.  I don’t know anybody, including Larry Summers — who’s a friend
of mine — who’s worried about inflation, is suggesting that there’s any
long-term march here if we do the things we’re going to do.   
   
For example, if we get this build on that I’ve been — put together a
long time ago — and, by the way, I want to say, I’m in his territory. 
You know, there’s — Portman is a good man.  Portman is a congressman
from this area.  I talked to him before I got — and I really mean it. 
He’s a decent, honorable man, and he and I are working on trying to get
this — this infrastructure bill passed.  
   
MR. LEMON:  But you’re — you’re talking about Senator Rob Portman of
Ohio?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, I’m sorry.  I —  
   
MR. LEMON:  No, but —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I thought that (inaudible).  I apologize.  
   
MR. LEMON:  Yeah, but — no, since you — you mention that infrastructure,
the bipartisan infrastructure deal failed the procedural vote today. 
Right?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  But — no —  
   
MR. LEMON:  In the Senate today.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, it did.  But that’s irrelevant.  
   
MR. LEMON:  Go on.  Okay.   
   
In the Senate, negotiators say that they need more time.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  
   
MR. LEMON:  Okay.  So, then — but they’re expected to vote again on
Monday, but how much time do you think that they need to get this
done?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Until Monday.  (Laughter.)  Look — no, I’m not being
facetious.  I’m not being facetious.  You had up to 20 Republicans sign
a letter saying, “We think we need this deal.  We think we need this
deal.”  And so I think there’ll be — by the way, the reason we’re
talking this way: We need 60 votes to get something moving.  And what’s
going to happen is, I believe — because I take my Republican colleagues
at my — at their word when you shake.  I come from a tradition in the
Senate: You shake your hand.  That’s it.  You keep your word.  
   
And I found Rob Portman does that.  I found that — you know, your
governor is a good man.  You shake his hand, it’s done.  (Applause.)  
No, I really mean that.  I’m not — I’m not being falsely
complimentary.  
   
MR. LEMON:  Do you think it’s going to move forward in the Senate on
Monday?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I do.  Here’s what I think:  What happens is, the vote
on Monday is a motion to be able to proceed to this issue.  Then they’re
going to debate the issue of the elements — the individual elements of
this plan to sake \[sic\] sure we’re going to fix that damn bridge of
yours going into Kentucky. (Applause.)  No, I’m serious.  
   
MR. LEMON:  We’re going to talk about that bridge in just a moment.  We
asked (inaudible) about that bridge.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Anyway.  But I think it’s going to get done.   
   
You may find in the amendments that take place on the detail — the
detail of whether or not — and I’m the guy that wrote this bill to begin
with, and so I’ve had to compromise to make changes in the bill.  When I
say “I,” I campaigned on this.  I mean, everybody thought I was a little
nuts when I talked about there are three reasons why I was running: one,
to restore the soul of this country and bring back some decency; two, to
build back the middle class because they’ve been getting really knocked
around a long time.  They’re the backbone that unite the country.   
   
And one of the big issues was dealing with infrastructure.   Remember,
the last four years we had “Infrastructure Week” every week.  We didn’t
do a thing.  But it’s necessary.  (Laughter.)  No, I really mean it. 
It’s going to not only increase job opportunities, it’s going to
increase commerce.  It’s going to — it’s a good thing, and I think we’re
going to get it done.  
   
MR. LEMON:  A lot of this stuff you’re going need — you need bipartisan
support.  So, let’s — let’s talk about that.  
   
Our next question comes from Cindy Peebles.  She’s a financial executive
and a Democrat.  Go ahead, Cindy.  
   
Q    Hello, Mr. President.  I am dismayed at how often Democratic plans
for stabilizing the economy or shoring up new strains of the virus are
held hostage by the utopian need to gain bipartisan support.  It
appears, at every turn, the Democratic plan is weakened and still
secures zero Republican votes.  Sometimes the opposition is just wrong,
and working to get them to agree with you is fruitless.  Why is the
strategy to abandon the need for bipartisanship not the right answer?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, look, I may be the wrong guy to talk to because I
spent a lot of time as a Senator and Vice President, and I’m going to
say something outrageous: I don’t know you’ll find any Republican I’ve
ever worked with who says I ever broke my word, didn’t do exactly what I
said I would do and keep my word.  
   
And I was able to get an awful lot of compromises put together to do
really good things, to change things.  And I still believe that’s
possible.  
   
But the well has been so poisoned over the last four years.  And even
now, there’s still this lingering effort.  A lot of my Republican
friends — and I’m not talking about Portman; I’m not talking about your
governor — a lot of my Republican friends say, “Joe, I — I know you’re
right, but if I do this, I’ll get primaried and I’ll lose my primary. 
I’ll be in trouble.”  
   
But I think that’s all beginning to move.  I don’t mean overnight. 
Don’t get me wrong, I’m not playing out some panacea here.  But I think
people are figuring out that if we want to — I’ve always found you get
rewarded for doing what you think at the time is the right thing, and
people really believe you believe it’s the right thing to do.  
   
MR. LEMON:  Yeah.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  And so I think you’re seeing it coming together.  And,
by the way, the compromises are — you know, are real — compromise within
my own party between the far left and the center and some of the folks
who are more conservative.  That’s coming together.  They said that
would never happen, but if you notice, it has happened.  
   
MR. LEMON:  Well, let’s talk a little bit more about bipartisanship. 
You know, the Republicans removed all their picks today for the January
6 committee — the select committee.  Nancy Pelosi rejected two of
them.  
   
The first thing I want to ask you is, what’s your reaction to that?  But
number two, if Republicans and Democrats can’t come together — right? —
to investigate the biggest attack on our Capitol in 200 years, what
makes you think that they can come together on anything?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  These people.  (Applause.)  No, I mean it.  I’m not
being facetious.  Democrats and Republicans.  I don’t care if you think
I’m Satan reincarnated.  (Laughter.)  The fact is, you can’t look at
that television and say, “Nothing happened on the 6th.”  You can’t
listen to people who say this was a “peaceful march.”  No, I’m serious. 
Think about it.  Think of the things being said.  
   
I’ve been through the other end of this when the Democrats, 35 years
ago, were way off to the other side.  Think about it.  
   
MR. LEMON:  But what you can do, though — what they can do is try to
change the narrative and say, “Well, why wasn’t Nancy Pelosi prepared? 
Why weren’t the Democrats prepared for that to happen?”   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, no, they can say that, and you can make honest
judgments about it.  I have —  
   
Look, I sometimes get myself in trouble for what I’m about to say —
(laughter) — not that I ever get in trouble.  (Laughs.)  As you’ve heard
me say before: No one ever doubts I mean what I say; the problem is I
sometimes say all that I mean.  And — (laughter).  
   
But all kidding aside, I have faith in the American people — I really do
— to ultimately get to the right place.  
   
And, by the way, many times Republicans are in the right place.  I don’t
mean that the Repub- — that it’s always the Democratic point of view.   
   
But some of the stuff — I mean, QAnon: The idea that the Democrats or
that Biden is hiding people and sucking the blood of children and — no,
I’m serious.  That’s —  
   
Now, you may not like me, and that’s your right.  Look, it’s a simple
thing.  You can walk out and say, “I just don’t like the way that guy
wears his tie.  I’m voting against him.”  You have a right to do that. 
You have a right to do that.  
   
But the kinds of things that are being said of late, I think you’re
beginning to see some of the — and both — and by Democrats as well —
sort of the venom get — sort of — sort of leak out a lot of it.  We got
to get beyond this.   
   
What do you say to your grandchildren or you children about what’s
happening?  Do you ever remember a time like this before, in the entire
history, whether you’re Democrat or Republican?  
   
This is not who we are.  And I’ll say one last thing — and you’re going
to — I’ve had a lot of experience internationally.  And I mean that —
not good or bad, just I have; I’ve chaired the Foreign Relations
Committee.  I’ve been deeply involved.  I did national security for the
— our last — the — the — the administration with Barack.   
   
But, folks, the rest of the world is wondering about us.  Those of you
who travel abroad — not a joke, not a joke — you ask — you know, when I
went to this G7, all the major democracies — I walked in — and I know a
lot of them because of my role in the past.  And they walk in and I
said, “America is back.”  And they go — I’m serious, heads of state — I
give you my word as a Biden — said, “Are you really back?  I mean, how
can I — we believe you, Joe, but will the country ever get it
together?”  
   
I talked to Xi — Xi Jinping in China, who I know well.  We don’t agree
on a lot of things.  He’s a bright and really tough guy.  He truly
believes that the 21st century will be determined by oligarchs, by — and
I’m not — not a joke.   
   
Democracies cannot function in the 21st century — the argument is —
because things are moving so rapidly — so, so rapidly that you can’t
pull together a nation that is divided to get a consensus on acting
quickly.   
   
So, autocrats — autocracies — I had a long meeting with Putin, and I
continued — I know him well.  These guys actually are betting — betting
— I’m not joking — on autocracies.   
   
Democracy has to stand up and demonstrate it can get something done. 
It’s not just important that we are — (applause) — no, I really mean
it.   
   
MR. LEMON:  Mr. President, we’re just getting started.  We got a lot to
talk about.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m sorry.  
   
MR. LEMON:  No, no, no.  You’re good.  We’re going to take a quick
break, and we’re going to come back with more questions for the
President of the United States right after this.  (Applause.)  
   
(Commercial break begins.)  
   
(Commercial break ends.)  
   
MR. LEMON:  Welcome back, everyone.  We are live at a CNN Town Hall in
Cincinnati, Ohio, with the President of the United States.  
   
Straight to the audience for a question.  This is John Lanni.  He is the
owner and co-founder of a restaurant group with 39 restaurants across
the country, Mr. President.  He is a Republican.   
   
John.  
   
Q    Hi there, Mr. President.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Hey, John.  
   
Q    Hi.  Thank you for taking my question tonight.  We employ hundreds
of hard-working team members throughout the state of Ohio and across the
country.  And we’re looking to hire more every day as we try to restart
our restaurant business.   
   
The entire industry, amongst other industries, continue to struggle to
find employees.  How do you and the Biden administration plan to
incentivize those that haven’t returned to work yet?  Hiring is our top
priority right now.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, two things.  One, if you notice, we kept you
open.  We spent billions of dollars to make sure restaurants could stay
open.  And — and a lot of people who now — who work as waiters and
waitresses decided that they don’t want to do that anymore because
there’s other opportunities and higher wages, because there’s a lot of
openings now in jobs.  And people are beginning to move — beginning to
move.   
   
There’s some evidence that maintaining the ability to continue not — to
not have your — have to pay your rent so you don’t get thrown out, and
being able to provide for unemployment insurance, has kept people from
going back to work.  There’s no — not much distinction between not going
back to work in a restaurant and not going back to work at a — at a
factory.   
   
So people are looking to change opportunities, change what they’re
doing.   
   
My — my deceased wife’s father-in-law was a restauranteur up in — up in
Syracuse, New York.  And, by the way, he tried to con- — he had a — had
a restaurant that was in a town called Auburn, about 20,000 people,
which was at a flagship 24-hour-a-day restaurant that — and he offered
it to me, which I would have been making five times what I would in law
school to try to keep me in Syracuse.  
   
But I spent too many times at home hearing a — in his home, hearing a
phone call: “The cook didn’t come in?  He’s in a fight with his wife? 
What — what’s going on?”  
   
Q    Exactly.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  So I would — God love you doing what you do.  
   
Q    It’s tough.  
   
But all kidding aside, I think it really is a matter of people deciding
now that they have opportunities to do other things.  And there is a
shortage of employees.  People are looking to make more money and to
bargain.  And so I think your business and the tourist business is
really going to be in a — in a bind for a little while.  And one of the
things — we’re ending all those things that are the things keeping
people back from going back to work, et cetera.   
   
It’ll be interesting to see what happens, but my gut tells me — my gut
tells me that part of it relates to — you know, you can make a good
salary as a waiter or waitress.  One of my sister-in-laws is — of five
sisters — makes a very good salary.  She works in Atlantic City.  That’s
where she’s — she’s from.  But it is — there’s a lot of people who — who
are looking to change their — their occupation, I think.  But I could be
wrong.   
   
MR. LEMON:  Well, let me ask you, because he’s — John is looking to hire
people.  He’s got 39 restaurants across the country.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.   
   
MR. LEMON:  Is there anything you can do to help him out?  I mean, he’s
— he’s got to get people in.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, John — first of all, I — you know, the thing we
did to help John and the Johns out is provide billions of dollars to
make sure they could stay open.  Number one.  So you all contributed to
making sure John could stay in business.  (Applause.)  And we should. 
We should have done that, as we did for other industries.   
   
But secondly, John, my guess is that people being $7, $8 an hour, plus
tips, that — that’s — I think, John, you’re going to be finding —
(applause) — 15 bucks an hour or more now.  You know what I mean?  But
you may pay that already.  You may pay that already.   
   
MR. LEMON:  Well, let me — let me ask you, because everywhere I go,
there isn’t pretty much a shop in my town, a restaurant or whatever,
where there isn’t a “for hire” sign.   
   
We were trying to check into the hotel; they couldn’t get the rooms
cleaned fast enough because they can’t find staff.  You mentioned
something — you said, “We’re going to end the things that may be keeping
people back.”  You think that’s the unemployment benefits expanded?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, that was the argument it was.  I — I — I don’t
think it did much.  But the point is, it’s argued that because the
extended unemployment benefits kept people –they’d rather stay home and
not work — than go to work.   
   
MR. LEMON:  You don’t think it hurt?  Did that?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I see no evidence it had any serious impact on it.  But
you can argue — let’s assume it did.  It’s coming to an end, so it’s not
like we’re in a situation where — if that was it and it ends, then we’re
going to see John is going to have no problem.   
   
But what I think is happening, folks, is, look, if you make less than
fift- — and I’m not saying, John, your folks make less than 15 — you had
good restaurants; that means their tips are good, people make a lot more
than just what the — what the minimum wage — what the wage is being paid
on with the — put tips on top of it.  
   
But, folks, look, here’s the deal.  Think about it: You know, if you
have an — we — for example, I want to be able to — one of my programs is
to make sure that we have four more years of school that’s free — two
years for three-year-olds and four-year-olds, because it’s demonstrated
that that — (applause) — increases significantly success, and community
college.   
   
MR. LEMON:  Yeah.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, those folks are not likely to want to go and be
waiters.  There’s nothing wrong being a waiter or waitress.  My family
has been engaged in that business.  But the folks is —  
   
And, lastly, if you make less than 15 bucks an hour working 40 hours a
week, you’re living below the poverty level.  You’re living below the
poverty level.  (Applause.)  
   
MR. LEMON:  I want to continue on and talk about — this has to do with
infrastructure, because you got applause when you mentioned the bridge
earlier — (laughs) — and —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  By the way, your congressman wants that bridge too. 
(Laughter.)  
   
MR. LEMON:  Todd Michael is here.  He’s a union electrician and a
Democrat.  He has a question about something that a lot of people in
Cincinnati are concerned about.   
   
Todd, take it away.   
   
Q    As Mr. Lemon said, you have already touched on the subject of my
question.  The two most recent presidents — past presidents — had both
campaigned using this region’s Interstate 75 Bridge — the Brent Spence
Bridge that crosses the Iowa River — as backdrops with a promise of an
infrastructure bill that would help with the replacement.   
   
President Biden, is it possible to bring Congress together to pass an
infrastructure bill that builds a bridge that does not just benefit this
region, but the entire I-75 corridor, from Michigan all the way to
Florida?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  The answer is absolutely, positively yes.  (Applause.) 
I’m not just saying that.  I’m not just saying that.  And if you take a
look at Ohio and Kentucky combined, there’s well over — there’s
thousands of bridges that need repair.  Thousands.  Thousands of
bridges.   
   
And we should be looking at it this way: It increases commerce, number
one.  But guess what?  They’re good-paying union jobs.  Union. 
(Applause.)  Union jobs.   
   
And — and — and, by the way, can you ever think of a time — those of you
who are economists, who are — who teach here, economics — can you think
of any time when the middle class did better, the wealthy didn’t do
really well?   
   
I’m not being facetious now.  I’m being deadly earnest.  Can you think
of any time that’s occurred when the middle class does better?  I’m
tired of trickle down.  I come from the corporate state of America. 
(Applause.)  
   
And, by the way, I think you should be able to go out and make a billion
dollars or a hundred million dollars if you have the capacity to do it. 
But I ask one thing: Pay your fair share.  (Applause.)  Just pay your
fair share.  I really mean it.  And if you know anything about me, check
it out: We have more corporations registered in Delaware than all the
rest of America combined.  Combined.  Combined.  I represented it for 36
years.  I’ve never seen a time when we have the middle class growing
that the wealthy didn’t do very, very, very well.  
   
MR. LEMON:  Yeah.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  So, that’s what we have to do: Build it out and up, not
just down.  
   
MR. LEMON:  Yeah.  So that people like our next guest — who just
graduated from law school, by the way — his name is Cory Marcum.  He’s a
graduate from the University of Cincinnati Law School.  And he —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  He’s a graduate, huh?  
   
MR. LEMON:  Excuse me, he’s heading to law school — I’m wrong — in the
fall.  
   
Q    Yes.  (Laughs.)  
   
MR. LEMON:  So, Cory, good luck in law school.  And what’s your
question?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Your first year — you wish you had already graduated. 
(Laughter.)  I know.  I — me too.  
   
Q    Yeah.  (Laughs.)  So, my question is: Last week, regarding the
GOP’s efforts to restrict voting rights, you said those efforts were,
quote, “the most dangerous threat to voting and the integrity of free
and fair elections in our history,” end quote.  While you have condemned
these attacks, you and congressional members of your party have done
little to actually stop these assaults.  If these efforts are really the
most dangerous in our history, isn’t it logical to get rid of the
filibuster so we can protect our democracy and secure the right to
vote?  (Applause.)   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I stand by what I said.  Never before has there been an
attempt by state legislatures to take over the ability to determine who
won.  Not count the votes — determine who won.   
   
We have election officials across the board that they’re deciding to
push out of the way.  And if, in fact, tomorrow — let’s say we’re
running last time and we’re — these laws had been in effect that are —
these changes.  In Georgia, the Georgia legislature — you know, Biden
won by multiple thousand votes; they could say, “We don’t think it was
legit.”  And the state legislature votes, “We’re going send electors up
to Congress to vote for Trump, not Biden.”  That’s never, ever, ever,
ever, ever, ever, ever, ever been tried before.  This is Jim Crow on
steroids what we’re talking about.   
   
And so, it takes — to go to your second point, I’ve been saying for a
long, long time: The abuse of the filibuster is pretty overwhelming. 
When I got to the United States Senate at a time when we had guys like
Jim Eastland and Strom Thurmond and Robert F. Byrd and a whole range of
people who were very, very, very, very, very, very conservative on race,
to say the least — even then, if you were to filibuster, you had to
stand on the floor and hold the floor.  And that’s why Strom, I think,
set the record at 24 straight hours or something.  Don’t hold me to the
number.  But, you know, so you had to take — there were significantly
fewer filibusters in those days.  In the middle of the civil rights
movement.   
   
MR. LEMON:  But let me — let me talk to you about that.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, let me finish my answer, because I’ll tell you
what I’d do.  I would go back to that where you have to maintain the
floor.  You have to stand there and talk and hold the floor. 
(Applause.)  You can’t just say that now.  
   
MR. LEMON:  I understand that.  But what difference is that if you hold
the floor for, you know, a day or a year?  What difference does it
make?   
   
Here’s the thing for me: You talked about people — and this is important
for people who look like me.  My grandmother would sit around when I was
a kid, fifth grade — (applause) — had a fifth-grade education.  I
learned that she couldn’t read when I was doing my homework.  And she
would tell me stories about people asking her to count the number of
jellybeans in the jar or the soap.   
   
And so why is protecting the filibuster — is that more important than
protecting voting rights, especially for people who fought and died for
that?  (Applause.)   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No.  It’s not.  I want to see the United States
Congress, the United States Senate, pass S.1 and S.4, the John Lewis
Act, and get it on my desk so I can sign it.  (Applause.)    
   
But here’s the deal: What I also want to do — I want to make sure we
bring along not just all the Democrats; we bring along Republicans, who
I know know better.  They know better than this.  
   
And what I don’t want to do is get wrapped up, right now, in the
argument of whether or not this is all about the filibuster or —  
   
Look, the American public, you can’t stop them from voting.  You tried
last time.  More people voted last time than any time in American
history, in the middle of the worst pandemic in American history.  More
people did.  (Applause.)  And they showed up.  They’re going to show up
again.  They’re going to do it again.   
   
But what I want to do is I’m trying to bring the country together.  And
I don’t want the debate to only be about whether or not we have a
filibuster or exceptions to the filibuster or the — going back to the
way the filibuster had to be used before.  
   
MR. LEMON:  But isn’t that the only way you’re going to get it done
right now?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, I don’t believe that.  I think we can get it done.  
   
MR. LEMON:  If you — if you — you agree with the former president; he
has called — as you call him, your “old boss” — that it’s “a relic of
Jim Crow.”  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  It is.  
   
MR. LEMON:  If it’s a relic of Jim Crow, it’s been used to fight against
civil rights legislation historically, why protect it?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  There’s no reason to protect it other than you’re going
to throw the entire Congress into chaos and nothing will get done.  
   
MR. LEMON:  Right.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Nothing at all will get done.  And there’s a lot at
stake.  The most important one is the right to vote.  That’s the single
most important one.  And your vote counted, and counted by someone who
honestly counts it.  
   
But it goes beyond that.  For example, wouldn’t — wouldn’t my friends on
the other side love to have a debate about the filibuster instead of
passing the recovery act?  Or wouldn’t they love doing it instead of
being in a position where we provide for — how many of you have children
under the age of 17?  Raise your hand.  Guess what?  You’re getting a
lot of money in a monthly check now, aren’t you?  (Applause.)   
   
No, you deserve — (applause) — no, no, no, I really mean it. 
Republicans used to fight for it as well.  It’s called the Child Tax
Credit.  If you have a child under the age of seven, you get 300 bucks a
month — 350 bucks a month.  If you have a child under — between 7 and
17, you get a total of 200 bucks a month.  And guess what?  It’s cutting
child poverty in half.  In half.  (Applause.)   
   
MR. LEMON:  Mr. President, I want to talk about something else that
affects people a lot, and to children as well.  The next question — and
it’s about gun violence.  This is from a paralegal and she’s an
advocate.  Her name is Andrea Solis Canto.  She’s a Democrat.   
   
Andrea, go ahead.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I used to be a public defender, kid.  Thanks for what
you’re doing.  
   
Q    (Laughs.)  Thank you.  So, gun violence has been on the rise across
the country, and as a recent student and young professional living in
Over-the-Rhine, I’ve seen this firsthand.  Gun violence has taken the
lives of so many young students and young people.  I’m tired, and I want
to see change that’s going to make our cities, like Cincinnati, safer.  
   
So, how will you address gun violence, from a federal point of view, to
actually bring about change and make our local cities safer?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Now, I’m not being a wise guy.  There’s no reason you
should — have you seen my gun violence legislation I’ve introduced?  As
you know — because you’re so involved — actually, crime is down; gun
violence and murder rates are up.  Guns.  I’m the only guy that ever got
passed legislation, when I was a senator, that made sure we eliminated
assault weapons.  The idea you need a weapon that can have the ability
to fire 20, 30, 40, 50, 120 shots from that weapon — whether it’s a —
whether it’s a 9-millimeter pistol or whether it’s a rifle — is
ridiculous.  
   
I’m continuing to push to eliminate the sale of those things, but I’m
not likely to get that done in the near term.  So here’s what I’ve done:
The people who, in fact, are using those weapons are acquiring them
illegally — illegally.  And so what happens is, I’ve gotten ATF —
Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms — I have them increase their budget and
increase their capacity, along with the Justice Department, to go after
the gun shops that are not abiding by the law of doing background
checks.  (Applause.)  For real.  That’s number one.  
   
Number two — number two, we’re in a position where you — most of the
cities — and I don’t know enough — I think you’ve had a lot of gun
violence here in Cincinnati.  I think it was up to — what? — how many —
how many how dead?  Five hundred over a period.  Don’t hold me to the
number — whatever it was.  But my point is, all across the country.  And
it’s not because the gun shops in the cities are selling these guns. 
They are either shadow gun dealers and/or gun shops that are not abiding
by the law.  
   
So, we’re going to do major investigations and shut those guys down and
put some of them in jail and — for what they’re doing: selling these
weapons.  There’s also a thing called “ghost guns” that are being sold
now and being used.   
   
And so — but in addition to that, what we have to do is we have to deal
with a larger problem of the whole issue of law enforcement, generally. 
We’re in a situation where, as much as we need to pass the Floyd Act and
all that — but here’s the deal: Cops are having real trouble.  They’re
not all bad guys; there’s a lot of good guys.  We need more policemen,
not fewer policemen.  But we need them involved in community policing. 
Community policing.  (Applause.)   
   
And when we did that, violent crime went down.  All the criticism about
the original crime bill — well, guess what?  Crime went down until we
stopped doing community policing.  So it’s about getting — we have
availability now of over billion — lots of money for cops to be able to
hire psychologists, psychiatrists, as well as social workers to be
engaged in the process.  (Applause.)   
   
MR. LEMON:  Mr. President, we’re going to put a period, maybe a comma
right here because we have more to come.  We got to take a quick
break.  
   
We’ll be right back.  More from President Joe Biden right after this. 
(Applause.)  
   
(Commercial break begins.)  
   
(Commercial break ends.)  
   
MR. LEMON:  Welcome back to our CNN Town Hall with the President of the
United States, Joe Biden.  I just — I said we were going to put a comma
on it because I want to continue this conversation.   
   
You said that you need — we need more police, right?  Your words.  So
then, how do you respond to Republicans who try to paint you and your
party as anti-police?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  They’re lying.  (Applause.)  No, look, never once — we
have to change police conduct.  We have to have rules where things are
open.  We have to have rules where you can be able to determine what the
background — how many times a cop has violated the rules and be able to
have access to what’s going on in police departments, or the Justice
Department can get involved in whether or not they have to change their
pattern and practices.  
   
I’ve always said that.  
   
MR. LEMON:  But what about defunding the police though?  Because there’s
a “Defund the Police.”  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, I’ve never — never, never said defunding the
police.  
   
Look, I don’t know any community, particularly the communities that are
in the most need and the poorest and the most at risk, that don’t want
police.  They want police, though, to look at them as equals. 
(Applause.)  They want police to treat them in a way.  They don’t want
police abusing.   
   
And what happened was we got in the position where — we used to have
community policing where the cop — my deceased son was the attorney
general of the state of Delaware.  And what we did when that original
bill got passed was he would go down in the tough neighborhoods in my —
in my state — in my city of Wilmington, which is overwhelming a minority
city, and he’d go where the — everybody can tell me where the best
basketball is played in a playground here in this city.  You know where
it is; you know who the best ballplayers are; you know where they are.  
   
He’d go down and sit there on the bench with his son, my — my grandson,
who’s now 16, when he was 5 and 6 years old, and let them know he was
there.  He’d go over and knock on the window of the local cop, who was
sitting there by himself in a squad car.  I’d say, “Get out of the car. 
Meet people.”   
   
Because what used to happen was cops used to — when first community
policing came about — they’d go in and they knew who the minister was in
the church, they knew who owned the local liquor store, the local
drugstore, the local grocery store.  And they’d walk in and say, “Look,
I’m Joe Biden, and I’m going to be in this beat.  Here’s my cell
number.  You have a problem, call me.  Here’s my cell number.”  
   
MR. LEMON:  You said it’s tough right now.  You said police are up
against — well, they’re up against the narrative that, you know, the
country is anti-police, Democrats are anti-police, Joe Biden is
anti-police.  And then you have —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  They aren’t saying Joe Biden is anti-police.  Cops are
not saying that about Joe Biden.  They know me, period.  (Applause.)  
   
MR. LEMON:  Go on.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  They’re not saying.  Republicans are saying it on the
far — I’m not going to — anyway, it doesn’t matter.   
   
MR. LEMON:  No, you can — no, I want you to talk about this, because — I
mean —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, look —  
   
MR. LEMON:  — it’s an important narrative.  There is no more important
issue, I think, right now than safety.  You can rebuild a home.  You
can, you know, get a lot of things back.  But, Mr. President, you cannot
get back a life.  And it —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s exactly right.  That’s exactly right.  
   
MR. LEMON:  Yeah.  And if police aren’t doing their jobs, that increases
—  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay — no, if police aren’t doing their job, they should
be held accountable.  They should be fired if they’re not doing their
job.  They should — (applause) — I have no — I make no excuses for
that.   
   
We should have, for example, the George Floyd Act, where chokeholds are
against the law, where a whole lot of things that are laid out in that
legislation.  And, by the way, I grew up in a neighborhood where you
became a cop, a firefighter, or a priest.  I wasn’t qualified for any
one of them, so here I am.  (Laughter.)   
   
But all kidding aside — I’m not joking — the guys that grew up in
Scranton and Claymont, Delaware — a steel town — that’s what we did. 
That’s what they did.  It’s what my friends did.   
   
And here’s the point: The point is that they — it doesn’t justify
maltreating the public.  You have no right to do that.  None.  But now
what’s happening is, because they’ve become — it’s become so tough
across the spectrum, we’ve actually cut down on a number of police,
unrelated to anybody asking for it.  The towns and cities aren’t
spending as much money on it.  There is not as much federal money to
hire police.  And now, what’s happening is police are not wanting to be
a cop.  Raise your hand if you want to be a cop now.  What do you think,
huh?   
   
So what we got to do is we got to give them the help they need to be
better at their job.  The idea that you have someone sitting on a ledge,
saying they’re going to jump off a ledge, and you call the cop, and
sending a guy or a woman who’s a law enforcement officer, has a criminal
justice degree, when you could send with him or her — you could send
with them a psychologist or a social worker, or somebody who can talk to
them.   
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Yes!  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, I mean it.  (Applause.)  I’m serious.  
   
MR. LEMON:  Mr. President, I want to get to more questions now.  I’m
going to bring in Lynne Miller.  She’s an attorney and a Democrat.   
   
Lynne, what’s your question?  
   
Q    Mr. President, the opioid crisis continues, and in this part of the
country, it remains a huge problem.  While the over-prescription of
opioids is part of that problem, the drugs available in the black market
are a growing issue as many of these contain fentanyl.  That took the
life of our son.  How can your administration combat the issue of
illegal opiates, many of which our young people buy online?  Someone
should bear responsibility for delivering death through the mail.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  They should bear responsibility.  You may or may not be
aware: Even in the period when I was out of office, I was railing
against the fact that drug companies were selling on the open market. 
There was one case — what’s really got me was you had two drugstores in
small town in West Virginia having something like prescription for 4,000
pills.  And it was obviously drug trafficking.  That’s what was going
on.   
   
So what we did was — what they did was, they went after it.  They just
settled with Johnson & — some of the drug companies who make opioids for
twenty-si- — was it $26 billion or 27.  Today, if I’m not mistaken, the
settlement took place.  
   
But here’s the deal: In addition to that, you have the Chinese sending
fentanyl to Mexico, in large part, that’s being mixed with opioids
and/or heroin and other drugs, which is a dead-set killer of people.   
   
And so, what we have to do — I’ve had this encounter with China, and
we’re going to continue it.  But we’ve also increased the number of DEA
agents — what we’re doing at the border — and how we’re going to deal
with ex- — the intercepting that drug trade.   
   
In addition to that, the Justice Department is moving on dealing with
the whole opioid issue by increasing significantly the number — the
number of people in Justice Department working on this issue.  And so,
there’s much more to say about it, but it is incredibly, incredibly
dangerous.   
   
MR. LEMON:  Mr. President, I believe there’s no better way to speak
about this than —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible) —  
   
MR. LEMON:  — from experience.  I don’t think there’s probably a family
in this room who hasn’t been affected by addiction.  You’ve been very
open about your son Hunter’s problems with addiction.  This is personal
for you.  And listen, I’ve dealt with it in — within my own family. 
Every family deals with it.  But this is personal for you.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  And I’m so damn proud of my son.  My son just
wrote a book about how he overcame being addicted.  And he did it, and
he’s doing it, and he is in good shape, thank God.   
   
Here’s the thing: We don’t have nearly enough people involved in mental
health and drug addiction services — number one.  (Applause.)  Number
one.  
   
Number two — number two, we shouldn’t be sending people to jail for use;
we should be sending them to mandatory rehabilitation.  (Applause.) 
Mandatory rehabilitation.  
   
Number three, when people are in fact in jail, they should be getting —
if that’s not the main crime, but they also did — they should be getting
treatment while they are in jail.   
   
Fourth, when people get out of jail — whether it’s for drug addiction or
any other crime — if they’ve served their time, they should have full
access to everything from Pell Grants, to public housing, to — to the
like.  (Applause.)    
   
And, by the way — and, by the way, folks, it’s not just the right thing
to do; it’s the smart thing for us to do. Because what happens?  Years
ago, there was a guy named Arlen Specter from Pennsylvania.  He and I
introduced legislation that was a second chance.  It would — meant that,
right now, when you get out of jail in most prisons in the states around
the country — what happens? — you get a bus ticket and 25 bucks.  You
end up under the bridge, just like you did before.  You’re almost —
almost guaranteed to get back in — in whatever — whatever your problem
was before.   
   
So, they should have access to drug treatment.  They should have access
to housing.  They should have access to whatever they qualify based on
their income.  And we should, in prisons as well, be training people
differently.   
   
But the mi- — the big thing here is: We have to deal with the idea of
addiction by providing for what we all know — it’s a disease of the
brain.  
   
MR. LEMON:  Yeah.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  It’s a disease of the brain and has to be treated as
such.   
   
MR. LEMON:  I think it’s — I think addiction and mental health issues
have to be dealt with, just as if you break your arm and go to the
doctor.  We should be able to talk.  There should be —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I agree.  
   
MR. LEMON:  — there shouldn’t be a stigma about it.   
   
I want to bring in now Madeena Nolan.  Madeena Nolan is a writer and
editor.  She’s a Democrat.  
   
Madeena, what’s your question?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Hi, Madeena.  
   
Q    Good evening, Mr. President.  Vice President Harris said to
Guatemalans, “Don’t come.”  Recently, you have indicated you are in
favor of refugees coming to this country.  Could you please explain your
administration’s basic stance on immigration?   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  They should not come.   
   
What we’re trying to set up is, in the countries like in — and
particularly in the Northern Triangle — Guatemala, Honduras, El
Salvador, et cetera — we are setting up in those countries: If you seek
asylum in the United States, you can seek it from the country, from your
— in place.  You can seek it from an American embassy.  You can go in
and seek and see whether or not you qualify.  We’ve significantly
increased the number of officers who can hear cases as to whether or not
you qualify under the law for being here as a refugee.  That is — that’s
what we’ve done.   
   
Thirdly, we have enabled a move, significantly, to change the number —
there were thousands of people in — in custody with the Border Patrol. 
It’s now cut by 90 percent, where there — it’s considerably down.   
   
What I — what I do say is: The one place you may heard that I’m talking
about more immigrants coming in are those folks from Afghanistan who
helped the American soldiers, who will be — they and their family will
be victimized very badly as a consequence of what happens if they’re
left behind.  And so, we’re providing for them to be able to see whether
they qualify to meet this special requirement to be able to come to the
United States as a refugee and as, ultimately, earning citizenship
here.  It seems to me it’s the only decent thing that we can do.   
   
In the meantime, we’re going to send people to American bases, where
they’re not going to be able to leave the base while their cases are
being determined — whether they qualify — and also other bases.  
   
MR. LEMON:  I want to talk to you about DACA.  I got two questions on
immigration.  They’re quick questions I want to ask you about.  Because
just last week, there was a federal judge who ruled the program
unlawful, blocked it from accepting new applications.  What do you say
to DREAMers who are really worried about their futures here in the
United States?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m not letting this go.  Look, guys, let’s just put it
— (applause) — let’s just put this — you know, we talk about DREAMers
sort of generically.  Let’s think about it now, what it really means:
You’re five years old.  You’re nine years old.  Your mom or your dad
says, “I’m going to take you across the Rio Grande and we’re going to
illegally going to go into the United States.”  What are you supposed to
say?  “Not me.  That’s against the law”?  I’m –no, I’m being — I’m being
deadly earnest.  What can a kid say?  What could they do?  They come
here with really no choice.  And they’re here, and they’re good, good
people.  They’ve done well.  (Applause.)  Ten thousand of them were
first-line workers.  (Applause.)  These are kids who’ve done well.   
   
And so, what we’re going to do is, first of all, appeal the case —
number one.  But number two, we’re going to make sure that — a number of
my Republican colleagues say they support the right of DREAMers to
come.  Let’s call the question.  They should be able to stay in the
United States of America when a child comes (inaudible).  (Applause.)  
   
MR. LEMON:  Mr. President, you’ve been the big guy for six months now in
the White House.  Can you take us behind the scenes — something that was
extraordinary or unusual that happened that stands out to you?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  “Mr. President, you didn’t close the door.  Mr.
President, what the hell are you going out at this time for?”  You
know.  (Laughter.) You know, it’s — it’s a wonderful honor.  As you can
tell, I hope I have very good manners, but I’m not very hung up on
protocol.  (Laughter.)   
   
And I — and the Secret Service is wonderful.  And because things are so
— (applause) — and because things are so crazy out there, it is very
hard to get comfortable like I would ordinarily be.  For example, I
think all of the — all the help that’s there, providing meals and all
the rest — I think they love us.  We can say, “Don’t come in for
breakfast.  We can get our own breakfast.”  Because I like to walk out
in my robe and go in.  (Laughter.)  No, no, I’m not — you think I’m
joking.  I’m not.  You know what I mean?   
   
And so it’s just a — you know, the only place I have felt like what the
office connotes is when I went to Europe and watched the rest of the
heads of state react to me — not me, because I’m the President of the
United States of America — the United States of America.   
   
And here’s what happened: It’s the first time I ever felt like — you
always hear say “leader of the free world.”  Well, I realize, when I’m
sitting across from Putin, who I know, he knows who I am; I know who he
is.  He knows I mean what I say and can do what I say.  He understands. 
It doesn’t mean he will do it or not do it.  But the point is it’s the
first time I’ve ever felt the notion that I am in the office that is the
leader of the free world.  And we must be the leader of the free world. 
If we don’t do it, nobody good is likely to do it or has the capacity to
do it.  I really mean it.  I genuinely mean it.   
   
So, it’s the thing, Don, that is the only time — and, by the way, the
first time I walked downstairs and they played “Hail to the Chief,” I
wondered, “Where is he?”  (Laughter.)  No, you think I’m kidding.  I’m
not kidding.  You know, I mean —  
   
MR. LEMON:  It’s a great tune, isn’t it?   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  It’s a great tune, but I — you know, you feel a little
self-conscious.  (Laughter.)  But you think I’m kidding.  I’m not.  
   
But I am — I am not at all self-conscious about the power that goes with
the office as it relates to resolving issues.  These are issues that
I’ve dealt with my whole life.  Whether I’m good or bad, I have more
experience coming to the office than anyone who’s ever held that
office.  I have done — I’ve — I’ve been deeply steeped in foreign
policy, the justice system, the econo- — not that I’m right.  I don’t
mean that.  But nothing has come before me where I’ve gone, “Oh, my God,
I never — I never thought…”   
   
You know, what the difference is — I used to kid Barack — he’s a good
friend — President Obama.  And, you know, at one point, I’d always be
the — I was always the last guy in the room, for real.  On every
important decision, I got to give my advice.  I’d give it all away, but
I’d be the last guy before I walked out.  And one day, he thanked me. 
And I said, “Mr. President, here’s the deal: I should be paying you, not
you me, because I get to give the advice, and then I get to leave.” 
(Laughter.)  
   
No, I’m serious.  Think about it.  The one thing that is real, that is
different — I don’t — and I feel comfortable with it — but is you’re the
last guy in the room.   
   
MR. LEMON:  Yeah.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  You decide, “Is the decision I’m about to make, will
that cause war?  Will that cause conflict?  The decision I’m about to
make, is that going to hurt people?  Is it going to help people?” 
That’s the part that is different.  
   
But the living conditions, I mean, it’s such a great, great honor to
live in the White House.  But, quite frankly — I kid the Vice President
— like, one day, Barack came over to NAVOBS — it’s called Naval
Operations \[sic\] — the Vice President’s Residence — which is on about,
I guess, 80, 90 acres.  And it’s a beautiful, beautiful spot.  And
there’s a fence around the whole property.  
   
MR. LEMON:  I bet you miss that, don’t you?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I do.  (Laughter.)  And Barack came over and he said,
“This is great.”  And I said, “I’ll tell you…”  And I said, “Trade you
only if the power goes with it.”   
   
But the point is that, there, it was totally different.  You could walk
out in your shorts — with a short-sleeve shirt on, and you can walk
around and there wasn’t anybody there.  You can’t walk out anywhere
now.  (Laughter.)  But I’m not complaining.  I’m trying to answer your
question as honestly as I can.   
   
MR. LEMON:  Yeah.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I just — it’s the greatest honor, I think, could ever be
bestowed on an American that a majority of American citizens said, “I
want you to lead the country.”  And it’s a great honor — a great honor
when you have presidents and prime ministers and the rest of the world
saying, “You know, what does the United States think?”  You’re the
leader of the free world.   
   
I was able to go to the G7 and change their mind about a whole range of
things.  They never once had included China in any criticism on what was
going on.  They’re very reluctant to be able to be in a position — you
and I have talked about this — about whether or not they’re going to do
business with China in a way that, you know, pushes America aside.   
   
All of a sudden, if you notice, we’re getting a great deal — not because
of me, but because of the administration I put together.  And America is
back; traditional America is more back.  And they’re willing to follow
us, I think.  (Applause.)  
   
Q    Well, Mr. President — Mr. President, here’s the deal.  Mr.
President, here’s the deal: I’m the last guy that gets to ask you
questions tonight.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Uh-oh.  
   
MR. LEMON:  Yeah.  And then I get to leave.  (Laughter.)  Thank you.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thanks, man.  
   
MR. LEMON:  I appreciate it.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Appreciate it.  (Applause.)  
   
MR. LEMON:  We’re so glad that you guys are here and that you got to ask
questions to the President of the United States.  Thank you so much.   
   
Thank you to our audience, for everyone, for being here taking
questions.  Of course, thank you to the President of the United States. 
And we want to thank Mount St. Joseph University right here in
Cincinnati, Ohio — right? — (applause) — for housing us.
