South Lawn

(July 21, 2021)

THE PRESIDENT:  We answered enough questions today.  The only reason I’m
stopping: I feel badly you’re here this hour of the night.  
   
Q    Mr. President, can you clarify what you said about no — that
there’s no — no one in the Democratic Party is anti-police?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I didn’t say that.  
   
Q    I know that you said you don’t want to defund the police —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I said that that — that is not the Democratic Party’s
position.   
   
Q    Okay.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m the Democratic Party; I am President.  So is the
Speaker of the House and so is the –- the Majority Leader.  We are not
the defunding the police.  
   
Q    Okay.  And are there people who — in the Democratic Party, who want
to defund the police?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Are there people in the Republican Party who think we’re
sucking the blood out of kids?
