title: "Remarks by President\_Biden Before Marine One\_Departure"
---
 
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m going to be late to a very important date.  If I
miss this — getting out to see my wife — I’m in trouble.  
   
Q    President Biden, how did your meeting on DACA go?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  It went very well.  What I think we sh- — I think we
should include in the reconciliation bill the immigration proposal.  My
staff is putting out a message right now.  
   
Q    Mr. President, do you think the country will have another wave —
another peak of cases?   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Say again?  
   
Q    Do you think the United States will have another wave of cases,
another peak of coronavirus cases?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I hope not.  
   
Q    Mr. President, did you talk to Kyrsten Sinema about the
reconciliation package when you spoke to her on infrastructure the other
day?  She says she’s not on board with the $3.5 trillion (inaudible).   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  She’s on board for passing if in fact she sees all the
pieces of it.  That’s why she allowed the budget to go forward.  
   
END
