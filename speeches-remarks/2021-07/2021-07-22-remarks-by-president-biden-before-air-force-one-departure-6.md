(July 21, 2021)

10:15 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I can’t see you, but I know you’re there.  Thank you for
your patience today.  I know it’s a long day for you.  I really mean
it.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.

I was just talking to one of the people who asked the question
(inaudible).

Q    Mr. President, the debt limit: Mitch McConnell said today that
Republicans won’t vote to raise the debt limit, and Democrats will have
to include it in reconciliation.  What’s your response?

THE PRESIDENT:  I was hoping that wouldn’t be the case.  You know, for
the last four years, they’ve just extended the debt limit.  The reason
for the significant debt is because of their — their debt, their tax
limit — excuse me, their tax cut.   
   
And there are going to be a couple of very difficult decisions that are
going to have to be made to get through the end of the year.  And one of
them is the debt limit and extending the debt.   
   
So, I don’t have an answer for you, but it’s — I hope we can get by it.

Q    Mr. President, what do you think of the Republicans and Fox News
changing their tune on the vaccine?

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, rather than be critical of it, I thank them for
it.  I think it’s a matter of — first of all, in truth, I don’t know how
many of them believed what they were saying.  They may have really
believed it — the things that they’ve been saying.   
   
And — but I think once the realization occurred that this virus is only
killing primarily those people who had not been vaccinated, I think it
was sort of, as we Catholics say, a bit of an “epiphany” for them.  You
know, it was a — like a — you know, conversion on the way to Damascus or
something.  
      
But I think it became real, and I — I’m glad they had the courage to say
what they said.  And hopefully it will have some impact.  
      
Q    Any comment on the Nord Stream deal, sir?  The fact that there’s a
deal that Nord Stream 2 is going to move forward.  
      
THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, I can.  Nord Stream is 99 percent finished.  The
idea that anything that was going to be said or done was going to stop
it was not possible.   
   
But I had, as you know, very, very fruitful discussions with Angela
Merkel, and her — she is working with the German government on a
commitment that suggests that if, in fact, Russia takes pains to
deliberately inflict pain on Ukraine or other countries, they will
respond.  
   
Q    Mr. President, what do you say to Americans who have done
everything right?  They’ve gotten fully vaccinated and they still
contract COVID — a “breakthrough case,” as it’s called.  What do say to
them?  
      
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I say to them: There are very, very, very, very,
very, very few people — number one.  Those that it happened to, I don’t
— it may be possible — I know of none where they’re hospitalized, in
ICU, and/or passed away.   
   
So, at a minimum, I can say that even if they did contract it — which
I’m sorry they did — it’s such a tiny percentage, and it is not
life-threatening.  
   
Guys, we got to get on the plane or they’re going to leave us all. 
Thank you.  
   
Q    Mr. President, one more question on January 6th.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  January 6th is — look, guys.  
   
Q    Are you concerned that no matter what happens now, the result is
going to be perceived as partisan?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, because I think the American public, as I said
tonight — you can’t not understand what happened and still be partisan
and try to cover it up.  But nobody really believes it wasn’t an
insurrection.  I mean, you know it.  You can see it on the looks on
their faces.  They know it.   
   
Thank you.
