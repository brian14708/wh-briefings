East Room

3:03 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  (Applause.)  Please, please
be seated.  
   
Before I begin, any family of the people who just got sworn in here
today?  If you are, stand up.  Congratulations to you all as well. 
Congratulations.  Congratulations.  It’s a good day, isn’t it?  
   
All right.  You get to — and, by the way, if you’re around on Sunday,
we’re going to — you’ll see the fireworks — Fourth of July, our
Independence Day.  (Laughter.)  
   
Mr. Secretary, thank you for administering the oath.  I know how
meaningful this event is to you personally and professionally.  And I
thank you and the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services,
Tracy — where is Tracy?  She — there you go, Tracy.  Thank you very much
— appreciate it — for joining us in this service.  
   
Look, today — today’s special guests — to all of you: It is my honor to
congratulate the 21 of you for — who earned the title of — that our
democracy, in every — is equal to being President — it’s of the same
consequence: citizen — citizen of the United States of America.  
   
You have each come to America from different circumstances and different
reasons and 16 different nationalities.  
   
But like previous generations of immigrants, there is one trait you all
share in common: courage.  It takes courage to get up and leave
everything you know and go to another place, no matter where it is.  You
know, the only homes you’ve ever known, the lives, the loved ones who
weren’t able to come — for a new start in the United States of
America.  
   
If I could hold a second and just point out that I — I’m often asked by
— by world leaders that I’m with, particularly autocrats: How can I
define America?   
   
I was with Xi Jinping in — on the Tibetan Plateau, and he asked me that
when I traveled with him 17,000 miles.  And it was a private meeting —
just he and I and a contemporaneous translator.  He said, “Can you
define America for me?”  I said, “Yeah, I can, in one word — one word:
possibilities.”  Possibilities.  It’s what America is built on.  It’s
one of the reasons why we’re viewed sometimes as being somewhat
egotistical.  We believe anything is possible in America.  Anything is
possible in America.  
   
I think about my own family’s journey here — at least two thirds of it
came from — got on a coffin ship in the Irish Sea, back in 1849, having
no idea whether they’d make it across the Atlantic to the United States,
then to the col- — to the United States of America, but certain if they
did, they could do better.  And they did.  They did better, and they
eventually built a life and raised a family in Scranton, Pennsylvania,
over generations.  
   
And here I stand on the shoulders and sacrifices of my
great-great-grandfather, my great-grandfather, my — and just all that
they did because they believed — they believed like you believe:
Anything is possible.  
   
So I want to thank you all for choosing us, and I mean that sincerely. 
Thank you for choosing the United States of America, believing that
America is worthy of your aspirations, worthy of your dreams.  
   
Making this journey, you have done more than move to a new place.  I’ve
often said that America is the only nation in the world founded on an
idea.  Every other nation in the world is founded on the basis of either
that — geography or ethnicity or religion.  You can define every —
almost everyone else based on those characteristics, but you can’t
define America.  I defy you to tell me what constitutes an American. 
You can’t do it.  We’re an incredibly diverse democracy.  
   
But there is one thing that does define us a country: We were founded on
an idea that, “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men
\[and women\] are created equal…endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable Rights…Life, Liberty, \[and\] the pursuit of Happiness.”  It
sounds corny to Americans, as we learn this in grade school and high
school.  We’ve never fully lived up to it, but we’ve never, ever, ever
walked away from it.  Every generation opens that aperture a little bit
wider.   
   
You know, they go back — as I said, since our nation’s founding, the
quintessential idea in America has been nurtured and enriched and
advanced by the contributions and sacrifices of so many people — almost
all of whom were immigrants.  Native Americans were, in fact, the only
people who were here — only people who were here.  
   
And so, folks, you know, it’s dreams of immigrants like you that built
America and continue to inject new energy, new vitality, new — new
strength.  We’ve seen that most clearly during this pandemic, with
immigrants as frontline workers and as scientists and researchers on the
frontlines of finding vaccines.   
   
Another defining moment of our nation in the past year was NASA landing
Perseverance Rover on Mars, flying the Ingenuity helicopter above its
surface as I talked to them — what is considered a sort of outer-space
Wright brothers moment.   
   
I spoke to the team about this historic mission while it was underway,
which includes immigrants.  The team was made up of immigrants who told
me they grew up looking at the stars — literally, not a joke; I’m not
making this up.  That’s what they told me in our conversation.  Looking
at the stars and believing only America could take them there.  Well —
and we see it each and every single day.  
   
Folks, among you are six members of the United States military.  I ask
you all to please stand.  Thank you, thank you, thank you for service
(inaudible).  (Applause.)  Thank you.   
   
Folks — please sit.  Please sit down.  
   
I was telling our new citizens, in the other room before we came in,
that one of my most — I don’t know how to say it — fulfilling moments
was, as Vice President, when I went over to Saddam Hussein’s god-awful,
gaudy palace.  And there were, I think, 167 men and women in uniform
standing in that palace.  As my wife who — I think, I’m not sure of this
— may be the only First Lady or Second Lady to go into a warzone — an
active war zone.  She was with me, and we both stood there as I was able
to swear in every one of those military officers as U.S. citizens.   
   
And I thought to myself — I thought to myself, “What incredible
justification for all the things that Saddam didn’t believe in.”  And
they stood — and there were a number there who had won Silver Stars —
not — like you, not citizens when you join — won Silver Stars, Bronze
Stars, Conspicuous Service Medals, Purple Hearts.  And I got to swear
them in in the palace of a dictator.  
   
Also among this incredible group that’s here are healthcare workers and
frontline workers who went above and beyond the call in the fight
against COVID-19.  They did so in hospitals and clinics, at our National
Institute of Health — the NIH — at restaurants and retailers, as
educators also in our schools.  I want to thank you all for risking your
lives to help others keep their country and our country going.   
   
And joining you today are your families.  And I want you to know and
understand that this is your day as well.  I can only imagine the pride
you must feel.  Pride in where you come from, in who you are, in the
lives you’ve built together as America — in America, and the communities
that make you stronger, make us stronger.   
   
All of you represent how immigration has always been essential to
America.  We’re constantly renewing ourselves.  Constantly.  When we
come out of this pandemic and build an economy, we’re going to build it
back better.  If we’re going to do that, we need to fix our immigration
system and fully tap the talent and dynamism in our nation.   
   
I’ve kept my commitment and sent an immigration reform bill to the
United States Congress.  It includes smart border management and
security and a pathway to citizenship for 11 million undocumented people
in America.  
   
With Vice President Harris’s leadership, we’re getting at the root
causes of why people are migrating for our southern border from
Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador in the first place: the violence;
the corruption; the gangs; the political instability; the hungry — the
natural — the hunger; the natural disasters.  
   
And I’ve made it clear that we can work together on other critical
issues as well: a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers — the young people
who have only known America as their home; a pathway for immigrants who
are here on temporary protective status — TPS — who came from countries
beset by manmade and natural-made violence and disaster; and a pathway
for farmworkers who are here putting food on our tables but are not
citizens.  
   
Folks, in the competition for the 21st century, we need an immigration
system that both reflects our values and upholds our laws.  We can do
both.  
   
I’ll close with this: No matter where you come from or the culture that
has made us, the language we speak, or the faith we follow, one of the
most basic acts of respect is inviting others into your home.  
   
You know, as we close out Immigration Heritage Month and start our
nation’s Fourth of July weekend, I can think of no better way to honor
each occasion than by welcoming all of you into the White House — the
People’s House — I might add, designed by an Irishman — (laughter) — for
real — in a nation shaped by the immigrant’s heart.  
   
I look forward to standing with you as you embrace your new rights and
responsibilities as American citizens, and as generations have done
before you.  
   
So, welcome, my fellow Americans.  
   
Now, before we take the Pledge of Allegiance together,  
I’d like to invite one guest, Sandra Lindsay, to please come up onstage.
(Applause.)  
   
Sandra immigrated to Queens, New York, from Jamaica when she was 18
years old.  And over the past — I don’t believe this — 30 years — she
doesn’t look 30 years old — (laughter) — she’s pursued her dream of
becoming a nurse to allow her to do what she wanted to do most: give
back to her new country.   
   
She earned a bachelor’s degree, then a master’s degree, then a doctorate
degree, and her citizenship.   And now she’s Director of Nursing for
Critical Care at a hospital on Long Island.  
   
And during the height of the pandemic, she poured her heart and soul
into her work to help patients fight for their lives and to keep her
fellow nurses safe.   
   
With a grandson at home — prematurely — she did what she had to do: She
kept her distance and kept him safe.  He is safe, but she lost an aunt
and an uncle to the virus.  
   
But in her pain, she didn’t lose hope.  When the time came, she was the
first person in America to get fully vaccinated outside of clinical
trials.  She can now hug her grandson.   She’s out there making sure her
patients and folks in her community are getting vaccinated so they can
get back to their lives and their loved ones.  
   
Sandra, if there are any angels in Heaven — as I told you, having spent
a lot of time in the ICU — they’re all nurses, male and female.  Doctors
let you live; nurses make you want to live.  Make you want to live — for
real.   
   
Sandra’s vaccination card and hospital scrubs and the badge that was —
she wore will be included in the Smithsonian’s National Museum of
American History exhibit on COVID-19.  (Applause.)   
   
And today, she’s receiving the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration
Services’ Outstanding Americans by Choice Recognition, which recognizes
the naturalized citizens who have made significant contributions to our
country through civic participation, professional achievement, and
responsible citizenship.  
   
Sandra, thank you for representing the very best of all of us.  Thank
you all in this room.  Thank you, again.  This is America.  
   
Happy Fourth of July.  May God bless you all.  And may God protect our
troops.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)
