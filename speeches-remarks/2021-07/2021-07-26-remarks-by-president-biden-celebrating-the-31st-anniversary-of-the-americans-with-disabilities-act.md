title: Remarks by President Biden Celebrating the 31st Anniversary of the Americans
  with Disabilities Act
---
 
Rose Garden

11:28 A.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Madam Vice President, Tyree — you’re an inspiration. 
Thank you for sharing your story.  
   
Thirty-one years ago today, on the South Lawn of the White House,
President George H.W. Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
He surrou- — he was surrounded by disability advocates and bipartisan
members of the United States Congress, just as we are today.  
   
Speaker Pelosi — welcome, by the way, Madam Speaker — Chairman Leahy,
Leader McCarthy, Senator Casey, Congressman Scott, Congressman La- —
where is here?  There you are, Paul \[Jim\].  You understand this better
than anybody does.  And I want to thank you, Congressman, for all your
work.  And I want to thank you all for being here.  
   
Second — by the way, where’s mom?  Mom — is she here?   
   
MS. BROWN:  She’s at home watching.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, she’s watching.   
   
MS. BROWN:  She’s watching.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  I thought she looked — I said, “Mom is out
there.”  I was going to ask her to stand up.  But, Mom, you can’t stand
up if you’re home.  But, folks — (applause) — give you — thank you for
what you’ve done.  
   
The Second Gentleman is here as well.  Thank you for being with us as
well.   
   
And some of the same folks who fought so hard for this landmark
legislation are with us today.  I just got off the phone with one of
them — a guy named Tom Harkin.  And yest- — or two days ago, I was on
the phone with one who just had his 98th birthday, Bob Dole. 
(Applause.)  But no one worked harder than Tony Coelho to get this
done.  House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer.   
   
Others weren’t able to join us today but were instrumental in bringing
this to life — dear friends, as I said, like  
Tom Harkin and Bob Dole.  
   
And I also spoke — as I said, Bob is — wanted to pass on his regards, as
did Tom.  Tom is up in Wisconsin working on — he said on ADA, doing
something up there.  Now, he didn’t explain exactly what.   
   
There are still more with us that are here in spirit, like Ted Kennedy,
Major Owens — Congressman Major Owens, and countless other advocates.  
   
I was enormously proud to be a co-sponsor to the ADA as Pat Leahy was,
as well, if I’m not mistaken, as a member of the United States Senate.  
   
And I’m proud to be here today, as President, alongside so many fearless
champions who represent the ongoing legacy of this law, from the
foundations to its future.  
   
Thirty-one years ago, after its passage, many Americans have never lived
in a world without the ADA.  Generations have grown up not knowing a
time before it existed.   
   
But many of us can still recall an America where a person with a
disability was denied service in restaurants and grocery stores, and
could be; where a person using a wheelchair couldn’t ride on a train or
take a bus to work or to school; where an employer could refuse to hire
you because of a disability.  An America that wasn’t built for all
Americans.  
   
Then we passed the ADA and made a commitment to build a nation for all
of us.  All of us.  And we moved America closer to fulfilling that
promise of liberty and justice, and maybe most importantly, dignity and
equality for all.  
   
You know, and perhaps most importantly, we did it together.  This was a
Democratic bill signed by a Republican president.  A product of passion
and compassion, not partisanship.  Progress that wasn’t political, but
personal, to millions of families.  
   
I’ll never forget the moment the ADA passed.  And you may remember it,
Pat.  Standing on the floor of the United States Senate, and Tom Harkin
saw the recognition — he rose.  And the first time — first time in the
history that I’m aware of — in the United States Senate, he stood up and
he signed in a speech to his brother.  Tom wasn’t just sending a message
to millions of deaf and hard-of-hearing folks; he was speaking to his
brother, Frank.  It was personal to him.  
   
It was personal to Bob Dole, as well, who lost the use of his right arm
in a heroic effort during World War Two; who laid out in a hospital for
almost three years — his injury listed, and they also lasted an entire
lifetime.  
   
But like so many Americans, he turned his disability,  
his apparent limitation, into greater purpose and will.  He made — he
made the rights of disabled Americans a lifelong cause.   
   
And for more than 60 million Americans living with disabilities, the ADA
is so much more than a law; it’s a source of opportunity, participation,
independent living, and respect and dignity, the bulwark against
discrimination, and a path to independence.  
   
And for our nation, the ADA is more than a law as well; it’s testament
to our character as a people, our character as Americans.  It’s a
triumph of American values.    
   
But, of course, this law didn’t bring an end to the work we need to do. 
Today, too many Americans still face barriers to freedom and equality. 
But thanks to this movement that spans all races, beliefs, backgrounds,
and generations, we’re once again making progress together.    
   
In my first day in office, I was proud to sign an executive order
establishing a government-wide commitment to advancing equity, including
people with disabilities.  (Applause.)    
   
And I was proud to appoint the first-ever White House Disability Policy
Director, Kim Knackstedt.  Where are you, Kim?  (Applause.)  Where is
Kim?  Thank you, Kim.   
   
And I’m ensuring that dignity and rights of disabled Americans are
lifted up in every policy we purzue \[sic\] — pursue, from continuing to
make sure that this administration looks like America, appointing people
with disabilities to positions across the government.    
   
In the American Rescue Plan, we were able to include substantial support
for schools that better serve students with disabilities, that —
expanding access to vaccines for disabled Americans.  
   
As part of my Build Back Better plan — it was already mentioned — we
propose $400 billion to expand access to home- and community-based care
— (applause) — helping people with disabilities and older adults live
more independently.    
   
And I’m glad that Congress is beginning to move on the Better Care
Better Jobs Act — (applause) — championed by my buddy, Bobby Casey —
Bobby, thank you — which builds on that effort.  
   
This past year, the entire nation saw just how vital our caregivers are
and how critical home-based care truly is for so many Americans.    
   
This legislation will help ensure that caregivers are fairly compensated
for their work.  (Applause.)  In addition, I’ve also called on Congress
to eliminate the discriminatory sub-minimum wage provisions — (applause)
— that too often keep people with disabilities from getting good jobs
with fair wages.  
   
And because of additional executive orders I’ve signed, we’re working to
remove barriers that hold back disabled Americans from exercising their
sacred right to vote.    
   
And we’re ensuring that the federal government is a model employer when
it comes to wages, accommodations, and opportunities to advance people
with disabilities.  That’s a firm commitment.    
   
And today — (applause) — finally, I’m proud to announce a new effort —
the first of its kind — to help Americans grappling with long-term
effects of COVID-19 that doctors call “long COVID.”  
   
Many Americans who seemingly recover from the virus still face lingering
challenges like breathing problems, brain fog, chronic pain, and
fatigue.  These conditions can sometimes — can sometimes rise to the
level of a disability.    
   
So, we’re bringing agencies together to make sure Americans with long
COVID, who have a disability, have access to the rights and resources
that are due under the disability law — (applause) — which includes
accommodations and services in the workplace, in school, and our
healthcare system so — so they can live their lives in dignity and get
the support they need as they continue to navigate these challenges.  
   
We made important progress, but we still have work to do.  We have to
keep going to ensure that every single American has a chance to
contribute their talents and thrive and succeed.  
   
And I know that today’s fearless advocates, some of whom are with us
today, are going to accomplish incredible things.  
   
People like — like M- — excuse me, people like Mr. Tootle.  Where are
you?  (Applause.)  Stand up, man.  Thank you.  Thank you, thank you,
thank you.   
   
You know, I want to thank you for your continued efforts to build an
America for everyone, and as I said, you courageous advocates who led
the way 31 years ago — a long time before the foundation for progress is
strong, though.  It’s part of the mor- — moral bedrock of our nation and
something every American should be proud of.  
   
Now it’s my honor to sign the proclamation on the 31st anniversary of
the ADA.  
   
I want to thank you all.  May God bless you and all of you dealing with
disabilities.  You’re — you are an inspiration to all of us.  I really
mean it.  You’re an absolute inspiration. (Applause.)  
   
May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.  Now I’m going to
walk over and sign this.  I’m going to invite up, though — Nancy, come
on up.  Steny.  I think we ought to get you up here.  You were — you’re
a big part of it — Tony Coelho.  Am I leaving anybody out?   
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Pat.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Pat, you — you were there at the time.  Why don’t you
get your rear end up here and put your — (laughter).  
   
The Leader is taking his camera, because Pat would rather use his camera
than, I think, anything else.   
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Come on.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, come on.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Come on up.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Tony, you get right in the back here.  You were a big,
big, gigantic part of this.    
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Pat, come on.  Get in.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  All right.  The anniversary of the Americans with
Disability Act 2021.   
   
(The executive order is signed.)   
   
(Applause.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Tony.  (Hands a pen.)  
   
REPRESENTATIVE COELHO:  Thank you.  
   
LEADER HOYER:  Thank you, sir.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Good to see you.   
   
Madam Speaker.  Pat.  
   
SENATOR LEAHY:  Thank you, sir.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And this hero right there.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I will, but I want to make sure I got all the —  
   
(Gives pen to Ms. Brown.)  
   
MS. BROWN:  Thank you so much.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, everybody.  (Applause.) Let’s keep it going. 
(Applause.)  
   
Q    Mr. President, would it be helpful if employers mandated vaccines,
sir?  
   
Q    Mr. President, do you have confidence you can get the unvaccinated
Americans vaccinated?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  We have to.  
   
Q    How?   
   
Q    Mr. President, are you confident there will be an infrastructure
deal this week — a bipartisan infrastructure deal?     
   
THE PRESIDENT:  You know me — I’m always optimistic.  Yes.
