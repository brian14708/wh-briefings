Vice President’s Ceremonial Office

Eisenhower Executive Office Building

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  So, before we get started, I just want to quickly
address the Supreme Court’s ruling today on medication abortion.  This
is not a cause for celebration, because the reality is certain things
are still not going to change. 

We are looking at the fact that two thirds of women of reproductive age
in America live in a state with a Trump abortion ban.  This ruling is
not going to change that.  This ruling is not going to change the fact
that Trump’s allies have a plan that if all else fails, to eliminate
medication abortion through executive action. 

So, we must remain clear-eyed about the threats to reproductive freedom
in America, and we must remain vigilant. 

And with that, I welcome all of you.  (Laughter.) 

PARTICIPANT:  Thank you.

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And I am happy for us to get started.

END
