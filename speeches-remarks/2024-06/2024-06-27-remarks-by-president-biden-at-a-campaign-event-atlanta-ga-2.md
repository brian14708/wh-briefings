THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. 
(Applause.)  I appreciate it.

You’ve been here the whole time.  I see it.  I see that d- — patch
there.  (Applause.)

Look, folks, you know, there — I shouldn’t say this, but my brother
always uses lines from movies.  There was a famous movie by John Wayne,
and — and he’s working for the — the Northern military trying to get the
Apaches back on the reservation, and they were lying like hell to him. 

And they’re all sitting on a bluff, and John Wayne was sitting with two
Indian — they were — they were tr- — Apaches.  And one of them looked at
John Wayne and said, “These guys are nothing but lying, dog-faced pony
soldiers.”  (Laughter and applause.)

Except, he’s just a liar. 

Look, folks, what’s going to happen over the next couple days is they’re
going to be — they’re going to be out there fact-checking all the things
he said.  (Applause.)

I can’t think of one thing he said that was true.  (Applause.)  No, I —
I’m not being facetious. 

But, look, we’re going to beat this guy.  We need to beat this guy. 
(Applause.)  And I need you in order to beat him.  You’re the people I’m
running for.  (Applause.)

AUDIENCE:  We need you!  We need you!  We need you!

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, here — he says he’s going to —

AUDIENCE:  We need you!  We need you!  We need you!

THE PRESIDENT:  He says he’s going to be the retribution for his
supporters.   
  
You are the reason why America is as good as we are.  We’re the finest
nation in the whole damn world — (applause) — and no one is close. 
Nobody is close.

So, let’s keep going.  See you at the next one.  (Applause.)

God love you all.  (Applause.) 

Heading to North Carolina.  (Applause.)  All right.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.  I
wanted to go home with you. 

Thank you.  (Applause.)
