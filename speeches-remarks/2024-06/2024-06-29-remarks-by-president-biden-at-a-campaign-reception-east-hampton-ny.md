3:44 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I think I should leave now.  (Applause.)   
   
Thank you, thank you, thank you.   
   
By the way, she was 25, and I was — I was — just so you know, I was — I
was under 35.  (Laughter.)  I used to be — she used to be just — anyway,
now she’s 25 years younger than I am.  I don’t know how that happened. 
(Laughter.)  
   
Folks, look, Lizanne and Barry, thank you very much for hosting us.  But
more importantly, thank you for your friendship.  It’s great to see so
many friends who’ve been with me for a long, long time.   
   
Three great members of Congress: Dan, Tom, and Adriano.  Where are —
where you guys?  Did you — still — there — thanks, fellas.  (Applause.) 
No way out, huh?  
   
This is what we call in our business a busman’s holiday, having to come
hear another politician speak.   
   
Look, another friend, Bonnie — where — where’s Bonnie?  Bonnie, I want
to tell you — Bonnie Lautenberg — Frank Lautenberg, we both miss him
dearly.  And one of the things I was able to do before he passed and
when he passed was — honored him posthumously, bestowed the Medal of
Freedom on him.  And, Bonnie — (applause) — you’ve been a great friend
for a long time.  
   
It’s great to see Howard Stern here.  Where is Howard?  How could I miss
Howard?  Anyway, he was here a moment ago.  Anyway, it was great to see
him, and I had a great time on his show.  And I’m actually going to take
a chance in going back.  (Laughter.)  
   
Look, I’d like to make three points today.   
   
First, thank you all for your support.  And I really mean it.  It’s
making a real difference in building a campaign to win.  In fact, today,
we announced, just since the debate, we’ve raised — just since the
debate, raised $27 million, the strongest stretch — (applause) — since
our campaign started.  And we’re on track for a very strong June.   
   
Second, but I understand the concern about the debate.  I get it.  I
didn’t have a great night.  But here’s what I — not getting reported:
Voters had a different reaction than the pundits.  Since the debate,
polls show a little movement, and we’ve moved us up, actually.  Research
on the debate shows it can — you know, all those folks on the edge,
converting more undecided voters.  Well, we converted more undecided
voters than Trump did, especially on January 6th and who’s fighting for
the working class, the middle class.   
   
He — and, by the way, the Times had their editorial.  Well, guess what? 
They also pointed out he lied 28 times in a matter of 90 minutes. 
That’s pretty good.  That’s pretty good.  (Laughter.)  
   
But the big takeaway were his lies.  People remembered how bad things
were during his presidency, how much they disliked him.  They don’t like
the chaos and extremism that he brought.  His answer to abortion and
January 6th did a lot of damage to his position — a lot of damage.  
   
He also lied about how great he was with veterans.  Well, then I told
him how he had called the veterans who had given their lives in a
cemetery in <s>Italy</s> \[France\] — he wouldn’t go to the cemetery,
and — because he said they’re a bunch of “suckers” and “losers.”  Well,
our son was one of those people — not in <s>Italy</s> \[France\] but in
Iraq — and he died.   
   
Well, guess what?  He tried to deny it.  But let me ask you this: Are
you going to believe a four-star Marine general and his own chief of
staff, John Kelly, who told us that’s exactly what Trump said, or a
disgraced, defeated president, liar like Trump?  
   
It’s about the fact that — think about this — 40 of his 44 top advisors
in his administration refuse to endorse him — 40 out of 44, including
his vice president.  And they refuse to support him this time.  It tells
you a hell of a lot about the man they worked for.   
   
The point is, I didn’t have a great night but neither did Trump.  We’ve
long believed the more voters focus on choice and better than focusing
on just what we have.    
   
Look, I — I get kidded for saying: Don’t compare me to the Almighty;
compare me to the alternative.  Well, that’s not a hard fight.  That’s
not a hard fight.  
   
Third, I would not be running again if I didn’t believe with all my
heart and soul I can do this job.  I know I don’t walk as easy I used
to, I don’t speak as smoothly as I used to, I don’t debate as well as I
used to.  But here’s what I also know: I know how to tell the truth.  I
know right from wrong.  I know how to do this job.  And I know how to
get things done.  And I know, like millions of Americans know, when you
get kicked down, you get back up.  And we’re back up.  (Applause.)  
   
I’ve got a lot more to say, but I’m not going to take a lot of your
time.  Let me close with this.  Donald Trump is a genuine threat to this
nation.  That is not hyperbole.  He’s a threat to our freedom.  He’s a
threat to our democracy.  He is literally a threat to the America that
we stand for.   
   
He doesn’t understand what I think all of us do, that America is unique
in the world.  We’re literally the unique country in the world.  We’re
the only country in the world bas- — built on an idea.  Every other
country is built on ethnicity or geography or religion.  Only one based
on an idea: We hold these truths to self-evident, that all men and women
are created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout their
lives.   
   
We’ve never fully lived up to it, but we’ve — damned if we’ve ever
walked away from it.  And I’ll be damned if, in 2024, two years before
the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, I’m going to
let Donald Trump walk us away from it.  That’s not going to happen. 
It’s not going to happen.  (Applause.)  
   
You know, I was told by my docs when I had an aneurism years ago — when
I was going down to the operating room for a nine-hour operation, I
remember asking him — I said, “How am I going to do, doc?”  He said,
“Well, you got a good 35 to 50 percent chance.”  (Laughter.)  And I
said, “Well, that’s good.”  
   
And after it was all over, he said, “You know what your problem is,
Senator?”  He said, “You’re a congenital optimist.”  (Laughter.)  Well,
I am.  
   
I still believe this nation is honest and decent, and treating people
with respect is important.  I still think this nation gives everyone a
fair shot and leaves nobody behind.  I still — I still believe this
nation gives hate no safe harbor.  We never have.  
   
And we’re still a beacon to the world.  I can tell you, as my colleagues
can, I’ve met every major world leader for the last 207 years. 
(Laughter.)   
   
But all kidding aside, we can never give up on what America makes
America — America makes America — the basic, fundamental truths that we
believe in, the decency we have.  The American people are good, decent
people.  
   
And Donald Trump is motivated by revenge and retribution.  Well, revenge
and retribution never built a damn thing.  But what built America is
hope, optimism, a possibility.  (Applause.)  That’s what’s always built
America, and that’s what we’re going to continue to do: build America
today.   
   
The choice in this election is simple as this: Donald Trump will destroy
democracy.  That’s not hyperbole.  He’ll de- — I will defend it.    
   
He’ll never — I’ve never been more optimistic about America’s future. 
We just have to remember who in the hell we are.  We are the United
States of America.  There is nothing — nothing, nothing — beyond our
capacity — nothing — when we do it together.  And we plan on doing
that.  You’re allowing me to do that.  
   
Folks, thank you very much.  I promise you: We’re going to win this
election.  We’re going to win this election.  (Applause.)  
   
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  In large part because of you all. 
Thank you very much.   
   
Guys, thanks for being here.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  
   
And, by the way, I don’t want to go home.  (Laughter.)   
   
Thank you, again, our host and hostess.  Tha- — this is magnificent. 
(Applause.)  Thank you, thank you, thank you.   
   
All right.  Thanks, everybody.  Enjoy the day.  (Applause.)
