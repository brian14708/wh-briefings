New York, New York

Looking at this crowd, I see the promise of Pride in all your faces:
joy, strength, and the beautiful boldness that brings you here today.

As a writing teacher, I’ve always believed that the stories we tell
shape our world. And this monument and the visitor center tell a story
we all need to know, no matter who we are.

It teaches us the power of hope and persistence.

It inspires us to work harder for the world that our children deserve.

It reminds us that our differences are precious and our similarities
infinite.

This is American history.

And like so many victories that the LGBTQ community has won throughout
the years, this is a work of love.

Diana, Ann Marie – with your hope and dedication, you’ve shown us that
love can move mountains.

You have the kind of partnership – both in life and in your work – that
everyone hopes to find. And you’ve made sure to keep the diversity of
this community at the center of your work.

From today on, this visitor center and monument will tell our nation’s
story to the teenager who comes here and discovers she isn’t alone. The
activist who wants to show his children what came before. And all those
who wish to learn from the wisdom of the past and use it to help chart
the course for our future.

I’m grateful to you and to Pride Live for making that possible.

Joe will never stop fighting for this country and for communities like
this one. 

That’s who Joe is. He wakes up every morning thinking about how he can
make the lives of Americans better.

Joe and I are proud to stand beside you today, and every day.

Now, please help me welcome, the incredible forces behind today: Diana
Rodriguez and Ann Marie Gothard!
