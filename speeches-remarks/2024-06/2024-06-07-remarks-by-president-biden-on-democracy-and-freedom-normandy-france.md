Pointe du Hoc  
Normandy, France

4:43 P.M. CEST  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  John, how are you?  Please, sit down.  (Applause.)  
   
At last, the hour had come.  Dawn, 6th of June, 1944.  The wind was
pounding, as it is today and always has against these cliffs.   
   
Two hundred and twenty-five American Rangers arrived by ship, jumped
into the waves, and stormed the beach.  They could see — all they could
see was the outline of the shore and the enormity of these cliffs.  And
I’d like to lo- — I know I’ll get in trouble with the Secret Service if
I go to the edge and look over but — (laughter) — think of those cliffs,
as my host just sh- — showed me.  That’s what we’re standing on top
of.  
   
They could hear — all they could hear was the crack of bullets hitting
ships, sand, rocks — hitting everything.  All they knew was time was of
the essence.   
   
They had only 30 minutes — 30 minutes to eliminate the Nazi guns high on
this cliff — guns that could halt the Allied invasion before it even
began.  But these were American Rangers.  They were ready.   
   
They ran toward the cliffs, and mines planted by Field Marshall Rommeny
— Rommel exploded around them.  But still, they kept coming.   
   
Gunfire rained above them.  But still, they kept coming.   
   
Nazi grenades thrown from above exploded against the cliffs, but still
they kept coming.   
   
Within minutes, they reached the base of this cliff.  They launched
their ladders, their ropes, and grappling hooks, and they began to
climb.   
   
When the Nazis cut their ladders, the Rangers used their ropes.  When
the Nazis cut their ropes, the Rangers used their hands.  And inch by
inch, foot by foot, yard by yard, the Rangers clawed — literally clawed
their way up this mighty precipice until at last they reached the
top.   
   
They breached Hitler’s Atlantic Wall.  And they turned, in that one
effort, the tide of war that began to save the world.  
   
Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday I paid my respects at the American
Cemetery just a few miles from here, where many of the Rangers who died
taking this cliff are buried.  I spoke of what the — about what the
fallen had done to defend freedom.  
   
Today, as I look out at this battlefield and all the bunkers and bomb
craters that are still surround it, one thought comes to mind: My God. 
My God, how did they do it?  How were these Americans willing to risk
everything, dare everything, and give everything?   
   
They were Americans like Sergeant Leonard Lo- — Lo- — Sergeant Leonard
Lomell from New York.  He was one of the first Rangers to jump off his
ship and run toward the cliff.  He almost was shot right above the hip
initially, and he didn’t — wasn’t sure, but he was.  He kept going.   
   
At one point, he was scaling the cliff and another Ranger yelled, “I’m
not sure I can make it.”  And Lomell yelled back with every ounce of
strength he had in him, “You’ve got to hold on.”  And he did, and they
did.    
   
Americans like Sergeant Tom Ruggiero from Massachusetts.  A German shell
hit his boat as he was approaching the shore.  Everything exploded.  The
Sergeant was knocked into the freezing water, and, as he told it, he
began to utter a prayer, “Dear God, don’t let me drown.  I want to get
in and do what I’m here and supposed to do.”   
   
Americans like Lieutenant Colonel James Rudder, Texas. When the military
asked for a battalion for this daring mission, he raised his hand and
said, “My Rangers can do the job.”  He knew their capacity.  He knew the
strength of their character.   
   
And a few days after they scaled this cliff, he wrote a condolence
letter to a mother of one of the Rangers who gave his life here.  And
that letter said, “A country must be great to call for the sacrifice of
such men.”  “A country must be great to call for the sacrifice of such
men.”   
   
And Americans like John Wardell of New Jersey.  And John is here.  John,
we love you, man.  Thank you for all you’ve done.  (Applause.)  You
deserve that and a lot more, John.  
   
Just 18 years old, he deployed to this cliff to replace the surviving
Rangers on that D-Day invasion.  He would go on to fight across France
and Germany.  In early in December of 1944, during one of those battles,
shrapnel pierced his skull.  But by Christmas, he was back, fighting
with his unit.   
   
And here is what he said about — what — the notes he kept at that time. 
He said, “Knowing that my buddies and I always looked out for one
another” — that’s why he came back.  That’s why he fought so hard to get
back.  He always looked out, and his buddies looked out for one
another.   
   
When we talk about democracy — American democracy, we often talk about
the ideals of life, liberty, pursuit of happiness.  What we don’t talk
about is how hard it is, how many ways we’re asked to walk away, how
many instincts are to walk away — the most natural instinct is to walk
away, to be selfish, to force our will upon others, to seize power and
never give up.  
   
American democracy asks the hardest of things: to believe that we’re
part of something bigger than ourselves.  So, democracy begins with each
of us.    
   
It begins when one person decides there’s something more important than
themselves; when they decide the person they’re serving alongside of is
someone to look after; when they decide the mission matters more than
their life; when they decide that their country matters more than they
do.  That’s what the Rangers at Port — at Pom- — Pointe de Hoc did. 
That’s they decided.  That’s what every soldier and every Marine who
stormed these beaches decided.   
   
A feared dictator had conquered a continent had finally met his match. 
Because of them, the war turned.   
   
They stood against Hitler’s aggression.   
   
Does anyone doubt — does anyone doubt that they would want America to
stand up against Putin’s aggression here in Europe today?   
   
They stormed the beaches alongside their allies.   
   
Does anyone believe these Rangers would want America to go it alone
today?  
   
They fought to vanquish a hateful ideology in the ‘30s and ‘40s.  Does
anyone doubt they wouldn’t move heaven and earth to vanquish hateful
ideologies of today?   
   
These Rangers put mission and country above themselves.  Does anyone
believe they would exact any less from every American today?   
   
These Rangers remembered with reverence those who gave their lives in
battle.  Could they or anyone ever imagine that America would do the
same — wouldn’t do the same?  They believed America was the beacon to
the world.  And I’m certain they believed that it would be that way
forever.  
   
You know, we stand today — where we stand was not sacred ground on June
the 5th, but that’s what it became on June the 6th.  
   
The Rangers who scaled this cliff didn’t know they would change the
world.  But they did.  
   
I’ve long said that history has shown that ordinary Americans can do
extraordinary things when challenged.  There’s no better example of that
in the entire world than right here at Pointe du Hoc.  
   
Rangers from farms and cities in every part of America, from homes that
didn’t know wealth and power, they came to a shoreline that none of them
would have ever picked out on a map.  
   
They came to a country many of them had never seen for a people they had
never met.  But they came, they did their job, they fulfilled their
mission, and they did their duty.  
   
They were a part of something greater than themselves.  They were
Americans.  
   
I stand here today as the first president to come to Pointe du Hoc when
none of those 225 brave men who scaled this cliff on D-Day are still
alive.  None.  
   
But I’m here to tell you that with them gone, the wind we hear coming
off this ocean will not fade.  It will grow louder.  
   
As we gather here today, it’s not just to honor those who showed such
remarkable bravery on that day, June 6th, 1944.  It’s to listen to the
echoes of their voices, to hear them, because they are summoning us, and
they’re summoning us now.  
   
They’re ask us: What will we do?  
   
They’re not asking us to scale these cliffs, but they’re asking us to
stay true to what America stands for.  
   
They’re not asking us to give or risk our lives, but they are asking us
to care for others and our country more than ourselves.  
   
They’re not asking us to do their job.  They’re asking us to do our job:
to protect freedom in our time, to defend democracy, to stand up
aggression abroad and at home, to be part of something bigger than
ourselves.  
   
My fellow Americans, I refuse to believe — I simply refuse to believe
that America’s greatness is a thing of the past.  
   
I still believe there is nothing beyond our capacity in America when we
act together.  
   
We’re the fortunate heirs of a legacy of these heroes, those who scaled
the cliffs at Pointe du Hoc.  But we must also be the keepers of their
mission — the keepers of their mission, the bearers of the flame of
freedom that they kept burning bright.  That — that is the truest
testimonial to their lives — our actions every day to ensure that our
democracy endures and the soul our nation endures.  
   
To come here simply to remember the ghosts of Pointe du Hoc isn’t
enough.  We have — need to hear them.  We have to listen to them.  We
need to listen to what they had.  We need to make a solemn vow to never
let them down.  
   
God bless the fallen.  God bless the brave men who scaled these cliffs. 
May God protect our troops.  God bless America.  (Applause.)
