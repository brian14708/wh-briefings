THE PRESIDENT:  All right.  Well, thank you all for being here.  
   
Look, I want to thank the leaders for being here today.  We got a lot of
work to do.  We got to figure out how we’re going to keep funding the
government, which is an important problem, an important solution we need
to find.  And I think we can do that.  
   
And — and Ukraine — I think the need is urgent.  I hope we get to speak
to that a little bit.  And I think the consequence of inaction every day
in Ukraine are dire.  I’ve been speaking to some of our — our G7
partners.  And you just got back, Chuck.  
   
LEADER SCHUMER:  I did.  I did.  Yeah.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  They’re very concerned.  
   
And — and also, we need to — we — we need to — in terms of the
supplemental, we need to deal with the Israeli portion.  But that also
contains a significant portion having to do with humanitarian assistance
into the Palestinian area, which I think is important.  
   
And we have to replenish the air defenses for Israel, and we have to
work on making sure they don’t face the threat from — they can face the
threat from the — from what’s going on in the Middle East, not just from
Hamas but from Iran.  
   
And so — and government funding, I’m sure you guys had all — that all
taken care of.  But all kidding aside, I think that it’s Congress’s
responsibility to fund the government.  We got to get about doing it.  A
shutdown would damage the economy significantly, and I think we all
agree to that.  And we need bipartisan solutions.  
   
So, I want to hear from the group.  And I want to hear from all of you
here.  So, thank you all for coming.  And that’s what we’re going to be
talking about.  Thank you.  
   
(Cross-talk.)  
   
We’ll get a chance to talk afterwards.
