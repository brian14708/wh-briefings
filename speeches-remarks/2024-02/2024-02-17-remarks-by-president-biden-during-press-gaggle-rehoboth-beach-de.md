Rehoboth Beach, Delaware

THE PRESIDENT:  I spoke with Zelenskyy this afternoon to let him know
that I was confident we were going to get that money to keep that
country from being overrun by Russia.  
   
You know, there’s so much at stake.  I learned — I watched the
television the other night and one of the other Republican candidates
saying I’ve never explained to the American people why NATO is so
important.   
   
NATO is critical to our survival.  NATO has held — we have never been
able to avoid a European conflict.  As long as there’s NATO, we’re —
have allies — allies who are confident and have defended us.  
   
And, by the way, the only time Article 5 has been invoked is the — when
we were attacked on 9/11.  So, the idea that we’re going to walk away
from Ukraine, the idea that we’re going to let NATO begin to split is
totally against the interests of the United States of America and it is
against our word we’ve given for — since Tru- — since all the way back
to Eisenhower.  
   
So, it’s about time we make sure that Congress come home and pass the
legislation funding NATO.  It’s critical.  Our security depends on it.  
   
Q    How — how confident are you that there isn’t another city that
falls right after this if Congress acts on it?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m not.  I’m not.  No one can be.   
   
Look, the Ukrainian people have fought so bravely and heroically. 
They’ve put so much on the line.  And the idea that now when they’re
running out of ammunition, we walk away — I find it absurd.  I find it
unethical.  I find it just contrary to everything we are as a country. 
So, I’m going to fight until we get it — get them the ammunition they
need and the capacity they need to defend themselves.  
   
Thank you very much.  
   
Q    Have you heard anything else about what led to Navalny’s death,
sir?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I haven’t — I’ve heard several things.  I haven’t had
them confirmed.  But the fact of the matter is: Putin is responsible,
whether he ordered it or he is responsible for the circumstances he put
that man in.  And he’s — it’s a reflection of who he is.  And it just
cannot be tolerated.  
   
I said we’d — there would be a price to pay.  He is paying a price
already.  Since 2000 when I made that statement, Russians have had
sanctions imposed on them and a whole range of other impacts.   
   
But it’s just — this is — look, the idea that after 70 years we have a
NATO Alliance that has kept the peace, basically, in Europe, kept us out
of the m- — the idea the transatlantic alliance is not overwhelmingly in
our interest is bizarre.  
   
It can only be — I — I just — I don’t understand.  I don’t understand. 
There’s either a complete lack of knowledge of history or the lack of
responsibility.  
   
Thank you very much.  
   
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
