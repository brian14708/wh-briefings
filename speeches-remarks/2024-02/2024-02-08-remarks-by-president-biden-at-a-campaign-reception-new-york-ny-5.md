Private Residence  
New York, New York  
(February 7, 2024)

2:38 P.M. EST  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  He doesn’t want to admit it, but we go back a long
way.   
   
MR. LINDEN:  It’s true.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  And I — it’s means a lot to me.  
   
MR. LINDEN:  It means a lot to me, sir.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Folks, look, this is pretty informal, but the fact of
the matter is — I — I think the key word — and I want to thank Kathleen
and Dana for all you guys are — all three of you are doing.  
   
Look, I look around the room — and some of you have been with me and
I’ve been with you for a long time.  And you’ve educated me.  You know,
I started off back in 1972 as a 29-year-old kid.  I know I don’t look
that old, but — (laughter).   
   
But I was a 29-year-old kid, and we had big problems in terms of the
environment.  And people wonder why in God’s name was I talking about
the environment.  I mean it sincerely.   
   
And — I’m just going to just walk out here.  Can you all hear me if I’m
standing out here?  
   
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Yes.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.   
   
Well, what I — what I realized was that I — when we moved from Scranton,
Pennsylvania — a coalmining town — because coal died.  Although my dad
wasn’t in the coal business, but that’s — he worked as a salesperson. 
And he moved back to where he was raised as a kid: Wilmington,
Delaware.  Actually, we were in a place called Claymont, Delaware, which
was steel town at the time — 4,500 — it was Worth Steel.   
   
And — and it also — it was right on the border, if you know anything
about Delaware, there’s an arch that goes up into Pennsylvania and
around the Delaware River.  And that corner where the arch meets the
Delaware River in Pennsylvania, there are more oil refineries when I was
growing up than there were in Houston.   
   
And the prevailing winds — literally not figuratively, literally — are
southwest — I mean southeast.  And so, I grew up, like a lot of other of
my friends — we moved there when I was in third grade — suffered from
bronchial asthma.   
   
And we had one of the worst environmental records of any state in the
nation.  We were — we were listed for a long time as having the worst
environment where we — period — in terms of exposure to carcinogenic
substances.  
   
And — and I — I just couldn’t understand how — like, I’d get in the car
— I didn’t plan on saying this, so I apologize I’m taking longer.  But I
— I’d get in the car in the morning — we lived in a place called the
Philadelphia Pike, which was a four-lane access highway from Wilmington,
Delaware, to Philadelphia.  And we lived not far from — we lived not far
from a little school I went to, probably the equivalent of a — maybe
three quarters of a mile.  And you could walk up the Pike, but it was
too dangerous.  My mother didn’t want third and fourth graders — or fir-
— a first and third grader, I mean — walking up to the school we went
to.  So, she’d drive up in the morning, drop us in the parking lot.   
   
And two things always impressed me.  And I mean this sincerely, and then
I’ll stop.  When the first frost came and she turned on the windshield
wiper, there would literally be an oil slick on the window.  Not a
joke.  We were one of those fence-line communities.  You all are
familiar with them in the environmental community.  An oil slick.  
   
And a lot of us — a lot of my buddies, a lot of my friends ended up with
various lung diseases in the case of many of us.  I don’t know many of
my friends who didn’t have bronchial asthma, because of it.  
   
But my generic point is this: You know, what you’re doing is changing
the world.  What you’re doing.  Not me.  What you’re doing.  You’re the
economic, political, and philosophic engine of this change.   
   
There is only one existential threat we face in this world, and that’s
the environment.  I mean, it literally is the existential threat.  It’s
even more consequential than nuclear power, nuclear war.  That would be
horrible and awful and it would just make the environment incredibly
worse.  But it’s about the environment.   
   
And so many of you didn’t have to do — none of you had to do what you’ve
done.  You’ve taken your — your intellect, you’ve taken your fortunes,
you’ve taken your — your interests, and you’ve — and you’ve inspired a
lot of people.  I’m not joking about this now when I say this.  
   
Twenty years ago, it was a — we couldn’t fill this room this way —
although you all were working on it 20 years ago, but it just wasn’t
there.   
   
And I’ve — if I hear one more — I used to hear at the beginning when I
was running this time out when I was vice president that there’s no
environmental problems.   
   
Well, as I traveled — as vice president, I traveled the nation for every
major forest fire.  More — more timber has burned to the ground than, in
fact — as a consequence of what has happened in the environment — than —
than makes up the entire state of Maryland, the square f- — square
footage.   
   
I don’t hear many people, even in the business community, saying, “Well,
we don’t have a problem with the environment.  We don’t have a
problem.”  
   
And even when I go around the world, the world is looking to us.  I’ve
known every major world leader — because of my job, not because I’m so
important — because I’ve just been — I’ve done foreign policy issues.  I
was chairman of Foreign Relations Committee for years as well as —
that’s why Barack asked me to be vice president: on the foreign policy
side.   
   
And so, I literally know every major world leader, every — every —
almost every major world leader.  And the major ones, I do know.  And
they’re looking to us.  They’re looking to us, both to maintain their
energy needs and deal with the environment.  They’re not — they’re not
one and the same.   
   
But that’s — so, it’s amazing to me how much the rest of the world looks
to us, to the United States, for everything — not to Joe Biden, to the
United States of America — because the rest of the world is in a very —
in a — in a piece — in a moment of transition like we haven’t seen.  We
see it once every six or seven generations.   
   
And there’s a transition going on based on the changes — incredible
technological changes that are taking place in the world.  
   
And so, I just want to thank you for not only dealing with the
environment but for helping us manage our international relations in
ways that we — we have been unable to do.   And it’s going to get harder
before it gets easier, but it still matters.   
   
Second point I’d like to make, and then I’ll shush up and take your
questions.  Second thing I’d like to say is that one of the things that
— how can I say this?  One of the things that I think matters is that,
all of a sudden — and I mean it in a historical sense, “all of the
sudden” — the rest of your colleagues around the — around the country
understand what you’ve been doing.  They don’t like it, maybe, but they
understand.  
   
And I — you know, I — I don’t get any phone calls from DuPont company
anymore what we’re doing.  I don’t get — I mean, it’s a realization.   
   
And two things that we’ve done — we, all of us — number one, some of you
were upset when I — and I don’t blame you — when I announced in 2020 and
I didn’t lay out my detailed plan on the environment until I first
talked to labor — not because I needed labor, because I want labor to
understand: When I think environmental protection, I think jobs, I think
opportunity, I think change.   
   
And you saw what happened when I was able to convince the IBEW to join
on.  I’ve become most pro-union, pro-environmental president in
(inaudible) history — both, at the same time.   
   
If you had told me or you — I told you 10 years ago that organized labor
and the environment would be one and the same and they were going to be
on the same page, I think we all would have looked like we were
crazy.   
   
But I invited all the major labor unions to the West Wing, to the —
excuse me — the yard behind it — the White House.  And they realized
that their future lies in being able to have the jobs that are going to
produce these fundamental changes that are taking place — everything
from the use of hydrogen to — I mean, a whole — and, by the way, even
when you guys got started, did you think that cement was a great
polluter?  You did.  I didn’t.  I didn’t know that.  I didn’t know
that.   
   
So, it’s just you’ve — you’ve provided an opportunity for the public to
get educated in a way that it wasn’t before.  And I thank you for that. 
I really do.   
   
And I’m flattered that you’d be willing to stick with me, because I’ve
made some pretty tough decisions that made a lot of people mad on the
environment.  But I think they’re beginning to figure it out.   
   
But our — last comment.  When I got elected when I was 29 years old —
and I come from a modest background.  We weren’t poor, but I come from a
modest background: a three-bedroom home in — 45 houses — 45 houses —
they’re split-levels homes that were in suburbia being built and — with
four kids and a grandpop living in a three-bedroom home with us.   
   
So, we weren’t poor, but we were — we were — we were — we had figure out
how to get to college, how to borrow money.  My dad was good man.   
   
And the interesting thing is that it took a while for me to figure out
that I’m not a big trickle-down guy.  I just want you to be aware,
because that does relate to the environment as well.  But the idea of
trickle-down economics, not a whole lot trickled onto to my dad’s
kitchen table.  He was a very well-read man and never got to go to
college.  He got to go to Johns Hopkins but went — World War Two
occurred, and he never went.  
   
But he’d always say, “You’re going to be a college man, Joe.” 
(Laughter.)  And I said, “What the hell difference does that make?” I
said, “Dad, they could still get fired as a college man.”  And he said,
“But they can’t take your degree away.”   
   
But my — my whole point is that it was a matter of giving people an
opportunity.  So, I want to — I want to tell you, because you probably
get heat sometimes — (inaudible) the economy overall — is I think the
way to grow the economy is from the middle out and the bottom up.  The
wealthy still do very well, and we ven- — invest in America.   
   
And one of the things that allowed me to do some of the things you
wanted me to do in the environment is there’s a provision in the law
that I was unaware of — and I’ve been around a long time — that passed
when Roosevelt was President, relating to unions.  The issue was: Are
unions legit?  Can they be organized?  Can they be protected, et
cetera?  
   
It’s a provision that no Democrat or Republican president paid much
attention to.  It said that when the President is given money as a
consequence of the Congress passing money — passing legislation to build
something, do something, he should hire an American and he should invest
with American products.  
   
That’s one of the reasons why we’re growing.  And that’s one of the
reasons why a couple of you were talking about the unions you work with
and how they’ve becoming supportive.   
   
Well, all of a sudden, people are realizing — you know, electric
vehicles — well, that’s 550,000 charging stations.  That’s a lot of
jobs.  It’s a lot of savings of the environment.  So, across the board,
I think we’re in the right direction.   
   
And I’ll end by saying there is one existential threat, and it’s Donald
Trump.  It’s not about me; it’s about Trump.  He will try to do — undo
everything we’ve done.  Make no mistake about it.  Many of you know him
better than I do.  But he will try.    
   
And you think that won’t happen, do you see what’s happening today in
the United States House of Representatives, the United States Congress? 
I — I tell you, I’ve been around — as I said, I served in the Congress
for 36 years.  Never thought I’d see something like I’m seeing now.   
   
And even people already who signed up — everything from the
environmental issues straight through to the border and (inaudible) —
they’re walking away at the last minute because Donald Trump called them
and threatened them — threatened retribution if they stick with their
position.  
   
So, that’s why I’m running, because we cannot let that happen.   
   
We’re on — I’m optimistic, and I think we’re on the verge of some real
change because of you.   
   
So, I’m going to hush up and answer questions.  (Applause.)
