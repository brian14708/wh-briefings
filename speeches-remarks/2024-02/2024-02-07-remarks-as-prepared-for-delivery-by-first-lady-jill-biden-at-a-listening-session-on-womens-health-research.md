Atlanta, GA

Thank you, Maria, for helping bring us together – and for showing the
world what’s possible when we invest in women.  
   
I’m here today because I heard about the amazing work that’s happening
in Atlanta, where universities, entrepreneurs, investors, companies, and
city leaders are coming together to drive innovation in women’s
health.  
   
Even though women are half the population, research on women’s health
has always been underfunded.  
   
Too many studies have left women out.  
   
Too many of the medicine dosages, treatments, medical school textbooks,
are based on men and their bodies – and that information doesn’t always
apply to women.  
   
My husband, President Biden, understands that.  
   
That’s why, in late November, we launched the first-ever White House
Initiative on Women’s Health Research.  
   
We have a clear goal: to fundamentally change how we approach and fund
women’s health research.  
   
As part of the initiative, Joe has directed federal agencies to look at
how they can better advance women’s health research – working with
leaders like our new NIH director, Monica Bertagnolli.  
   
But the federal government can’t do it alone.  
   
We need research at universities to develop breakthroughs. Investors who
believe in those ideas. Startups that bring those ideas to the market.
Doctors who translate those ideas into treatment plans. And government
and advocates who help bring everyone together.  
   
Atlanta has been doing this for decades – helping push progress forward
in women’s health. And I know this city will remain at the forefront of
this work.  
   
So, we came here to listen to your insights and your experience – to
hear about the work you’re doing and the path you see ahead.   
   
Because this is going to take all of us.  
   
Together, we will build a future where women – all women – aren’t just
an after-thought, but a first thought, where health care meets the needs
of everyone.  
   
Thank you.
