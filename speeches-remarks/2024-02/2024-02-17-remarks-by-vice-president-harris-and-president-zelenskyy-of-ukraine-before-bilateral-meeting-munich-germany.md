VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  President Zelenskyy, it’s good to see you
again.  I’m remembering the last time you and I were together in this
very room. 

PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY:  Exactly this.

VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Do you remember?  Yes, exactly in this room. 
Two years ago, five days before Russia’s unprovoked, unwarranted, and
brutal invasion of your country. 

But it is good to see you again.  The last time I saw you was in the
White House.  And I gave a speech yesterday in which I said publicly
what I had and the President — President Biden — have said to you many
times: We stand with Ukraine.  We have stood with Ukraine since day one.

And I was honored, in particular, to talk about you as a leader and your
courage and your determination.  You and I have had many conversations
over these past two years.  And you have shown extraordinary courage and
accomplishment on the battlefield.  And it has been a source of our
pride and our commitment to democracy and to democratic principles to
support you in every way we possibly can. 

And our support is unyielding and unending.  The President and I have a
firm and solid commitment to you and the Ukrainian people. 

So, it is good to see you again. 

PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY:  Thank you so much. 

VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Thank you.

PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY:  Happy to see you, Madam Vice President.  Yes, you
remind us our meeting some days before invasions of Russian terrorists. 
And — and you mentioned very important thing: that you’ve been with us
from the first days of full-scale war.   
  
And we are very thankful from — from — not only from me and my team,
first of all, from all our people are thankful to you, to people of the
United States, your society — great society, and to President Biden, his
team, and, of course, bipartisan support.  We are thankful for this. 

But we need now your unity during such a challenging period for us. 
And, of course — of course, in the United States, challenging period. 
We understand everything. 

We are happy that you are the leaders of support.  I think we — we have
to continue it.  And today we will focus on some — some questions like
defense, frozen assets, security issues, and micro-financial assistance.

Thank you so much.  We are very happy that we have such strategic
partners.  Thank you so much. 

VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you.
