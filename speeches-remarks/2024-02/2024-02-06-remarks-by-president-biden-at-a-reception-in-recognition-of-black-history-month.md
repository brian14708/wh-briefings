East Room

5:48 P.M. EST  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, Nijel, thank you for that introduction.  Where’s
Mom and Dad?   
   
PARTICIPANT:  Right there.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Put your hands up so everybody can see you. 
(Applause.)  
   
Dad, you knew that expression: God made man, then he made a few
firefighters.  (Laughter.)  God love you.  An incredible family.  
   
And I need a commitment from you, old buddy, that when you’re President
and they say, “Joe Biden is in the waiting room,” you remember who I
am.  (Laughter.)  All right?  
   
I — I think that’s important — (laughter) — because I don’t want to be
forgotten by you.  (Laughter.)   
   
Look, folks, the — the fact is, to all of you, on behalf of Jill and me,
Happy Black History Month from the White House.   
   
Let me just say we are really fortunate to have a real leader, a true
friend, and a historic Vice President, Kamala Harris.  (Applause.)  I
not only asked her to join me; I love her.  (Laughter.)  It’s a good
relationship.   
   
She is doing an incredible job on everything from voting rights, to
reproductive freedom, to economic opportunity, to foreign policy and
national security, and so much more.  We couldn’t do this without you,
Kamala, and that’s a fact.  Thank you, thank you, thank you. 
(Applause.)   
   
And the same goes for Doug.  He’s a great friend.  He also teaches now,
these days.  (Laughter.)   
   
You guys don’t teach at the same school, do you?  
   
THE FIRST LADY:  No.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:   No.  (Laughter.)  
   
There are so many friends here that if I were to acknowledge everyone,
I’d be — we’d be here until next Black History Month.  (Laughter.)   
   
But, look, folks, we will be back here next year.  (Applause.)  This
community is the reason why I’m standing here — this community.   
   
And a special thanks to members of our Cabinet and our military.  I
promised the administration would look like America, and I’m proud to
have the most diverse administration in all of American history. 
(Applause.)  
   
And a special thanks to the Congressional Black Caucus, who are key
partners in the progress we’re making.   
   
And thanks to all of you elected officials, like Governor Wes Moore. 
Gov — (applause) — where are you?  Watch this guy.  (Laughter.)  Watch
this guy.  He won in spite of my campaigning for him.  (Laughter.)  
   
Civil rights leaders, business leaders, educators, artists, and so much
more, I sincerely mean it: I am President and Kamala is Vice President
because of you.  You’ve had my back, and I’ve — we’ve had your back, and
we always will.   
   
Kamala just talked about the power of Black history that is an American
history.  Black excellence, culture, resilience.  Heroes known and
unknown who inspired a nation.   
   
But as Kamala described, you know, as you — all of you know, that proud
history has always been shadowed by sinister forces — always — trying to
erase our history, trying to deny freedoms to — those who seek to dim
the brilliance of our nation’s North Star.   
   
That’s the very idea of America — the very idea of America.  And you
know that we’re all created equal, in the image of God, deserve to be
treated equally throughout our lives.  We’ve never fully lived up to
that, but we’ve never walked away from it before — because of you and
your ancestors before you and because of all of the progress we’ve made
together, building a democracy that recognizes the inherent dignity of
all of us.  
   
My dad’s favorite word was “dignity.”  Every — he used to say, “A job is
about a lot more than a paycheck, Joey.  It’s about your dignity.  It’s
about honor.  It’s about respect.”   
   
And that’s what everyone deserves — to grant each of us the power to
shape our collective destiny.  A democracy with dignity rooted in
freedom, fairness, opportunity, and justice and truth — truth — based on
promises made and promises kept, a recognition that we all have promises
to keep.   
   
So, tonight, let’s reflect on how we make history, not erase history. 
You know?  (Applause.)  
   
And may we reflect on this wisdom.  As you entered the White House, you
heard the choir from St. Augustine’s Church here in Washington.  St.
Augustine’s Church once — (applause) — St. Augustine once said, “Singing
— singing is praying twice.”   
   
Well, I felt that power over a week ago when I attended Sunday service
at St. John’s Baptist Church in Columbia, South Carolina — the church
that’s home to our very own former mayor — Columbia mayor, Steve
Benjamin.  There’s Steve over there.  (Applause.)  
   
The pastor, Reverend Graham, preached a powerful sermon.  He reminded us
no matter how dark the hour, the power is in our hands — it really is —
to find light.  Then he said history — history is in our hands to build
a future within the — our reach.   
   
My friends, we face a moment of real choosing.  And I mean it
sincerely.  It’s not hyperbole.  In this moment, may we choose to be the
light and make real the promise of America for all Americans.  May we
make clear that, in America, we still believe in honesty, decency,
dignity, respect — where — where we leave no one behind; where everyone
deserves a shot; where we give no — we give hate no safe harbor.   
   
May we remember what our late friend John Lewis would say.  He said,
“Democracy is not a state.  It’s an act.”  “Democracy is not a state. 
It’s an act.”   
   
Through this Black History Month and each day we feel the grace of God,
let’s act.  Let us act in light and truth and freedom.  The power really
is in our hands.  It’s not hyperb- — it’s in our hands.  
   
Let’s remember who in the hell we — who — (laughter and applause). 
Let’s remember who we are.  (Laughter.)  We are the United States of
America, and there is simply nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when
we act together and do it together.   
   
So, God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops.  (Applause.)  
   
Please enjoy — please enjoy the performance that’s about to begin.   
   
All right.  We’re going to walk off here and get our performance. 
(Laughter.)
