Biden for President Campaign Headquarters  
Wilmington, Delaware

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Hello, Delaware!  (Applause.)  
   
Can we please give it up for Julie, who is an extraordinary human? 
(Applause.)  
   
I have to tell you, I have worked with Julie for years, and she is
someone who really just represents all that I know that we all stand for
— about the people, about organizing, about coalition building, bringing
people together, and the work that it requires around the clock.  Julie,
thank you for all of your work.  (Applause.)  
   
And Mr. President, Dr. Biden, the first Second Gentleman of the United
States — my husband.  (Laughs.)  (Applause.)    
   
I want to — I just — I have to tell you what joy Doug and I were feeling
as we were coming into Delaware.  And we were reflecting, Mr. President
and — and Dr. Biden, on those days that we were waiting, as we all
remember, for the announcement about who would be the next President of
the United States.   
   
And this is a community that is so extraordinary in terms of the support
that you give so tirelessly and so selflessly.  And we know this is what
it’s going to take: all of us being here together, understanding that it
is about all of us.  The senators are here.  The soon-to-be-senator is
here.  (Applause.)  
   
And this election, yes, it is about each of us asking of ourselves: What
kind of country do we want to live in?  That really is what is at
stake.  Knowing that we each have the power to answer that question.   
   
Yes, it is about our ticket.  But it is about all of us.   
   
And I’m so proud to work every day with our President.  I will tell you
— (applause) — he is a son of Delaware.  This is family.  So, I know you
know what I’m talking about.  But for the sake of the cameras —
(laughter) — let me just tell you something.   
   
Joe Biden, first of all, is fearless.  When you look at — (applause) —
what he has pushed through, in spite of the odds, that’s the story of
his life.  But it is the story also of his presidency.   
   
Joe Biden doesn’t hear “no.”  Some people talked about “Infrastructure
Week” forever.  Joe Biden said, “We’re going to make it a reality.” 
(Applause.)  
   
So, many of our young leaders know what is at stake in terms of the
climate and what we must do to build up our ability in terms of
adaptation and resiliency, bringing down greenhouse gas emissions,
saving this beautiful planet God has given us.  (Applause.)  
   
Joe Biden is the one, under his presidency, that pushed through historic
legislation, together with our senators and so many of our friends in
Congress.  
   
Joe Biden is the President who said — as he has always said — we’re
going to invest in science.  He was the author of the Moonshot.  And
when he became President, it was about saying we’re going to get a CHIPS
and Science bill and invest in — (applause) — what we need to do to be a
global leader on the challenges that face the world.   
   
And those are just a few of the things.  But I have to tell you, it is a
great blessing and privilege for me to work with him every day.  Because
he really, really cares.   
   
And, you know, there is a certain perversion that has been taking place,
I think, in our country by some to suggest that the measure of the
strength of a leader is based on who you beat down.  But the measure of
our leader is based on who he lifts up.  (Applause.)  
   
With the character of a true leader, which is someone who has a profound
character of caring about the suffering of other people and then
spending days and nights doing what he knows is possible to lift people
up.   
   
And so, it is my great honor to be with him and to introduce our
President, Joe Biden.  (Applause.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  
   
It’s good to be home.  (Applause.)  
   
You know what’s really good about it, Kamala?  These people know me, and
they’re still here.  (Laughter.)  
   
These are the folks, as that saying goes up in Claymont, who “brung me
to the dance.”  (Laughter.)   
   
Folks, you know, no one did more of that.  I remember my sister coming
home when we were starting to run for the Senate and said, “I think you
need some help.”  (Laughter.)  This was back in 1990.  No, I’m only
joking.  (Laughter.)  
   
Hey, John, how are you?  
   
1972.  And she said, “There’s a guy named Ted Kaufman.  Works for the
DuPont company.”  Ted, good to see you.  (Applause.)  
   
One of my best friends in life and friend to my children.  And it’s
great to see you, buddy.  Or I should call you “Senator” because —
(laughter).  He’s the only guy when I said, “You got to be senator,” he
said, “I don’t want to be senator.”  (Laughter.)   
   
Well, look, folks, you know, Doug and Kamala are here.  I was hoping —
you know, they came here, and I’m leaving from here to their home in Los
Angeles.  So, you know, it seemed kind of — kind of ass-backwards here. 
I — (laughter).  
   
Well, look, I’m feeling good about where we are.  I really am.   
   
You know, the folks are starting to focus in.  And the guy we’re running
against, he is — he’s not for anything.  He’s against everything.   
   
No, I mean it.  It’s the — it’s the weirdest campaign I’ve ever been
engaged in.  It’s even worse than — in terms of his behavior — than the
last time in 2020.   
   
And, you know, Kamala mentioned there’s so much at stake.   
   
And you all, this crowd, really knows me extremely well.  They know me
too well.  Don’t tell everything you know, guys.  (Laughter.)   
   
But all kidding aside, the — I meant what I said back in — when we
announced the first time for president against this guy, and we went up
to legislative — up to Independence Hall and made a speech on
democracy.  And the press kind of thought it was a little bit of an
exaggeration, except the American people didn’t.   
   
The American people get it.  They understand what’s going on.   
   
And so, this is a group of folks assembled in this room who are going to
be able to say, God willing, that you helped — this generation helped
save democracy.  I mean in a literal sense.  You have —  
   
And by the way, as I go around the world, which I do a lot, meet with
other heads of state — because I’ve known them for so long, I’m — I’m
engaged in the — Madeleine Albright was right.  America is the essential
nation.  And they all look — all look to us, as my co- — my colleagues
know.   
   
And every time I leave — not a joke — whether it’s at the G20, the G7,
wherever they are, they’ll pull me aside one at a time and say, “You’ve
got to win.  You’ve got to win.  We can’t afford — my — my country is at
stake” — meaning their country.   
   
So, there’s a lot at stake here, folks.  We have an enormous
obligation.   
   
But, you know, I think it’s time to finish the job here.  I think it’s
time for us to — (applause).  
   
And if I don’t stop talking, I’m going to get the hook from Jill.  She’s
going to pull me off this little pla- — (laughter).  
   
But folks, look, things are — people beginning to focus.  They’re
beginning to focus, and the polling data — everything is picking up
across the board.   
   
The new Quinnipiac poll — the national poll has us beating him 50-44. 
(Applause.)  
   
Our neighbor state of Pennsylvania — the Susquehanna poll has us beating
him 47-39.  (Applause.)  
   
And another one in Pennsylvania, 42-37.   
   
And by the way, in New Hampshire, we weren’t on the ballot.  Couldn’t
campaign there.  And guess what?  We got 64 percent of the vote. 
(Applause.)  
   
So, folks, I’m going to put all of this away and just say: Thank you,
thank you, from the bottom of my heart.   
   
I look out there and I see — Tommy, it’s great seeing you, pal.  I’m
going to miss you.  But I’m — you’re not getting away.  (Laughter.) 
You’re not getting away.   
   
And Chris is there all the time for me.   
   
And our soon-to-be-senator, former congressperson.  Your dad was
incredible, by the way.  (Applause.)  
   
And that woman behind you, that sister of yours, she ran my operation
for a long time.  (Laughter.)  She is the reason I was able to win the
first time.  God love her.   
   
But I look out and see so many of you.  
   
Gov, you’re the best.  Because, like me, you married way above your
station.  (Applause.)  
   
So, anyway, I — if I start naming everybody, I’ll name everybody in
here, including — including Vince D’Anna.  Vinny, how are you, buddy? 
(Applause.)  Good to see you, man.  
   
I haven’t run a campaign without Vince giving me hell and helping me win
around the way.   
   
Anyway, thank you, thank you, thank you.  We got a lot to do.  And I
think you all get it along with me: We can’t — this is not just the
campaign.  This is more of a mission.  We cannot — we cannot — we cannot
lose this campaign, for the good of the country.  And I mean that from
the bottom of my heart.   
   
It’s not about me.  It goes well beyond me.  It goes about the country. 
And I think everybody knows it.  And I think people are — beginning to
dawn on people.   
   
And as long as I’ve got Ronnie Olivere still hanging out with me, I’m
okay.  (Laughter.)  
   
So, anyway, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.  You’re the best
in the world.   
   
I’m going to hang out with you, if I can.   
   
Thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)  
   
END
