Atlanta, GA

Thank you, Valerie. Morehouse School of Medicine is setting an inspiring
example of cutting-edge research, patient-centered care, and an
education that’s training the next generation of health care providers –
and making sure they are representative of the communities they serve.
I’m grateful for your work and your leadership. And, your friendship.   
   
Good afternoon. It’s great to be back in Atlanta and an honor to be here
with you today.  
   
For 15 years, the women in this room have been committed to raising
awareness about heart disease – and learning from each other, about one
another.  
   
If you ask any woman in America about her health care, she probably has
a story to tell. You know her.  
   
She’s the woman who gets debilitating migraines, but doesn’t know why,
and can’t find treatment options that work for her.  
   
She’s the woman going through menopause, who visits with her doctor and
leaves with more questions than answers, even though half the country
will go through menopause at some point in their lives.  
   
She’s the woman who dies because her heart disease isn’t recognized,
since her symptoms don’t look like a man’s heart attack.  
   
That’s why we’re all here, isn’t it?  
   
Because women are more likely than men to die after a heart attack. And
Black women are more likely to die from heart disease than women of any
other race.  
   
What you’ve heard today is powerful – the ways in which heart disease is
connected to diabetes, hypertension, and pregnancy, and how it’s even
connected to our genes based on new research from the Morehouse School
of Medicine.   
   
But just knowing this isn’t enough. We have to turn our knowledge into
action.  
   
And to do that we need to better understand heart disease in women and
study it more.  
   
Because even though women are half the population, research on women’s
health has always been underfunded.  
   
Too many medical studies have focused on men and left women out.  
   
Too many of the medicine dosages, treatments, medical school textbooks,
are based on men and their bodies – and that information doesn’t always
apply to women.     
   
That means there are big gaps in research on diseases and conditions
that only affect women, that disproportionately affect women, or that
affect women and men differently.  
   
These gaps are even greater for communities that have historically been
excluded from research – especially women of color and women with
disabilities.  
   
Because of these gaps, we understand far too little about these
conditions, and how to help the millions of women who struggle with
them.  
   
My husband, Joe, understands that this is a problem. And he’s taking
action.  
   
That’s what he does – he learns about a problem and then he gets to work
solving it. He doesn’t waste any time.  
   
So, in November, President Biden launched the White House Initiative on
Women’s Health Research. We have a clear goal: to fundamentally change
how our nation approaches and funds women’s health research.  
   
Joe issued a presidential memorandum asking federal agencies for their
recommendations on how to make the policy changes necessary to advance
women’s health research. And he’s instructed agencies to address health
inequities as part of this initiative.  
   
Remarkable work is happening here in Atlanta, where universities,
entrepreneurs, investors, companies, and city leaders – and groups like
Women with Heart – are coming together to drive innovation in women’s
health.  
   
We need research at universities to develop breakthroughs.  
   
Investors who believe in those ideas. Startups that bring those ideas to
the market. Doctors who translate those ideas into treatment plans. And
government and advocates who help bring everyone together.  
   
Later today, Valerie and I will be speaking with leaders who are pushing
that innovation forward – hearing about their insights and experience,
and how we can all be part of reaching toward the possibilities
ahead.   
   
I know that women in Atlanta have been doing this work for decades.  
   
And I’m here because Joe and I want to be your partners in this. And we
are proud to join you in this fight.  
   
Together, we will build a health care system that puts women – all women
– and their lived experiences at its center, where no woman or girl has
to hear that “it’s all in your head,” or, “it’s just stress.” Where
women aren’t just an after-thought, but a first-thought. Where women
don’t just survive, they lead long, healthy, and happy lives.  
   
Thank you.
