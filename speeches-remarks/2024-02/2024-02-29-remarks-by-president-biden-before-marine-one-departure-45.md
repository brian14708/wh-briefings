Q    Do you expect a ceasefire by Monday, sir?  Do you still expect a
ceasefire is possible by Monday, sir?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Hope springs eternal.  
   
Q    And what is —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I was on the telephone with the people in the region. 
I’m still — probably not by Monday, but I’m hopeful.  
   
(Cross-talk.)  
   
Q    What is your reaction (inaudible) in Gaza City?  More than a
hundred civilians were killed.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I just — we’re checking that out right now.  But two —
there’s two competing versions of what happened.  I don’t have an answer
yet.  
   
Q    Are you worried that will complicate these negotiations?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I know it will.  
   
(Cross-talk.)  
   
Q    Mr. President, the Alabama ruling.  I want to ask you about the
Catholic Church.  The Catholic Church said that IVF is immoral and wrong
because it destroys countless human embryos.  What do you say to that?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t agree with that position.
