title: "Remarks by Vice President Harris in Press Gaggle | Pittsburgh,\_PA"
---
 
*Independent Enterprises Construction Site  
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania*  

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Just — these incredibly highly skilled folks are
doing the work that is about removing lead pipes, which for too long in
our country have existed, especially in communities that just couldn’t
afford on their own to pay to get rid of those lead pipes.  
  
And lead pipes produce toxic water.  And when children drink toxic water
through lead pipes, it has an impact on their learning ability, on their
health.  And for too long, this has been the case, that communities have
been crying out for support to get rid of these lead pipes.   
  
And proud — I am proud to say that the President and I have finally made
a commitment — and we’re seeing it through — to get rid of all lead
pipes in America.   
  
And so, this is one of the projects that is taking place because of our
infrastructure work.  And it’s about good-paying jobs — union jobs.  The
— the folks who are running this operation hired over 100 people just to
do this work.   
  
But it’s about the families that live here and — and deserve to — to be
heard and deserve to get the attention they’re now receiving because of
our work.  
  
So, thank you all.  
  
END
