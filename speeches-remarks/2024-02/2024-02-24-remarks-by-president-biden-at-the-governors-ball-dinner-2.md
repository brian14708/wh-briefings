State Dining Room

7:40 P.M. EST  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you, Gov.  I — I may be the only Irishman
you ever met that’s never had a drink.  And my grandfather used to say,
“Joey, if you toast with anything other than alcohol, you got to use
your left hand.”  (Laughter.)   
   
Folks, Governor Cox, Governor Polis, and everyone — to all the family
members that are here — and thank you, (inaudible), for being here
tonight.  Appreciate it very much.   
   
You know, let me just say that we have a — we have a — a lot to do
together.  The thing that makes me feel good about having the governors
here is there is still the tradition of doing things together.  We fight
like hell.  We make sure that we get our points across.  But at the end
of the day, we know who we work for.  The objective is to get things
done.   
   
And, you know, standing here in front of this portrait of the man behind
me here, he — he said — and I want to make sure I get the quote exactly
right.  He said, “We — the better angels” — he said, “We must address
the counsel — and adjust the better angels of our nature.”  And we do
the — and we do well to remember what else he said.  He said, “We’re not
enemies, but \[we’re\] friends.”  This is in the middle of — this is in
the — in the part of the Civil War.  He said, “We’re not enemies, but
\[we’re\] friends.  We must not be enemies.”   
   
Folks — and I’ve been around.  I know I don’t look it.  I’ve been around
a long while though.  (Laughter.)  And — and I mean this sincerely,
we’ve gotten — politics has gotten too bitter — Democrats and
Republicans.  Politics has gotten too personally — and it just is — it’s
just not like it was.   
   
And, by the way, I served in times when we had very, very starnch —
staunch differences.  I mean, there were incredible differences, but we
always — not always, but the vast majority of the time, we looked out
for a compromise when the end of the — when the end of the day came.   
   
And, you know, it seems to me that — I’ll conclude by saying, I — I’ve
spent a lot of time with Xi Jinping — someone whom I have a great deal
of difference with.  And I was — when I was vice president, President —
my — my president was — told me that he wanted me to get to know Xi
Jinping because it was clear he was going to be the head of Russia — of
— of China and that he — we had a — we were having problems with Russia
at the time and other countries as well.  And so, what he said was, “Get
to know him.  He’s going to be there.”  I — and he couldn’t because he
was the president, and he couldn’t travel.  So, I traveled 17,000 miles
with him throughout the country — our country and — and in — in China,
as well.   
   
We were in the Tibetan Plateau.  And he turned to me, and he said, “Can
you define America for me?”  And I — given this has been documented, and
it’s real — I looked at him, and I said, “Yes, I can.  In one word.” 
And he looked at me.  And he said, “What’s that?”  And I said,
“Possibilities.”  Possibilities.   
   
Here is to possibilities.   
   
(President Biden offers a toast.)  
   
Possibilities, because there’s so — I have never been more optimistic in
my life about the prospects of what we can do if we just work together. 
There’s nothing beyond our capacity.   
   
So, again, to possibilities.  
   
(President Biden offers a toast.)
