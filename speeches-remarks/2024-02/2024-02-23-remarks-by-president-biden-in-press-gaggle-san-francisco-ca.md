THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, folks.  This morning, I had the honor of meeting
with Aleksey Navalny’s wife and daughter. 

As to state the obvious, he was a man of incredible courage.  And it’s
amazing how his wife and daughter are — are emulating that.  And we’re
going to be announcing the sanctions against Putin, who is responsible
for his death, tomorrow.

And — but the one thing I’ve made — that was made clear to me is that
<s>Yulanda</s> \[Yulia\] is going to — she’s going to continue to fight
(inaudible) the way.  So, we’re not letting up.

Thank you.
