Q    Mr. President — Mr. President, you’re heading to the border on
Thursday.  Why go to the border now, Mr. President?  You’re going on
Thursday.  Why go now?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’ve been planning to go Thursday.  What I didn’t know
is my good friend, apparently, is going.   
   
Q    And will you meet with migrants while you’re there, Mr.
President?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’m not going to announce ahead of time.  Secret
Service doesn’t like me announcing exactly what I’m going to do.  
   
(Cross-talk.)  
   
Q    Can you give us a sense of when you think that ceasefire will
start, sir?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I hope by the beginning of the weekend — I mean
the end of the weekend.    
   
At least, my —  
   
Q    Say again.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  My National Security Advisor tells me that we’re close. 
We’re close.  It’s not done yet.  And my hope is by next Monday, we’ll
have a ceasefire.
