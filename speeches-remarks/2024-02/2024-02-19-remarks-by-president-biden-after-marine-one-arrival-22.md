South Lawn

Q    Mr. President, will you meet with Speaker Johnson to try and
negotiate the aid?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Sure, I’d be happy to meet with him if he has anything
to say.  
   
Q    Mr. President, would you go as far as to say that Aleksey Navalny’s
blood is on the hands of House Republicans right now?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I wouldn’t use that term.  They’re making a big mistake
not responding.  
   
Look, the way they’re walking away from the threat of Russia, the way
they’re walking away from NATO, the way they’re walking away from
meeting our obligations, it’s just shocking.  I mean, they’re wild. 
I’ve never seen anything like this.  
   
Q    Do you think Navalny’s death will make any difference in nudging
House Republicans to take up Ukraine aid?  They’re on the (inaudible)

THE PRESIDENT:  I hope so.  But I’m not sure anything is going to

Q    Are you going to impose additional sanctions on Russia over
Navalny’s death?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  We already have sanctions, but we’re considering
additional sanctions, yes.  
   
Thank you.
