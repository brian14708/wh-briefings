title: Remarks by Vice President Harris at Signing of H.R. 3684, The Infrastructure
  Investment and Jobs Act

*South Lawn*

3:51 P.M. EST  
    

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thanks.  
 

ANNOUNCER:  Please welcome Heather Kurtenbach.  
 

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  In a moment.  (Laughter.)  Please have a seat.  
 

President Joe Biden, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Chuck
Schumer, Cabinet members, Congressmembers, governors, and mayors, and —
(applause) — and my fellow Americans: This is an historic day.    
   
     In the middle of the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln started
construction on the transcontinental railroad.  In the middle of the
Great Depression, President Franklin Roosevelt finished construction on
the Hoover Dam.  President Dwight Eisenhower signed the National
Interstate and Defense Highways Act in the middle of the Cold War.  And
today — and today, President Joe Biden will sign the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act into law.  (Applause.)  
   
     Indeed, it is an historic day today.  From the very start of our
administration, we were determined to follow through not just on our
promise to invest in our nation’s infrastructure, but on the promises
that the American people have heard for years now.    
   
     And we would not be here today were it not for your leadership, Mr.
President.  From the very start, you welcomed Democrats, independents,
and Republicans to meet with us in the Oval Office.  You welcomed ideas,
you welcomed debate, all in the service of getting this bill done.  
   
     And here is what I know to be true, Mr. President: You are equal
parts believer and builder.  And because you are, we are all better
off.  On behalf of our nation: Thank you, Mr. President.  (Applause.)  
   
     And, of course, our administration did not arrive at this day by
ourselves.  We are also here because of leaders in the House and the
Senate who worked on this bill together, who voted for this bill.  And
we are here because of the millions of Americans who believed that we
could get this done.    
   
     Well, we got it done, America.  (Laughs.)  (Applause.)  We got it
done.  
   
     In many ways, this day embodies our character as a nation.  It
demonstrates exactly who we are.  We are believers, through and
through.  We see what can be, unburdened by what has been.  We are as
bold as we are determined to do big things.  
   
     The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act proves that.  It proves
that, in America, we have the courage to believe a better future is
possible and to build it together.  
   
     After this bill is signed into law, millions more Americans will go
to work in good-paying, good union jobs.  (Applause.)  Americans like
Jovan Johnson, a carpenter I met in Nevada, who said that she has,
quote, “built her career on infrastructure and fed her family on
infrastructure.”    
   
     Americans like Jeff Bird, a line design technician I met with in
New Hampshire.  He attaches fiber to utility poles to keep up with the
demand for high-speed Internet.  
   
     Or Leslie Kilgore, an engineer I met with in North Carolina whose
team is building electric school buses.  
   
     Or Walter Coty, a construction inspector with whom I met who is
working to get clean water to families in California.    
   
     This will be a nationwide effort, the likes of which we have not
seen in a generation.  It will make our country more competitive, and it
will deliver on our nation’s and our administration’s commitment to
equity.  
   
     Now, this bill — as significant as it is, as historic as it is — is
part one of two.  (Applause.)  To lower costs and cut taxes for working
families, to tackle the climate crisis at its core, Congress must also
pass the Build Back Better Act.  (Applause.)  
   
     The work of building a more perfect union did not end with the
railroad or the interstate, and it will not end now.  So, on this
historic day, let us all continue to believe in our people, believe in
our country, and believe in what we can do when we work together.    
   
     Thank you all.  May God bless you.  And may God bless America. 
(Applause.)
