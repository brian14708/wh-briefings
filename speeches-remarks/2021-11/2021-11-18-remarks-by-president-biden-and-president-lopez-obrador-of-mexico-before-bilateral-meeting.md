Oval Office

3:40 P.M. EST  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, welcome.  Mr. President, it’s a delight to have
you here.   
   
The President I were just talking about the long, over — almost 200-year
relationship with Mexico.  And we were talking about — I was explaining
why Roosevelt and Lincoln were — their portraits were up here on the
wall.  
   
And the President pointed out that the reason he liked Roosevelt was he
initiated the “Good Neighbor” policy.  
   
And the best way to start this meeting, I pointed out, was: When I
became President and as Vice President, I indicated there’s no longer a
“Good Neighbor” policy; it’s absolutely equal.  We’re equal countries.  
   
Mr. President, we no longer use language like “our friends from the
south.”  You are an equal — we are equal countries, and that’s what I
like about you.  
   
I believe it’s a different and emerging relationship that is one born
out of mutual respect.  
   
Since January, we’ve taken significant steps and strides to deepen our
relationship, including — including relaunching the High-Level Economic
Dialogue and holding a High-Level Security Dialogue, which resulted in a
new joint approach to security and a Bicentennial Framework.  
   
Together, we’re taking on problems — mutual problems that affect our
people: getting the pandemic under control, driving an inclusive
economic recovery, and addressing migration.  
   
And I know we both are committed to making sure our democracies deliver
for our people.  
   
Democracies, in last 20 years, have actually shrunk.  There’s fewer.  
   
So, Mr. President, I look forward to talking about how progress here at
home on the infrastructure initiative that we’ve just passed and
building back better — that hopefully will be passed very shortly here —
and — are made stronger by working with our allies and our partners. 
It’s not just what we’re doing here, but working with our allies and our
partners makes it even stronger.  
   
As we mark 200 years of diplomatic relations between our countries next
year, we’ll celebrate both the shared values and family ties that have
long united our people and the brighter future that our nations are
going to chart together.  
   
So, Mr. President, I want to thank you again for your commitment to the
U.S.-Mexican relationship.  Going to make it even closer.  And I’m
looking forward to a great discussion.  First of many.  
   
PRESIDENT LÓPEZ OBRADOR:  (As interpreted.)  We are very thankful and
satisfied with the reception that we have had and having this — to have
this encounter with President Biden.   
   
Before you were all here, we were talking about the historical relations
that President Lincoln and President Juárez had in their time —
President Juárez, by the way, was the best president Mexico has ever had
— and they understood each other well.   
   
President Lincoln, by the way, never recognized Maximilian, the Emperor
imposed through a territorial invasion in Mexico.   
   
When Lincoln was assassinated, he expressed his pain in writing.  I
believe it was a stellar moment in our histories.   
   
The second thing I would like to say is quite significant as well. 
Franklin Roosevelt, who maintained relations with Mexico based on
respect and friendship when Cárdenas was in office — he was the best
president of our 20th century.   
   
And, as Pablo Neruda, the poet, said — that he respected FDR’s visions
and his concept of his “Four Freedoms” or liberties: the freedom of the
manifestation of ideas, or freedom of expression; the freedom of
religion; and two very important ones — the free- — the liberty for
living free from fear and free from misery.   
   
This is why Neruda considered President Roosevelt as the “titan of
freedoms,” and that is what we wish to come from this new era of
Mexico-U.S. relations.   
   
We believe it’s easier because, as President Biden also said, he wants
us to be equals.   
   
From the first time we talked over the phone with the President already
in office, he mentioned this — that we would not be seen as the backyard
of the United States.  And we are thankful for that.   
   
We do not need to reaffirm our principles of independence or
sovereignty, and are thankful for the respect.  And we will keep on
helping in the integration of North America as a region.  
   
In the face of the progress made by other regions in the world, our
economies and our relations must always be based on respect of our
sovereignties.  There are many possibilities right now to strengthen our
cooperation and economies, and we will keep on acting together as North
America.  
   
As I mentioned before, the agreement that has just come into force is
crucial for our relations.  And that is why we are very pleased to be
here.   
   
I would also like to say to President Biden — because I made a promise
and promises must be kept: A few days ago, when I visited New York, I
promised I would convey our thanks in terms of the bill that you have
just sent to Congress to regularize the situation in terms of migration
of over 11 million people.  We are paying attention to this process and
hope that Congress will give you the support that you need on behalf of
both parties.  
   
We will follow up on this and hope for the benefits and fruits of this
new era, in terms of Mexican migrants that live and work here with
honor.   
   
We believe that this is a wonderful initiative with a social dimension
in favor of justice.  
   
Thank you, President.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you, Mr. President.  ‘
