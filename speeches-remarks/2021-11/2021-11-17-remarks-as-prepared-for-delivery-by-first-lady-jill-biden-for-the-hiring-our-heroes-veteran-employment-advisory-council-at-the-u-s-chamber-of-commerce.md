*Washington, D.C.*

Today, we end, “It’s too complicated.”  
  
Today we end, “We don’t know how.”  
  
Today, we are coming together to say, “Our military spouses deserve as
much commitment from us as they give to us.”  
  
For ten years, we’ve made progress in so many areas— hiring veterans,
educating schools about military kids, raising awareness about
caregivers.  
  
But when it comes to military spouse unemployment, the needle doesn’t
move—instead, it’s gotten worse. Today, it’s more than seven times the
national rate.  
  
Why? What I’ve heard from organizations is that military spouses’
resumes don’t fully reflect their qualifications.  
  
That military spouses leave jobs too often. That organizations can’t
maintain their culture if they allow remote work.  
  
We all want to make progress in this area, but it requires businesses to
make significant changes. And that’s not easy.  
  
But for a moment, I want you to imagine a spouse on a base. She’s
self-assured and accomplished—with not one, but two master’s degrees.  
  
She tells you how proud she is of her husband, serving on a ship in the
Pacific, and that she knows what he’s doing matters.  
  
But the more she talks, the more you can see cracks in her
confidence.   
  
She tells you she wore her best suit because she never gets the chance
to anymore. She misses her work.  
  
After months of applying to jobs with no luck, she’s ready to take
anything—after all, there are bills to pay—but it won’t be the career
she’s worked so hard to build.  
  
She’s not complaining, but you can see the sadness and frustration that
she doesn’t voice.  
  
I’ve heard this same story more times than I can count.  
  
Change isn’t easy. But neither is moving to a new base, again and
again.  
  
Neither is parenting while your partner is deployed.  
  
Neither is losing sleep, worrying that the person you love most in the
world might not come home.  
  
That’s what our military spouses do every day. They do it even when it’s
hard. They do it for us.  
  
Meanwhile, their husbands and wives question how long they can serve
their country when their spouse is unhappy or feels unfulfilled.  
  
Our military isn’t going to be able to keep our best and brightest if
they have to choose between their love of family and their love of
country. That’s why supporting military families is critical to our
national security.   
  
Joining Forces—my White House initiative that serves our military and
veteran families, caregivers and survivors—was founded on that
principle.  
  
In September, we announced that every executive department across the
federal government has committed to joining DOD’s Military Spouse
Employment Partnership to recruit, hire, and train military spouses.   
  
But we need your help.  
  
All of you have worked so hard to get our veterans hired. Today, their
unemployment rate is below the national average. We need the same focus
and dedication for our military spouses.   
  
And it starts by creating flexible, transferable, remote work
opportunities.  
  
For families, remote work means mom or dad doesn’t have to start over at
each duty station.  
  
And it means you can keep skilled, talented, experienced workers, even
if they are relocated.  
  
It’s not a small ask, but there are organizations—some of you here
today—that are making it work.  
  
If we’ve learned anything in this pandemic, it’s how to be creative.  
  
So, let’s be creative now.  
  
This is possible. And it’s profitable.  
  
Because military spouses are highly educated. Through long deployments
and difficult transfers, they have learned to be adaptable and
resourceful. They know the value of organizations that are willing to
invest in them—and they are loyal.   
  
Tap into the power of this dynamic group, and you are tapping into the
best of the best.  
  
So, what can you do? How can you create a culture where military spouses
have what they need to thrive?  
  
Join the Military Spouse Employment Advisory Council. Invite your
colleagues to join as well. Spread the word and share best practices.  
  
As you know, Hiring our Heroes is deeply committed to this cause and
they’re here to help.  
  
For ten years, so many have asked: How can we afford to make this
work?  
  
But the question should be: How can we look at the sacrifices that our
military community makes and do anything less? How can we tell those
spouses that this is too difficult?  
  
We can’t. We won’t.  
  
We will come together—with the dedication, resourcefulness, and sense of
duty that they show every day—and give them the support they have
earned.  
  
Thank you.
