Q    On the timeline, sir, for Build Back Better, do you want it to pass
in December or is it okay if it rolls into later months, sir?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  The sooner, the better.  The sooner, the better.  
   
Q    Mr. President, are you considering any new vaccine requirements or
efforts to try to get more Americans vaccinated?  You said that is the
key to protecting against Omicron.  Is there anything you’re going to
do?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’ll — I’ll be talking about that on Thursday.  
   
Q    Anything you can preview for us?  
   
Q    Mr. President, are you planning to go to Michigan to talk to the
families?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t know that I’m able to do that.  I don’t even
have the detail of who the families are.  Although, I was talking to
Debbie Dingell — she was talking to me about it.  And I think she knew
somebody who was there.  I’m not — I don’t know anybody who was
injured.  But she was telling — talking about it.   
   
So I don’t have the detail.  I don’t have the detail.  
   
Q    Mr. President, how long will the travel restrictions on countries
in Southern Africa be in place?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, it kind of depends.  I — it’s going week to week
here to determine what we need and what the state of affairs.  We’re
going to learn a lot more in the next couple of weeks about the
lethality of this virus, about how much it spreads, about whether what
we have can control it, et cetera.  So it will depend on those — those
issues.  
   
Q    Are you committed to telling the Allies if you have to impose
further travel restrictions?  When the — President Trump instituted the
travel restrictions, it was a real shock to European Allies.  Are you
committed to — I mean, are you committed to sort of coordinating that?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Unlike Trump, I don’t shock our Allies.
