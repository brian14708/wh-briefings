*Vice President’s Ceremonial Office*

1:56 P.M. EST  
   
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Mr. President, it is my great honor to welcome
you to Washington, D.C. and to the United States.  I want to thank you
again for the very warm welcome you gave me when we came to Mexico City
five short months ago.  
   
This meeting is a continuation of an ongoing conversation that you and I
have had, fueled by friendship, fueled by partnership, fueled by the
longstanding relationship between Mexico and the United States, and in
recognition of all the work that we will do currently and that we pledge
to do together in the future — together, working on the challenges that
we face and also recognizing the opportunities that exist when we work
together as countries in North America and as partners in the Western
Hemisphere.  
   
The conversations that we have had range in subject.  I have enjoyed
always the conversation that you and I have about history and the
critical figures in history, both in Mexico and the United States, who
have worked together.   
   
But our conversation also extends to economic prosperity for both of our
nations; the issue of our mutual concern about migration and what we
will do as partners to address, in particular, the root causes of
migration; and also what we can do on the issues of technology and the
exploration of space.  
   
All of these issues have been the subject of our discussions previously
and will be ongoing.  
   
And so, again, I welcome you.  I thank you for traveling to be with us. 
I know the President is looking forward to his time with you.   
   
I also want to thank you for the warm reception that you and the people
of Mexico have given to Ken Salazar, our Ambassador to Mexico.  I have
known Ken Salazar — Ambassador Salazar — for a very long time, and we
are very proud that he is the representative of the United States in
Mexico.  
   
And with that, again, welcome.  And I look forward to the discussion we
will have today.    
   
PRESIDENT LÓPEZ OBRADOR:  (As interpreted.)  I want to thank you for
your kind, warm welcome.  Madam Vice President, it is a pleasure to meet
you again, here in Washington, D.C.  
   
I agree on the fact that you have a very good ambassador appointed to
Mexico.  We were talking a few minutes ago that we shouldn’t leave
history aside, which is our teacher in life.   
   
President Roosevelt was here.  Before becoming President, he worked with
the Secretary of the Navy Daniels.  And it was a fortunate event for
Mexico because time went by, President Roosevelt became the President of
the United States, and he appointed Daniels, his former boss, Ambassador
to the USA in Mexico.   
   
And that was a relevant moment because it was President Lázaro
Cárdenas’s administration, our best president in the 20th century —
because the best president in Mexican history is Benito Juárez, from my
standpoint.  
   
So, it was helpful that Ambassador Daniels was the representative of the
United States because he was a man of progress who understood why — the
“why” behind President Cárdenas’s decisions.  And, on top of that,
President Roosevelt was his friend, which strengthened the relationship
in such a way that it is of the utmost importance that the ambassadors
appointed to Mexico, that the USA representatives in Mexico are people
of trust, such as the current ambassador.  
   
And we get along just fine.  The relationship is very good.  And since
your visit to Mexico and we discussed different affairs, we have
continued working jointly.  The Secretary of Foreign Affairs has dealt
with all things related — economics; our sovereignty; of course, the
migratory issue, addressing the causes, which you understand.  
   
     We have to invest to foster employment and wellbeing in Central
America so people do not find themselves in the need of migrating, and
that migration is an option and not something that is enforced,
something that is an obligation that they have to leave their hometowns,
their families out of necessity or due to violence.  
   
     Hence, the importance of economic cooperation and investing in
Central America, has — we will accomplish.  We do have information that,
as per our conversations, there’s already a plan in place set by the
U.S. government to assist Central America, which we strongly commend you
for.  
   
     And, on top of that, if economic integration is strengthened
throughout North America, we will need to organize migratory flow, and
several opportunities — job opportunities — will be created to promote
growth throughout North America and so that North America produces what
it uses, what it consumes, without having to depend on imports.  We need
to produce and manufacture in North America whatever we need.  It is an
ideal — and not only for North America, but throughout the entire
continent.  
    
     Just as the European Union started out, which became the economic
European Union afterwards, that needs to be our ideal: integration
throughout the region.  And we can leverage from the outstanding
advantages that we have, such as this proximity.  And right now, we are
suffering from that because of the maritime fleet — prices have gone
up.  
   
     So why don’t we take advantage of the proximity of the closeness
between our countries and the fact that we have our own marketplace? 
There is high demand in the continent vis-à-vis other regions.  
   
     So I believe that — the economic integration of North America in
sovereign terms, as well as to have integration throughout the Americas,
in order to strengthen the region at the economic level.  And we will.  
   
     With all due respect, tell President Biden that we celebrate that
he sent a bill to Congress to regulate the migratory status of our
immigrants.  And hopefully, the congressmen and women of both political
parties will help us out with that, because it is fair.  
   
     There are hardworking, honest people who have been living in the
U.S. for a while now.  I think there’s no such better initiative when it
comes to the migratory conversation, and we will watch over this process
regarding the bill submitted by President Biden, and we highly commend
him for it.  
   
     I’ve spoken quite a bit now.  I’m really glad to be here.  
   
     VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:  Thank you.  It is good to see you.  And I’m
looking forward to our conversation.  Thank you.
