South Lawn

Q    Mr. President, are you feeling momentum, sir, for Build Back Better
now?  Are you feeling momentum?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  I’m always optimistic.

Q    Okay.  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  It’s going to be — it’s going to be a tough fight.  And
it ain’t over yet, as they say, as the old expression goes.  But I feel
good, and I think people will realize, are beginning to realize it’s
important to get it done.  
  
Q    Any lessons from what you’ve just gone through with the bipartisan
infrastructure?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  None that I didn’t already know.

END
