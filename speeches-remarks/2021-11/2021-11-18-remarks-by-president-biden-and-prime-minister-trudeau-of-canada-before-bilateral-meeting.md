Oval Office

1:49 P.M. EST  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  You guys all have health insurance, right?  In case
you get injured.  
   
Q    Yes, sir.  
   
PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU:  Half of them are Canadian, so they definitely
have — have health coverage.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  All right.  Well, it’s great to welcome back the Prime
Minister, who we’ve been good friends for a while, and — but it’s great
to have him here in the White House.  We’ve had a lot of meetings around
the country and around the world.  We’ve been with each other — what? —
a half a dozen times almost so far?  
   
PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU:  It’s been a busy year.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  And the — you know, we — I know we’re both keeping our
minds close to the families affected by the storms, flooding in British
Columbia area and the Pacific Northwest.   
   
But one of the things we’ve spent time on is — on our global agenda is
climate change.  We’ve spent a lot of time dealing with that.  And we
are on the same page as to the need for us to move on it and get the
rest of the world to move.  
   
And since our first bilateral meeting back in February, we’ve met in
venues around the world — getting COVID-19 under control; trying to deal
with the next pandemic, be prepared for it; as well as meeting
infrastructure needs across the developing world.   
   
We see an opportunity not only to enhance the prospects of a better life
for people around the world, but we can do it by the Build Back Better
World, Build Back Better effort — that we can provide for the health
needs as well.   
   
We’re contributing a significant amount of vaccines, no strings
attached.  And we’re also — think we can — we should be building back in
a more significant, more environmentally friendly way.  
   
We’re meeting infrastructure needs, as I said.  We’re driving inclusive
economic recovery — together, as two nations — and meeting the climate
crisis and standing up for democratic values.   
   
And so, we’ve spent a lot of time at the G7, the G20, and COP26.  And I
think we both think we’re at our best when opportunity, equity, and
justice all coincide.  And — and they’re the core values of Canadians
and the United States.   
   
So, this is one of the easiest relationships you can have as an American
President and one of the best.  
   
Welcome.  
   
PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Joe. 
It’s — it’s been a busy year.  It is a pleasure to be back here in
Washington with you.   
   
But as you say, we have had the virtual bilat.  We’ve had many, many
encounters at all sorts of different international fora where we’ve been
strongly aligned on environment; on fighting COVID and getting — getting
through this pandemic, preparing for future challenges; but also on
building back better and recovering our economies in ways that work for
the middle class, for people working hard to join it in a way that is
inclusive and fair.  
   
And we’ve got a lot — a lot of work to continue to do.  The easy work is
done here at home; the hard work around the world — making sure we’re
bringing people along.  And that’s something that we’re always great
partners on.  
   
(Speaks in French.)  
   
I’m really looking forward to this.  So, thank you, Joe.   
   
Q    Mr. President, can I ask you a question about your tax incentives
for electric vehicles that would be assembled in the United States?  The
Canadian government says that would be a violation of the new trade
agreement we just signed.  Are you going to consider a carveout for
Canada, given the fact that our indu- — auto industries are so
integrated?  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  We’re going to talk about that to so- — some
extent.   
   
Q    Is it possible, Mr. President, to make changes for Canada?  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  I said we were going to talk about that.  We haven’t
even — it hasn’t even passed yet through the House.  We’re about to see
that move.  And we don’t know what will happen in the Senate, but
there’s a lot of complicating factors.  We’re going to talk at length
about it, I’m sure.  
   
Q    Sir, do you support a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Olympics?  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  It’s something we’re considering.  
   
Q    Do you think you can find common ground on the EV tax credit?  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  The answer is: I don’t know.  And I don’t know what
we’re going to be dealing with, quite frankly, when it comes out of
legislation.  So, we’ll talk about it then.  
   
1:55 P.M. EST
