title: "REMARKS BY VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS AT THE PARIS PEACE\_FORUM"
---
 
##### *La Grande Halle de la Villette Paris, France*

5:31 P.M. CET  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, President Macron, for hosting this forum
and for the warm welcome.  
   
Today, we stand together at the start of a new era in our world,
inspired by the possibility of our shared future, united by the bold
ambition of our shared ideals.  And so, it is an honor to be here today,
to join leaders from nations around the world in discussing one such
ideal: equality.  
   
To reach this ideal, we must acknowledge that inequality has always
existed in our world.  The gaps between the rich and poor, men and
women, the Global North and South have existed throughout history.  
   
To be sure, there are moments in which these gaps have narrowed and
moments in which they’ve widened.  
   
Most recently, and throughout this pandemic, the gaps have undoubtedly
become much larger.  Globally, extreme poverty is on the rise, as is
extreme wealth.  
   
The progress we have made on gender equality is under threat.  Experts
suggest it will now take decades longer for women to achieve parity with
men.  
   
And with school closures worldwide, the struggle to ensure that every
child has access to a quality education has become that much more
difficult.  
   
By virtually every measure, the gaps have grown.  
   
As the leaders of today, we are being confronted with this challenge
which is immense in both size and scale.   
   
At times like this, there are some who see what is happening and accept
it.  They accept it as something that has always existed and always
will.  But there are others who see what is happening and ask, “Why?”  
   
When I arrived in Paris, I visited the Institut Pasteur and reflected on
the work of my mother.  My mother, you see, had two goals in her life:
to raise her two daughters and to end breast cancer.  
   
At the age of 19, my mother arrived in the United States from India to
study science.  Throughout her career as a breast cancer researcher, she
collaborated with scientists worldwide, including right here in Paris at
the Institut Pasteur.  
   
And you see, when you’re a daughter of a scientist, science has a way of
shaping how you think.  My mother and her work taught me the power of a
short and very important question — that question being: “Why?”    
   
History is full of leaders — leaders in science, in politics, in
business, in the arts, in education — leaders who refused to accept the
status quo, who asked why, who took action.  And because they did, they
changed our world.  
   
Well, today, we face a dramatic rise in inequality, and we must rise to
meet this moment.  I believe that we, as leaders, must ask why this
inequality persists.   
   
We all know that this is a pivotal moment in the history of our
world.   
   
We are nearly two years into a global pandemic — 5 million lives lost,
countless livelihoods have been lost.  But the pandemic has also
presented us with an opportunity — an opportunity, because many in our
world, who perhaps did not see, now clearly see the gaps.   
   
And the call for leaders to bridge the gaps is rightfully growing more
urgent and more insistent.  
   
In this moment, leaders must reckon with the magnitude of this challenge
by asking:  
   
Why is it that 1 percent of the world now owns 45 percent of the world’s
wealth?  
   
Why is it that one in four people in the world lack access to clean
drinking water at home?  
   
Why is it that one in three women in the world experience sexual or
physical violence during her lifetime?  
   
Why is it that only half of the world has access to the Internet?  
   
Why have we allowed so many of the world’s children to go hungry, when
we know that we produce enough food to feed the entire world?  
   
We cannot be aware of these gaps and simply resign ourselves to them. 
We cannot accept them by thinking simply: This is what has always been
or what will always be.  
   
We must instead agree that these growing gaps are unacceptable.  And we
must agree to work together to bridge them.   
   
And here, I want to be clear: This is not about charity.  This is about
our duty and what we owe to each other as human beings.  This is also a
strategic imperative.  
   
As I have said many times, our world is more interconnected and
interdependent than ever before.  A virus can spread globally in a
matter of months.  A hacker in one nation can shut down the critical
infrastructure of another.  Emissions anywhere can increase air
pollution everywhere.  
   
In the 21st century, our fates are linked, as is our future.  In the
21st century, our nations are interconnected and our people are
interconnected.   
   
And so, in the 21st century, addressing inequality is a strategic
imperative for each of us — for our security and our health, our shared
prosperity and our collective future.  
   
All of which brings me back to this very moment.  As we recover from
this pandemic, from this crisis, we must challenge the status quo and
build something better.  
   
As leaders of our world, we must rise to meet this moment.  To get at
the root of this challenge, we must look critically at the norms that
are holding people back from achieving all that they can.  
   
To get at the root of this challenge, we must look critically at the
longstanding systems and structures that are fractured and fissured. 
And we must fix them: First, by taking action at home, and second, by
showing solidarity as a global community.  
   
For our part, the United States is committed to addressing our own
systemic gaps.  In fact, it has been a priority of our administration.  
   
Just before I traveled here, our Congress passed a landmark piece of
legislation to make an historic investment in our nation’s
infrastructure.  
   
Another bill that will support our nation’s workers and families and
help us meet our climate commitment is poised to pass soon.  
   
Together, these bills are designed to lift people out of poverty, to put
people to work in good jobs, and to help bridge the gaps that persist in
our nation.  
   
And as we make progress at home, we recognize our obligation to other
nations around the world.  
   
To that end, we are doubling our climate funding for those nations
hardest hit, pledging more than 1 billion vaccines worldwide and sending
development assistance to nations throughout the world.  
   
And we know there is more we can do and more we must do.  
   
But the fact remains: No single nation can take on inequality alone.  A
challenge this sizeable and seismic demands that our world work together
in solidarity.  And we have seen what is possible when we do.   
   
Less than two weeks ago, our world joined together at the G20 Summit in
Italy.  And there, leaders from nations that comprise 80 percent of
global GDP agreed to the Global Minimum Tax.  
   
This agreement will ensure that corporations — no matter how large, no
matter how global — will no longer be able to avoid paying their fair
share.  
   
And in so doing, it will give countries a greater ability to invest in
their people.  
   
Now, to be sure, this is just one step.  But it shows us what is
possible when the world joins together.  
   
And we all remember: When the world joined together to issue a Universal
Declaration on Human Rights, we saw what is possible.  When the world
joined together to launch the International Space Station, we saw what
is possible.  When the world, together, eradicated small pox, we saw
what is possible.  
   
And I believe that, in this pivotal moment, if we join together, there
is no challenge that is too big for us to take on.  
   
So, I will conclude with this: When we acknowledge what is happening in
our world — what is actually happening in our world — and then ask
ourselves “why,” we open ourselves up to the possibility that the future
can be different, that the future can be better.  And, in that way, this
question is a key to any progress and it is critical to our shared
future.  
   
So, I challenge all of us here today — government leaders, business
leaders, community leaders — let’s continue to ask why.  And, then,
let’s take action.   
   
There is the power of the people, and there are the people who are in
power.  And it will take all of us to meet this challenge.   
   
So, as we go forward from this place, let us not be burdened by what has
been.  Let us focus on what can be.  And let us realize a better future
together.  
   
Thank you.  (Applause.)
