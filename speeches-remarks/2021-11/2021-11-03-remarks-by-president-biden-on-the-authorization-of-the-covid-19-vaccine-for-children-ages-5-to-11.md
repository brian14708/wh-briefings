South Court Auditorium

4:06 P.M. EDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, folks.  Get my mask here.  Today is a
great day for American parents, American families, and American
children.  We’ve taken a giant step forward to further accelerate our
path out of this pandemic.  
   
After months of rigorous and independent scientific review, the Food and
Drug Administration — the FDA — authorized and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention — the CDC — recommended the COVID-19 vaccine for
children ages 5 through 11.  
   
For parents all over this country, this is a day of relief and
celebration.  After almost 18 months of anxious worrying every time that
children — your child had a sniffle or started to cough, well, you can
now protect them from this horrible virus, because that would always
worry that it was coming along.  
   
Twenty-eight million more young Americans are now eligible for the
protection of a vaccine, and my administration is ready — we’re ready
from day one, today — organized, and have a plan for this vaccination’s
launch.  
   
As soon as next week, we will have enough vaccine in enough places, and
parents will be able to schedule appointments to get their kids their
first shot.   
   
And we’ve already secured enough vaccine supply for every single child
in America ages 5 through 11.   
   
And weeks ago, we asked states and pharmacies to put together their
detailed plan to start placing their orders for these specially
formulated vaccines for young children.   
   
We started packing and shipping these orders last week, as soon as FDA
authorized the vaccine.   
   
And we’ve already sent millions of doses — excuse me — (coughs) —
millions of doses, and millions more to come by next week.  These doses
will be available at approximately — excuse me — (coughs) — I beg your
pardon; I swallowed wrong — will be available in approximately 20,000
locations around the country.  
   
These include places that parents know and trust: their local
pharmacies, their pediatricians, family doctors, and children’s
hospitals.   
   
Many of the vaccine sites will offer times on nights and weekends so
parents can take their children to get vaccinated after work and after
school.  
   
We’ve also been working with governors, mayors, and local school leaders
to bring vaccines to schools.  
   
As of today, more than 6,000 school clinics have already been planned in
school districts around the country.  
   
These efforts will also ensure equity that — is the center of our
children’s vaccination program, as has been — as it has been the prac- —
the vaccination program for adults.  
   
We’re making vaccines available at hundreds of community health centers,
rural health clinics, and thousands of pharmacies and schools in our
hardest-hit communities.  
   
And we’re sending out mobile units to reach where the people are.  
   
The bottom line is: We’ve been planning and preparing for months to
vaccinate our children.  
   
Our program will be ramping up this week and more doses shipped out each
day so that we have fully — we are fully up and running by next week.   
   
Now, I know that many parents have been anxiously waiting for this day,
but I also know that some families might have questions.  So, trusted
messengers — like your pediatricians, family doctors — will be able to
answer your questions, talk to parents about the importance of getting
their kids vaccinated, and put your mind at ease.  
   
We’ll also be raising awareness and encouraging parents to get their
children vaccinated, from our level.   
   
Just when we’ve been doing — that’s what we’ve been doing since day one
of my administration.  And we’re going to do everything we can to make
these vaccines easily available and raise awareness of the importance of
getting vaccinated.  
   
So, parents of children ages five and older, please get them
vaccinated.  Because here’s the deal: Children make up one quarter of
the cases in this country.  And while rare, children can get very sick
from COVID-19.  And some can end up — few — but end up hospitalized. 
But they don’t have to.  
   
This vaccine is safe and effective.  So, get your children vaccinated to
protect themselves, to protect others, and to stop the spread, and to
help us beat this pandemic.  
   
Today, I also want to speak to America’s seniors.  While everyone is at
risk of getting COVID-19, the evidence is overwhelming that older
Americans are still, by far, the most vulnerable to getting the
sickest.  
   
And boosters — boosters add an important layer of protection.  Booster
shots are free and effective, and every senior should get one.  It’s
important.  
   
Seniors are eligible to get your booster shot six months after you’ve
been fully vaccinated.  So, six months.  If you got your second shot
before May the 1st, you are eligible to get the booster right now.  
   
And I’ve made it clear: We have ample supply of boosters.  
   
And thanks to our planning and preparation, our booster program is off
to a very strong start.  Over 20 million Americans have now received a
booster.  
   
In fact, in just six weeks, we’ve already gotten boosters to about half
the eligible seniors who received the Pfizer vaccine.  Nearly half of
the eligible seniors in just six weeks.   
   
It took nearly 11 weeks to get half of all seniors their first shot for
that — when that program was launched back in December of 2020, just
during the prior administration.  So, as a — this is a strong pace.   
   
To our seniors: If you’re eligible, get your booster now.   
   
I’ll conclude with this: Vaccines for children ages 5 to 11 and boosters
\[to\] provide additional protection for seniors and others are two
major steps forward that are going to accelerate our path out of this
pandemic.  
   
And this brings — and this brings me to where we are and where we’re
going to go from here: Since early September, cases and hospitalizations
are down now more than 50 percent.  And over the past two weeks, cases
and hospitalizations are falling in approximately 40 states.  
   
A year ago, we had no vaccines.  Just this week, we hit an important
milestone: 80 percent of adults have at least one shot.  That’s four out
of every five adults.  
   
And for our seniors, over 95 percent have gotten at least one shot.   
   
Overall, 193 million Americans are fully vaccinated, up from just 2
million the day I was sworn in.  Over 20 million have enhanced
protections from boosters.  And we’re now down from 100 \[million\] to
about 60 million unvaccinated Americans 12 years and older.  
   
And I’m proud to say, Black and brown adults and Native Americans have
gotten vaccinated at the same rate as white adults.   
   
And one more thing.  Our vaccination program is not only helping to save
lives and beat the pandemic, it’s helping our economy recovery and
helping us grow.  
       
In the three months before I came to office, the economy was stagnant
and creating only 60,000 jobs a month.  
   
Since I’ve taken office, it’s now averaging 600,000 new jobs every
month.  That’s the average.  
   
And one more thing.  Vaccinating our children will help us keep our
schools open — keep our kids in the classroom, learning and socializing
with their classmates and teachers.   
   
I think every reporter in this room who has a child understands the
difference of a child going to school and having to learn from home.  It
matters.  It matters in terms of their not just physical health, their
mental health.  
   
You know, during this pandemic, we’ve seen just how important being in
school is for our families and for our country.  
   
A year ago, we were heading into a Thanksgiving where public health were
— experts were advising against traveling or gathering with family and
friends.     
   
Last Thanksgiving, for the first time, it was just four of us — my wife
and I, our daughter and her — and my son-in-law.  Later this month, our
tables and our hearts are going to be filled, thanks to the vaccines.  
   
We’ve made incredible progress over these past nine months, but we have
to keep going.  The pandemic is not yes \[sic\] behind us — yet behind
us, but we’re getting there.  
   
So, please — please do your part.  If you know someone who is not
vaccinated, encourage them to get vaccinated.   
   
And folks — folks who haven’t gotten vaccinated yet, please get
vaccinated.  It’s easy.  It’s accessible.  And it’s free.  Get
vaccinated.  You can do this.  
   
May God bless you all.   
   
And I’ll take a few questions.  
   
Q    Mr. President, on the outcome on Virginia —  
   
Q    Mr. President, a quick one —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I’ll start all the way at the end.  
   
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  Appreciate it.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you’re not all the way at the end, but that’s
okay.  You’re up.  (Laughter.)  
   
Q    As leader of the Democratic Party, how much responsibility do you
take for the dismal results in Virginia and beyond last night?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, look, yesterday reminded me of — that one of the
scared rights we have is to be able to go out and cast our votes.  And
remember that we all have an obligation to accept the legitimacy of
these elections.   
   
I was talking to Terry to congratulate him today.  He got 600,000 more
votes than any Democrat ever has gotten.  We brought out every Democrat
about there was.  More votes than ever has been cast for a Democratic
incumbent — I mean, not incumbent — a Democrat running for governor. 
And no governor in Virginia has ever won when he is of the same — where
he or she is the same party as the sitting President.  
   
What I do know is — I do know that people want us to get things done. 
They want us to get things done.  And that’s why I’m continuing to push
very hard for the Democratic Party to move along and pass my
infrastructure bill and my Build Back Better bill.   
   
I think if we — look, think about what we — what we’re talking about
here.  People are upset and uncertain about a lot of things — from
COVID, to school, to jobs, to a whole range of things, and the cost of a
gallon of gasoline.   
   
And so, if I’m able to pass — sign into law my Build Back Better
initiative, I’m in a position where you’re going to see a lot of those
things ameliorated quickly and swiftly.  And so that has to be done.  
   
Q    Mr. President — Mr. President, given what you’ve said, do you take
some responsibility?  And do you think that Terry McAuliffe would have
won if your agenda had passed before Election Day?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think we should have — it should have passed
before Election Day.  But I’m not sure that I would be able to have
changed the number of very conservative folks who turned out in the red
districts who were Trump voters.  But maybe.  Maybe.  
   
Q    You won the state by 10 points, Mr. President.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No, I — I know we did.  But I — we also — I was running
against Donald Trump.  
   
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  I have a —  
   
Q    Mr. President —  
   
Q    What should Democrats possibly do differently to avoid similar
losses in November, especially as Republicans are now successfully
running on culture-war issues and false claims about critical race
theory?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think we should produce for the American
people.  Look, one of the things that is important to understand: If —
if they pass my legislation, we’re going to be able to reduce the price
— people are going to see a reduction in the price of the drugs they —
they have to get because Medicare will be able to negotiate and lower
the price of drugs.   
   
If they pass my legislation, you’re going to see that nobody — and some
of you who have children in daycare or children in childcare, you’re
paying up to $14,000 a year if you live here.  You will never have to
pay that much money if you live in Washington, or wherever you live.  No
more than 17 perc- — 7 percent of your income.  They’re going to see
that, you know, they’ll get tax breaks — I mean, genuine tax breaks.   
   
\[A cellphone rings.\]  
   
If that’s Trump, then tell him I’m busy.  (Laughter.)  
   
Q    But, Mr. President —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  That was bad — bad joke.  
   
But anyway, but the — but the point is that, you know, we have to move
and make it clear that what we’ve done is increasing their —  
   
Look, people — people need a little breathing room.  They’re
overwhelmed.  And what happened was — I think we have to just produce
results for them to change their standard of living and give them a
little more breathing room.  
   
Q    My question is —  
   
Q    Mr. President —  
   
Q    Can you just — what’s your message, though, for Democratic voters,
especially Black voters who see Republicans running on race, education —
lying about critical race theory — and they’re worried that Democrats
don’t have an effective way to push back on that?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that the whole answer is just to speak the
truth, lay out where we are.   
   
Look, I’m convinced that if you look at everything from my view on
criminal justice system, to my view on equal opportunity, to my view on
economic issues, and all the things that I have and what I’ve been
pushing in legislation — each of the elements are overwhelmingly
popular.  We have to speak to them though.  We have to speak them and
explain them.   
   
Look, I just think people are at a point — and it’s understandable —
where there’s a whole lot of confusion.  Everything from, “Are you going
to ever get COVID under control?”; to “Are my kids going to be in
school?  Are they going to be able to stay in school?”; to “Whether or
not I’m going to get a tax break that allows me to be able to pay for
the needs of my kids and my family?”   
   
And they’re all things that we’re — that we’re going to — that I’m
running on — that we’ll run on.  And I think we’ll do fine.   
   
Q    Mr. President, right here.  Right here, Mr. President.  Mr.
President —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  This ought to be good.  
   
Q    I think so, too.   
   
About the way forward, Mr. President: As you were leaving for your
overseas trip, there were reports that were surfacing that your
administration is planning to pay illegal immigrants who are separated
from their families at the border up to $450,000 each, possibly a
million dollars per family.  Do you think that that might incentivize
more people to come over illegally?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  If you guys keep sending that garbage out, yeah.  But
it’s not true.   
   
Q    So, this is a garbage report?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.   
   
Q    Okay.  So, you —  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Four hundred and fifty — four hundred and fifty dollars
per person.  Is that what you’re saying?   
   
Q    That was separated from a family member at the border under the
last administration.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s not going to happen.  
   
Q    Okay.  And then just a follow-up, because you mentioned Trump a
couple times.  When you went to try to help Terry McAuliffe in — a
couple weeks ago, before you left, you mentioned Trump 24 times.  Do you
still think that voters really want to hear you talking about Trump more
than the issues affecting them every day?  
   
THE PRESIDENT: Well, the reason I mentioned Trump — I didn’t count the
times — is because the issues he supports are affecting their lives
every day and they’re a negative impact on their lives, in my view.  
   
Thank you all very much.
