Q    Mr. President, can we have a reaction to your meeting with
President Xi last night?  How did it go?

THE PRESIDENT:  It was a good meeting.  We got a lot to follow up on. 
We set up four groups, and we’re going to get our folks together on a
whole range of issues. 

I’ll have more to report for you in the next two weeks.

Q    Any progress on Taiwan?

THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  We have made very clear we support the Taiwan Act,
and that’s it.  It’s independent.  It makes its own decisions.

Q    How about a Fed chair nominee?  Any closer to a decision?

THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, as my grandfather would say, “with the grace of God
and the goodwill of the neighbors,” you’re going to hear that in about
four days.
