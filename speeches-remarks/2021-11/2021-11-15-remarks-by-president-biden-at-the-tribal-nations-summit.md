Via Teleconference  
South Court Auditorium

11:50 A.M. EST  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Madam Secretary.  And I say to the press,
“Excuse my back.”  (The President turns to the video call screen behind
him.)  Next time in Washington, okay?  I see you all up on the board
behind me, and I hope we do this in person.  I hope, I hope, I hope. 
That’s my — that’s my hope.  Thank you.  
   
Good morning.  I want to thank you for joining us.  This is a big day. 
I think, as my mother would say, former Senator Dan Inouye is looking
down going, “Finally.  Finally.”  I was raised by Dan Inouye in the
United States Senate.  
   
And to President Fawn Sharp and Chairman Hill of the Oneida Nation, and
our President Holsey: I thank you all for what you’re doing, and I want
to recognize you.  
   
And, Chairman Hill, I thought going — being from Upstate New York, in
college, and my deceased wife is from Skaneateles Lake, not far from
Oneida, New York — I thought that the Oneida Nation was all in Central
New York, but obviously you’re up in Wisconsin.  Come down and see us in
Oneida.  (Laughs.)  
   
Anyway, I want to thank you, Madam Secretary, for your remarks.  But I
also want to thank you, Deb, for being willing to join when I asked you
to come along and to serve.  And as I said, I was confident, at the
time, you would be incredibly important.  
   
When I got to the Senate, Dan Inouye took me under his wing.  He helped
me understand the simple truth that I had only been vaguely aware of,
and that is that Tribal Nations do better when they make their own
decisions.  That’s why some of the votes I took as a young senator are
among my proudest: supporting the Indian Self-Determination and
Education Assistance Act, the Indian Child Welfare Act, the Native
American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, and so much more.  
   
When I ran for President, it was important for me to continue to make
progress.  And that’s what we’ve done since I took office.  When
COVID-19 struck in Indian — it hit Indian Country with devastating
consequences.  Native Americans contracted the virus at over three times
the rate of white Americans, nearly twice the rate of lives lost; twice
as many died as a percentage.  
   
But Tribal Nations stepped up.  And today, the Native Americans have
gone from being a population most harmed by COVID to one of the
populations most vaccinated against COVID.  That success has a lot to do
with Tribal leadership, but it also has to do with the American Rescue
Plan, which included over $31 billion — $31 billion for Tribal Nations —
the most significant investment in the history of Indian Country.  Long
overdue.  
   
Now we’re taking the next step.  Today, I’m signed — and I’ll shortly
sign — a Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal.  Everyone knows we’re long
overdue to make major investments in infrastructure, but nobody knows
that better than Indian Country.  Tribal lands have been chronically
underfunded for generations.  
   
And so I’m very proud to say that when I sign the bill outside on the
South Lawn shortly, the single-largest investment in Tribal
infrastructure ever is going to occur: more than $13 billion in direct
investments to Indian Country and tens of billions more in grants and
future funding opportunities — funding for clean drinking water,
high-speed Internet, roads and bridges, environmental cleanups, and so
much more.  
   
But we can’t stop there.  We need Congress to pass my Build Back Better
plan as well.  Today, 1 in 10 Native American parents have reported
having to quit or change their jobs or turn down an opportunity due to a
childcare challenge.  This bill would save most families thousands of
dollars per year in childcare, helping moms and dads rejoin the
workforce.   
   
But also, this bill, when it passes, will allow every three- and
four-year-old in the nation to attend high-quality preschool, increasing
considerably their chances of getting all the way through the first 12
years of primary school and on to college.  It includes the most
significant investment to tackle the climate crisis in history.  
   
And I might note parenthetically: No group of Americans has created and
cared more about preserving what we inherited than the Tribal Nations. 
And it will be expand — will — this also will expand health coverage,
lower costs for millions of Americans.  
   
You know, we have to continue to stand up for the dignity and
sovereignty of Tribal Nations.  My dad used the word “dignity” I think
more than any other word.  He said, “Everyone is entitled to be treated
with dignity.”   
   
I was proud to reestablish the White House Council on Native American
Affairs and to issue a memorandum my first week in office instructing my
entire administration to engage in regular, meaningful consultation with
Tribal Nations.  
   
I was kidding my wife Jill, who’ll be out here shortly: She’s visited
the Navajo Nation so many times I’m worried she’s not going to come
home.   
   
But, look, I’ve been proud — I’m proud to –- of the — to name Native
American leaders in my administration: not only the first Native
American Cabinet Secretary — and it won’t be the last in history — but
more than 50 Native Americans now serving in significant roles in my
administration.   
   
We’ve also taken action to protect Tribal lands: revoking the permit for
the Keystone XL pipeline; preserving and protecting their sacred
homeland, including Bears Ears and the Grand Staircase-Escalante.  It’s
part of who we are as a nation.  And I’m grateful to the Tribes who led
the effort.   
   
You know, we also can be proud of that progress, but there’s still so
much more to do.  So, today, I’m announcing five new initiatives.  
   
First, a new initiative involving 17 departments and agencies to protect
Tribal treaty rights and the work of the federal government.   
   
Second, a new initiative to increase Tribal participation in the
management and stewardship of federal lands.   
   
Third, my administration will be the first to work with the Tribes to
comprehensively incorporate Tribal — Tribal ecological knowledge into
the federal government’s scientific approach, helping us fight climate
change.   
   
And fourth, taking action to protect the Greater Chaco Landscape in
Northwest New Mexico from future oil and gas drilling and leasing.   
   
And fifth, I’m about to sign an executive order, in a moment, addressing
the crisis of violence against Native Americans.  
   
Today, I’m directing federal officials to work with Tribal Nations on a
strategy to improve public safety and advance justice.  This builds on
the work we did together in reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act
in 2013, when we granted authority to try to exercise jurisdiction over
non-Indian offenders who commit violence on Tribal lands.  We’re going
to reauthorize that again.  We’re going to expand the jurisdiction to
include other offenses like sex trafficking, sexual assault, and child
abuse.  
   
These efforts — again, to use the word my dad would use much — are a
matter of dignity.  That’s the foundation of our nation-to-nation
partnership.  That’s what this summit is all about.   
   
So, I want to thank everyone who’s here for participating, and I look
forward to continuing to work together.   
   
And now it’s my honor to sign an executive order.  And a couple of my
friends are going to be coming out here, I’m told — Cabinet members. 
But, you know, here we go.  
   
Where is everybody?  (Laughter.)  Jill.  
   
THE FIRST LADY:  Hi.  (Laughs.)  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Jill is here.  The Attorney General.  We got — oh,
everybody is there.  All right, Jill.  
   
I don’t know what was going on back there, but I — (laughter).  You’re
all here.  Okay.  I was worried you weren’t going to come out here. 
(Laughter.)  Good to see you.  All right.   
   
The title of this legislation is “Improving Public Safety and Criminal
Justice for Native Americans and Addressing the Crisis of Missing or
Murdered Indigenous People.”  
   
And I’m proud to sign it.  It’s long overdue.  
   
(The executive order is signed.)  
   
Thank you all so very much.  
   
We’re going to make some substantial change in Indian Country, and it’s
going to continue.  
   
Thank you all.  (Applause.)  
   
Q    Mr. President, are you confident that Build Back Better will pass
the House (inaudible)?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  You ask me that all the time and I give you the same
answer.  I’ve been confident since the day I stepped into office.
