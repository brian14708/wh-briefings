title: Remarks by President Biden After Meeting with a Bipartisan Group of Senators
  on Infrastructure Negotiations

Stakeout Location

THE PRESIDENT:  We had a really good meeting.  And to answer your direct
question, we have a deal.  And I think it’s really important — we’ve all
agreed — that none of us got what we — all that we wanted.  I clearly
didn’t get all I wanted.  They gave more than, I think, maybe they were
inclined to give in the first place.   
   
But this reminds me of the days we used to get an awful lot done up at
the United States Congress.  We actually worked with one — we had
bipartisan deals.  Bipartisan deals means compromise.  
   
One of the things that I’ve — I’ve made clear: I’ve signed on — and I’m
going to let them give you the detail because — and you can ask them —
and I’m — I will — I will talk to you all later, in the next hour or
two.  What- — I promise you I’m not going away.   
   
But one of the things that we agreed on: infrastructure.  We made
serious compromises on both ends.  There is — and they’ll — they’ll give
you the numbers.  But we did not — they did not — and I understand their
position — Republicans and this group did not want to go along with my —
any of my Family Plan issues — the childcare tax credits, the human
infrastructure that I talk about.  
   
And that — we’ll see what happens in the reconciliation bill and the
budget process — if that — if we get some compromise there.  And if we
can’t, see if I can attract all the Democrats to a position that is
there.  But we’re going to — they’re going to move on a dual track.  And
— and that’s all I’ll say.  
   
But I want to thank each and every one of them.  It’s been — you know, a
lot of us go back a long way, where we’re used to doing one thing: Give
each other our word and that’s the end.  Nobody questions it.  They have
my word, I’ll stick with what they proposed, and they’ve given me their
word as well. So, where I come from, that’s good enough for me.   
   
So, I’m going to turn it over to the two Chairs here.  And I’ll talk to
you all a little bit later.   
   
Q    Have you been briefed about the building collapse in Miami?   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  I have.  I spoke with the mayor.  I spoke with the
congresswoman.  And I’ll have more to say about that as well.  
   
Q    Are you committed to the two-track system, Mr. President?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Pardon me?  
   
Q    Are you committed to the two-track system?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  That is — there is going to be a two-track system.  
   
Q    And are you confident that you’re going to have all of the
Democrats support it in the Senate?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Let them talk to you. Okay?  I’m not confident in
anything except I trust their word.  
   
END
