title: Excerpts from Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Vice President Harris to
  the Brussels Forum

The truth is we face many shared challenges: The pandemic and the
resulting economic uncertainty. Climate change, cyber threats, and the
resulting security concerns. And, of course, the outright assault on
democracy that is occurring around the globe.

In the chaos of the crisis, Autocrats have become more destructive.
Human rights abuses have multiplied. The rule of law that underpins our
international order is under assault. Even basic truth, even basic
facts, are being undermined by disinformation—chipping away at public
confidence in our press and scientists, our courts and our elections.

I will never forget the horror and the heartbreak of January 6, 2021,
when our United States Capitol, a beacon of democracy for so many, came
under siege by a violent mob who refused to accept the results of a free
and fair election. It is not enough to say we cannot let something like
that ever happen again. We must commit and recommit our democratic
principles and lead by example. We must reinforce our democratic
institutions to deliver real results and instill trust.

There are barriers that stand in the way of doing that. Corruption is
one such barrier.

Corruption causes the people to suffer. It stands in the way of
progress. It stands in the way of hope.

Corruption can keep people from going to the doctor, sending their
children to school, opening a small business, getting a fair trial.
Corruption corrodes public trust and drives away investment. It compels
migration. It causes violence. And it cannot stand. This month, we
announced that for the first time ever, our Administration is
designating the fight against corruption a core U.S. national security
interest. Together with our allies, civil society, and the private
sector, the United States will prioritize the fight against corruption
to preserve democracy.

The fight against corruption is a fight won through accountability,
through transparency. It is a fight won through strengthening the rule
of law and also through the promotion of human rights.

Our democracies cannot be sustained when people are denied their rights,
their freedom, their dignity. We must reckon with the injustices of the
past and confront those that still persist.

A democracy’s strength depends on its ability to protect against
injustice. When we make it possible for more people to fully
participate, we improve communities, we improve countries, we improve
our world. And that is why, wherever, whenever human rights are
violated, we must stand together.
