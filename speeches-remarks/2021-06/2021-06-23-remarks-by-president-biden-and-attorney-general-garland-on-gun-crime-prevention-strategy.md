  Strategy"

State Dining Room

4:55 P.M. EDT  
   
ATTORNEY GENERAL GARLAND: Good afternoon, Mr. President. It’s good to be
here with you, and with local elected and community leaders, and with
representatives of law enforcement.  
   
Protecting our communities from violent crime is a top priority for the
Department of Justice and one of our most important responsibilities.  
   
I’m glad the President brought us together today to discuss a subject of
such importance to the public we serve. As our participants in today’s
roundtable have noted, the increase in violent crime in 2020 and early
2021 is deeply troubling.  
   
That is why, last month, the Justice Department launched a comprehensive
violent crime reduction strategy. This strategy is built around four
principles: setting strategic enforcement priorities; fostering trust
with and earning legitimacy in our communities; investing in
community-based prevention and intervention programs; and measuring the
results of these efforts through a decrease in violent crime, not merely
by arrests and convictions, as if they were ends in themselves.  
   
Now, we know that the lion’s share of violent crime reduction work is
shouldered by our state, local, Tribal, and territorial law enforcement
partners. Core to our strategy is targeted support of the critical work
that you will be doing in the weeks and months ahead.  
   
Every one of our U.S. attorney’s offices is working with its local
partners to establish an immediate plan to address the spike in violent
crime that typically occurs during the summer. And the law enforcement
components of the Department are making enhanced resources available to
help prevent and disrupt violent crime, and to focus on the most
dangerous, most violent offenders.  
   
The Department is also strengthening our Project Safe Neighborhoods —
our cornerstone initiative that brings together law enforcement and
community stakeholders to develop solutions to pressing violent crime
problems.  
   
Community-led efforts are vital to preventing violence before it occurs.
The Justice Department has available over $1 billion in funding through
over a dozen grant programs that can be used to support evidence-based,
community violence intervention strategies.  
   
And I want to say that’s what I found particularly useful in our
discussion just a few minutes ago — was the fact that there are such
evidence-based programs available. And I’m hoping that you will get
together with us so that we can spread those across the country — as
well, of course, funding your own.  
   
A properly functioning criminal justice system is essential to our
efforts, as well. The Department has grant funding available to help
cities resume court operations and services that were curtailed during
the COVID-19 pandemic. That includes funding for technology and
equipment for courts to address the backlog of cases and enhance access
to justice.  
   
We know that an effective violent crime reduction strategy must also
address the illegal trafficking of firearms and focus on keeping guns
out of the wrong hands. And so the Department is delivering on the
promises we made here at the White House in April.  
   
On May 7th, we issued a proposed rule to help address the proliferation
of ghost guns. On June 7th, we issued a proposed rule to clarify that
pistols equipped with certain stabilizing braces are subject to the same
statutory restrictions as easily concealable, short-barreled rifles. And
on the same day, the Department published model Extreme Risk Protection
Order legislation for states to consider as they craft their own laws to
reduce gun violence.

We are now taking further steps. First, we will hold gun dealers that
break the rules accountable for their actions. Most federally licensed
firearms dealers operate legally in selling guns to individuals who have
passed background checks. But those dealers that willfully violate the
law increase the risk that guns will fall into the wrong hands.   
   
Absent extraordinary circumstances, ATF will initiate proceedings to
revoke the licenses of dealers that willfully violate the law by failing
to conduct required background checks, falsifying records, failing to
respond to trace requests, refusing to permit ATF to conduct
inspections, or transferring firearms to persons who are prohibited from
owning them.  
   
Second, we are seeking funding to increase ATF’s dealer inspection
capacity and improve its effectiveness. ATF has very limited inspection
resources. The President’s Fiscal 2022 Budget requests resources to add
inspection positions in every field division. The effectiveness of the
enforcement program depends on the ability to identify and focus on
those dealers that pose the greatest risk to public safety.  
   
Starting today, ATF will make clear to investigators in every field
division that, as they prioritize inspections, they must consider the
extent to which firearms sold by a dealer are later used in criminal
activity.  
   
Third, we will improve information sharing with state, local, Tribal,
and territorial partners to help bring more intelligence and law
enforcement resources to bear — as well as with the public, to increase
our own accountability.  
   
Today, ATF has a point of contact in every field division to receive
information from mayors, police chiefs, and other local leaders about
firearms dealers they believe are acting unlawfully.  
   
And starting next month, ATA — ATF will begin sharing inspection data
with the 16 states that license or regulate firearms dealers
themselves.  
   
Also beginning next month, ATF will publicly post information about
inspection frequency and outcomes disaggregated by field division,
providing for enhanced transparency and accountability.  
   
Fourth, we are launching a concerted effort to crack down on gun
traffickers. Yesterday, the Department announced that it will establish
five new cross-jurisdictional law enforcement strike forces within the
next 30 days. The strike forces will focus on addressing significant
firearms trafficking corridors that fuel violence in New York, Chicago,
Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Washington, D.C., as well
as in cities and towns along the way.  
   
The Justice Department’s violent crime reduction strategy and our
initiatives to stem the rising tide of illegal — illegal guns will save
lives. But these steps alone will not solve the problem of violent
crime. Success depends on all of us joining together: those of you in
this room, the many like you across the country who are working to keep
their communities safe, and the people of our communities themselves.  
   
I would now like to introduce President Biden, who has emphasized the
importance of this issue and who has my gratitude for gathering us
together today.  
   
Thank you.  
   
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, General. Let me — before I begin, thank the
participants in our roundtable today: two mayors — three mayors, chiefs
of police, attorneys general, and community organizers who have been
doing significant work in bringing down violent crime in their
communities. There is no one — one answer that fits everything. And it’s
about being engaged and multiple organizations being engaged.  
   
So, I want to thank you for the time you spent with us today. And I
warned you: I’m coming back at you again for more information.
(Laughter.)  
   
And we just met, as a I said, with a bipartisan group of mayors, law
enforcement, and community leaders. And we discussed a comprehensive
strategy that I’m releasing today to combat the epidemic of gun violence
and other violent crime that we’ve been seeing in our country for far
too long, that has spiked since the start of the pandemic over a year
ago.  
   
Crime has — historically rises during the summer. And as we emerge from
this pandemic with the country opening back up again, the traditional
summer’s — summer spike may even be more pronounced than it usually
would be.  
   
For folks at home, here’s what you need to know: I’ve been at this a
long time and there are things we know that work that reduce gun
violence and violent crime, and things that we don’t know about. But
things we know about: Background checks for purchasing a firearm are
important; a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines — no one
needs to have a weapon that can fire over 30, 40, 50, even up to 100
rounds unless you think the deer are wearing Kevlar vests or something;
community policing and programs that keep neighborhoods safe and keep
folks out of trouble.  
   
These efforts worked. They saved lives. But over time, these policies
were gutted and were woefully underfunded.  
   
In our conversation today, we talked about our strategy to supercharge
what works while we continue to push the Congress to act on sensible gun
violence legislation.  
   
First, we discussed cracking down, as you heard from the Attorney
General, on rogue gun dealers. We know that if there is a strict
enforcement of background checks, then fewer guns get into the hands of
criminals. Background checks have thus far kept more than 3 million guns
out of the hands of felons — convicted felons, fugitives, domestic
abusers, and others prohibited from being able to purchase a gun. And
there are still too many loopholes in that system.  
   
And, today, enough rogue gun dealers feel like they can get away with
selling guns to people who aren’t legally allowed to own them.  
   
And I might add: The Second Amendment, from the day it was passed,
limited the type of people who could own a gun and what type of weapon
you could own. You couldn’t buy a cannon.  
   
Those who say the blood of lib- — “the blood of patriots,” you know, and
all the stuff about how we’re going to have to move against the
government. Well, the tree of liberty is not watered with the blood of
patriots. What’s happened is that there have never been — if you wanted
or if you think you need to have weapons to take on the government, you
need F-15s and maybe some nuclear weapons.  
   
The point is that there has always been the ability to limit —
rationally limit the type of weapon that can be owned and who can own
it.  
   
The last time we had data on this issue of who is purchasing guns was
more than 20 years ago. Five percent of gun dealers — it turns out, in
the study we did — showed that 90 percent of illegal guns were found at
the crime scenes sold by 5 percent of gun dealers. Five percent sold 90
percent of the guns found at crime scenes.  
   
And the — these merchants of death are breaking the law for profit.
They’re selling guns that are killing innocent people. It’s wrong. It’s
unacceptable. And as the Attorney General said, we’re going to crack
down on those gun dealers and the violent criminals they knowingly
arm.  
   
In April, I announced that the Justice Department is going to be issuing
an annual report on gun trafficking so we can update that data.  
   
Today, the Department is announcing, as I just did, a major crackdown on
— to stem the flow of guns used to commit violent crimes. It’s zero
tolerance for gun dealers who willfully violate key existing laws and
regulations. Let me repeat: zero tolerance.  
   
If you willfully sell a gun to someone who is prohibited from possessing
it, if you willfully fail to run a background check, if you willfully
falsify a record, if you willfully fail to cooperate with the tracing
requests or inspections, my message to you is this: We’ll find you, and
we will seek your license to sell guns. We’ll make sure you can’t sell
death and mayhem on our streets. It’s an outrage. It has to end, and
we’ll end it. Period.  
   
Second, we discussed disrupting illegal gun trafficking. Now, the gun
lobby wants you to believe that cities that are the toughest gun — have
the toughest gun laws still have the highest rates of gun violence, as
was pointed out by the group we had today in our roundtable. They — the
violence is so — they argue, “Why do you need those gun laws if they
don’t work in cities that have tough laws?” Don’t believe it.  
   
Here’s the truth: Today’s conversation with Mayor Scott of Baltimore,
for example, echoed what we know to be the case, and you hear it from
mayors across the country. Mayors have the power to help shape and
enforce the laws in their cities, but they can’t control the laws in
neighboring cities and states, even though the gun legally bought there
is — often ends up in their streets.  
   
Mayor Scott says that 80 percent of the guns in Baltimore were acquired
outside the city — outside the city. There’s little he can do about
that, so we have to act.    
   
As part of our strategy, the Justice Department is creating five new
strike forces to crack down on illegal gun trafficking in the corridors
supplying weapons to cities like New York; Chicago; Los Angeles;
Washington, D.C.; and the Bay Area.    
   
With these strike forces, local and federal law enforcement and
prosecutors are going to be able to better coordinate the prosecution of
illegal gun trafficking across city and state lines, so illegal guns
sold from the back door of a gun shop in Virginia don’t end up at a
murder scene in Baltimore. And if they do, then local and federal law
enforcement can better coordinate to trace illegal gun sales back to the
shady gun dealer and hold them accountable.    
   
Police Chief Murray of the Baltimore \[sic\] — excuse me, Police Chief
Merritt \[sic\] — Police Chief Murphy Paul of Baton Rouge, Louisiana,
talked about how he’s coordinating more closely with the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; the ATF; and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation — the FBI — to help take on criminal organizations
committing violent crimes in the city.  
   
This kind of coordination is essential to keeping the weapons of war out
of the hands of dangerous criminals, fugitives, and gangs, as well as
organized crime.  
   
Third, we discussed historic funding — we discussed historic funding for
states, cities, and counties, and Tribes for law enforcement and crime
prevention. You know, they’ve not only had to fight this pandemic,
they’ve also had to deal with economic crisis that has decimated their
budgets — forced them to cut essential services, including law
enforcement and social services.  
   
And amid the COVID-19 pandemic, they’ve had to deal with a second public
health crisis: gun violence. The American Rescue Plan, which we passed
in the first 100 days of my administration, is providing much-needed,
historic relief to bring back those law enforcement jobs and social
service jobs.    
   
Much of this relief has already arrived. The rest is on its way. And
we’re now providing more guidance on how they can use the $350 billion
nationally that the American Rescue Plan has available to help reduce
crime and address the root causes.    
   
For example, cities experiencing an increase in gun violence were able
to use the American Rescue Plan dollars to hire police officers needed
for community policing and to pay their overtime.    
   
Mayors will also be able to buy crime-fighting technologies, like
gunshot detection systems, to better see and stop gun violence in their
communities.  They can use the funding to scale up wraparound services
for the residents as well, including substance abuse and mental health
services that we know will make a difference in prevention of crime.    
   
Here’s another example that reminds me of the old saying my mom used to
use. She’d say, “An idle mind is the devil’s workshop.” Well, school’s
out for the summer. Teenagers are in tough neighborhoods, no — who are
in tough neighborhoods — no jobs, more trouble.    
   
We know summer job training — summer jobs, training, and recreation for
young people work. They help make sure young people pick up a paycheck
instead of a pistol. One study found a Boston summer jobs program for
youth reduction reduced violent crimes by 35 percent in Boston.  
   
Another study found that a program that offers high school students in
Chicago a good summer job and an adult mentor and behavioral therapy led
to a 45 percent drop in violence.  
   
We can invest in more of these programs with the American Rescue Plan.
And here’s another thing states, cities, counties, and Tribes can do
with that funding: When someone finishes their time in prison, they
can’t just give them — we can’t just continue to give them 25 bucks and
a bus ticket. They end up right back where they started and got them in
trouble in the first place — or no option for being able to provide for
access to public housing or for schools or for — for mentors to help
them find their way, and the stuff that prevents recidivism and helps
them integrate in a society. That’s changing with guidance we’re issuing
today.  
   
The American Rescue Plan funding can help formerly incarcerated people
get skills training, apprenticeships, and work experience so they can
gain stability and security and a chance for a better life, rather than
going back to exactly what they left.    
   
Attorney General Greenwald of New Jersey and Mayor Daniel- — and Mayor
Daniella Levine Cava of Miami-Dade talked about their efforts to lift up
those kinds of communit– their — the kinds of community programs that
reduce gun violence, keep communities safe, and make real, positive
difference in people’s lives.  
   
And for folks at home, the American Rescue Plan, which is a
once-in-a-generation investment to reduce violence in America, is
available. I’m proud of it. It means more police officers, more nurses,
more counselors, more social workers, more community violence
interrupters to help resolve issues before they escalate into crimes.  
   
It means we go after the people who flood our streets with guns and the
bad actors who decide to use them to further terrorize the communities.
 It means saving lives. And Congress should in no way take away this
funding. It’s already been appropriated.    
   
In fact, a few weeks ago, the bipartisan United States Conference of
Mayors, the National League of Cities, National Association of Counties
— they all came out forcefully against efforts to reclaim American
Rescue Plan funds that have already been allocated to the state, cities,
and counties, and Tribes.  This is not a time to turn our backs on law
enforcement or our communities.    
   
Fourth, we discussed the need to support community violence
intervention.  These are local programs that utilize trusted messengers
and community members and leaders to work directly with people who are
most likely to commit gun crimes or become victims of gun crimes.    
   
We know who they are. They intervene before it’s too late — these —
these interrupters — turn down the temperature, halt the cycle of
retaliation, connect people to social services.  And it works. Community
violence intervention programs have shown a reduction in violence of up
to 60 percent in many places.    
   
We heard from two community leaders that do this work. Eddie, thank you
for coming from Chicago to — you’re really — quite frankly, it was
impressive — your presentation.  And — and DeVone Boggan from Richmond,
California.    
   
Eddie was formerly incarcerated for gun homicide, and DeVone lost his
brother to gun violence. And Eddie worked as a violence interrupter.
 Now he runs a program that provides high-risk men with cognitive
behavioral — cognitive behavioral therapy to help them react to the
impulses by slowing down rather than following through on the violence.
 It puts them in — he — puts them in paid jobs to change their
trajectory.  The program has reduced sh- — has reduced shootings by 40
percent.  
   
DeVone runs a program across California and six other states that enroll
high-risk individuals in peace fellowships, complete with intensive
mentoring and social services. It’s saving lives. In Sacramento, for
example, 91 percent of participants stayed away from gun violence.  
   
States and cities should invest the American Rescue Plan funds in those
kinds of anti-violent crime programs. And today, I’m announcing that the
White House will be working with 15 jurisdictions that are doing exactly
that — from Baltimore to Baton Rouge, and Memphis to Minneapolis — to
build up their community violence intervention programs, starting this
summer.  
   
And Mayor Steve Allender of Rapid City, South Dakota — a Republican and
a former chief of police himself — joined us today and will be a part of
this effort to help disrupt cycles of crime and violence in his
community and nearby Tribal communities.  
   
We need more mayors to follow and I’m going to be pushing to keep —
pushing for more of these proven programs, which are part of the
American Jobs Plan and my budget.  
   
Fifth, and I’ll close with this: We talked about the lives we lost —
have already been lost and the lives that we can save. We talked about
how much pain and loss so many people have experienced and so many
people have now accepted as their fate here in America.    
   
We have an opportunity to come together now — as Democrats and
Republicans, as fellow Americans — to fulfill the first responsibility
of government and our democracy: to keep each other safe. Enough.  
   
That means Congress passing sensible gun prevention, violence prevention
initiatives is warra- — is — makes sense: background checks, ban on
assault weapons, repeal of the liability shield for gun manufacturers.  
   
It means the Senate reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act — my
proudest legislative accomplishment — to close the so-called “boyfriend
loophole” — its “boyfriend and stalking loophole” — to keep guns out of
the hands of abusers. We added the provision saying, “If you have a
stay-away order — you are stalking someone and you’re told that has to
stop — you can’t own a weapon.”  
   
Every single month, an average of 57 women are shot and killed by an
intimate partner. We can help stop that.  
   
It means confirming my outstanding nominee for — to lead the AFT —
excuse me, the ATF: David Chipman. It’s been without a leader for a
while. The top job has been un- — unconfirmed for much too long. A
career and distinguished ATF official for 25 years, David is eminently
qualified for the job that we desperately need to fill.  
   
As Vice President, I pushed hard to lift the freeze on gun violence
research at the C- — the Center for Disease Control, the CDC. Guess
what? Why should they not be able to study gun violence and what causes
it? But there’s been a block on it. I want to unfreeze that.  
   
As President, my budget doubles funding for the gun violence research at
the CDC and the National Institutes of Health — the NIH — to study gun
violence as a public health threat that it is.  
   
And while we keep pushing there, Vice President Harris and I also — and
our entire administration are continuing to be — will continue taking
action where we can. Let’s stop the proliferation of ghost guns, as we
announced back in April with the Attorney General.  
   
We need to support the development of smart gun technologies. This
doesn’t affect responsible gun owners or Second Amendment rights. It
helps keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn’t have them in
the first place, from a child who accidentally picks up a — picks it up,
to a burglar or violent criminal trying to steal it and use it.  
   
And we need to keep building on the gun violence and crime-prevention
strategy we’re laying out today.  
   
Folks, this shouldn’t be a red or blue issue; it’s an American issue.
We’re not changing the Constitution; we’re enforcing it — being
reasonable. We’re taking on the bad actors doing bad and dangerous
things to our communities and to our country.  
   
Talk to most responsible gun owners and hunters. They’ll tell you
there’s no possible justification for having 100 rounds in a magazine of
a gun. Like I’ve said before: What do you think, the deer are wearing
Kevlar vests?  
   
Responsible gun owners will tell you that there are too many people
today who are able to buy a gun but shouldn’t be able to buy a gun.  
   
And these kinds of reasonable reforms have overwhelming support from the
American people, including gun owners.  
   
The bottom line is this: Let’s show the world and show ourselves that
democracy works and that we can come together as one nation. We can do
this and save lives.  
   
So, thank you. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops.  
   
And again, I thank you all for participating. But the bad news for you
all is, I’m coming back. I need your continued help. So, thank you very,
very much.  
   
And, General, thank you. Appreciate it.  
   
Q  Mr. President, are you still holding out hope that Congress can pass
another assault weapons ban?  
   
THE PRESIDENT: I never give up hope.  
   
Q  How do you feel about the bipartisan infrastructure deal that’s been
released?  
   
THE PRESIDENT: I’ll tell you that when I get the final numbers
tonight.  
   
Q  Mr. President, what do you feel is the most effective thing that
government can do to change the mindset of those who feel compelled to
pull the triggers of these guns?  
   
THE PRESIDENT: By being engaged in a whole range of programs. We talked
today — everything from mental health programs to engaging people early
on and letting them know there is other options. Making sure that when a
child is young, they have access to a real education, and they get
started off on the right foot.  
   
Making sure that when someone gets out of prison, they’re not denied
public housing, they don’t have to go back under the bridge where they
were living before — that they’re able to get help for healthcare, et
cetera, and reengaging them in the neighborhood, giving them some hope,
some opportunity. And in the meantime, making sure that those folks who
are taking advantage of them by taking advantage of their — their
situation are, in fact, held accountable.  
   
Thank you all so much.  
   
Q  Once you take care of the voting rights bill, do you think it’s time
to reform the filibuster?  
   
THE PRESIDENT: I think it’s time to pass the voting rights bill.
