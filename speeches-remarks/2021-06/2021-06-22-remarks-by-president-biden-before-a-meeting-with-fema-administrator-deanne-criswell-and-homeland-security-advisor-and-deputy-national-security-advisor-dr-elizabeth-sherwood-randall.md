THE PRESIDENT:  Well, our FEMA Director — Administrator is here today. 
We’re going to talk about was the sever- — severe weather patterns we’re
facing which keeps — likely increase every year.  And I want to make
sure that we’re in a position to be able to help Americans all across
the country and in all our jurisdictions as these severe weather
incidents increase.  
   
The last few days alone, we’ve seen droughts and wildfires in the West,
and we’ve seen tornadoes in Illinois, flooding in the South and the
Mid-Atlantic.  And extreme weather doesn’t confine itself, as you all
know, to state lines.  These crises require proactive federal
responses.  It’s just not just the states responding.   
   
And I know that — that your team, Administrator, is going to raise — be
faced with a lot of challenges this year, more than most.  And it’s not
that you’re not used to it, but it’s going to — this time, it’s the
whole country.  
   
And we’ve already stepped up this year to help vaccinate the American
people and respond to the (inaudible), but now we have to respond to
these brutal storms — and more severe storms and fires that extend into
longer seasons throughout the year.  And we’re going to bring every
resource to bear to be prepared to respond and to help people recover,
but it’s a big job.  
   
And we’re making sure FEMA and other frontline agencies have what they
need to continue getting the job done.  And I insist on being ready for
whatever comes our way.  That’s what this is all about.   
   
And that’s what we’re here today about.  And I’ll be hosting a meeting
next week with Western governors and FEMA and the Cabinet members to
prepare for heat, drought, and wildfires in the West.   
   
And so, I want to thank everybody for being here today.  And let me just
say one other thing.  You know, I was talking with my staff a moment ago
in the office about wildfires.  And — and, you know, the thing I know a
little bit about is the fire service.   
   
And there’s an old expression: God made man, and then he made a few
firefighters.  They are — they have the higher incidence of severe
injuries than police officers do.  They are incredibly, incredibly
brave, what they do: They run to the fire.   
   
And I just realized — I didn’t realize this, I have to admit — that
federal firefighters get paid $13 an hour.  That’s going to end in my
administration.  That’s a ridiculously low salary to pay federal
firefighters.  Not that many federal firefighters, but — and they — and
I know you use all the resources, including state and local
firefighters.   
   
But, any rate, that’s we’re going to talk about today.  And we’re going
to be brought up to date on what we can expect this season.   
   
And many of you have covered what’s already happened.  And the droughts
in the West is just astounding, when you take a look at it.  Fires have
already started, and flooding.   
   
So we’re in for a tough season, but I think we’ve got to be prepared and
have every resource available to make sure we’re there for the American
people.   
   
Thank you all so very much.  
   
Q    Mr. President, on voting rights, is this end?  Is it over?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
