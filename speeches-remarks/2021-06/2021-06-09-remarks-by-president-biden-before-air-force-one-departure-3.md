Watch out for the cicadas.  I just got one — it just got me.  
  
Q    What’s your main goal today when you get over there?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  Strengthening the alliance and make it clear to Putin
and to China that Europe and the United States are tight, and the G7 is
going to move.  
  
Q    Mr. President, do you expect to come out with a vaccine strategy
for the world?  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  I have one and I’ll be announcing it.  Thank you.  
  
Q    Do you expect that Putin will be able to work out any kind of
understanding with you on the cyberattacks?
