PRESIDENT BIDEN: Prime Minister, good to see you and have a chance to
offer my congratulations in person again, in front of everyone here.

And I think this meeting is an opportunity for us to reaffirm the
incredible and close relationship between Great Britain and the United
States. You are our closest ally and closest friend, and we appreciate
that.

We stand together with Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, and continue to
take issue with Russian behavior. And we’re going to continue to support
Ukraine and as long as Russia continues their aggression.

And this morning, we’ve already met with our fellow NATO and G7 leaders
to address Russia’s latest missile strikes against Kyiv and — and
western Ukraine. And it’s just — it’s merciless. And it’s — I think it
borders on — anyway, it’s — it’s way over the top what they’re doing.

And at a moment when world leaders here in Bali are seeking to make
progress on global peace, Spuki- — Putin is striking civilian targets
and children and women. I mean, it’s just — it’s almost — in my words,
not yours — barbaric, what he’s doing.

And Russia can and should stop the war. They’re able to do it. They
could stop it tomorrow if they wanted to.

But I’m glad we’re on the same page in terms of supporting the Ukrainian
people’s right to be free and — and — and free of all Russian forces in
their country.

So — but thank you. And I’m looking forward to our discussion.

PRIME MINISTER SUNAK: Well, President Biden, it’s a great honor to have
the opportunity to sit down with you. I think the partnership between
our countries is unique and enduring, and of course, it’s bigger than
any two individuals. But I’m proud to have stewardship of it at the
moment.

And as you said —

PRESIDENT BIDEN: I’m glad you are too.

PRIME MINISTER SUNAK: Yeah. Well, as you said, the United States is our
closest ally, biggest trading partner, closest security partner. And I’m
glad to see that partnership in action doing good, whether it’s standing
up to — and I agree with your words — barbaric activity by Russia in
Ukraine, but also tackling climate change, stabilizing the global
economy.

Our values are aligned, our interests are aligned, and there’s much good
that we can do working together.

I look forward to our discussion.

PRESIDENT BIDEN: I’m looking forward to it too.

Thank you all.

PRIME MINISTER SUNAK: Thank you.
