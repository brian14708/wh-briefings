THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Hey, everyone.  Listen, I wanted to join you just
to say thank you.  I see all these incredible leaders — I see all your
faces on the screen.  And I just want to thank you for everything that
you are doing.  You are turning folks out in Pennsylvania, in Georgia,
in Nevada, and Arizona. We got a day and a half to go, and I know we’re
going to see this through.  I know we’re going to get it done.  
   
And, you know, when I think about where we are right now, everything is
at stake.  And so many of you were the people who, because of your
leadership, because of your organizing, because of your work, were
responsible for Joe Biden becoming President of the United States and me
becoming Vice President of the United States.   
   
You guys did that work.  We know how to do it.  We know how to get it
done.  You all did the work of reminding people of what’s at stake and
reminding people of their power and the importance of not letting
anybody take your power from you.   
   
And that’s especially important now when we have these extremist
so-called leaders that have got this really absurd kind of definition of
what strength looks like.  Right?   
   
They think strength is based on who you beat down.  But we know that
strength is based on who you lift up.   
   
And that’s who you all stand for.  That’s who we, together, stand for. 
We stand for coalition building.  We stand for organizing.  We stand for
— for lifting up the power of the people through their voice.   
   
And so let’s just do it again — in 2020, in the height of a pandemic. 
And I don’t need to tell so many of the folks who are on this call what
that was.  Unite Here was, you know, right on the frontlines.  And in
the midst of all the burdens that people were going through in terms of
their personal life, in terms of their job — you organized.  And we had
one of the largest turnout ever in a presidential election.  The largest
number — a historically large number of young voters turned out.  
   
And the way I think about it is people stood in those lines, they took
the time to fill out those ballots, and they put in their order.  And
they said, “Look, we want our leaders and our government to deal with
issues like child poverty in America.”  And because people stood in
those lines, because they voted, we extended the Child Tax Credit so, in
the first year, we reduced child poverty in America by over 40
percent.  
   
People said, “Help take care of the fact that parents are trying to
parent kids, but it’s expensive and people need help.” And so we,
because they voted, passed a tax cut that gives people parenting
children up to $8,000 more in their pocket for the cost of food and
medicine and school supplies for their children.  
   
People put in their order and said, “Latinos are 70 percent more likely
to be diagnosed with diabetes.  Black Americans are 60 percent more
likely to be diagnosed with diabetes.  And the cost of insulin is too
high.  Too many of our seniors are making decisions about whether they
fill a prescription a doctor gave them to save their life, or be able to
pay their rent or buy food.”  And because people voted, we have now
capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month.   
   
These are the kinds of things that happen when the people exercise their
power through their vote at election time.  And I’m telling you all what
you already know.   
   
But, you know, we all know — all of us who’ve worked on these campaigns
year after year — when we ask people to vote, they’re going to ask us
why should they vote.  And the good thing is we got a lot of good
material.  
   
And so let’s get out there and remind them they are not alone.  There’s
so much about these past many months that have made people feel not only
tired, but, you know, feeling a bit alone.  
   
And part of the work that we do in organizing is to remind people that
they are not alone; they are part of a community, and we stand with
them, and we stand by them.  And there’s great power in that as well.  
   
So thank you all.  It’s going to be a long day and a half.  It’s going
to be well worth it.  And I do believe we’re going to see victory, but
it will not be easy.  But then it never has been in the fights that we
have always engaged in that has been about uplifting the people and
expanding rights.  It is never easy, and it is always worth it.  
   
So thank you, thank you, thank you, each and every one of you.  I thank
your families.  I thank all of the folks who are not having this time
with you because you’re out there fighting for our democracy.  Thank
you.  
   
PARTICIPANT:  Thank you, Vice President Harris, and to take your time
with us today.   
   
We had a couple additional canvassers who wanted to ask you some
questions.  So I wanted to kick it over to Nevada, where canvasser Brian
Villa del Vasquez (ph) has the first question.  
   
Hey, Brian.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Hey, Brian.  
      
MR. VASQUEZ:  Hey there. So my name is Brian Villa del Vasquez.  I’m a
(inaudible) bartender over at Aria Resorts and Casino.  I’m a
first-generation American, born to Mexican immigrants, so my family
can’t vote.  So when I vote, I’m the voice for my family.  
   
The reason I’m out here canvassing, knocking on doors — one of the
things I’m fighting for is housing and education.  You know, I want to
elect leaders who will keep on fighting for affordable housing and to
fund public schools.  
   
So, Madam Vice President, my question to you is: Republicans running
seem to have no real plans while the Biden and Harris administration is
working to continue lowering costs for working families.  Can you speak
on what the stakes are in this election?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  It’s great.  Well, first of all, thank you
for your leadership.  And the point that you’re making about housing is
such an important one.   
   
You know, the President appointed as the Secretary of HUD — Housing and
Urban Development — Marcia Fudge, who’s been doing some really
extraordinary work around affordable housing.  And — and so we can
follow up on that.  Let’s get past the election.  But it has been a real
priority.  It’s one of the biggest issues in our country right now.  And
we need to, frankly, give it a lot more attention.  
   
In terms of — you know, the thing about Republicans that we’ve been
seeing — the Republican Party — the Republican Party — is, you know,
they define their strength based on who they beat down.  I mean, look at
how — what we’ve been seeing in terms of the cruelty, you know, in terms
of the use of language and the — and the suggestions they’re making
about what’s important and what’s not; the efforts to divide our
country.  
   
And we as Democrats — you know, we stand for unifying.  We stand for
coalitions.  We stand for the belief that we all have more in common
than what separates us.  And we stand for democracy.  We stand for the
protection of rights.  We stand for the fact that the progress of our
country is based on an expansion of rights, not a restriction of rights,
which is what they’re doing on everything from a woman’s ability to make
decisions about her own body to voting rights and you name it.    
  
And — and so there is that, in terms of the difference.  There is the
fact that we stand for working people.  You know, the Child Tax Credit —
up to 40 percent of children in the first year, lifting out of poverty,
helping parents with the cost of raising their kids.  
  
What we have done in terms of the cost of insulin, what we have done to
take on the pharmaceutical companies because we agree that it’s been too
long that the pharmaceutical companies have been running the game and
jacking up prices for prescription drugs that make it almost
unaffordable for working people.  
  
And we’re finally — we had the ability, because everybody voted, to say,
“We’re going to let Medicare negotiate on behalf of 60 million people in
our country.”  And I don’t need to tell all of our labor leaders that —
the power of collective bargaining, right?  
  
So these are the kinds of things we do when we’re in power.  We focus on
fixing roads and bridges with the infrastructure law.  We — we focus on
getting lead out of pipes because too many of our children have been
drinking toxic water, which causes them to have asthma, much less — not
to mention what it does in terms of affecting their learning ability.  
  
This is the kind of work we do.  And meanwhile, they — you know, they —
they make jokes about people being hurt.  They — they — they vilify
people.  They try to marginalize people.  And, you know, so not only is
it a big difference in terms of the tone, but also just the vision and
also solutions.  
  
We’re providing solutions.  We have invested $370 billion in the climate
crisis, which has been — as Joe Biden says, “When he thinks climate, he
thinks jobs.”  It’s been about the creation of jobs, right?  
  
This is the kind of work we do.  And we just have to remind people
elections matter.  And especially in this election cycle, what you’re
seeing in terms of the programs, the policy, and the rhetoric from the
two parties, it couldn’t be more different in terms of a vision for
America.  So much at stake.  
  
PARTICIPANT:  Thank you.  And thank you, Brian.  And now I want to just
move around to Arizona and introduce canvasser Maggie Acosta.  
  
MS. ACOSTA:  Hi, I’m Maggie Acosta.  I’m a cancer survivor and a proud
member of UNITE HERE Local 11 in Arizona.  I remember speaking to you in
2020 and sharing with you how the pandemic nearly killed my son.  
  
I remember you tell — you told me that real leadership is not about
leading when life is easy or convenient, and about your plan to get the
pandemic under control.  
  
What you told me in 2020 really moved me, and I still carry that message
when I’m canvassing.  I talked to many young woman voters and canvassers
over the several months who are devastated by the loss of rights under
Roe vs. Wade.  And Arizona is a state where women will lose the right to
choose depending on who becomes governor in a few days.  
  
My question to you is: What would you say to those young women to
inspire them to keep fighting?   
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  It’s good to see you again.  How are
you doing?  
   
MS. ACOSTA:  I am doing well, thank you.   
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, good.  You look strong.  Thank you.  Thank
you.  
   
What I’d say to them is, look, there has been — nothing we have achieved
as a nation has been without a good fight.  (Laughs.)  Any progress that
we’ve had has been because we organized, because we march, because we
speak up and talk about what we believe gets us to the ideals of our
country.  And that includes the fact that our progress has, in large
part, been defined by the progress we have made in terms of an expansion
of rights, not a restriction of rights.   
  
When the Court just did what I did in the Dobbs decision –- think about
this –- it literally took a constitutional right, that had been
recognized, from the people of America, from the women of America.  And
I think it’s important to note one does not have to abandon their faith
or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her
what to do with her body.    
   
And so, it’s time for everyone to stand up and — and also recognize
Clarence Thomas — Justice Clarence Thomas, on the Court, took — he said
the quiet part out loud.  He said, in that decision, at risk now is your
right to access contraception, your right to marry the person you love.
   
   
I had my team look at from which states are we seeing attacks on women’s
reproductive care and seeing attacks on voting rights and attacks on
LGBTQ rights.  And you would not be surprised to know that there was an
overlap.  Right?    
So, let’s see what’s at play here.  There is an, I think, a real effort
by some to be on the path of restricting hard-fought rights in a way
that, frankly, is going to harm our country and certainly harm our
democracy.  And so, this is a time for all good people to stand and know
their power.   
   
And to these young women you speak of, I say: Know your power.  So many
of our movements that have been about progress have been led by young
leaders, and we need them now.  We need them to lead.  
   
PARTICIPANT:  Thank you.  Thank you.  Those are great words, I think, to
send us off our — our young people.   
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Maggie.  Thank you again.   
   
PARTICIPANT:  Yeah.  We need them to lead, and we need them to lead in
the economic fight that we are out here swinging on every day.  It was
great to hear you talk about all of the different ways that the
Democrats and the administration are out there swinging.    
   
I mean, people like to pretend that this economic crisis somehow started
now.  You inherited this crisis, and you’re out there fighting it.  And
we’re out there on the doors telling people every day, “This is the team
you want at your back to protect our democracy, protect our rights, and
fight for the economic future that we all deserve.”
