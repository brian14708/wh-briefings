PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Prime Minister Kishida, President Yoon, it’s great to
see you both again.  And, Mr. President, I first want to express our
deepest condolences to you and the people of Korea for the tragedy in
Seoul two weeks ago.  We grieve and stand with you and — and the many
families who lost loved ones.  
   
Japan and the Republic of Korea are both critical allies of the United
States.  And for years, our countries have been engaged in a trilateral
cooperation out of a shared concern for the — for the nuclear and
missile threats North Korea poses to — to our people.  And North Korea
continues provocation — provocative behavior.  This partnership is even
more important than it’s ever been.  
   
We’re also deepening our cooperation and collaboration on a range of
other challenges.  Today, we’ll discuss how we can strengthen our supply
chains and economic resilience, and how we can preserve peace and
stability across the Taiwan Straits, and how we can expand our
coordinated support for Ukraine, and how we can work toward the common
goals of a free and open Indo-Pacific.  
   
And we face real challenges, but our countries are more aligned than
ever, more prepared to take on those challenges than ever.  
   
So, I look forward to deepening the bonds of cooperation between our
three countries and thank both of you for your friendship as well as
your partnership.  
   
And I yield the floor to Prime Minister Kishida.  
   
PRIME MINISTER KISHIDA:  (As interpreted.)  Again, from myself,
President Yoon, I would also like to once again extend my deep
condolences to the victims of the painful incident that occurred at
Itaewon.  
   
Now North Korea’s provocations, unprecedented both in their frequency
and their manner, continue.  And we assume that there could be more
coming.   
   
So, it is extremely, truly timely that the Japan-U.S.-ROK trilateral
summit is being held at such a juncture.  And I truly hope that our
trilateral cooperation will be cemented further as we counter such
challenges resolutely.  
   
Thank you.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you.  President Yoon.  
   
PRESIDENT YOON:  (As interpreted.)  Following our encounters in New York
last September, I am delighted to meet with President Biden and Prime
Minister Kishida once again.  
   
In a tragic incident that occurred recently, the lives of two Americans
and two Japanese were lost, for which I am deeply saddened and
heartbroken.  
   
For the victims of the Itaewon incident, you have given us warm words of
condolences.  And I thank you very much.  
   
This Korea-U.S.-Japan summit is being held again in five months at a
very timely moment indeed.  The current developments on the Korean
Peninsula and in the region and beyond require the strongest level of
our trilateral coordination.  
   
Notably, North Korea, emboldened by its nuclear and missile
capabilities, is attempting even more hostile and aggressive
provocations.  
   
Since I took office in May, North Korea has launched some 50 missiles to
date.  And from the end of October to early November, its missile-firing
was intensive — one of which flew over the eastern part of the Northern
Limit Line and landed in our territorial waters.  First time this has
ever happened since the division of the Peninsula — an extremely serious
provocation indeed.  
   
At a time when South Koreans are grieving in deep sorrow, North Korea
pushed ahead with its — with such provocations, which lays bare the Kim
Jong Un regime’s true inclinations that completely go against
humanitarianism and humanism.  
   
In safeguarding universal values and attaining peace and stability on
the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia, our trilateral coordination
remains a strong bulwark.  
   
Through this meeting today, I hope we will step up cooperation among our
three nations.  
   
Thank you.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, the trilateral cooperation is extreme, it’s
extensive, and it’s real.  And it’s not going to — it’s going to be
sustained.  
   
(Addressing the press.)  And if you all can leave without hurting one
another, it’d be a nice thing to see.
