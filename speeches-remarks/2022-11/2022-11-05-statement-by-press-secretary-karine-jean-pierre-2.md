President Biden knows that the men and women of coal country built this
nation:  they powered its steel mills and factories, kept its homes and
schools and offices warm.  They made this the most productive and
powerful nation on Earth.  He came to the White House to end years of
big words but little action to help the coal-producing parts of our
country.  Working closely with Senator Manchin, a tireless advocate for
his state and the hard-working men and women who live there, President
Biden has helped get this part of the country back to work:  the
unemployment rate in West Virginia was 6.2% the last month before Joe
Biden took office; now it is down to 4%.  The President’s plans are
already bringing new energy and manufacturing jobs to the region, and in
the years ahead, will continue to create new jobs with projects like
hydrogen energy generation.  In fact, through the Working Group on Coal
and Power Plant Communities, President Biden has already delivered more
than $23 billion to energy communities across the country.    
   
The President’s remarks yesterday have been twisted to suggest a meaning
that was not intended; he regrets it if anyone hearing these remarks
took offense.  The President was commenting on a fact of economics and
technology:  as it has been from its earliest days as an energy
superpower, America is once again in the midst of an energy transition. 
Our goal as a nation is to combat climate change and increase our energy
security by producing clean and efficient American energy.  Under
President Biden, oil and natural gas production has increased, and we
are on track to hit the highest production in our country’s history next
year.  He is determined to make sure that this transition helps all
Americans in all parts of the country, with more jobs and better
opportunities; it’s a commitment he has advanced since Day One.  No one
will be left behind.
