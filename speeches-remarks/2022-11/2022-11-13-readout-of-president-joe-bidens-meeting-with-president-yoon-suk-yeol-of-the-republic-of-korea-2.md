President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with Republic of Korea (ROK)
President Yoon Suk Yeol in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The two leaders
condemned the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s (DPRK)
destabilizing and threatening actions in recent weeks, including
military operations near the border area and the launch of an
intercontinental ballistic missile, and discussed our joint efforts to
limit the DPRK’s ability to fund and advance its unlawful weapons of
mass destruction and ballistic missile programs. During the meeting,
President Biden reaffirmed the U.S. extended deterrence commitment to
the ROK using the full range of U.S. defense capabilities, including
nuclear, conventional, and missile defense capabilities and emphasized
the U.S. commitment to identify additional steps to further reinforce
deterrence in the face of DPRK nuclear threats.

President Biden and President Yoon also discussed U.S. and ROK efforts
to provide humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and hold Russia
accountable for its unprovoked and brutal war against its neighbor.
President Biden welcomed President Yoon’s announcement of the ROK’s new
Indo-Pacific Strategy and the two leaders discussed the importance of
strengthening cooperation throughout the region, including with ASEAN
partners and Pacific Island nations.  President Biden laid out the
ambitious U.S. agenda to combat the climate crisis through historic
investments in green technology facilitated by the Inflation Reduction
Act and the two discussed the important role US and ROK companies will
play to meet our shared climate goals.
