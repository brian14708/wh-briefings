South Lawn

(November 7, 2022)

THE PRESIDENT:  Don’t forget to vote.

Q    How are you feeling about tomorrow, sir?

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’m feeling — I’m optimistic.  But I’m always
optimistic.

Q    Can Democrats win the House?

THE PRESIDENT:  I think it’s going to be tough, but I think we can.  I
think we’ll win the Senate, and I think the House is tougher.

Q    What do you think awaits you if it is a Republican-controlled
Congress?

THE PRESIDENT:  What do I think what?

Q    Awaits you.  What’s — what’s your new reality going to be like in
Washington?

THE PRESIDENT:  More difficult.

END
