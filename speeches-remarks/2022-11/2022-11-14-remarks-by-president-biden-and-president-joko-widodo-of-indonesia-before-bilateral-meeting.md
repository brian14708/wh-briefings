PRESIDENT WIDODO:  (As interpreted.)  President Biden, welcome to Bali. 
Welcome to Indonesia.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you.  
   
PRESIDENT WIDODO:  (As interpreted.)  I really appreciate the presence
of President Biden at this G20 Summit.  And, once again, I really
appreciate your presence here.  And tomorrow, we will discuss and start
the G20 Summit.  And I hope that the G20 Summit will be able to produce
complete cooperation that will help global economic recovery.  
   
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, as I told you, Mr. President, I don’t think I’m
going home.  (Laughter.)  (Inaudible) you had me staying on the beach. 
I — I don’t know.  (Laughter.)  
   
It’s great to see you again, Jokowi.  This is a — you’ve been a good
friend.  I was happy to welcome you, back in May, at the White House. 
And I want to thank you for your hospitality and your support of this
G20.  You’ve done a wonderful job thus far.  
   
Indonesia is a vibrant and critical, critical partner.  As two of the
largest democracies in the world, we’re working together to preserve the
rule-based system and international order, and to uphold human rights.  
   
And together, we’re pursuing a better future.  We’ve finalized a new
partnership, through the Millennium Challenge Corporation, to invest
nearly $700 million in developing high-quality transportation and
infrastructure here in Indonesia.  
   
And tomorrow, we’ll unveil a transformative new partnership to support
Indonesia’s clean energy transition.  
   
And finally, we’ve collaborated to protect our people, including
improving our ability to fight infectious disease with the launch of a
historic pandemic fund.  
   
And, Mr. President, I look forward to discussing all of this with you
today.  And thank you again, Mr. President, for your hospitality and all
you’ve done.  It’s good to see you.  It’s good to be here.
