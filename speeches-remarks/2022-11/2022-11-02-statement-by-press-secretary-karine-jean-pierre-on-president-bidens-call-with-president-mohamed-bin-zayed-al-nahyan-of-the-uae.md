President Joe Biden today spoke with His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin
Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the United Arab Emirates, to celebrate the
landmark clean energy cooperation framework both countries signed on
November 1 in Abu Dhabi.  The U.S.-UAE “Partnership for Accelerating
Clean Energy” (PACE) will help spur $100 billion in financing and other
support to generate 100 new gigawatts of clean energy in order to
accelerate the global clean energy transition.  President Biden thanked
President bin Zayed for his leadership on climate issues, and pledged
his support for the UAE’s hosting of the 28th session of the Conference
of the Parties (COP-28) in 2023.  Together, the United States and the
UAE will cooperate on a range of clean energy initiatives, including
carbon and methane management, civil nuclear energy, and decarbonizing
the industrial and transport sectors.  The two leaders also underscored
the importance of further deepening the U.S.-UAE strategic relationship.
