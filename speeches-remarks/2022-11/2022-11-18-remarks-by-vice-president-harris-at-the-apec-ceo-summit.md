*Bangkok, Thailand**

  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Please have a seat.  Good
afternoon.  I know we’ve been a bit delayed arriving, but thank you all
very much.  And I know that it’s been a productive day.  And I want to
—  
   
(Loud sound of dishes clanking.)  (Laughter.)  That’s either auspicious
or it’s not.  (Laughter.)  Is everyone okay?  Yeah?  Okay.  
   
Well, thank you all for the warm welcome.  And to the government of
Thailand, thank you for hosting us and for the exceptional leadership
that you have provided during your APEC host year.  
   
This is my third trip to the Indo-Pacific since taking office as Vice
President.  Last year, I traveled to Singapore and Vietnam.  In
September, I was in Japan and South Korea.  And these trips are in
recognition of the critical importance of Southeast Asia and the broader
Indo-Pacific to America’s security and prosperity.  
   
Throughout these visits, I’ve made clear the United States is a proud
Pacific power, and we have a vital interest in promoting a region that
is open, interconnected, prosperous, secure, and resilient.  
   
In the newly — in the nearly two years since President Joe Biden and I
took office, we have strengthened our alliances and partnerships
throughout the Indo-Pacific.  We have reinforced our defense and
deterrence commitments, as well as our security presence — a
longstanding security presence that has enabled the region to develop
and prosper for more than 70 years.  
   
The Biden-Harris administration has also joined with allies and partners
to uphold international rules and norms.  And, importantly, our
administration has made significant progress on an ambitious and
affirmative economic agenda for the region, one that has already
delivered results for individuals, for communities, and for entire
economies.  
   
Our message is clear: The United States has an enduring economic
commitment to the Indo-Pacific, one that is measured not in years, but
in decades and generations.  And there is no better economic partner for
this region than the United States of America.   
   
The Biden-Harris administration has proved this again and again, through
our actions, our investments, and the principles that we stand for each
and every day.  
   
Under our administration, the United States is more engaged with the
Indo-Pacific than we have ever been as a nation.  We have infused new
energy and leadership into our unrivaled network of global alliances and
partnerships.  
   
Under President Biden, we have seen an unprecedented expansion of ties
between the United States and ASEAN, hundreds of millions of dollars in
assistance and new initiatives across three leader summits, including
last week in Cambodia.  In the Pacific Islands, we have committed to
provide nearly a billion dollars in assistance.   
   
We expanded our presence on the ground and elevated our engagement to
the leader level.  I participated in the Pacific Islands Forum in July
of this year, and President Biden convened Pacific leaders in
Washington, D.C., for a first-of-its-kind summit in September.  
   
Our engagement in the Indo-Pacific also includes newer configurations,
such as the Quad.  Together, Quad members pledged $5.2 billion to COVAX
and donated 265 million COVID vaccines to the Indo-Pacific, which helped
save lives, keep businesses running, and recover faster from the
pandemic.  
   
Throughout these partnerships, we are bringing significant resources to
the table in areas such as electric vehicles, infrastructure, education,
and entrepreneurship.  And last year in Singapore, I announced the
United States’ offer to host APEC in 2023.   
   
During our host year, we will build on the strong foundation Thailand
has set for sustainable economic growth.  And to that end, we look
forward to partnering with all of you here throughout the next several
months.  
   
In a further demonstration of our enduring commitment and economic
commitment, the Biden-Harris administration is pioneering new models of
economic cooperation that will strengthen our economic footprint in the
long term.   
Together with Australia and Japan, we are financing new telecom networks
in the Pacific.  And we are working to mobilize $2 billion in financing
under the Southeast Asia Smart Power Program to decarbonize power and
those systems throughout the region.  
  
I believe the private sector will play a vital role in all of this.  In
order to bridge the infrastructure gap in the Indo-Pacific, we need your
expertise.  We need to work with you and the capital that you bring
forward in these projects.  And we need your innovation, especially when
it comes to clean energy and digital infrastructure.  
  
Simply put, governments cannot do this alone.  And in recognition of the
impact on global companies and economies, the Biden-Harris
administration is building resilient supply chains.  We are working
through IPEF, the Quad, and bilateral relationships, including a
significant supply chain agreement reached with Thailand just a few
months ago.  
  
In the last year, I have convened business leaders in Singapore, in
Tokyo, and the United States to advance our work on supply chains.  And
I know you all agree: The public and private sectors must work
hand-in-hand on this together.  
    
And the impact is clear.  In collaboration with businesses, our
administration is leading work across the region to develop early
warning systems and diversify suppliers.  
  
As a strong partner to the economies and companies of the Indo-Pacific,
America’s approach to these relationships is based on collaboration,
sustainability, transparency, and fairness.   
  
Through all of our efforts, we will continue to uphold and to strengthen
international economic rules and norms that protect a free market and
create predictability and stability, which, of course, is essential to
protect companies from arbitrary interference, protect nations from
economic coercion, and protect workers’ rights.  
  
In addition, we stand against market distortions and unfair competitive
advantages.  And we prioritize inclusivity.  
   
We also know that economies will reach their full potential when all
segments of a society can fully participate.  
   
The United States adheres to these values and these principles not only
because we believe it is the right thing to do, but because it makes
economic sense.   
   
In addition, regarding the climate crisis, an existential crisis for us
all, the United States is doing our part and leading with action.   
   
Our administration recently made the largest climate investment in our
history through the Inflation Reduction Act.  More than $370 billion to
invest in electric vehicles, battery supply chains, and solar, wind, and
hydrogen power.  This puts the United States on a direct path to reduce
our emissions by at least 50 percent by 2030 and net zero by 2050.  
   
We have committed to increase climate finance to more than $11 billion
annually and are investing billions of dollars to help communities adapt
to a warming planet globally.   
   
As we act to avert this threat and protect our planet, we will also
drive economic growth.  
   
As we accelerate the transition to clean energy, we will create new
jobs, spur innovation, and unlock new industries.  
   
So let me be clear on another point: America is a strong partner to the
economies and the companies of this region because America is and will
remain a major engine of global growth reinforced by our
administration’s approach, which has been record job creation, a
revitalized manufacturing sector, a booming clean energy sector,
resilient consumer spending, an unprecedented small-business
creation.   
   
We have enacted historic legislation, the CHIPS and Science Act, which
will strengthen global supply chains and spur innovation around the
world, and the Inflation Reduction Act with its clean energy investment,
which will help bring down the costs of energy globally.  
   
And we believe that when we prosper at home, the entire Indo-Pacific
region benefits.  In fact, nearly 30 percent of our exports go to the
Indo-Pacific, and American companies currently invest around a trillion
dollars a year in this region.  
   
So, supported by that track record, we will continue to work with our
partners in this region to increase foreign direct investment, to
increase the free flow of capital, and to increase the already high
level of goods and services that flow between the United States and the
Indo-Pacific.  
   
As a member of the Indo-Pacific, America has a profound stake in the
future of this region.  Commerce between the United States and the
Indo-Pacific supports millions of American jobs.  We have then a shared
commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.  And the United States has
historic bonds and common values with the nations and the people of this
region.  
   
All of this to say: The United States is here to stay.   
   
Strengthening our economic relationships in this region and partnering
with the private sector is a top priority for the United States and a
bipartisan one.  
   
As we go forward together, the companies and economies in this region
will find a United States that brings immense opportunities for growth,
a United States that will uphold the rules of the road, and a United
States that will help build prosperity for everyone.  
   
Thank you all.  (Applause.)
