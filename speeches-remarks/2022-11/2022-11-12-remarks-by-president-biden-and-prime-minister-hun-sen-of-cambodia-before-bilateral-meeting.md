PRIME MINISTER HUN SEN:  (No translation provided.)  
  
PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Well, Mr. Prime Minister, you came a long way to the
United States, and you chaired a very important meeting and made a
significant impression on the centrality of ASEAN to the United States
and to all our colleagues.  
  
We have — we have a long agenda today, I know — and I’m anxious to get
to it — but from pandemic recovery to tackling the rising energy prices
and food insecurity.  
  
But I also want to thank you for Cambodia’s clear condemnation of
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and for your leadership of ASEAN during
what had to be one of the most difficult years.  So, thank you for
that.  
  
And as I said last year in our <s>viral</s> \[virtual\] summit, and
again in May, the United States is committed to ASEAN centrality.  We
are committed to that.  
  
We remain committed to seeing the return of democracy in Myanmar and
working with the ASEAN to ensure implementation of the Five-Point
Consensus that is out there.   
  
We got a lot of work to do, but I’m looking forward to a productive
U.S.-ASEAN Summit and delivering on our shared vision of peace for all
of our people.  And I look forward to the meeting.  Thank you again for
your hospitality.
