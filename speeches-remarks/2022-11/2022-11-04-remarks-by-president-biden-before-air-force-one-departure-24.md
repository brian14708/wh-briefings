THE PRESIDENT:  I know you always asked me, “How are we doing?”  We’re
going to win this time around, I think.  I feel really good about our
chances.  I haven’t been in all the House races, but I think we’re going
to keep the Senate and pick up a seat.  I think we have a chance to win
in the House.  I don’t think we’re going — not “win,” keeping the
House.   
   
So, I’m optimistic.  I really am.   
   
And I find that, you know, most of the debate that occurs in the places
I visit — I know you don’t think it, but I think we have pretty good
crowds.  They’re fairly enthusiastic.  You don’t write it that way, but
they are.  
   
And I find that — that the thing that gives me the most confidence is
the fact that the policies we’ve initiated, people care about.  Now,
they want more.  They write to me, but I don’t know anybody who’s really
opposed to us bringing down medical prices and prescription drugs and
all those other things.  
   
So — so I feel optimistic.  
   
And you can smile.  I’m okay.  All right?  
   
Q    Mr. President, could I just ask you one quick question?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  No.  
   
Q    You said that you were going to meet with the oil companies.   
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I —  
   
Q    When is that going to happen?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Well I — nothing is set up.
