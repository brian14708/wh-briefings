  Cooperation"
---
 
Vice President Kamala Harris and President Emmanuel Macron of France met
today at the headquarters of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) in Washington, D.C. as part of the State Visit, to
highlight the strong U.S.-France partnership in outer space.   
   
This meeting builds on their November 2021 meeting in Paris where they
agreed to strengthen space cooperation across all sectors.  Since that
meeting, France has signed the Artemis Accords to guide civil use of
space, the United States has joined the Space for Climate Observatory
(SCO) to develop accessible tools for climate monitoring and adaptation,
and the United States and France held the first Comprehensive Dialogue
on Space to discuss cooperation on civil, commercial, and national
security space initiatives.  France announced yesterday the same
commitment that the Vice President announced in April 2022 not to
conduct destructive, direct-ascent anti-satellite missile testing.   
   
The Vice President and President Macron agreed to strengthen U.S.-France
space cooperation across civil, commercial, and national security
sectors. They received a briefing from French and U.S. experts on
climate science, and discussed how to better utilize space data to
address the climate crisis.  They also discussed expanded participation
of the United States in SCO, and the upcoming launch of the U.S.-France
Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission that will make the first-ever
global survey of Earth’s surface water and comprehensively track changes
over time.  
   
The Vice President and President Macron also discussed space exploration
with U.S. and French astronauts, including the continued importance of a
crewed presence in low Earth orbit, including International Space
Station operations, and the continued strengthening of joint investments
in the exploration of the Moon and Mars.
