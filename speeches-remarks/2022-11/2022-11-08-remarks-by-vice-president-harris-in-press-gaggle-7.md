*John O’ Groats Restaurant  
Los Angeles, California*

Q    Madam Vice President, what’s your message to the people of
California and L.A. today?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  We, as Californians, always are engaged.  And let’s
be engaged again today.  Today is Election Day.  There is so much on the
ballot.  Let’s vote for Karen Bass for mayor.  Let’s restore our
democracy.  Proposition 1 is very important.  We need to restore the
rights of women to make decisions about their own body, not having their
government tell them what to do.  So let’s put that into law so it can’t
be manipulated.   
   
But there’s so much at stake.  And one of the most important expressions
of love of country is to vote and to participate as part of our civic
duty and our responsibility — our individual responsibility to uphold
our democracy.  And one of the great ways we do that is by getting out
to vote.  
   
Q    And what does it mean for you to have the Vice President here with
you of all days on Election Day?   
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  I told her it means the world to me to be here. 
The message that that sends — that the way we are going to solve our
problems in L.A. is to make sure that all levels of government are
aligned.  And how more aligned could we be than to have the Vice
President of the United States here?   
   
Q    Madam Vice President, if Republicans take control over Congress,
how do you plan to work with them to advance your agenda and to make
sure that your priorities are still achieved?  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’m working that that doesn’t happen.  
   
REPRESENTATIVE BASS:  Thank you.  
   
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  So today is still Election Day.   
   
                               END
