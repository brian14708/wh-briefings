Central New Mexico Community College  
Albuquerque, New Mexico

   
1:55 P.M. MDT  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)  
   
MS. SANCHEZ:  Thank you for this opportunity.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.   
   
Please, have a seat.  Thank you.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  
   
Well, hello, New Mexico.  
   
AUDIENCE:  Hello!  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Kristi, thanks for that introduction.  
   
And, you know, my wife’s a full-time community college professor still —
a teacher.  (Applause.)  And matter of fact, she’s teaching today.  And,
you know, the average age of her students at Northern Virginia Community
College — before that, she spoke — she’s taught at the Delaware
community college system — is just 29 years of age.  An awful lot of
people going back just knowing what they have to do and having a shot.  
   
And I want to thank you, Madam President, for hosting us here at your
college.  It’s very gracious of you.   
   
And, by the way, in case you haven’t noticed, you probably have — if not
the best, one of the best governors in the United States of America. 
(Applause.)  
   
We’ve worked, as they say, hand in glove, because we agree on so
much.   
   
And, Senator Ben Ray Luján, so much of the progress we’ve made has been
because of you, man.  (Applause.)  You’re a great champion of the people
of this state.   
   
And — and I want to say, Teresa, you’re — you’re good.  (Laughter.)  I
tell you what, man, I could listen to you all day.  I was — seriously,
you’re really, really, really good.  And we’re in your district. 
Right?  Or are we just —  
   
REPRESENTATIVE LEGER FERNÁNDEZ:  In Melanie’s.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Oh — well, okay.  (Laughter.)  Well — (laughs) — well, I
— I want to tell you, the district we’re in is pretty good, too. 
(Laughter.)  I — and I can tell you, you lack enthusiasm, Congresswoman.
(Laughter.)  And it’s really — it’s contagious.  You know, New Mexico is
lucky to have you.  For real.  
   
And the thing I — I really — well, I shouldn’t go on.  I’m — but, you
know, there’s enthusiasm.  It’s one thing to be for something, another
thing to be — be a champion of it.   
   
And, you know, Melanie, you’re — you’re filling big shoes taking over
for Secretary Hele- — Haaland, who rode down from Washington with me. 
She never lets me come to New Mexico unless she can oversee it. 
(Laughter.)   
   
And — but she’s doing an incredible job as our Secretary of the
Interior, the first Native American to ever serve in the Cabinet. 
(Applause.)   
   
And, Mayor Keller, thanks for the passport into town.  Appreciate it
very, very much.   
   
Look, folks, here in New Mexico — I want to thank the governor for
making it possible for students across the state to go to college for
free.   
   
And it’s been — it’s been, as I said, working hand in glove.  I mean,
there’s a lot of ways the federal government can be helpful and a lot of
ways it can be a pain in the neck.  And I try to get the pain in the
neck out of the process.   
   
But, you know, we’ve lowered costs for families.  It’s no surprise that
New Mexico is seeing one of the fastest — I think either one or two —
fastest-growing increase in college enrollment in this state — in their
state, than anywhere in the country.  And the other one is New
Hampshire.  
   
And so, I want — understand why this is important.  It’s important
because her leadership is an example for states all across the country. 
A lot of governors look and say, “How did you do that?  What did you…” 
You know, there’s a lot of ways to do it.  And you know we talked about
them.  And you — you did it.  
   
We’re here today to talk about a key part of what’s — what we’re doing
nationwide: student debt relief for millions of working- and
middle-class Americans still recovering from the economic crisis caused
by the pandemic.  
   
When I announced I was going to run for the presidency this time, I made
it clear that I had three goals.  The first and most important goal was
to give middle-class families and working-class families a fighting
chance.  They’d been on the short end of the stick for a long time,
across the board — across the board.   
   
And that’s why I said, whether it’s the tax policy or whether it’s
education policy — whatever it is — when the middle class has a — you’re
going to build this economy from the middle out and the bottom up.  That
way, the folks are — who are on bottom part of the scale have a shot,
the middle class gets to grow, the wealthy still do very well.  There’s
never been a time when the middle class or working class were doing well
and the wealthy haven’t done very well.  
   
And the way I think about it is the way my dad talked about it and the
way so many of you at home talk about it around the kitchen table.  How
much are your monthly bills?  And at the end of the month, do you have
enough to pay for those bills?  And what’s left over, if anything? 
There’s enough — is there enough for just a little bit of breathing
room?  As my dad used to say, just a little bit of breathing room.  
   
Folks in urban and suburban and rural and Tribal communities across the
country, our student loan program is designed to give just a little more
breathing room.  A little breathing room.  
   
You know, my administration is working to provide up to $10,000 in
student debt relief and up to $20,000 if the person seeking the relief
received a Pell Grant.  If you receive a Pell Grant, your family income
had to be very low.  And so, you have to make under $125,000 now to get
that relief.  
   
And for borrowers out of school, nearly 90 percent of that relief is
going to go to people who have incomes under $75,000.  
   
And, you know, it’s a plan for people who took out federal loans before
July of this year.  
   
And a few weeks ago, we launched a simple online application where you
can apply for this debt relief.  Folks, just go to StudentAid.gov.  Fill
out your name, your Social Security number, your date of birth, and
contact information.  
   
No forms to upload.  No special log-in to remember.  It’s available in
English and Spanish.  It’s on desktop and mobile.  It takes less than
five minutes to do it.  And if you need additional information, we’ll
follow up with you.  
   
This is a game changer for so many people.  We’re hearing from people
all over the country about how easy it is to apply.  Close to 26 million
Americans have already applied, already given us the information to be
consider — so that they consider lifechanging for their — for their
families and for them.    
   
My commitment when I ran for President was, as I said, I would — the
government would work to deliver for ordinary people.  A simple
application process keeps that commitment that way, just as I’m keeping
my commitment to relieve student debt.  
   
And I want to state again who will benefit most: working people and
middle-class folks.  If you earn under $125,000 a year, you’ll get up to
$10,000 knocked off your student debt.   
   
If you earn under $125,000, you’ll receive a Pell — and you received a
Pell Grant, you’ll get another $10,000.  That’s $20,000 in relief.   
   
Over 200,000 people in New Mexico have student loans, and the average
borrower in New Mexico owes just over $34,000.  
   
And my plan is going to make a real difference in lowering the monthly
costs for families as well.  (Applause.)   
   
Folks, in total, more than 40 million Americans stand to benefit from
this relief.  And not a dime of it will go to the top 5 percent of
incomes.  Period.  
   
Across America, nearly every Pell Grant recipient comes from a family
making under 60 grand.  Two thirds come from families making under
$30,000 a year.  
   
In New Mexico, more than 150,000 borrowers received Pell Grants to go to
college.  That’s 150,000 New Mexicans who will get $20,000 of their
loans wiped off immediately, plain and simple.  And it matters. 
(Applause.)   
   
Folks, as I’ve pointed out, my wife has been a community college
professor for years, and she’s still teaching.  As a matter of fact,
she’s teaching today before she goes off to see me and to campaign for
us.  She’s traveled across the country meeting students from every walk
of life.  
   
She’s worked — some — some of the students she meets work two or three
jobs while going to school, putting dinner on the table, helping their
kids with their homework, staying up late to do their own homework.  
   
And as Jill says, they only ask for one thing in return: the chance —
the chance to work hard and build a good life for themselves and their
families.  
   
Many of those students, just like the students here, have had to borrow
money to cover the cost of tuition.  Roughly 40 percent of community
college students nationwide received a Pell Grant.  
   
And I’m here today to tell you this student loan relief plan is for them
as they recover the ec- — from the economic crisis the pandemic
inflicted and pay for their education.  
   
It’s for folks like Kristi, who you just heard from earlier.  She went
back to school to get a better job, take care of her family, so she can
compete in today’s economy.  She relied on student loans and a Pell
Grant, and did it while st- — starting a family.  
   
Under our plan, she’ll have nearly all of her loan forgiven.  And it
really matters.  
   
By the end of this week, the Department of Education will have approved
the applications of 16 million Americans and sent the necessary
paperwork to student loan servicers in the last step before 16 million
Americans’ can have their loans discharged.  
   
That’s 16 million people who will be hearing from the Department of
Education that they’ve been approved and who should be seeing relief in
the coming days.  
   
But it’s temporarily on hold.  Why?  Well, because Republican members of
the Congress and Republican governors are doing everything they can,
including taking us to court, to deny the relief and even to their own
constituents.  And every lawyer tells me we’re — there — we knocked two
of them out of the way.  There’s only one thing left in the way — and
that it’s going to happen.   
   
As soon as I announced my administration’s plan for student debt, they
started attacking it, even though I ran on it and everybody knew what I
was going to do.  The out- — their outrage is just simply wrong.  And I
might add, very — I don’t want to be too political here — but
hypocritical.  
   
We’re fighting them in court.  We’re not letting them get away with it. 
I’m never going to apologize for helping working- and middle-class
families as they recover from the economic crisis created by a
pandemic.  And I don’t want — (applause).  
   
And there’s an awful lot of mainstream Republicans who — which they
didn’t vote for it, but who I know support it.  But they’re a little
apprehensive about their situation in their party.   
   
I don’t want to hear it from MAGA Republican officials who sit in
Congress and who had hundreds of thousands of dollars — in one case, a
million — over a million dollars in pandemic relief loans forgiven.   
   
You know all those folks who had businesses hurt by the pandemic?  Well,
we stepped in and we helped.  Well, those loans are being forgiven.  One
of them — one of the congressman received $2 million in forgiveness
loan.   
   
Another one, who you know, she’s — very well.  She speaks a lot about
this.  Marjorie Taylor Greene and her husband — they got over $180,000
in business loans forgiven.  And she said — but she said, quote, it’s
“completely unfair” for us to forgive student loans for working- and
middle-class Americans.   
   
Representative Vern Buchanan of Florida said our plan was “reckless.” 
He got forgiven $2.3 million.  You can’t make this stuff up. 
(Laughter.)  
   
Republican governors wrote me a letter saying that the relief only helps
the “elite few.”  You all know you’re “elite”?  It’s nice to know that. 
I knew you were elite.  (Laughter.)  The “elite few.”   
   
Ted Cruz, the senator from Texas, said, you’re a bunch of “slackers.” 
He says it’s for “slackers” who don’t deserve relief.  Who in God’s name
do these guys think they are?    
   
And, folks, despite what Republican officials say, we can afford this
student loan program.  And it’s because of our historic deficit
reduction.  
   
If we can hold for a second here: You know, when I came to office, I
received and I got an enormous debt passed on to me: a $2 trillion tax
cut, not a penny of which was paid for, and over 98 percent of it went
to the top 1, 2 percent of the public.  And guess what?  They raised the
deficit.   
   
But guess what?  Because of our historic — we had a very different
(inaudible) — a very different reduction for all Republicans who voted
against this.  And they opposed the Inflation Reduction Act.  Every
single one voted against it, even though some I know were for it. 
Everyone voted for it — against it.  
   
And this year, under the leadership of the Democrats in Congress and a
little help from me, the deficit fell $1.4 trillion.  (Applause.) 
Trillion.  The largest one-year drop in the history of the United States
of America.  
   
And we cut the federal deficit in half this year.  We cut it in half. 
(Applause.)   
   
And this follows last year’s historic drop in the deficit of $350
billion reduced last year.   
   
And we’re going to further reduce the debt over the next decade by
another $250 billion.  (Applause.)  
   
But, folks, that’s not all.  We’re relieving student debt, but we’re
also resuming student loan payments that are paused during the
pandemic.  But come January, folks whose debt isn’t fully canceled —
because of the thirty thou- — up to thirty — $20,000 they can receive —
are going to start paying their student loans again.  But guess what? 
That means billions of dollars a year are going to start coming back
into the United States Treasury.  
   
But my administration has a plan — the economically responsible course —
to ensure the smooth transition to repayment and \[prevent\] unnecessary
defaults.  And so we’re focused on going after the fraudsters, the
borrower — the — who call borrowers and pretend they’re from the
government to help them with your loans.  If you get any questionable
calls — any of them — please tell us by going to ReportFraud.FTC.gov  
   
Look, folks, my message to fraudsters looking to cheat the American
people: Don’t.  We’re going to get you.  We’ll hold you responsible. 
(Applause.)   
   
Look, but here’s the other thing.  My administration is taking
additional steps to make education a ticket to the middle class and
folks can actually afford.   
   
For example, we’re fixing what was called — and it wasn’t very well
administered — the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.  The idea
was if you can use your education to do — go to public service, you can,
over 10 years, have it totally forgiven if you do.  And if — the program
forgives students’ loans to encourage those students to go into public
service, to go into public school teaching, become police officers, work
at local charities, members of the military, the National Guard.  
   
Since I’ve been in office, more than 250,000 teachers — 235,000, to be
precise — nurses, police officers have been — have been able to get over
$14 billion in loan forgiveness, because we’re using them to encourage
them to go into this — into these works which we need.  
   
We’re also proposing changes to what’s called income-driven repayment
plans to make it simple and fair.  No one with an undergraduate loan
today or in the future, whether from a community college or a four-year
college, will have to pay more than 5 percent of their discretionary
income to repay their loan, no matter how long it takes.  That’s income
after you pay for necessities like housing, food, and the like.  Only
after that, 5 percent of the disposable income.  You’re currently paying
10 percent.  We’re cutting in that in half, to five.  
   
And if you’ve still got loans left over after making your payments for
20 years, your debt will be completely wiped out.  And I know that
sounds strange for the students here, but a lot of people who are my
generation and a little bit later also have debt still.   
   
My son, Beau Biden, who was the attorney general of the state of
Delaware, passed away — after a year in Iraq living next to a burn bit —
of glioblastoma.  He went to two universities.  He went the University
of Pennsylvania and Syracuse Law School.  He ended up with a debt,
because I had the dubious distinction of being listed as the “poorest
man in Congress.”  (Laughter.)   
   
I shouldn’t say this, but I’m going to tell you anyway.  I got a call
when — you know, when I’d be away campaigning for somebody, I’d call my
wife in the morning before she took off to school, see how things were. 
And I called her one morning, and I was up in — up in the state of
Vermont campaigning for Pat Leahy.  And I said, “Hi, honey.  How are
you?”  She said, “Fine.”  Well, you know that’s a good start. 
(Laughter.)   
   
And she said, “Did you read today’s paper?”  True story.  “Did you read
today’s paper?” — meaning the local Wilmington paper — Wilmington,
Delaware.  I said, “No, honey.  I didn’t see it.”  She said, “Headline,
front page, top of the fold: ‘Biden: Poorest Man in Congress.’  Is that
true?”  (Laughter.)  Well, I didn’t think you were supposed to make
money when you’re in Congress.  But at any rate — (applause).  And I
didn’t feel poor.  
   
No, no — and, by the way, I got elected when I was 29.  I had no
income.  I mean, I had a little.  I was just starting my law practice. 
And — and so — but I had a good salary as a senator.  I thought that was
just fine.  
   
But at any rate, you know, those who borrow the original balance of less
than $12,000, like community college students, you — you’re going to be
done paying that in 10 years if you go into the position of making sure
you’re involved in public service.      
   
And these — these changes are going to save more than $1,000 a year on
average.  It’s a gamechanger.  
   
Let me close with this message to young people about this nation.  I’ve
always believed your generation, the 18- to 30-year generation,
represents the best-educated, most-talented, least-prejudiced, most
generatio- — most generous generation in our history.  And I really mean
that.  It is.  That’s why I’m so optimistic about the future.   
   
And that today we face an inflection point, one of those moments that
only come around every few generations where there is so much change
happening technologically, politically, environmentally that the decades
and the decisions we make now are going to affect the future for a
decade or more to come.  It’s going to — it’s going to set the course.  
   
You know, I know your generation may feel like it’s an added burden on
top of what you’ve already been through; I’m not saying you have to
shoulder the burden alone.  The task at hand, though, and the task ahead
is the work of all of us.  What I am saying is you represent the best of
us — the very best of us.  And your generation is not going to be
ignored.  You will not be shunned.  You will not be silenced.  Just look
at what happens when you speak out.  
   
Two years ago, perhaps many of you voted for your first election or
volunteered in your first election.  You understood the choice and the
stakes.  Because you expressed your right to vote and elected me
President and Kamala Vice President — the highest-ranking woman ever to
be elected in history — since then, with your help and the help of your
Democratic — the Democratic members of Congress here in New Mexico,
we’ve delivered enormous progress for the nation.  
   
People are still hurting with inflation.  We have the most significant
gun safety law in nearly 30 years.  We’re going to — and, by the way, I
told the Gov I got assault weapons banned once in Congress; we’re going
to do it again.  (Applause.)   
   
We passed the most significant infrastructure law in 70 years.  The only
thing bigger was Eisenhower’s Highway Trust program.   
   
The first Black woman on the Supreme Court of the United States has been
appointed.  I promised.  (Applause.)   
   
I’ve appointed more appellate federal judges who are women and African
American than every other President in history combined.  (Applause.)   
   
And the most significant commitment to climate change we’ve ever engaged
in.  And if anybody ever doubted climate change, come to Mexico the last
two years — New Mexico the last two years.  You see what’s happening.   
   
So I’m keeping my promise that no one should be in jail merely for
possessing marijuana, by the way.  Just for possession.  Nobody should
be in jail.  Those records should be expunged.  (Applause.)   
   
And let me close with this.  I know it’s been a rough few years for
hardworking Americans.  A lot of families, things are still really
tough.  But there are bright spots where America is reasserting
itself.   
   
I look around at all of you, and I’ve — I’ve never been, as I said, more
optimistic.  You know, we’ve created 700,000 manufacturing jobs in
America since we came to office.  Seven hundred thousand.  We have
invested in new technologies.  We invented the computer chip.  We’re
investing, literally, hundreds — 200 trillion — $200 billion, and it’s
going to grow, and making sure we produce these — these chips that are
smaller than the tip of your finger.  But they — they run everything
from automobiles to your home appliances, to your wi- — across the
board.  
   
So, we — we’re making real progress.  And, by the way, a lot of it is
just going to kick in beginning in January because we passed this
profound legislation on — whether it’s dealing with the environment or
dealing —  
   
I mean, for example, it’s estimated that what we did under the envi- —
we passed legislation providing $368 billion in help to deal with global
warming.  Well, guess what?  It’s estimated that that’s going to save
just — what’s available to people for their homes to deal with
weatherizing their homes, solar panel — a whole range of things.  It’s
estimated it’s going to save the average family in America at least $500
a year.  And it’s going to save the environment.  
   
Look, I guess the point I want to make, and then I’ll stop: Our best
days are really ahead of us.  We just have to remember who in God’s name
we are.  We’re the United States of America.  (Applause.)  There’s
nothing — nothing, nothing beyond our capacity.  And I mean it.  We got
to remember who we are.  
   
I spent more time with Xi Jinping of China than any world leader has —
when I was Vice President and when I was out of the office for four
years when I was a professor, and then, now, as President.  Sixty-eight
hours, in terms of on the telephone or in person with him.   
   
And he asked me when we were on the Tibetan Plateau, when I traveled
17-, 18,000 miles with him.  He said to me — he said, “Can you define
America for me?”  I said, “Yes, in one word and please always remember. 
One word: possibilities.”  (Applause.)   
   
We’re the only nation in the world who believes anything is possible. 
And it is.   
   
So, God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops.  Thank you,
thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)
