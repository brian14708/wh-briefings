*Arlington, Virginia**

11:51 A.M. EST  

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  Good morning.  To Secretary Denis
McDonough, I thank you for the work that you have been doing so
tirelessly.  It is noble and important work.   
   
First Lady Dr. Jill Biden, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, Secretary Lloyd
Austin, and members of our Cabinet, General Mark Milley and service
chiefs, leaders and members of veteran service organizations, and all of
the distinguished guests: Good morning, and thank you.  
   
And in particular to our veterans, service members, families,
caregivers, and survivors, it is a profound privilege to thank and honor
you today and every day.  
   
So we gather to pay homage to all those who have served our nation in
uniform at home and overseas, in times of war and in times of peace. 
Generations of veterans defended our country and our most sacred
values.  
   
From the fields of Yorktown to the trenches of the Marne, from the
beaches of Normandy to the banks of the Chosin Reservoir and the streets
of Saigon, from Baghdad to Fallujah to Kandahar, you stood as one to
protect our democracy and our freedom.  
   
And even when you returned home and took off your uniform, you continued
to serve and to lead in communities across our country.  
  
Veterans, after all, are nurses and firefighters, Little League coaches
and small-business owners, faith leaders and elected officials, mentors
and teachers.  
   
Every day, through your life’s work and your example, you make America
stronger.  (Applause.)   
   
And on Veterans Day, we come together as a nation, then, to express our
profound gratitude for all you have done and for all you continue to
do.  
  
Here on hallowed ground, we also remember those who gave their lives for
our nation.  We remember our service members who have not yet returned
and their families.  And we reaffirm our commitment to bring home all
those missing in action.  
   
Veterans represent the best of America: unwavering courage, unmatched
talent, and unshakable devotion.  
  
You come from every corner of our country.  And out of many, you become
one — the greatest fighting force in the world.  (Applause.)   
   
As Vice President — at the DMZ in Korea, aboard ships  
in the Indo-Pacific, at SOCOM and CENTCOM in Florida, and on NATO’s
eastern flank — I have seen firsthand how America’s armed forces protect
the highest ideals of our nation around the world.  
   
Since 1789, American service members have sworn an oath not to a person,
not to a party, but to the Constitution of the United States to support
and defend the principles of liberty, equality, and justice; to preserve
and protect our democracy.  
   
Veterans, you’re the one who answered the call.  And in so doing, you
left, often, the people you love and the place you call home.  You
missed birthdays, holidays, and graduations.  Some of you first met your
newborn baby on a video chat.  You risked everything and you gave up so
much to safeguard the lives and the liberty of people who you may never
meet.  
   
To be a veteran is to have truly known the true cost of freedom and to
have borne it for all of us.  
   
That is a debt that must always be remembered.  And I believe it is a
debt we must all work to repay.  (Applause.)   
   
Back when I was attorney general of California and then as a United
States senator, we fought to protect the health and wellbeing of our
veterans and service members.  And as Vice President, I am proud to
serve alongside one of the greatest \[sic\] — greatest — greatest
champions of our nation’s warriors, our President, Joe Biden. 
(Applause.)   
   
President Biden and I believe that, as Americans, we have a sacred
obligation to take care of our veterans and our military families.   
Fulfilling that obligation means making sure veterans can access the
support and the resources they need to thrive.  For example, it has
meant connecting thousands of veterans with job training to help them
leverage the skills and experience they gained while serving, to build a
new career and to strengthen America’s workforce.  
  
Fulfilling that obligation also means taking on veteran homelessness. 
This year alone, we have placed 31,000 veterans in permanent housing,
and we are on track to house thousands more by year end.   (Applause.)  
  
Taking care of our veterans also means taking care of those who love
them, because while our veterans wore the uniform, they were not the
only ones who served.  And no one understands that better than Dr. Jill
Biden.  
  
Through her leadership of Joining Forces, Dr. Biden fights for military
families, caregivers, and survivors.  And, Dr. Biden, our nation
applauds your extraordinary work. (Applause.)   
  
And taking care of our veterans means making sure that they receive the
benefits they have rightfully earned.  
  
Since we took office, we have worked to reduce the VA claims backlog by
upgrading technology, hiring more claims processors, and streamlining
evaluations.  And as a result, this year, and under the leadership of
the Secretary, we processed more VA claims than ever before in history. 
(Applause.)   
  
And we also came together, Democrats and Republicans, to support
millions of veterans exposed to toxic substances while working and
living near burn pits and other dangerous environments.  
  
The PACT Act, as has been mentioned, is the most significant expansion
of healthcare and benefits for veterans and their survivors in three
decades.  And it was passed because of the leadership of our President
and because of the leadership of so many of you.  And we are indebted to
you for that hard work and success.  (Applause.)  
  
So, a few months ago, I received a letter from Lieutenant Travis Akers. 
So, Lieutenant Akers wrote about a friend and a fellow sailor,
Lieutenant Chris Reed.  
  
Lieutenant Reed served our nation in Afghanistan and Iraq, and he worked
as a Navy EOD officer near a burn pit.  Tragically, Lieutenant Reed
passed away in 2018 from leukemia.  He is buried here in Arlington,
Section 60, Plot 11854.  
  
Lieutenant Akers fought for the PACT Act in his friend’s memory.  He
advocated.  He testified.  And thanks to him and so many veterans like
him, our nation is one step closer to living up to our highest ideals.  
  
So all of that to say America is a promise — a promise of security,
opportunity, and freedom — not for some, but for all.  
  
On Veterans Day, we celebrate the generations of Americans who fought to
make that promise real.  And we recognize, to truly honor our veterans,
we must come together as a nation to defend that promise too.  
  
So, on that point, I will conclude by sharing the words of Private First
Class Abe Lurie, one of the many veterans joining us today.
 (Applause.)  There you are.   
  
So, Abe served our nation in World War Two.  He was a member of the 58th
QM Sales Company of the United States Army.  
  
From 1943 to 1946, Abe traveled across England, France, and Belgium,
going from camp to camp to outfit the men and women fighting to free
Europe and the world.  
  
In his travels, Abe met thousands of Americans.  They came from towns
and cities he had never heard of.  And yet, as he tells it, even if they
only crossed paths for a moment, Abe felt a connection with each.  
  
And he said — and I’m quoting you, Abe — he said, “In the service, we
were one people.”  One people.  (Applause.)  
  
*E pluribus unum*.  Out of many, one.  
  
And that is the story of our armed forces.  And it is the story of our
nation.  
  
That is who we are.  That is who we must be.   
  
One nation united for liberty, united for equality, united for
democracy.  
  
One nation united to preserve and strengthen the freedoms our veterans
gave so much to defend.  
  
May God bless you.  And may God bless the United States of America.
 (Applause.)
