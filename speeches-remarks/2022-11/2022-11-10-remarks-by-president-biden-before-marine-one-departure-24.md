Q    Mr. President, do you think that your conversations with the
Chinese President will be productive?

THE PRESIDENT:  I always think my conversations are productive.

Anyway —

Q    Are you hopeful that the conflict will be resolved with Russia and
Ukraine, sir?

THE PRESIDENT:  Look, I don’t think the conflict will be resolved with
Russia and Ukraine until Ukraine gets out of — until Putin gets out of
Ukraine.

Anyway, you guys, I’m heading down to — first of all, going to Cairo for
the – for the environmental effort, then heading over to Colombia and
then — I mean, Cambodia.  I was thinking — I’m thinking the Western
Hemisphere.  And then off to Indonesia.  So there will be a lot to talk
about.

Q    Kevin McCarthy says you congratulated him, when you spoke with him,
on winning the majority.  Is that true?

THE PRESIDENT:  No, I congratulated him — I said, “And if you win the
majority, congratulations.  But congratulations — so far, you’ve made
some gains.”

Q    And, sir, do you plan to go and campaign in Georgia for the runoff
election?

THE PRESIDENT:  I plan on doing whatever he wants me to do for him.

Q    Can you keep the House, Mr. President?

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you know, it’s still alive.  It’s still alive. 
It’s like drawing an inside straight.  But it’s still alive.

Q    When are you meeting with the Brazilian president, Mr. President? 
When are you meeting the new Brazilian President, the next president —
Lula?  When is that happening?

THE PRESIDENT:  I — we don’t have a date yet.   
   
Thank you.

Q    You said yesterday that the Constitution (inaudible) involved with
whether former President Trump could run.  Did you mean that he might
not be able to run because of the 14th Amendment?

THE PRESIDENT:  No, no, I said respecting the institutions matter.  And
one of the things I know you all kind of dismissed in my talking about
whether or not we had, in America, a land that was consistent with our
institutions, and I talked about whether or not there was going to be
any shenanigans in the way in which we did our elections.  And I notice
all you are talking about it now.  Welcome aboard.
