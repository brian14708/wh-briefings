*Puerto Princesa, Philippines*

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Good afternoon. Thank
you, Mr. Undersecretary, for the warm welcome. It is truly great to be
here with all of you — local elected officials, distinguished guests,
and community leaders.  And it is an honor to be with members of the
Philippine Coast Guard.   
   
The United States is proud of our longstanding ties with the people of
the Philippines. I am here in Palawan to underscore the importance of
our partnership in order to create economic opportunities, protect
coastal ecosystems, maintain peace and stability, and uphold
international rules and norms here in the South China Sea and around the
world.   
   
To uphold international rules and norms is to support the lives and the
livelihoods of people throughout the region.   
   
Earlier today, I heard from local officials in Tagburos about the
generations of families that have fished these waters.   
   
The fisheries of Palawan not only provide food for residents, but serve
as the economic lifeblood of this island.   
   
I met fishers who go out every day and sustainably catch mackerel and
tuna.  I spoke with a young woman — her name is Jacqueline — who runs a
fish-drying business, a business that has been so successful that she
has taught other women how to dry rabbitfish so that they can too
participate in a vital industry and benefit from extra income.  
   
Community leaders are also working to help residents adapt to warming
waters and extreme weather.   
   
The stories I have heard make clear this community has come together to
sustainably manage natural resources.    
   
Despite many challenges, I saw the strength and the resilience of the
Palawan community.    
   
However, the vitality of communities like this is at risk.  Communities
like this have seen the consequences, and people here know the impacts,
when foreign vessels enter Philippine waters and illegally deplete the
fishing stock; when they harass and intimidate local fishers; when they
pollute the ocean and destroy the marine ecosystem.   
   
Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing — also called IUU — is far
too common across the world’s oceans. It presents a direct threat to
coastal ecosystems and economies  
   
To help address these maritime issues, the United States is proud to
have a strong partnership with the Philippines, which includes the
training recently conducted on this very ship with the Philippine Coast
Guard and U.S. service members.   
   
And today I am pleased to announce additional areas of cooperation.  
   
The United States will provide new funding to Philippine maritime law
enforcement agencies to increase their capacity to counter IUU fishing,
to enhance monitoring systems, and to upgrade equipment.   
   
This will all build upon new initiatives I launched in May at the
U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit in Washington, D.C., to provide more training,
assets, and personnel to build maritime law enforcement capabilities
across Southeast Asia.   
   
In addition, we have increased efforts to provide countries in the
region with a wider and more accurate picture of their territorial
waters.   
   
In May, in Tokyo, alongside the leaders of Australia, Japan, and India,
President Joe Biden launched the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime
Domain Awareness.  This initiative uses space-based platforms to deliver
a common operating picture of Indo-Pacific waterways and to promote
transparency so that our allies and partners can better protect
vulnerable fisheries, respond to humanitarian disasters, and detect and
counter illicit activities.   
   
I am pleased to report that the Philippines is already receiving this
stream of data alongside other partners here in Southeast Asia.  And we
plan to increase this work in the coming months to include launching new
satellites into orbit in December to expand this program.  
   
Through USAID, we are also launching a new partnership with local
communities here in Palawan to promote sustainable fishing, strengthen
food security, and conserve marine ecosystems.  
   
So this is how I see it: To protect the economic vitality of these
communities, to protect the ecosystems they rely on, and to protect
lives and livelihoods, we must uphold international rules and norms.
 And that is why our work here is so very important.   
   
We must stand up for principles such as respect for sovereignty and
territorial integrity, unimpeded lawful commerce, the peaceful
resolution of disputes, and the freedom of navigation and overflight in
the South China Sea and throughout the Indo-Pacific.    
   
To the Philippine Coast Guard, you are on the frontlines of standing up
for the international rules-based order.   
   
Each and every day, as you patrol these waters, you uphold the rules and
norms that are vital to the prosperity of the Filipino people and people
around the world.   
   
The United States and the broader international community have a
profound stake in the future of this region. America’s prosperity relies
on the billions of dollars that flow through these waters every day.
 And we are proud to work with you in your mission.   
   
 As an ally, the United States stands with the Philippines in the face
of intimidation and coercion in the South China Sea.   
   
As the United States has long made clear, we support the 2016 ruling of
the U.N. arbitral tribunal, which delivered a unanimous and final
decision firmly rejecting China’s expansive South China Sea maritime
claims.  The tribunal’s decision is legally binding and must be
respected.   
   
We will continue to rally our allies and partners against unlawful and
irresponsible behavior.  
   
When the international rules-based order is threatened somewhere, it is
threatened everywhere.   
   
So the rules and norms that I have discussed today, they matter to the
United States, to the Philippines, and to communities around the
world.   
   
So to all of you here today, I say: The United States-Philippines
alliance is strong.  We are committed to you.  We are committed to your
success and to all the lives and livelihoods that rely on your work.   
   
Thank you.  (Applause.)   
   
END
