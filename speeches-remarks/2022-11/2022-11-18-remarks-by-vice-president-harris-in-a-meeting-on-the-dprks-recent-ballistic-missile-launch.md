  \ Missile\_Launch"

*Queen Sirikit National Convention Center  
*Bangkok, Thailand**

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, good afternoon, everyone.  I have asked this
group of allies and partners to come together to join us in condemning
North Korea’s long-range ballistic missile launch this morning.  And
I’ve also asked them to join so that we, as allies and partners, can
consult on next steps.   
   
This conduct by North Korea most recently is a brazen violation of
multiple U.N. Security resolutions.  It destabilizes security in the
region and unnecessarily raises tensions.  
   
We strongly condemn these actions, and we again call for North Korea to
stop further unlawful, destabilizing acts.  
   
On behalf of the United States, I reaffirm our ironclad commitment to
our Indo-Pacific alliances.   
   
Together, the countries represented here will continue to urge North
Korea to commit to serious and sustained diplomacy.   
   
I want to thank these leaders for ongoing discussions in this regard and
on so many other very important topics.  And I thank you for joining us
today.  
   
And with that, Prime Minister Kishida, please.  
   
                               END
