East Room, The White House

12:49 P.M. EST  
   
THE FIRST LADY:  Hi, everybody.  Oh, I just want them to play longer,
don’t you?  (Laughter.)  It sounds beautiful.  Thank you!  (Addresses
Marine Corps band.)  
   
So, thank you.  And, gosh, over the last two years, I’ve traveled to
almost 40 states, to rural counties and to big cities.  And again and
again, the Americans I’ve met have shown me the soul of our nation:   
   
The optimism that glowed on the faces of future teachers in Tennessee,
who dreamed of changing the world one student at a time.   
   
The hope of the gospel songs that washed over me like healing water in a
South Carolina church.   
   
The gratitude of each new American citizen I watched recite the oath in
a naturalization ceremony in California.   
   
The empathy of the nurse navigator I met in Florida, who understood that
no one should have to go through cancer care alone.   
   
The resolve of the survivors of loss, whose love for each other is the
only thing strong enough to overcome their grief and their pain.      
   
And the pride I saw in military bases across this country — loved ones
and family members who put their shoulders back and their chins up
through every single deployment.    
   
I’ve seen it everywhere I’ve gone: When our country comes together, we
are stronger.  What we share is so much greater than the things that
pull us apart.  
   
The soul of our nation is and always has been “We the People.”  And that
is — (applause) — yes.  (Laughs.)  And that is what has inspired this
year’s White House holiday decorations.   
   
The values that unite us can be found all around you: a belief in
possibility and optimism and unity.  Room by room, we represent what
brings us together during the holidays and throughout the year.    
   
The Gold Star trees honor and remember those who laid down their lives
for our country and the families who carry on their legacies.   
   
In the Library, we celebrate how the stories we share bring us closer to
each other, our history, and the world around us.   
   
In the Vermeil Room, we honor how the smallest acts of kindness and
appreciation really do matter.  
   
In the China Room, we remember family traditions passed down at dinner
tables full of laughter.  
   
In the East Room, where we are right now, we highlight the national
treasures that belong to all of us: the National Parks and the communion
we find in nature.  So you can see them on all the mirrors if you look
around you.  All the National Parks are celebrated.   
   
And in the Green Room, bells of all kinds remind us of the healing and
unifying power of music.  
   
In the Red Room, we know that in times of both joy and grief, faith can
light the way.  
   
And in the State Dining Room, we honor the promise of the next
generation and see the holidays through the eyes of children.  
   
And in the Blue Room, the official birds of all 57 states and
territories, and of our nation’s capital, are woven together to
transform the 18-foot Christmas Tree into a stunning symbol of unity.
 Wasn’t that tree, like, so magnificent?  (Applause.)      
   
Throughout these halls, from the shining bells to the mirrored ornaments
in the Grand Foyer behind me, you will see your own reflection and a
reminder that — a request to see yourself in this house.   
   
And we are grateful to be able to welcome Americans home.    
   
Earlier today, I had the opportunity to meet with National Guard
families from more than 30 states and territories as part of my White
House initiative to support military families, and it’s called Joining
Forces.  
   
We wanted them to be a part of this special day because they represent —
you all represent the heart of our communities: men and women who choose
to serve even as they pursue other careers, who answer the call of duty
in our hometowns as quickly as disasters strike and needs arise.   
   
Though our nation res- — relies on their courage, the service of our
Guardsmen and women, and of their families, often goes unseen,
especially children of the National Guard members.  This morning, these
incredible kids told me their stories, and we heard of how we can better
support them.  All of us have a role to play.  It starts by recognizing
their service and letting them know that they are not alone.   
   
As a fellow National Guard mom and a grandmom, I wanted to welcome the
National Guard families to help us open this holiday season as my
honored guests.  Your service is the embodiment of “We the People.”    
   
So to all the National Guard families, please wave so that we can
applaud you.  So, please wave.  Tell us who are you.  (Applause.)  I see
that little hand back there waving.  (Laughter.)      
   
And now, to the volunteers who brought this holiday vision to life: All
of this would not be possible without your hard work.  You gave up time
with your family this holiday weekend, and many of you traveled from far
away to be here.  And you’ve worked long hours in service of this gift.
   
   
Now, some of you may still have a little glue gun residue on your
fingers — (laughter) — or sore backs from hanging up all that snow in
the Colonnade.  And yesterday, you might have thought, “If I have to tie
just one more bow, I’m out of here!”  (Laughter.)  Am I right?  I’m sure
some of you had a — a couple of those thoughts.  (Audience member
claps.)  Yes, especially in the back there.  (Laughter.)   
   
But I also hope you’ve made some lifelong friends and felt the unique
joy that only comes from the chaos of the holidays.  
   
And so, with all my heart, thank you for everything that you’ve done.   
   
And I have a few other thank-yous that are close to my heart: the State
Teachers of the Year from across the country who worked with their
students to send in self-portraits to be featured in ornaments on the
Christmas trees in our “We the Children” room.  (Applause.)  So, to
those teachers and students, who are all likely in their classrooms
right now, thank you for being part of our holiday season.    
   
And to another teacher who is here, Daria Peoples.  Where is Daria?  Oh,
there you are!  Daria — Daria, come on up.  And how ironic is it that
her last name is “Peoples” for “We the People”?  (Laughter.)  I mean,
that was just — happened.    
   
So, Daria is an elementary school art teacher and children’s book author
from Las Vegas, Nevada, and she illustrated the two thou- — 2022 White
House Holiday Guide.  (Applause.)  I was so glad to feature a teacher as
our holiday illustrator of the year.  (Applause.)     
   
We may celebrate different holidays, we may sing different songs or say
different prayers, but our shared American values endure season after
season.  May the promise of “We the People” light our path forward into
the new year and bring us together always.    
   
Merry Christmas and happy holidays.     
   
God bless you.  God bless our troops and their families.  Thank you all.
 Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you for being here.
