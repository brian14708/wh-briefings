11:26 A.M. EST  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, Brookland Middle School!  (Applause.)   
   
Well, good morning, everyone.  I’m sorry, there’s a tradition around
where I come from in the state of Delaware.  When there’s a governor in
the room, you got to stand up.  And I — your governor is here, and I
wanted to say hi to him.  So, thank you, Governor, for being here.  
   
It’s a wonderful Thanksgiving tradition here at the White House. 
There’s a lot to say about it, but it’s chilly outside, so I’m going to
keep this short.  Nobody likes it when their turkey gets cold. 
(Laughter.)  I don’t know if they’re mad yet or not.  
   
But at any rate, I want to thank Ronnie Parker, chairman of the National
Turkey Federation, and his family from Monroe, North Carolina.  Ronnie
has got 44 years in the turkey business, and he also is the grower of
our honored guests today.   
   
And Lexie — he got a lot of help from Lexie, a fourth-generation member
of the ranch where the turkeys were raised and prepared for this very
day.  They don’t know what the ve- — they’re not sure of the verdict
yet, but we’re going to find out in a minute.  
   
They listened to a lot of music, I’m told, in order to prepare for the
crowd noise today.  That’s pretty — that’s real hard work.  And they
interacted with the children to show their softer side.  Sounds like
another flock hoping to come to Washington in 2024.  (Laughter.)  
   
But, look, we’re joined by another special guest, and that is — for what
is the largest National Turkey Presentation ever held at the White
House.  My dear friends, I’m going to introduce them again, Roy Cooper
and First Lady Kristin Cooper are here.  Truly fantastic leaders.  Say
hi.  (Applause.)  
   
We’re also joined by Congressman Dan Bishop.  Where are you, Danny? 
There — Dan, welcome.  Great to see you here.  Thank you.  And — from
the 9th District of North Carolina.  
   
And a special thanks to members of my staff for their — and their young
children who are here today as well.  As a matter of fact, if you look —
you see that dog up in the balcony there?  That German Shepherd.  That’s
my dog, Commander.  I was worried if he came down here with all of you,
he’d just do nothing but kiss you and lick you.  But he may go after the
turkeys, so I kept him up there.  (Laughter.)  
   
But — we’re joined by another group of kids — as I said, the — from —
students from Brookland Middle School.  The reason — they’re here in
Washington.  The reason they’re joining us today is, you know, they were
invited a couple years ago to come and — but because of COVID, we
couldn’t have it.  So, I’m glad you guys came this year.  Thank you
very, very much for coming.  (Applause.)  
   
And we’re also joined by students from the 4-H programs of Virginia and
Maryland, and the folks from the National Future Farmers of America.  I
want to thank them for being here as well.  
   
But before I gobble up too much time — (Commander barks).  (Turkeys
gobble.)  (Laughter.)  I didn’t mean to get started, man.  Don’t start
on them.  (Laughter.)  
   
And by the way, that’s my grandson, Beau, up there and my
granddaughter.  Don’t let him jump.  (Laughter.)  
   
At any rate, you know, le- — we got to get on with this.  First of all,
the votes are in.  They’ve been counted and verified.  There’s no ballot
stuffing.  There’s no fowl play.  (Laughter.)  The only red wave this
season is going to be a German Shepherd, Commander — knocks over the
cranberry sauce on our table.  (Applause.)  That will cause —  
   
They are big turkeys, aren’t they?  
   
My fellow Americans, please welcome the 2022 National Thanksgiving
Turkeys, Chocolate and Chip.  (Applause.)  I tell you what, man.  
   
They can go wherever they want.  (Laughter.)  
   
Of course, Chocolate is my favorite — Chocolate is my favorite ice
cream, so I — but I could’ve — we could’ve named them CHIPS and Science,
but — anyway.  (Laughter.)  It would have been good names as well.  
   
But Chocolate <s>chip</s> weighs 46 pounds.  And I’m told he loves
catching the sun on the Outer Banks.  And Chip weighs 47, and he loves
barbeque and basketball, I’m told.  (Laughter.)  
   
After receiving their presidential pardons today, Chocolate and Chip are
going to head to the nation’s great basketball schools and research
universities: North Carolina State.   
   
Now, when we told them they were joining the Wolfpack, they got a little
scared.  (Laughter.)  But then we explained it was just a mascot for the
school.  It has one of the nation’s best poultry science departments in
the country.  
   
And now, based on their temperament and commitment to being productive
members of society, I hereby pardon — I hereby par- — (turkey gobbles). 
Yes.  (Laughter.)  I hereby pardon Chocolate and Chip.   
   
Which one is Chocolate?  And who’s Chip?  (Laughter.)  
   
MS. STARNES:  This is Chocolate.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  This is Cho- — Chocolate, you’re pardoned.  And so are
you, Chip.  
   
Chip says, “I know.  I — I don’t even have to be told.”  
   
AIDE:  Ronnie, why don’t we put them on the table?  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Can we do that?  If you can do that — Ronnie, that’s a
big bird, man.  (Laughter.)  
   
We have more chickens than anybody in the nation in Delaware, but we
don’t have turkeys.   
   
Look at this.  God love you.  Now, this is Chocolate, right?  
   
MR. PARKER:  It is.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Chocolate, you are pardoned.  You are pardoned.  He
said, “You had to tell me that?”  (Applause.)  Yeah.  Yeah, you are. 
Yeah.  I’m serious.   
   
He said, “I don’t know, man.  You didn’t have to pardon me.  I knew I
was pardoned.”  (Laughter.)  
   
At any rate, thank you both very, very much.  
   
MR. PARKER:  Thank you.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Appreciate it.  
   
MR. PARKER:  Appreciate you.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  How many turkeys have you got down there — are you
raising?  
   
MR. PARKER:  Circle S Ranch grows about nine and half million turkeys a
year.  
   
THE PRESIDENT:  God love you.  Nine and a half million turkeys.  I tell
you what.  That’s like some of the countries I’ve been to.  (Laughter.) 
And the — anyway.  
   
(Addressing Chocolate.)  Do you want to talk?  (Laughter.)  
   
Look, folks, in all seriousness, let me close with this.  
   
We can’t forget the reason for Thanksgiving in the first place.  The
pilgrims thought it was pretty important in tough times to come together
and thank God, to be grateful for what we have.  That’s what the
Thanksgiving tradition is all about: being grateful for what we have and
grateful for fellow Americans who we may never meet but who we —
(turkeys gobble).  There you go.  (Laughter.)  They’re grateful.  
   
And think about the scientists and researchers, doctors and nurses
keeping us safe through the pandemic.  Two years ago, we couldn’t even
safely have Thanksgiving with large family gatherings.  Now we can. 
That’s progress, and let’s keep it going.   
   
We have new COVID vaccine updates to deal with new variants to protect
you and your loved ones.  So, get it today.  Get your flu shots as
well.  This winter can be a — much happier than recent holiday seasons,
but you have to do your part.  Please visit Vaccines.gov.  Decide what
you’re going to do.  
   
We’re also are grateful for frontline workers that are keeping essential
services going, and growing and providing food for our tables.   
   
We’re grateful for our faith leaders and their counsel and comfort and
support.   
   
Later today, Jill and I are going to be flying down to North Carolina —
to Cherry Point, North Carolina — for a Friendsgiving, where we’ll be
serving Thanksgiving dinner to troops and military families to
demonstrate our gratitude for their service and sacrifice.   
   
And so many of those families are missing someone at their table today,
like our family.  So many military folks that we have lost.  And so,
there’s just really — it’s important to keep them in our hearts, those
who have lost so much and those who are going to have an empty seat at
their table this Thanksgiving.  
   
This is a special time and the — in the greatest nation on Earth, so
let’s be grateful.  Scripture says, “Let us rejoice always, pray
continually, and give thanks in all circumstances.”   
   
Folks, let’s remember — all the political fighting that goes on that you
read about — let’s remember one thing: This is the United States of
America — the United States of America.  There’s not a single, solitary
thing beyond our capacity as a nation — nothing beyond our capacity — if
we do it together, united.  United.  (Turkeys gobble.)  (Laughter.)  
   
You picked two great turkeys.  
   
From the Biden family to all of yours, Happy Thanksgiving.  And may God
bless you all.  And may God protect our troops.  Thank you all for being
here.  (Applause.)
