title: Remarks by President Biden in Meeting with Senate Judiciary Committee Chair
  Dick Durbin and Ranking Member Chuck Grassley on the Forthcoming Supreme Court Vacancy
---
 
Oval Office

1:57 P.M. EST   
  
THE PRESIDENT:  Look, I invited — we’re different parties but two good
friends down here.  We’ve done an awful lot of Supreme Court justices
together, Senator Grassley and I, as well as Senator Durbin.  And we’ve
worked together on a lot of court nominations overall but particularly
Supreme Court nominees.  
  
And selecting a justice is one of the President’s most serious
responsibilities.  And as I always said — and I went back and looked at
a lot of the opening statements I made — apparently, Dick, I’ve presided
over more Supreme Court justices than anybody around that’s still in
Congress or associated with the government, which is — it kind of means
we must be beyond 60, Chuck.  I’m not sure what it is, but we’re a
little older.  But —  
  
 SENATOR GRASSLEY:  For me, it’d be 15 or 16.  
  
THE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  Yeah, well, and I started way back early on
in the early ‘70s. 

At any rate, what — what we’re going to do, as I’ve said before — and I
went back and looked at some of the opening statements that I made for
justices over the years that, you know, it’s — the Constitution says
“advise and consent” — “advice and consent.”  And I’m serious when I say
it: that I want the advice of the Senate as well as the consent, if we
can arrive on who the nominee should be.  
  
And, you know, it’s — there’s always a renewed national debate every
time we nominate — any President nominates a justice, because the
Constitution is always evolving slightly in terms of additional rights
or curtailing rights, et cetera.  And it’s always an issue.  And there’s
several schools of thought in terms of judicial philosophy.  And we’ll
see.   
  
But the fact is that I’m looking for someone who I can — this is not a
static issue; it flows back and forth.  What I’m looking for is a
candidate with character; with the qualities of a judge, in terms of
being courteous to the folks before them and treating people with
respect; as well as a judicial philosophy that is more of one that
suggests that there are unenumerated rights in the Constitution, and all
the amendments mean something, including the Ninth Amendment.   
  
And — but I intend to take this decision — to make this decision and get
it to my colleagues by — by the end of the month.  That’s my hope.  
  
And — and I’m looking forward to their advice in how to proceed and how
the hearings will be conducted and the like.  
  
 So, thank you very much.  We’re going to get a chance to talk, and I
want to hear from them today.  
  
 Thank you.
