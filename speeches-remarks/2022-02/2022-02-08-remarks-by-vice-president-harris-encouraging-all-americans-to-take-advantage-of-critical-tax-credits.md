*South Court Auditorium*

9:50 A.M. EST  
  
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Sharron, for that very meaningful
introduction.  And Sharron and I were talking earlier.  You know,
there’s so much about the Child Tax Credit that is about the — the
impact — the intergenerational impact.   
   
And Sharron was sharing with me that her grandfather actually worked
with President Kennedy.  And we were talking about the fact that,
obviously, her family has a long, strong, and deep commitment to public
service and this good work.  So, thank you, Sharron, for that
introduction.   
   
It is good to be here with two of the most energetic champions of our
nation’s working families: Secretary Janet Yellen and Gene Sperling.   
   
And as many of you know, Secretary Yellen and I are working on a number
of things.   
   
Gene, I heard your introduction about the conspiracy.  It’s not a
conspiracy; it’s just a collaboration to do very important work to lift
people up with one of the — the leaders in the world on how we do that
in terms of economic empowerment.   
   
So, Secretary Yellen, thank you.  Gene Sperling, thank you for your
years of hard work.  You really are the backbone of what we, as an
administration, have been doing with the Child Tax Credit.   
   
So, on this day of action, there are so many individuals and
organizations who are dedicated to action: the United Way, AARP, and
Code for America.  And I want to thank all of you for the work you do
every day and for joining us today.   
   
So, our message today is simple: If you are eligible for the Child Tax
Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit, we want you to get those
credits.  And you know why: Working families deserve a break.  
   
Last month, I received a letter from a mother in Pennsylvania.  She and
her husband have four children.  They both work 50-hour weeks.  They
coordinate their schedules to minimize the cost of childcare, and their
family is still barely holding on.  They just need a little help, and
that’s what she told me in her note — a hand up, not a handout.  A hand
up.   
   
And I receive letters like this all the time.  The truth is, there are
people across our nation who work hard every day and still struggle to
get by.  And it should not be this way in our country — in the United
States of America.  
   
And the President and I firmly believe that we have to do better.  And
that is why we fought to expand the Child Tax Credit and the Earned
Income Tax Credit as part of the American Rescue Plan: to give families
and working people a little help.   
   
The American Rescue Plan increased the Child Tax Credit  
and extended it to millions more families.  
   
And the American Rescue Plan also nearly tripled the maximum Earned
Income Tax Credit and made it available to workers between 19 and 24
years of age, as well as to workers 65 years old and above.  
   
These tax credits are already making a difference.  In fact, thanks to
the Child Tax Credit, we are on a path to cut child poverty in America
by 40 percent.  That bears repeating: We are on a path to cut child
poverty by 40 percent.  
   
This is historic and, as I said earlier, will have a generational
impact.  
   
Millions of families have used their monthly Child Tax Credit — CTC —
check to put food on the table, to save for college, to cover daily
expenses, and to pay down debt.  That is why this Day of Action is so
important.  
   
If you are eligible for either of these credits or even if you think you
might be eligible, please go to the following website:
ChildTaxCredit.gov.  ChildTaxCredit.gov.   
   
It is a quick and easy way to check whether you qualify.  And if you
qualify, all you need to do to receive benefits is to file your taxes.  
   
Now, one more important note: If you are one of the more than 30 million
families who have already received the Child Tax Credit, you still need
to file your taxes.  So that is the only way to receive the second half
of what you are owed.  So, remember: You are owed more, but you still
need to file your taxes.  
   
Everyone here knows it will take a hands-on-deck approach to get people
signed up for these credits.  So, we need help.  We need state and local
governments to send out texts to remind folks of what they entitled to
receive.  We need faith-based organizations to spread the word at houses
of worship.  We need community groups to get people the help they need
to file their taxes.  And we need everyone to spread the word — be it at
Sunday dinner, at the barbershop, at work, at school, and at home.  
   
And I believe and I know our work will be worth it, because every family
we lift up, when we do that, we lift up our entire nation.  
   
And that’s why the President and I will keep fighting to extend these
measures for years to come.  
   
And I’ll close today where I began: with that mother from Pennsylvania. 
In her letter, she wrote that, earlier this year, her family started
receiving the monthly Child Tax Credit.  And with the money, she
described that they bought food, they paid their daily expenses, and
they supported local businesses in the process.  She wrote, “Nothing
fancy.”  Just making a difference.  
   
So, it’s enough to make a difference.  And that’s why we are here today:
to make a difference for working families across our nation, to offer
just a little help.  
   
So, thank you all for what you have done and will continue to do.  Let’s
keep getting the word out, and be well and take care.   
   
Thank you.
