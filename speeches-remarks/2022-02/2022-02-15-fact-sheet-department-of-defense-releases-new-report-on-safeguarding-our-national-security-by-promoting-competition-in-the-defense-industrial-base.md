title: "Fact Sheet: Department of Defense Releases New Report on Safeguarding our\
  \ National Security by Promoting Competition in the Defense Industrial\_Base"
---
 
As part of President Biden’s whole-of-government approach to promoting
competition, the Department of Defense (DoD) released a new report today
on the state of competition in the defense industrial base. The report
surveys the state of competition across key defense sectors and finds
that extreme consolidation poses risks to our nation’s national and
economic security. The report emphasizes that promoting competition is a
top priority for DoD and outlines a series of actions that DoD will
pursue to rebuild its competitive bench, lower costs for taxpayers, and
safeguard our national security. 

The term “defense industrial base” (DIB) describes the vast network of
companies that provide goods and services to DoD. These companies make
up a significant part of our economy, ranging from small businesses and
startups to some of the biggest corporations in the world. They provide
products ranging from intercontinental ballistic missiles and highly
specialized military satellites to everyday commercial products like
batteries and laptops.

The report observes that extreme consolidation in the defense sector has
reduced competition and heightened national security risks. Since the
1990s, the number of aerospace and defense prime contractors has shrunk
from 51 to just 5. The same pattern has played out across categories of
major weapons systems: for example, today, 90% of missiles come from 3
sources. Such consolidation leaves DoD increasingly reliant on a handful
of companies for critical defense capabilities. It also hurts taxpayers,
as companies no longer feel the competitive pressure to innovate or
perform at the highest level to win contracts.

The report also emphasizes the need to rebuild DoD’s competitive bench
by lowering barriers for small businesses and bringing in new entrants.
Small businesses spur innovation, producing 16.5 times more patents than
large firms, and form the next generation of suppliers to support the
DoD mission. However, the number of small businesses in the DIB shrunk
by over 40% over the past decade. Without action, DoD could lose an
additional 15,000 suppliers over the next decade—a national security and
economic risk that threatens key domestic capabilities.   

The report outlines five lines of effort to achieve the goals of
President Biden’s Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the
American Economy, confront the challenges posed by industry
consolidation, and ensure sufficient domestic capacity and capability in
the defense industrial base:

-   *Strengthening Merger Oversight.* DoD faces a historically
    consolidated DIB, making careful attention by DoD in the review of
    any further mergers necessary. When a merger threatens DoD
    interests, DoD will support the Federal Trade Commission and
    Department of Justice in antitrust investigations and
    recommendations involving the DIB.  
-   *Addressing Intellectual Property Limitations*. Certain practices
    surrounding intellectual property (IP) and data rights have been
    used to limit competition in DoD purchasing. In its ongoing
    modernization of its approach to IP rights, DoD should remain
    conscious of potential unnecessary anticompetitive consequences of
    any new IP-related procedures do what it can to create IP-related
    procedures that do not result in unnecessary anticompetitive
    consequences.  
-   *Increasing New Entrants*. To counteract the trend of overall
    shrinking of the DIB, DoD should endeavor to attract new entrants to
    the defense marketplace by reducing barriers to entry. That includes
    through small business outreach, support, and use of acquisition
    authorities that provide DoD the flexibility to reduce barriers and
    attract new vendors.  
-   *Increasing Opportunities for Small Businesses*. DoD should increase
    small business participation in defense procurement, including with
    small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses,
    service disabled veteran owned small businesses, and HUBZone
    businesses, with an emphasis on increasing competition in priority
    industrial base sectors.  
-   *Implementing Sector-specific Supply Chain Resilience Plans*: DoD
    should take steps to ensure resilience in the supply chain for five
    priority sectors: casting and forgings, missiles and munitions,
    energy storage and batteries, strategic and critical materials, and
    microelectronics.
