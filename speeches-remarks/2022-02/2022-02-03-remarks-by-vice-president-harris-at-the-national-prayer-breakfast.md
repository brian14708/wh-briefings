*The U.S. Capitol Visitor Center  
Washington, D.C.*

9:33 A.M. EST  

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you all.  Please have a seat.  Thank you,
Mike.  It was a pleasure to work with you in the United States Senate. 
And I want to thank you for your grace and your wisdom and your
friendship.  And, yes, we piled into that station wagon — (laughs) —
going to church.  So we have many things in common.  
  
So good morning, everyone.  Good morning.  Good morning.  I want to
thank you, Mike, Kirsten, the whole group for organizing this
breakfast.  Congressman Conor Lamb.  Congressman Tim Walberg, you as
well.  
  
And, of course, it is an honor to be here with these members of
Congress, with faith leaders from across our country, and of course,
with our President, who is, as we all know, a leader of unending
faith.  
  
So, over the past two years, so many among us have lost loved ones.  So
many parents have struggled.  All of us have had a loss of a sense of
normalcy.  
  
And the spiritual weight of it all has indeed been great.  Our faith has
indeed been tested.  But it is that same faith — our faith in God, our
faith in humanity, and our faith in what is possible — it is that same
faith that I know has seen us through, that has helped us to see the
light in one another.  
  
You know, last March, I paid a visit to a food bank in Nevada.  And the
families there were waiting for hours at a time in their cars to receive
a box of groceries.  And when they drive up, the volunteers there would
stand there, the driver would pop open the trunk, and the volunteer
would put a box of food in the car.  
  
And invariably, as the volunteers explained and they described it to me,
in the middle of that empty trunk, the volunteer would see a handwritten
note sitting in the trunk written out to the volunteers to thank them
for their labor, for their work.  The volunteers would describe that
sometimes that trunk would pull — pop open that empty trunk and there’d
be a five- or a ten-dollar bill.  
  
Now, let us be clear: The driver of that car was very likely just barely
holding everything together or could have  
lost everything they have, but they still showed such remarkable
kindness, such generosity when they seemingly had nothing to give.  Such
grace.  
  
It is said a candle shines brightness and most brightly in the darkness.
 I believe the same is true of faith.  And it is that faith that fuels
me to say now and often as I do — so many times — that let us see,
always guided by our faith — let us be able to see what can be,
unburdened by what has been.    
  
And those words have deep spiritual roots for me.  I grew up attending
23rd Avenue Church of God in Oakland, California.  And one of the
important places there is where I learned to believe in what is possible
and that we each have the ability to achieve what is possible.  
  
After all, as I know we have all learned and been taught, faith is not
passive.  Faith motivates action.  It lifts us up, and it gives us
purpose.  
  
I am blessed to have worshipped over the years with many pastors, one of
whom recently reminded me of the story of Nehemiah.  
  
Nehemiah, as we all know, was neither a priest nor a prophet; he was a
city official.  After Jerusalem was burned and broken, Nehemiah told the
people, “Let us rise up and build.”  And they did.  Their faith allowed
them to see what was possible and to see how to make it so.  
  
That, I believe, is the faith that we as a nation must and do summon
today.   
  
So, I will end with a simple prayer: God, grant us faith, not only in
you, but in one another.  Let us be kind.  Let us be generous.  Let us
be full of grace.  Let us see the light in all your people and be guided
by that light for all our days.   
  
God, may you bless us all and may you bless the United States of
America.  
  
Thank you.   (Applause.)
