*“We envision an Indo-Pacific that is open, connected, prosperous,
resilient, and secure—and we are ready to work together with each of you
to achieve it.”*  
*President Joe Biden*  
*            East Asia Summit*  
*October 27, 2021*

The Biden-Harris Administration has made historic strides to restore
American leadership in the Indo-Pacific and adapt its role for the
21<sup>st</sup> century. In the last year, the United States has
modernized its longstanding alliances, strengthened emerging
partnerships, and forged innovative links among them to meet urgent
challenges, from competition with China to climate change to the
pandemic. It has done so at a time when allies and partners around the
world are increasingly enhancing their own engagement in the
Indo-Pacific; and when there is broad, bipartisan agreement in the U.S.
Congress that the United States must, too. This convergence in
commitment to the region, across oceans and across political-party
lines, reflects an undeniable reality: the Indo-Pacific is the most
dynamic region in the world, and its future affects people everywhere.  
  
That reality is the basis of the Indo-Pacific Strategy of the United
States. This strategy outlines President Biden’s vision to more firmly
anchor the United States in the Indo-Pacific and strengthen the region
in the process. Its central focus is sustained and creative
collaboration with allies, partners, and institutions, within the region
and beyond it.  
  
The United States will pursue an Indo-Pacific region that is:

1.  ***FREE AND OPEN***

Our vital interests and those of our closest partners require a free and
open Indo-Pacific, and a free and open Indo-Pacific requires that
governments can make their own choices and that shared domains are
governed lawfully. Our strategy begins with strengthening resilience,
both within individual countries, as we have done in the United States,
and among them. We will advance a free and open region, including by:

-   *Investing in democratic institutions, a free press, and a vibrant
    civil society*
-   *Improving fiscal transparency in the Indo-Pacific to expose
    corruption and drive reform*
-   *Ensuring the region’s seas and skies are governed and used
    according to international law*
-   *Advancing common approaches to critical and emerging technologies,
    the internet, and cyber space*

**2.** **CONNECTED**

A free and open Indo-Pacific can only be achieved if we build collective
capacity for a new age. The alliances, organizations, and rules that the
United States and its partners have helped to build must be adapted. We
will build collective capacity within and beyond the region, including
by: 

-   *Deepening our five regional treaty alliances with Australia, Japan,
    the Republic of Korea (ROK), the Philippines, and Thailand*
-   *Strengthening relationships with leading regional partners,
    including India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, New Zealand,
    Singapore, Taiwan, Vietnam, and the Pacific Islands*
-   *Contributing to an empowered and unified ASEAN*
-   *Strengthening the Quad and delivering on its commitments*
-   *Supporting India’s continued rise and regional leadership*
-   *Partnering to build resilience in the Pacific Islands*
-   *Forging connections between the Indo-Pacific and the Euro-Atlantic*
-   *Expanding U.S. diplomatic presence in the Indo-Pacific,
    particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands*

**3.** ***PROSPEROUS***

The prosperity of everyday Americans is linked to the Indo-Pacific. That
fact requires investments to encourage innovation, strengthen economic
competitiveness, produce good-paying jobs, rebuild supply chains, and
expand economic opportunities for middle-class families: 1.5 billion
people in the Indo-Pacific will join the global middle class this
decade. We will drive Indo-Pacific prosperity, including by:

-   *Proposing an Indo-Pacific economic framework, through which we
    will*:
    -   *Develop new approaches to trade that meet high labor and
        environmental standards*
    -   *Govern our digital economies and cross-border data flows
        according to open principles, including through a new digital
        economy framework*
    -   *Advance resilient and secure supply chains that are diverse,
        open, and predictable*
    -   *Make shared investments in decarbonization and clean energy*
-   *Promoting free, fair, and open trade and investment through the
    Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), including in our 2023 host
    year*
-   *Closing the region’s infrastructure gap through Build Back Better
    World with G7 partners*

**4. SECURE**

For 75 years, the United States has maintained a strong and consistent
defense presence necessary to support regional peace, security,
stability, and prosperity. We are extending and modernizing that role
and enhancing our capabilities to defend our interests and to deter
aggression against U.S. territory and against our allies and partners.
We will bolster Indo-Pacific security, drawing on all instruments of
power to deter aggression and to counter coercion, including by:

-   *Advancing integrated deterrence*
-   *Deepening cooperation and enhancing interoperability with allies
    and partners*
-   *Maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait*
-   *Innovating to operate in rapidly evolving threat environments,
    including space, cyberspace, and critical- and emerging-technology
    areas*
-   *Strengthening extended deterrence and coordination with our ROK and
    Japanese allies and pursuing the complete denuclearization of the
    Korean Peninsula*
-   *Continuing to deliver on AUKUS*
-   *Expanding U.S. Coast Guard presence and cooperation against other
    transnational threats*
-   *Working with Congress to fund the Pacific Deterrence Initiative and
    the Maritime Security Initiative*

**5. RESILIENT**

The Indo-Pacific faces major transnational challenges. Climate change is
growing ever-more severe as South Asia’s glaciers melt and the Pacific
Islands battle existential rises in sea levels. The COVID-19 pandemic
continues to inflict a painful human and economic toll across the
region. And Indo-Pacific governments grapple with natural disasters,
resource scarcity, internal conflict, and governance challenges. Left
unchecked, these forces threaten to destabilize the region. We will
build regional resilience to 21<sup>st</sup>-century transnational
threats, including by:

-   *Working with allies and partners to develop 2030 and 2050 targets,
    strategies, plans, and policies consistent with limiting global
    temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius*
-   *Reducing regional vulnerability to the impacts of climate change
    and environmental degradation*
-   *Ending the COVID-19 pandemic and bolstering global health security*
