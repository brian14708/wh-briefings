title: "Remarks by Vice President Harris After Swearing In Scott A. Nathan as Chief\
  \ Executive Officer of the United\_States International Development Finance\_Corporation"

*Vice President’s Ceremonial Office  
Eisenhower Executive Office*

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  So, I know you all — well, all eyes around our
country and the world are on Ukraine, and Russia’s invasion of
Ukraine.   
   
And I want to be clear that we know and believe that this is a war of
choice.  It is unprovoked, it is unwarranted, and it is unjustified.  
   
As the President made clear from the beginning: If Russia were to take
aggressive action against Ukraine, our response would be swift and
certain.  And that is, in fact, what has occurred.  
   
Today, the President outlined the sanctions, which are going to have a
direct impact on Russia’s economy, both in terms of sanctions and in
terms of export controls.  Those — the effect will be immediate on
Russia.  
   
And we will continue, as we have from the very beginning, to work with
our Allies and our partners around the world.  We are unified in our
position on this and in our reaction to this unjustified, unprovoked
attack on a sovereign nation.  
   
Thank you.  
   
END
