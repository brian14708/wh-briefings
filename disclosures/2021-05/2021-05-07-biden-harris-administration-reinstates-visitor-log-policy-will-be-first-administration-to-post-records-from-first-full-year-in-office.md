title: "Biden- \u2060 Harris Administration Reinstates Visitor Log Policy, Will Be\
  \ First Administration to Post Records from First Full Year in Office"
---
 
Today the Biden-Harris Administration posted visitor logs from January
2021.  The Biden-Harris Administration will be the first administration
to post visitor logs from its first full year in office.  Visitor log
disclosures will occur on a monthly basis.

This release was made in accordance with the reinstated policy to
voluntarily disclose White House visitor logs.  These logs give the
public a look into the visitors entering and exiting the White House
campus for appointments, tours, and official business — making good on
President Biden’s commitment to restore integrity, transparency, and
trust in government.

This set, from January 20 to 31, 2021, includes only 400 records.  As
vaccinations increase and the pandemic response continues to make
progress, we look forward to welcoming many more visitors onto the White
House campus and back into the People’s House.

In keeping with the Obama-Biden Administration’s policy, select records
that implicate privacy, national security, or other concerns will be
withheld.  To learn more about the policy, read our [<u>voluntary
disclosure
policy</u>](https://www.whitehouse.gov/voluntary-disclosure/).  To view
visitor log records, view our [<u>disclosure
page</u>](https://www.whitehouse.gov/disclosures/visitor-logs/).

**<u>Voluntary Disclosure Policy</u>**

As previously announced, President Biden is reinstating a policy to
voluntarily disclose White House visitor logs.  These logs will include
appointment information for individuals who have been processed to enter
the White House complex, including the White House, Eisenhower Executive
Office Building, and New Executive Office Building.  Naval Observatory
records related to White House business will also be released when they
are generated. 

The voluntary disclosure policy will apply to records created for
appointments after 12:00 p.m. on January 20, 2021. 

The White House considers these records to be subject to the
Presidential Records Act or the Federal Records Act and will continue to
preserve them accordingly.

This policy will be subject to the following exceptions:

-   The White House will not release fields within the access records
    that implicate personal privacy or law enforcement concerns (e.g.,
    dates of birth, social security numbers, and contact phone numbers).
-   The White House will not release access records of staff members
    (e.g., staff processed through the visitor system to enter the
    complex before being issued their badge).
-   The White House will not release access records whose release would
    threaten national security interests.
-   The White House will not release access records related to purely
    personal guests of the First and Second Families (i.e., visits that
    do not involve any official or political business).
-   The White House will not release access records related to a small
    group of particularly sensitive meetings (e.g., visits of potential
    Supreme Court nominees).  The White House will disclose each month
    the number of records withheld on this basis, if any, and it will
    release such records once they are no longer sensitive.
