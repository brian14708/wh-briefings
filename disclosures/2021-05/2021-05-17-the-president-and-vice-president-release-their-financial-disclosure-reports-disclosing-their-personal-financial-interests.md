Today, the President and Vice President released their public financial
disclosure reports. The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 requires
high-level federal officials to publicly disclose their personal
financial interests on OGE Form 278. The public filing system serves to
prevent financial conflicts of interest by providing for a systematic
review of the finances of government officials. Those finances are set
forth in annual disclosures, which are reviewed and certified by the
independent Office of Government Ethics. Neither the President nor the
Vice President have any conflicts of interest.
