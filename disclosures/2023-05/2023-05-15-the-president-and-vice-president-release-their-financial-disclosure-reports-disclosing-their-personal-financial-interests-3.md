  \ disclosing their personal financial\_interests"

Today, the President and Vice President released their annual public
financial disclosure reports to the American people.  
  
These public filings help to prevent financial conflicts of interest by
providing transparency about the assets of government officials.  
  
Information about these finances are reported through annual
disclosures, which are reviewed and certified by the independent Office
of Government Ethics.  Neither the President nor the Vice President have
any conflicts of interest.  
  
The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 requires high-level federal
officials to publicly disclose their personal financial interests on OGE
Form 278 and the President and Vice President are pleased to do so.
