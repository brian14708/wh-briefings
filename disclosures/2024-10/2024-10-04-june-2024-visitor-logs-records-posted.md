Today the White House released visitor log records generated in June
2024. This set includes 90,735 records, bringing the total number of
records posted to 1,653,271

These records were posted pursuant to the White House’s policy to
voluntarily disclose visitor log records. This release is consistent
with the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to becoming the first
administration to post visitor log records from its first full year in
office.
