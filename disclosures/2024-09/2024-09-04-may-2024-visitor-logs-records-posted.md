Today the White House released visitor log records generated in May
2024. This set includes 87,040 records, bringing the total number of
records posted to 1,562,536

These records were posted pursuant to the White House’s policy to
voluntarily disclose visitor log records. This release is consistent
with the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to becoming the first
administration to post visitor log records from its first full year in
office.
