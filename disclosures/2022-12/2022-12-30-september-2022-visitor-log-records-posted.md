Today the White House released visitor log records generated in
September 2022. This set includes 37,269 records, bringing the total
number of records posted to 209,950.

These records were posted pursuant to the White House’s policy to
voluntarily disclose visitor log records. This release is consistent
with the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to becoming the first
administration to post visitor log records from its first full year in
office.

policy](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/voluntary-disclosure/). To view
