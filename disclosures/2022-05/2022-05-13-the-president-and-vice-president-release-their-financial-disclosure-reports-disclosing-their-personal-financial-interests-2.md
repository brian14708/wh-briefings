Today, the President and Vice President released their annual public
financial disclosure reports. The Ethics in Government Act of 1978
requires high-level federal officials to publicly disclose their
personal financial interests on OGE Form 278 and the President and Vice
President are pleased to do so. The public filing system serves to
prevent financial conflicts of interest by providing for a systematic
review of the finances of government officials. Those finances are set
forth in annual disclosures, which are reviewed and certified by the
independent Office of Government Ethics. Neither the President nor the
Vice President have any conflicts of interest.
