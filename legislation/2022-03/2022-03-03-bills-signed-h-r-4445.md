On Thursday, March 3, 2022, the President signed into law:

H.R. 4445, the “Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual
Harassment Act of 2021,” which invalidates predispute arbitration
agreements that preclude a party from filing a lawsuit in court
involving sexual assault or sexual harassment, at the election of the
party alleging such conduct.

Thank you to Representatives Bustos, Griffith, and Jayapal and Senators
Gillibrand, Graham, and Durbin and many others for their leadership.
