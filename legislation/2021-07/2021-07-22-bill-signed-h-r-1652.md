On Thursday, July 22, 2021, the President signed into law:  
  
H.R. 1652, the “VOCA Fix to Sustain the Crime Victims Fund Act of 2021,”
which requires funds collected from deferred prosecution and
non-prosecution agreements to be deposited into the Crime Victims Fund;
increases the crime victim compensation formula grant to provide
eligible programs with 75 percent of the amounts awarded during the
preceding year; allows states to waive a requirement that programs
promote victim cooperation with law enforcement; and allows or requires
states to waive matching requirements for grant funds under certain
circumstances.
