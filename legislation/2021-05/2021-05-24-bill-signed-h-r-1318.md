On Monday, May 24, 2021, the President signed into law:

H.R. 1318, the “Alaska Tourism Restoration Act,” which temporarily
allows foreign-flagged cruise ships to sail directly from Washington
State to Alaska without having to dock in Canada first until either the
date on which Canada lifts restrictions prohibiting cruise ships from
docking in its waters due to the COVID-19 pandemic or March 31, 2022.
