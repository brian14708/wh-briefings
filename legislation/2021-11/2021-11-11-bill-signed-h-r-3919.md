On Thursday, November 11, 2021, the President signed into law:

H.R. 3919, the “Secure Equipment Act of 2021,” which requires the
Federal Communications Commission to adopt rules clarifying that it will
no longer review or approve any authorization application for equipment
that poses an unacceptable risk to national security.

Thank you to Representatives Scalise and Eshoo, and Senators Rubio and
Markey for their leadership.
