On Tuesday, December 13, 2022, the President signed into law:  
  
H.R. 8404, the “Respect for Marriage Act,” which establishes statutory
authority for same-sex and interracial marriages and repeals provisions
of law that once prevented any State or territory from being required to
give effect to a same-sex marriage from another State or territory.

Thank you to Speaker Pelosi, Representatives Nadler, Cicilline, and
Davids, Leader Schumer, Senators Baldwin, Collins, Portman, Sinema,
Tillis, Feinstein, and Booker, and many others for their leadership.
