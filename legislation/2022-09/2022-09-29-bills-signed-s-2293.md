On Thursday, September 29, 2022, the President signed into law:

S. 2293, the “Civilian Reservist Emergency Workforce Act of 2021” or the
“CREW Act,” which grants employment protections under the Uniformed
Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act to Federal Emergency
Management Agency reservists who deploy to major disaster sites.

Thank you to Senators Peters and Portman, Representatives Titus and
Katko, and many others, for their leadership.
