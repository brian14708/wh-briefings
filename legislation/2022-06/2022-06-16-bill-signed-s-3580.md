On Thursday, June 16, 2022, the President signed into law:

S. 3580, the “Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2022,” which authorizes
appropriations for the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) for fiscal
years 2022 through 2025; establishes additional requirements and
prohibited conduct for ocean carriers; requires the FMC to issue rules
related to certain fee assessments, prohibited practices, and
establishment of a shipping registry; and authorizes the FMC under
certain circumstances to issue an emergency order requiring common
carriers to share information directly with shippers and rail and motor
carriers.

Thank you to Senators Amy Klobuchar, John Thune, Maria Cantwell, and
Roger Wicker and Representatives Peter DeFazio, Sam Graves, John
