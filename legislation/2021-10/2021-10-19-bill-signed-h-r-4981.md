On Tuesday, October 19, 2021, the President signed into law:  
   
H.R.4981, “To amend the Fentanyl Sanctions Act, to modify certain
deadlines relating to the Commission on Combating Synthetic Opioid
Trafficking.” This bill will extend the Fentanyl Sanctions Act deadline
for the Commission on Combating Synthetic Opioid Trafficking by 120 days
to allow the Commission to continue its work until February 2022. This
deadline was for the Commission to report on the flow of synthetic
opioids into the United States and to develop a strategic approach to
combat the supply and locate the origins of these substances.  
   
Thank you to Representatives Trone and Upton and Senators Cotton and
Markey for their leadership.
