On Monday, March 18, 2024, the President signed into law:

S. 206, the “Eradicating Narcotic Drugs and Formulating Effective New
Tools to Address National Yearly Losses of life Act” or the “END
FENTANYL Act,” which requires U.S. Customs and Border Protection to
review and update manuals and policies related to inspections at ports
of entry to ensure the effective detection of illegal smuggling of drugs
and humans along the border.

Thank you to Senators Scott, Rosen, Braun, Hassan, and Kelly, and
Representatives Guest and Trone, for their leadership.

S. 1858, the “Disaster Assistance Deadlines Alignment Act,” which aligns
the application deadline for the Disaster Unemployment Assistance
program with the application deadline for assistance under the
Individuals and Households program.

Thank you to Senators Peters, Rubio and Paul, and Representative Neguse,
for their leadership.
