On Wednesday, June 23, 2021, the President signed into law:

H.J.Res. 27, which appoints Barbara M. Barrett as a citizen regent of
the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution; and

H.R.711, the “West Los Angeles VA Campus Improvement Act of 2021,” which
will allow the West Los Angeles Veterans’ Affairs Campus to use proceeds
from property leasing to support construction, maintenance, and services
for additional housing for homeless or at-risk veterans. Thank you to
Representative Ted Lieu and Senators Dianne Feinstein and Alex Padilla
for their work on this issue.
