On Tuesday, July 25, 2023, the President signed into law:  
   
S. 111, the “Providing Accountability Through Transparency Act of 2023,”
which requires each agency, in providing notice of a rulemaking, to
include a link to a 100-word plain language summary of the proposed
rule.  
   
Thank you to Senators Lankford, Sinema, Johnson, Risch, Braun, and
Peters for their leadership.
