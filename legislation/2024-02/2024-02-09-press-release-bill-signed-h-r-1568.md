On Friday, February 9, 2024, the President signed into law:  
   
   
H.R. 1568, the “Moving Americans Privacy Protection Act,” which  
requires the Department of the Treasury, in coordination with the
Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Customs and Border Protection, to
ensure any personally identifiable information is removed from cargo
manifests before disclosing them to the public.  
  
Thank you to Representatives Waltz and Pascrell, and Senators Daines,
Peters, Stabenow, and Marshall, for their leadership.
