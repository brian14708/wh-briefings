title: Presidential Message on the 235th Birthday of the United States Coast Guard
---
 
For 235 years, the United States Coast Guard has secured our waterways
and defended our homeland as America’s premier maritime law enforcement
agency.  They never flinch in their mission to patrol and protect. 
Today, we celebrate the Coast Guard’s enduring legacy and the thousands
of Coast Guardsmen who heroically live by the motto: “Semper
Paratus”—“Always Ready.”

Every day, the Coast Guard works to keep America safe and prevent
dangerous threats from reaching our borders.  In the first six months of
2025, they have already seized more than 240,000 pounds of cocaine, a
more than 100 percent increase over the same time period in 2024. 
Thanks to their work, our streets are safer, our families are protected,
and our communities are guarded from the poisonous drugs that have
claimed far too many precious American lives.

The Coast Guard’s commitment to serving our citizens was once again put
on full display last month, when search and rescue crews were deployed
to areas of Central Texas ravaged by devastating floods.  In the face of
tragedy and chaos, our Coast Guardsmen saved hundreds of lives.  Their
heroism, compassion, and resolve stand as a shining example of what it
means to be a Coast Guardsman—and their inspiring devotion to protecting
the American people represents the very best of our Nation.

As President, I am steadfastly committed to ensuring that every Coast
Guardsman has the support, resources, and capabilities they need to
maintain their hard-won dominance, prestige, and respect for future
generations.  Through Force Design 2028—historic funding delivered in
the One Big Beautiful Bill—my Administration is empowering the Coast
Guard to accomplish its mission better, stronger, and more efficiently
than ever before.  As a result, military recruitment levels are
skyrocketing, and the Coast Guard is now on pace to exceed recruitment
expectations by 110 percent, a stark contrast to their recruitment
shortages under the previous administration.

As we commemorate the 235th birthday of the United States Coast Guard,
we honor the brave patriots who defend our shores—and we remain
eternally indebted to their unwavering dedication to preserving American
excellence.
