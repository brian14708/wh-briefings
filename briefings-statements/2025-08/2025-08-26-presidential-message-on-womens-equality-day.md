title: "Presidential Message on Women\u2019s Equality Day"
---
 
On this day 105 years ago, the 19th Amendment of the United States
Constitution was officially certified—forever changing the course of
history and immortalizing these mighty words: “The right of citizens of
the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United
States or by any State on account of sex.”

This Women’s Equality Day, our Nation proudly celebrates the timeless
truth that every American citizen is created in the holy image of God
and endowed with certain unalienable rights.  We recognize the
ratification and certification of the 19th Amendment as a defining
moment in fulfilling America’s founding principle that all humans are
created equal.  Above all, we recommit to upholding our country’s
long-cherished principles of liberty, equal justice under the law, and
the God-given dignity of the human person.

Today, we honor the strong, patriotic American trailblazers who paved
the path for women’s suffrage.  We remember that August 26, 1920, stands
as an enduring reminder of America’s promise of freedom and equality. 
Above all, we remain committed to protecting the blessings of liberty
for generations to come.
