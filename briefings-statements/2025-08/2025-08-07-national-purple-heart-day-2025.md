title: National Purple Heart Day, 2025
---
 
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  
  
A PROCLAMATION  
  

On National Purple Heart Day, we pause in solemn tribute to every
American Soldier, Sailor, Marine, Airman, Guardian, and Coast Guardsman
who was wounded or killed defending our birthright of freedom.  Today,
we renew our resolve to never forget the wounded warriors and martyrs of
liberty who have received this distinguished decoration — and we vow to
forge a future worthy of their sacrifice.

On August 7, 1782, General George Washington established the Badge of
Military Merit, fashioned with a heart-shaped purple cloth to honor acts
of “unusual gallantry, extraordinary fidelity, and essential service.” 
Today, that award — known as the Purple Heart — recognizes any member of
our Armed Forces wounded or killed in action against an enemy.

The Purple Heart is an award neither pursued nor won.  Instead, it is
bestowed as a symbol of the sacrifices manifested in bloodshed, broken
bodies, and perished souls.  The modern medallion — a gold heart bearing
a likeness of George Washington and adorned with a purple sash — stands
as an enduring reminder that our cherished freedom is preserved, often
at tremendous cost, by the steadfast courage of those who wear our
Nation’s uniform.

To honor the heroism and safeguard the legacy of every man and woman who
has earned this distinguished medal, my Administration remains
steadfastly committed to pursuing a foreign policy of peace through
strength, ending the days of endless foreign wars, and ensuring that the
United States military remains the most powerful, most lethal, and most
respected in the world.  Under my leadership, fewer conflicts will erupt
on the field of battle, but the significance of this decoration will
never be diminished.

On this observance, the First Lady joins me in honoring all Purple Heart
recipients as well as the resilient and faithful families who support
the wounded in recovery and restoration and those who grieve the
fallen.  We are eternally indebted for their devotion to duty, and
sacrifice on behalf of our great Nation.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 7, 2025 as
National Purple Heart Day.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
fiftieth.

                             DONALD J. TRUMP
