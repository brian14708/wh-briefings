Today, the United States Senate confirmed Sean Cairncross as the
National Cyber Director. He will serve as President Trump’s principal
advisor on national cybersecurity policy and strategy.

“I want to thank President Trump for this opportunity. It is an
incredible honor to serve our country and this President as the National
Cyber Director,” said Mr. Cairncross. “As the cyber strategic
environment continues to evolve, we must ensure our policy efforts and
capabilities deliver results for our national security and the American
people. The United States must dominate the cyber domain through strong
collaboration across departments and agencies, as well as private
industry. Under President Trump’s leadership, we will enter a new era of
effective cybersecurity policy.”

the National Cyber Director. He previously served as Chief Executive
Officer of the Millennium Challenge Corporation and as Senior Advisor to
the White House Chief of Staff during President Trump’s first
administration.
