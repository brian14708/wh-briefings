**The Honorable Lonnie G. Bunch III**

Secretary, Smithsonian Institution

1000 Jefferson Dr SW

Washington, DC 20560

**Subject: Internal Review of Smithsonian Exhibitions and Materials**

Dear Secretary Bunch,

We wish to begin by expressing our appreciation for the brief tour you
gave us recently of the National Museum of American History and the
National Museum of African American History and Culture, and by
acknowledging your work on behalf of the Smithsonian Institution, as
well as the Institution’s role in shaping public understanding of
American history and culture. We are completely aligned with your
statement that the Smithsonian is “a welcoming place of knowledge and
discovery for all Americans.” We are grateful that you and the Board of
Regents have expressed your commitment to the non-partisan, educational
mission of this great institution.

As we prepare to celebrate the 250th anniversary of our Nation’s
founding, it is more important than ever that our national museums
reflect the unity, progress, and enduring values that define the
American story. In this spirit, and in accordance with Executive Order
14253, *Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History*, we will be
leading a comprehensive internal review of selected Smithsonian museums
and exhibitions. This initiative aims to ensure alignment with the
President’s directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove
divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared
cultural institutions.

This review is a constructive and collaborative effort — one rooted in
respect for the Smithsonian’s vital mission and its extraordinary
contributions. Our goal is not to interfere with the day-to-day
operations of curators or staff, but rather to support a broader vision
of excellence that highlights historically accurate, uplifting, and
inclusive portrayals of America’s heritage.

The review will focus on several key areas:

1.  **Public-facing Content**: A review of exhibition text, wall
    didactics, websites, educational materials, and digital and social
    media content to assess tone, historical framing, and alignment with
    American ideals.
2.  **Curatorial Process**: A series of interviews with curators and
    senior staff to better understand the selection process, exhibition
    approval workflows, and any frameworks currently guiding exhibition
    content.
3.  **Exhibition Planning**: A review of current and future exhibitions,
    with particular attention to those planned for the 250th anniversary
    of the Declaration of Independence.
4.  **Collection Use**: Evaluation of how existing materials and
    collections are being used or could be used to highlight American
    achievement and progress, including whether the Smithsonian can make
    better use of certain materials by digitizing or conveying to other
    institutions.
5.  **Narrative Standards**: The development of consistent curatorial
    guidelines that reflect the Smithsonian’s original mission.

Initially, our review will focus on the following museums. Additional
museums will be reviewed in Phase II.

-   National Museum of American History
-   National Museum of Natural History
-   National Museum of African American History and Culture
-   National Museum of the American Indian
-   National Air and Space Museum
-   Smithsonian American Art Museum
-   National Portrait Gallery
-   Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden

**Timeline**

To ensure clarity and coordination across all parties involved, we have
developed the following implementation timeline:

Within 30 days of receipt of this letter, we anticipate:

-   Each museum to submit all requested materials outlined in the first
    four bullet points above, including current exhibition descriptions,
    draft plans for upcoming shows, America 250 programming materials,
    and internal guidelines used in exhibition development.
-   Review of America 250 exhibition and program planning and connect
    with curators and staff about their specific proposals.
-   A staff liaison from each museum will be designated to serve as the
    primary point of contact throughout the review process.
-   Our team will begin on-site observational visits, conducting
    walkthroughs of current exhibitions to document themes, visitor
    experience, and visual messaging.

Within 75 days:

-   Museums are asked to submit the remaining requested documentation
    (items 5 through 10), including promotional literature, grant data,
    educational materials, and guided tour content.

<!-- -->

-   Our team will begin scheduling and conducting voluntary interviews
    with curators and senior staff. These conversations will help us
    better understand each museum’s goals and the broader curatorial
    vision guiding the institution.
-   Each museum should finalize and submit its updated plan to
    commemorate America’s 250th anniversary and ensure coordination with
    the White House Salute to America 250 Task Force to align messaging
    and public engagement.

Within 120 days:

-   Museums should begin implementing content corrections where
    necessary, replacing divisive or ideologically driven language with
    unifying, historically accurate, and constructive descriptions
    across placards, wall didactics, digital displays, and other
    public-facing materials.

If all benchmarks are met on schedule, we anticipate completing our
review and preparing a final report for your review in early 2026. This
report will include museum-specific assessments, institutional trends,
and constructive recommendations for future exhibition strategy.

We view this process as a collaborative and forward-looking
opportunity—one that empowers museum staff to embrace a revitalized
curatorial vision rooted in the strength, breadth, and achievements of
the American story. By focusing on **Americanism**—the people,
principles, and progress that define our nation—we can work together to
renew the Smithsonian’s role as the world’s leading museum institution.

We look forward to working alongside you and your team to ensure these
iconic institutions remain vibrant, trusted, and inspiring for
generations to come.
