title: Presidential Message on National Shooting Sports Month
---
 
From the earliest days of our great national story, hunters, fishers,
sportsmen, and gun owners have carried forth a storied legacy of
recreation and competition, proudly embodying our timeless principles of
liberty, responsibility, and self-reliance.  This National Shooting
Sports Month, my Administration honors these cherished American
traditions—and we pledge to keep them alive and flourishing for
generations to come.

Since the ratification of the Second Amendment in 1791, shooting sports
have instilled the values of focus, discipline, and confidence in our
citizens—connecting generations, binding together communities, and
reminding us of the freedoms that define our Republic.  Sports like
hunting and fishing also provide a glimpse into the beauties of God’s
creation and allow countless Americans to experience the splendors of
the great outdoors.  For as long as I am President, the Federal
Government will abide by the premise that the God-given right to bear
arms shall not be infringed.

This National Shooting Sports Month, we honor the generations of
sportsmen who have carried forward our traditions of marksmanship,
responsibility, outdoorsmanship, and freedom.  We encourage every
citizen to promote a culture of firearm safety.  And above all, we
recommit to the eternal truth that our constitutional rights do not come
from the hands of government, but from the hands of Almighty God.
