Recalling the Joint Statement on U.S.-China Economic and Trade Meeting

Reflecting on their meetings in London on June 9 and 10, 2025, and in

1.  The United States will continue to modify the application of the
    additional *ad valorem* rate of duty on articles of China (including
    articles of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the
    Macau Special Administrative Region) set forth in Executive Order
    14257 of April 2, 2025, by suspending 24 percentage points of that
    rate for an additional period of 90 days, starting on August 12,
    2025, while retaining the remaining *ad valorem* rate of 10 percent
    on those articles pursuant to the terms of said Order.

    10 percent on those articles, and (2) adopt or maintain all
    necessary administrative measures to suspend or remove the
    non-tariff countermeasures taken against the United States as agreed
