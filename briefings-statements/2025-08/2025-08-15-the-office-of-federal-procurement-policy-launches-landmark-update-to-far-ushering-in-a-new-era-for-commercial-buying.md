**The Office of Federal Procurement Policy Launches Landmark Update to
FAR, Ushering in a New Era for Commercial Buying**

**Washington, D.C.** – Today, the White House Office of Management and
Budget’s Office of Federal Procurement Policy announced the launch of a
historic update to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), marking the
most significant reform to federal commercial buying procedures ***in
over four decades***.  This action is part of the Revolutionary FAR
Overhaul (RFO), which is returning the FAR to its statutory roots,
rewritten in plain language, while removing non-statutory rules when
they are not essential to sound procurement. 

Under today’s action, agencies are authorized to immediately begin
eliminating one-third of requirements from their future contracts that
are not required by statute or executive orders and have little to do
with contract outcomes.  This deregulation, combined with more
streamlined buying procedures, will make it easier for agencies to
leverage commercially-available solutions, including the innovations of
small businesses, to provide better, more cost-effective services to
taxpayers.

***“The old rules were built for paperwork; the new rules are built for
performance. With each deviation, we’re clearing out red tape and making
space for better value, timely delivery, and more robust competition. 
This will open the door for increased participation by innovative small
business manufacturers, new entrants, and others who have not
traditionally been willing or able to work with our agencies,”*** said
Dr. Kevin Rhodes, senior advisor to OMB Director Russell Vought.

OFPP along with FAR Council is releasing the *FAR Companion Guide,
Practitioner’s Albums,* and *Category Guide*. 

-   *The FAR Companion Guide* provides strategic “how to” tips and other
    insights from experienced practitioners across the government on
    using the new streamlined FAR to meet taxpayer needs. 
-   *The Practitioner’s Albums* provide tested learning tools to
    accelerate adoption of innovative practices for getting better
    contract outcomes. 
-   *The Category Guide* includes practical advice from category
    managers for getting the most out of best-in-class and other
    preferred government-wide contracts.  These tools will enable the
    Federal Government’s acquisition workforce to quickly understand and
    implement the streamlined FAR.

Also, as part of today’s announcement, OFPP is directing agencies to use
government-wide contracts for common commercial products and services
including “best-in-class” and “preferred” contracts, rather than
maintaining their own contracts.  New criteria will be created by OFPP
to qualify as a “Best in Class” contract for mandatory use in ways that
align with the Administration’s priorities, including the best deal for
taxpayers.  Where a best-in-class contract does not meet needs, the
agency will be expected to consider other “preferred” governmentwide
contracts.

Other actions announced by OFPP include:

-   The newly issued deviations eliminate outdated requirements—such as
    paper-based pricing lists and duplicative contract approvals—and
    consolidate key procedures under a modernized FAR Part 8.
-   FAR Parts 38 and 51 have been officially retired and the
    centralization of information and supply chain security policies
    into a single FAR part to make requirements easier to find, both for
    the workforce and contractors.
-   Common-sense changes that will make it easier over time for
    contractors to sign up and maintain their registration with the
    Federal Government in the System for Award Management

Upcoming releases of the RFO will focus on emerging technologies,
pricing transparency, and agency accountability.

**BACKGROUND**

The FAR is the primary set of rules that governs how federal agencies
purchase goods and services. It ensures consistency, fairness, and
transparency across government contracts, helping agencies obtain the
best value while complying with federal laws and policies.

The Revolutionary FAR Overhaul is the most significant reform to the FAR
in its 41-year history. To date, the FAR Council has provided relief
from more than 500 burdensome requirements for agencies and contractors,
with over 1,000 total expected to be eliminated by the time the
regulatory roll-back is complete. These reforms open the door for
increased participation by innovative small businesses, manufacturers,
new entrants, and others who have not traditionally worked with federal
agencies.

The streamlined FAR and non-regulatory resources will collectively form
the *Strategic Acquisition Guidance (SAG)* that provides a common-sense
authoritative foundation for nimble response and delivery of mission
capability.
