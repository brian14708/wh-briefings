title: Historic Pocket Rescission Package Eliminates Woke, Weaponized, and Wasteful
  Spending
---
 
**<u>THIS HISTORIC POCKET RESCISSION PACKAGE ELIMINATES WOKE,
WEAPONIZED, AND WASTEFUL SPENDING</u>** 

The Trump Administration is committed to getting America’s fiscal house
in order by cutting government spending that is woke, weaponized, and
wasteful. Now, for the first time in **50 years**, the President is
using his authority under the *Impoundment Control Act* to deploy a
pocket rescission, cancelling $5 billion in foreign aid and
international organization funding that violates the President’s America
First priorities.  
 

**<u>EXAMPLES OF WHAT THE RESCINDED ACCOUNTS FUND</u>**

***United States Agency for International Development (USAID) –
Development Assistance (DA) – $3.2 billion***  
The Development Assistance (DA) account was established to fund programs
that work to end poverty in the developing world. However, the account
has come to bankroll initiatives that are antithetical to American
values and represented the worst of USAID’s woke excesses. Development
Assistance has provided endless handouts that allow recipient
governments to eschew responsibilities to their own citizens, rather
than equipping countries to build their own workforces and
self-reliance. This account has been used to fund radical, leftist
priorities, including climate change, diversity, equity, and inclusion
(DEI), LGBTQ activities, and other projects like baking and beauty
therapy in Zimbabwe that are of no value to American taxpayers and
American foreign policy interests. Examples include:

-   $400 million per year for global climate grift projects like:
    -   A partnership with the Green Climate Fund, for the Barbados
        Blue-Green Bank for climate change mitigation.

    <!-- -->

    -   $650,000 for micro-insurance for smallholder farmers and
        microbusinesses in Colombia for climate disaster response.
    -   $24.6 million to build climate resilience in Honduras.
    -   $38.6 million for biodiversity and low-emissions development in
        West Africa.
-   $60,000 for listening tours on local development in Timor-Leste.
-   $12,000 for “telling the USAID story” in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
-   $13.4 million for civic engagement in Zimbabwe.

***USAID and Department of State (State) – Democracy Fund – $322
million***  
Thisaccount funds the “democracy promotion activities” of the Department
of State and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). In
practice, so-called democracy promotion activities undermine American
values, weaken the perception of America abroad, and interfere with the
sovereignty of other countries—including our allies. For example, this
account funded “gender responsive governance” and “strengthening
information integrity, equality, and democracy for LGBTQI+ populations.”

This action would eliminate programs that have conducted censorship
operations and meddled in elections in foreign countries. This proposal
aligns with the Administration’s efforts to return funding from wasteful
foreign assistance programs to the American taxpayers.

-   $2.7 million to advance “inclusive democracy” in South Africa
    through the Democracy Works Foundation, which has published articles
    such as “The Problem with Whiteness,” and “The Problem with White
    People.” One article claims that White South Africans are “not even
    aware” of the “hostility they unleash” against black people; another
    lauds terrorism and communism as an effective means of
    deconstructing White Afrikaner identity.
-   $4 million for the New Alliance for Global Equality to advance
    “global LGBTQI+ awareness.”
-   $3.9 million to promote “democracy” for LGBTQI+ populations in the
    Western Balkans.
-   $2 million for “Organizing for Feminist Democratic Principles” in
    Africa
-   $40 million to address “the needs, opportunities, and challenges
    identified by activists, and other civic actors engaged in
    nonviolent collective action”

***State – Contribution to International Organizations (CIO) – $521
million***  
This account provides funding for the assessed contributions to the
United Nations (UN), UN-Affiliated organizations, and various other
international organizations that do not support major U.S. policies or
priorities or have been operating contrary to American interests for
many years. This account funded:

-   $45 million to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) is the
    regional arm of the World Health Organization, and has faced
    credible accusations of forced labor and human trafficking of Cuban
    doctors.
-   $75 million per year to the United Nations Educational, Scientific
    and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), which works to advance divisive
    social and cultural causes, with an outsized focus on the globalist
    ideological agenda in the UN’s “Sustainable Development Goals” and
    has long fostered antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment.
-   $29 million to the toothless World Trade Organization (WTO), which
    has for decades aided and abetted global trade cheating by the
    Chinese Communist party.
-   $107 million for the International Labor Organization (ILO), a group
    that works to unionize foreign workers and punish U.S. corporate
    interests abroad.
-   U.S. contributions to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
    Development (OECD) facilitated a harmful global tax deal, allowing
    other countries to dictate American tax policy.
-   U.S. budget support for countless organizations like the Colombo
    Plan Council for Technical Cooperation, the International Tropical
    Timber Organization, and the Pan American Institute on Geography and
    History.
-   $2.3 million for desert locust risk reduction in the Central Region
    and Horn of Africa, with a focus on “gender equality,”
    “interculturality,” and supporting “indigenous peoples.”

***State – Contributions for International Peacekeeping Activities
(CIPA) – $393 millio*n**  
This account provides payments for the U.S. share of United Nations (UN)
peacekeeping assessments. UN peacekeeping without specific, measurable,
and time-bound goals simply does not work, as the world recognized just
this week when voting to wind down the failed 40-year mission in
Lebanon. Through America First diplomacy, the President has ended more
wars in 8 months than the UN has in 80 years.

UN peacekeeping has been fraught with waste and abuse, as evidenced by
the ongoing sexual exploitation and abuse in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo and the Central African Republic. There have been thousands of
credible allegations of sexual abuse and other crimes against UN
peacekeepers from across the world, including when underage girls in
Kosovo were kidnapped, tortured, and prostituted – with UN peacekeepers
driving demand for these horrific practices. The UN even admitted that
peacekeepers were part of the problem in trafficking. 

-   In 2023, 43 people were killed during demonstrations against the
    Democratic Republic of the Congo Mission and DRC presidential
    candidates have threatened to remove the UN’s consent to operate. 
-   In addition to sex exploitation and abuse, the Central African
    Republic mission has become fully aligned with Russia which
    continues to extract the country’s natural resources.
-   The Mali mission’s failure to retain host country consent and
    protect civilians is another stain on the UN’s tattered history of
    peacekeeping.

***IAP – Peacekeeping Operations – $445 million***  
This account is a slush fund used to support projects counter to a core
security focus, including hybrid energy power generation pilot projects
in Nepal and South Sudan. This action would eliminate programs, such as
the Global Peace Operations Initiative, and undirected Africa Regional
funding but will not impact the United States’ commitment to the
Egyptian-Israeli Treaty of Peace through our contributions to the
Multinational Force and Observers.

-   Hundreds of millions in security assistance have been provided to
    Niger, and yet in 2023, its military overthrew the democratically
    elected government, wasting American taxpayers’ investments. Over
    $30 million of PKO funding was planned in 2023, the same year the
    coup occurred.
-   Annually, $71 million of PKO’s funds have been allocated to the
    Global Peace Operations Initiative to ready other countries’
    militaries to support UN peacekeeping. Not only is the U.S.
    overpaying its assessed contributions, but it pays twice to pick up
    global slack. Programs undergoing termination include:
    -   Nearly $11 million for armored personnel carriers for Uruguay’s
        quick reaction force.

    <!-- -->

    -   Nearly $4 million for infrastructure and facilities at the
        Zambia Training Center.

    <!-- -->

    -   Nearly $3 million for barracks for Kazakhstan peacekeepers.

    <!-- -->

    -   Over $500,000 for a body armor pilot program in Ghana.
-   Nearly $300 million annually to Somalia for peacekeeping and UN
    programs that have manifestly failed to stop piracy or provide
    lasting peace and security.
