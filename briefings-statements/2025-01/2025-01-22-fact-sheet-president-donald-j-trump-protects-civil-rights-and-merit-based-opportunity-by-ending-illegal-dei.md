title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Protects Civil Rights and Merit-Based
  Opportunity by Ending Illegal DEI'

**PROTECTING CIVIL RIGHTS AND EXPANDING INDIVIDUAL OPPORTUNITY**: Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an historic Executive Order that
protects the civil rights of all Americans and expands individual
opportunity by terminating radical DEI preferencing in federal
contracting and directing federal agencies to relentlessly combat
private sector discrimination. It enforces long-standing federal
statutes and faithfully advances the Constitution’s promise of
colorblind equality before the law. This comprehensive order is the most
important federal civil rights measure in decades:

-   It terminates “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI)
    discrimination in the federal workforce, and in federal contracting
    and spending.
    -   Federal hiring, promotions, and performance reviews will reward
        individual initiative, skills, performance, and hard work and
        not, under any circumstances, DEI-related factors, goals,
        policies, mandates, or requirements.
-   The order requires OMB to streamline the federal contracting process
    to enhance speed and efficiency, reduce costs, and require Federal
    contractors and subcontractors to comply with our civil rights laws.
    -   It revokes Executive Order 11246 contracting criteria mandating
        affirmative action
    -   It bars the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs from
        pushing contractors to balance their workforce based on race,
        sex, gender identity, sexual preference, or religion.
    -   It requires simple and unmistakable affirmation that contractors
        will not engage in illegal discrimination, including illegal
        DEI.   
-   It directs all departments and agencies to take strong action to end
    private sector DEI discrimination, including civil compliance
    investigations.
-   It mandates the Attorney General and the Secretary of Education
    issue joint guidance regarding the measures and practices required
    to comply with the Supreme Court’s decision in *Students for Fair
    Admissions v. Harvard*.

**RESTORING THE VALUES OF INDIVIDUAL DIGNITY, HARD WORK, AND
EXCELLENCE**: Individual dignity, hard work, and excellence are
fundamental to American greatness. This Executive Order reaffirms these
values by ending the Biden-Harris Administration’s anti-constitutional
and deeply demeaning “equity” mandates, terminating DEI, and protecting
civil rights:

-   Reversing the progress made in the decades since the Civil Rights
    Act of 1964 toward a colorblind and competence-based workplace,
    radical DEI has dangerously tainted many of our critical businesses
    and influential institutions, including the federal government.
-   In the private sector, many corporations and universities use DEI as
    an excuse for biased and unlawful employment practices and illegal
    admissions preferences, ignoring the fact that DEI’s foundational
    rhetoric and ideas foster intergroup hostility and authoritarianism.
    -   Billions of dollars are spent annually on DEI, but rather than
        reducing bias and promoting inclusion, DEI creates and then
        amplifies prejudicial hostility and exacerbates interpersonal
        conflict.

**PRESIDENT TRUMP PROMISED AND DELIVERED**: President Trump promised to
terminate DEI in the federal government, protect equal opportunity, and
force schools to end discriminatory admissions policies, and he
delivered. Every man and woman should have the opportunity to go as far
as their hard work, individual initiative, and competence can take them.
In America, excellence, grit, and determination is our strength.
