MEMORANDUM TO THE HEADS OF DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES

FROM: Matthew J. Vaeth, Acting Director, Office of Management and
Budget 

Kevin Hassett, Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and
Director of the National Economic Council

SUBJECT: Guidance Regarding Section 7 of the Executive Order *Unleashing
American Energy*

The directive in section 7 of the Executive Order entitled *Unleashing
American Energy* requires agencies to immediately pause disbursement of
funds appropriated under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Public Law
117-169) or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law
117-58).  This pause only applies to funds supporting programs,
projects, or activities that may be implicated by the policy established
in Section 2 of the order. This interpretation is consistent with
section 7’s heading (“Terminating the Green New Deal”) and its reference
to the “law and the policy outlined in section 2 of th\[e\] order.”

For the purposes of implementing section 7 of the Order, funds
supporting the “Green New Deal” refer to any appropriations for
objectives that contravene the policies established in section 2.
 Agency heads may disburse funds as they deem necessary after consulting
with the Office of Management and Budget.
