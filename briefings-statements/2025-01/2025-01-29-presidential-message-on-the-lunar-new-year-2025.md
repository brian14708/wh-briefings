title: Presidential Message on the Lunar New Year, 2025
---
 
Melania and I send our warmest greetings to those in the United States
and around the world who are celebrating the Lunar New Year.  
   
Our Nation is blessed with a passionate and strong Asian-American
community that has made countless contributions to our proud history.
 For many Americans of Asian heritage, this is a time of rich family
traditions.  As people gather together for fireworks and parades, The
First Lady and I join them in celebrating and welcoming the Year of the
Snake.  
   
Traditionally, the snake is associated with wisdom, spirituality, and
good fortune.  As we begin America’s golden age, I ask God to bless our
Nation with these gifts—may this year bring peace, happiness, and
success to all.  
   
Happy New Year!
