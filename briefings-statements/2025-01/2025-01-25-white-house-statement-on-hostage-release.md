title: White House Statement on Hostage Release
---
 
“Today the world celebrates as President Trump secured the release of
four more Israeli hostages who were, for far too long, held against
their will by Hamas in horrific conditions. The United States will
continue with its great partner Israel to push for the release of all
remaining hostages and the pursuit of peace throughout the region.”
