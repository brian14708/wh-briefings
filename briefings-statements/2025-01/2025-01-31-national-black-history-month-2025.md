title: National Black History Month, 2025
---
 
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA   
A PROCLAMATION

  
 Today, I am very honored to recognize February 2025 as National Black
History Month.  
  
     Every year, National Black History Month is an occasion to
celebrate the contributions of so many black American patriots who have
indelibly shaped our Nation’s history.  
  
     Throughout our history, black Americans have been among our
country’s most consequential leaders, shaping the cultural and political
destiny of our Nation in profound ways.  American heroes such as
Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, Thomas Sowell, Justice Clarence
Thomas, and countless others represent what is best in America and her
citizens.  Their achievements, which have monumentally advanced the
tradition of equality under the law in our great country, continue to
serve as an inspiration for all Americans.  We will also never forget
the achievements of American greats like Tiger Woods, who have pushed
the boundaries of excellence in their respective fields, paving the way
for others to follow.   
  
     This National Black History Month, as America prepares to enter a
historic Golden Age, I want to extend my tremendous gratitude to black
Americans for all they have done to bring us to this moment, and for the
many future contributions they will make as we advance into a future of
limitless possibility under my Administration.  
  
     NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States
of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 2025 as
National Black History Month.  I call upon public officials, educators,
librarians, and all the people of the United States to observe this
month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.  
  
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
thirty-first day of January, in the year of our Lord
two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States
of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.
