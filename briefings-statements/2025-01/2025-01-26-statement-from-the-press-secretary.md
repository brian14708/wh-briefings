title: Statement from the Press Secretary

“The Government of Colombia has agreed to all of President Trump’s
terms, including the unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from
Colombia returned from the United States, including on U.S. military
aircraft, without limitation or delay. Based on this agreement, the
fully drafted IEEPA tariffs and sanctions will be held in reserve, and
not signed, unless Colombia fails to honor this agreement. The visa
sanctions issued by the State Department, and enhanced inspections from
Customs and Border Protection, will remain in effect until the first
planeload of Colombian deportees is successfully returned. Today’s
events make clear to the world that America is respected again.
President Trump will continue to fiercely protect our nation’s
sovereignty, and he expects all other nations of the world to fully
cooperate in accepting the deportation of their citizens illegally
present in the United States.”
