STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY

H.R. 21 – Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act  
(Rep. Ann Wagner, R-MO-2, and 151 cosponsors)

The Administration strongly supports H.R. 21 the Born-Alive Abortion
Survivors Protection Act, and applauds the House for its efforts to
protect the most vulnerable and prevent infanticide.

Current law fails to provide adequate protections, including adequate
requirements for the provision of medical care, for vulnerable newborns
who survive an abortion attempt. If enacted, H.R. 21 would require any
healthcare practitioner who is present at the time that such a child is
born to exercise care to preserve the child’s life and health, and to
ensure the child is immediately transported and admitted to a hospital.
The bill would also require a healthcare practitioner, or hospital
employee, to immediately report a violation of these requirements. H.R.
21 would establish a civil right of action for, and prevent criminal
prosecution and penalties from being brought against, the mothers of
such children.

As President Trump established through Executive Order 13952 of
September 25, 2020, it is the policy of the United States to recognize
the human dignity and inherent worth of every newborn or other infant
child, regardless of prematurity or disability, and to ensure for each
child due protection under the law.

A baby that survives an abortion and is born alive into this world
should be treated just like any other baby born alive. H.R. 21 would
properly amend current law to ensure that the life of one baby is not
treated as being more or less valuable than another.

the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend he sign
it into law.</span>
