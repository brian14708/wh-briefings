  Financial Technology'

**ENSURING U.S. LEADERSHIP IN DIGITAL FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to establish
regulatory clarity for digital financial technology and secure America’s
position as the world’s leader in the digital asset economy, driving
innovation and economic opportunity for all Americans.

-   The Executive Order establishes the Presidential Working Group on
    Digital Asset Markets to strengthen U.S. leadership in digital
    finance.
    -   The Working Group will be tasked with developing a Federal
        regulatory framework governing digital assets, including
        stablecoins, and evaluating the creation of a strategic national
        digital assets stockpile.

    -   The Working Group will be chaired by the White House AI & Crypto
        Czar and include the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairman of
        the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the heads of other
        relevant departments and agencies.

    <!-- -->

    -   The White House AI & Crypto Czar will engage leading experts in
        digital assets and digital markets to ensure that the actions of
        the Working Group are informed by expertise beyond the Federal
        Government.
-   The Executive Order directs departments and agencies with
    identifying and making recommendations to the Working Group on any
    regulations and other agency actions affecting the digital assets
    sector that should be rescinded or modified.
-   The Executive Order prohibits agencies from undertaking any action
    to establish, issue, or promote central bank digital currencies
    (CBDCs).
-   The Executive Order revokes the previous Administration’s Digital
    Assets Executive Order and the Treasury Department’s Framework for
    International Engagement on Digital Assets which suppressed
    innovation and undermined U.S. economic liberty and global
    leadership in digital finance.

**ELIMINATING REGULATORY OVERREACH ON DIGITAL ASSETS AND PROTECTING
AMERICAN ECONOMIC LIBERTY:** President Trump is fulfilling his promise
to make the United States the “crypto capital of the planet.”

-   President Trump will help make the United States the center of
    digital financial technology innovation by halting aggressive
    enforcement actions and regulatory overreach that have stifled
    crypto innovation under previous administrations.
-   President Trump’s policy vision marks an unprecedented step towards
    welcoming in a new era for digital financial technology; one in
    which President Trump’s administration will work towards ensuring
    innovation thrives, regulatory frameworks are clear, and economic
    liberty is protected.
-   The growth of digital financial technology in America must remain
    unhindered by restrictive regulations or unnecessary government
    interference.
