---
 
## MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN

-   President Trump will take bold action to secure our border and
    protect American communities.
-   This includes ending Biden’s catch-and-release policies, reinstating
    Remain in Mexico, building the wall, ending asylum for illegal
    border crossers, cracking down on criminal sanctuaries, and
    enhancing vetting and screening of aliens.
-   President Trump’s deportation operation will address the record
    border crossings of criminal aliens under the prior administration.
-   The President is suspending refugee resettlement, after communities
    were forced to house large and unsustainable populations of
    migrants, straining community safety and resources.
-   The Armed Forces, including the National Guard, will engage in
    border security, which is national security, and will be deployed to
    the border to assist existing law enforcement personnel.
-   President Trump will begin the process of designating cartels,
    including the dangerous Tren de Aragua, as foreign terrorist
    organizations and use the Alien Enemies Act to remove them.
-   The Department of Justice will seek the death penalty as the
    appropriate punishment for heinous crimes against humanity,
    including those who kill law enforcement officers and illegal
    migrants who maim and murder Americans.

## MAKE AMERICA AFFORDABLE AND ENERGY DOMINANT AGAIN

-   The President will unleash American energy by ending Biden’s
    policies of climate extremism, streamlining permitting, and
    reviewing for rescission all regulations that impose undue burdens
    on energy production and use, including mining and processing of
    non-fuel minerals.
-   President Trump’s energy actions empower consumer choice in
    vehicles, showerheads, toilets, washing machines, lightbulbs and
    dishwashers.
-   President Trump will declare an energy emergency and use all
    necessary resources to build critical infrastructure.
-   President Trump’s energy policies will end leasing to massive wind
    farms that degrade our natural landscapes and fail to serve American
    energy consumers.
-   President Trump will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord.
-   All agencies will take emergency measures to reduce the cost of
    living.
-   President Trump will announce the America First Trade Policy.
-   America will no longer be beholden to foreign organizations for our
    national tax policy, which punishes American businesses.

## DRAIN THE SWAMP

-   The President will usher a Golden Age for America by reforming and
    improving the government bureaucracy to work for the American
    people. He will freeze bureaucrat hiring except in essential areas
    to end the onslaught of useless and overpaid DEI activists buried
    into the federal workforce. He will pause burdensome and radical
    regulations not yet in effect that Biden announced.
-   President Trump is announcing an unprecedented slate of executive
    orders for rescission.
-   President Trump is planning for improved accountability of
    government bureaucrats. The American people deserve the
    highest-quality service from people who love our country. The
    President will also return federal workers to work, as only 6% of
    employees currently work in person.
-   President Trump is taking swift action to end the weaponization of
    government against political rivals and ordering all document
    retention as required by law. President Trump is also ending the
    unconstitutional censorship by the federal government. No longer
    will government employees pick and require the erasure of entirely
    true speech.
-   On the President’s direction, the State Department will have an
    America-First foreign policy.

## BRING BACK AMERICAN VALUES

-   The President will establish male and female as biological reality
    and protect women from radical gender ideology.
-   American landmarks will be named to appropriately honor our Nation’s
    history.
