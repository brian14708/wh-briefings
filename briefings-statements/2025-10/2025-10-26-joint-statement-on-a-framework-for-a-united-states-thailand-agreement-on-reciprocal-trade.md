title: Joint Statement on a Framework for a United States-Thailand Agreement on Reciprocal
  Trade
---
 
The United States of America (“the United States”) and the Kingdom of
Thailand (“Thailand”) have agreed to **a Framework** for an **Agreement
on Reciprocal Trade** to strengthen our bilateral economic relationship,
which will provide both countries’ exporters unprecedented access to
each other’s markets.  The Agreement on Reciprocal Trade will build upon
our longstanding economic relationship, including the U.S.-Thailand
Treaty of Amity and Economic Relations, signed in 1966, and the
U.S.-Thailand Trade and Investment Framework Agreement, signed in 2002.

Key terms of the Agreement on Reciprocal Trade between the United States
and Thailand will include:

-   Thailand will eliminate tariff barriers on approximately 99 percent
    of goods, covering a full range of U.S. industrial and food and
    agricultural products.

<!-- -->

-   The United States will maintain at 19 percent the reciprocal
    tariffs, as set forth in Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025, as
    amended, on originating goods of Thailand, and will identify
    products from the list set out in Annex III to Executive Order 14346
    of September 5, 2025, Potential Tariff Adjustments for Aligned
    Partners, to receive a zero percent reciprocal tariff rate.

<!-- -->

-   The United States and Thailand will work together to address
    Thailand’s non-tariff barriers that affect bilateral trade.
     Thailand commits to address barriers to U.S. exports, including by:
    accepting U.S. manufactured vehicles manufactured to comply with
    U.S. federal motor vehicle safety and emissions standards; accepting
    U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) certificates and prior
    marketing authorizations for medical devices and pharmaceuticals as
    sufficient to meet Thailand’s requirements; issuing import permits
    for U.S. ethanol for fuel; amending its customs laws to remove the
    customs reward system related to customs breaches and penalties; and
    adopting and implementing good regulatory practices.

<!-- -->

-   Thailand will address and prevent barriers to U.S. food and
    agricultural products in the Thai market, including expediting
    access for U.S. Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS)-certified
    meat and poultry products. Thailand will additionally address trade
    irritants and ensure requirements imposed on U.S. horticultural
    products, including for distiller dried grains with solubles, are
    science- and risk-based.  Thailand commits to accept currently
    agreed certificates issued by U.S. regulatory authorities.  

<!-- -->

-   The United States and Thailand will finalize commitments related to
    protecting internationally recognized labor rights, including by
    working to amend its law to ensure that workers’ rights to freedom
    of association and collective bargaining are fully protected; and
    strengthen enforcement of its labor laws, including by addressing
    violations in sectors with a high-risk for forced labor and child
    labor.

<!-- -->

-   Thailand commits to adopt and maintain high levels of environmental
    protection and to effectively enforce its environmental laws,
    including by: taking measures to combat trade in illegally harvested
    forest products; encouraging a more resource efficient economy;
    accepting and fully implementing the World Trade Organization (WTO)
    *Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies*; and combating illegal,
    unreported, and unregulated fishing and illegal wildlife trade.

<!-- -->

-   The United States and Thailand will finalize commitments on
    intellectual property, including on geographical indications.
     Thailand commits to resolve long-standing intellectual property
    issues, including regarding enforcement against trademark
    counterfeiting and copyright piracy, rogue collective management
    organizations, circumvention of technological protection measures,
    and the patent backlog.

<!-- -->

-   The United States and Thailand will finalize commitments by Thailand
    to address barriers impacting digital trade, services, and
    investment.  Thailand commits to refrain from imposing digital
    services taxes or measures that discriminate against U.S. digital
    services or digital products; to ensure the free transfer of data
    across trusted borders for the conduct of business; to support a
    permanent moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions
    at the WTO; to refrain from imposing screen quotas for film; to ease
    foreign ownership restrictions for U.S. investment in Thailand’s
    telecommunications sector; and to remove in-country processing
    requirements for all domestic retail electronic payment transactions
    for debit cards issued in Thailand.

<!-- -->

-   The United States and Thailand will finalize commitments to address
    distortionary behaviors of state-owned enterprises.

<!-- -->

-   The United States and Thailand will strengthen economic and national
    security cooperation to enhance supply chain resilience and
    innovation through complementary actions to address unfair trade
    practices of third parties, and cooperate on export controls,
    investment security, and combatting duty evasion.

<!-- -->

-   In addition, the United States and Thailand take note of the
    forthcoming commercial deals between U.S. and Thai companies in the
    agriculture, energy, and aviation sectors, including:

<!-- -->

-   Purchases of agriculture products, including feed corn, soybean
    meal, and dried distiller grains with solubles with an estimated
    value of $2.6 billion per year;
    -   Purchases of energy products, including liquefied natural gas,
        crude oil, and ethane, with an estimated value of $5.4 billion
        per year; and

    <!-- -->

    -   Procurement of 80 U.S. aircraft, totaling $18.8 billion.

In the coming weeks, the United States and Thailand will negotiate and
finalize the Agreement on Reciprocal Trade, prepare the Agreement for
signature, and undertake domestic formalities in advance of the
Agreement entering into force.
