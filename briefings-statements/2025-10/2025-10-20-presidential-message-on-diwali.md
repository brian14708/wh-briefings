title: Presidential Message on Diwali
---
 
Today, I send my best wishes to every American celebrating Diwali—the
“Festival of Lights.”

For many Americans, Diwali is a timeless reminder of light’s victory
over darkness.  It is also a time to bring families and friends together
to celebrate community, draw strength from hope, and embrace a lasting
spirit of renewal.  As millions of citizens light diyas and lanterns, we
rejoice in the eternal truth that good will always triumph over evil. 

To every American celebrating Diwali, may this observance bring abiding
serenity, prosperity, hope, and peace.
