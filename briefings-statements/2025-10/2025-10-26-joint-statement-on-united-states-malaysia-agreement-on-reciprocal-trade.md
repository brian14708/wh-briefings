---
 
The Government of the United States of America (“the United States”) and
the Government of Malaysia have reached agreement on an **Agreement on
Reciprocal Trade** (“the Agreement”) to strengthen our bilateral
economic relationship, which will provide both countries’ exporters
unprecedented access to each other’s markets.  The Agreement will build
upon our longstanding economic relationship, including the United
States-Malaysia Trade Investment Framework Agreement signed in 2004.

Key terms of the Agreement on Reciprocal Trade between the United States
and Malaysia include:

-   Malaysia has committed to provide significant preferential market
    access for U.S. industrial goods exports, including chemicals,
    machinery and electrical equipment, metals, and passenger vehicles,
    and for U.S. agricultural exports including dairy, horticultural
    products, poultry, processed products, beverages, pork, rice, and
    fuel ethanol.

-   The United States has committed to maintain at 19 percent the
    reciprocal tariffs first set forth in Executive Order 14257 of April
    2, 2025, as amended, on originating goods of Malaysia, and has
    identified products from the list set out in Annex III to Executive
    Order 14346 of September 5, 2025, Potential Tariff Adjustments for
    Aligned Partners, to receive a zero percent reciprocal tariff rate.

-   Malaysia has committed to address non-tariff barriers that affect
    bilateral trade in priority industrial areas.  Malaysia has
    committed to accepting U.S. manufactured vehicles built to U.S.
    motor vehicle safety and emissions standards; streamlining import
    licenses for U.S. alloy steel and pipe products and steel-containing
    goods; streamlining halal requirements for products including
    cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices; and addressing U.S.
    concerns with conformity assessment procedures. 

<!-- -->

-   Malaysia has committed to address and prevent non-tariff barriers to
    U.S. food and agricultural products in the Malaysian market,
    including by accepting currently agreed certificates issued by U.S.
    regulatory authorities; streamlining halal and facility registration
    requirements to facilitate imports of U.S. food and agricultural
    products; and implementation of regionalization of the United States
    for animal diseases. 

<!-- -->

-   Malaysia has committed to adopt and maintain high levels of
    environmental protection and to effectively enforce its
    environmental laws, including by taking measures to address illegal
    logging, fisheries subsidies, illegal, unreported, and unregulated
    fishing, and illegal wildlife trade.

-   Malaysia has committed to increasing enforcement against notorious
    markets for counterfeiting and piracy.

-   To protect internationally recognized labor rights, Malaysia has
    made commitments on preventing forced labor and effectively
    identifying and addressing labor law violations in sectors with a
    high-risk of forced labor and child labor.

<!-- -->

-   The United States and Malaysia have finalized commitments by
    Malaysia to address barriers impacting digital trade, services, and
    investment.  Malaysia has committed to refrain from imposing digital
    services taxes that discriminate against U.S. companies or requiring
    U.S. social media platforms and cloud service providers to pay into
    Malaysia’s domestic fund; ensure the transfer of data across trusted
    borders, with appropriate protections, for the conduct of business;
    support a permanent moratorium on customs duties on electronic
    transmissions at the World Trade Organization ; and remove
    broadcasting terrestrial airtime restrictions on U.S. programming.

    intellectual property protection and enforcement, customs and trade
    facilitation, good regulatory practices, and distortionary behaviors
    of state-owned enterprises.

<!-- -->

-   The United States and Malaysia have committed to strengthening
    economic and national security cooperation and to enhancing supply
    chain resilience and innovation, addressing duty evasion, and
    cooperating on investment security and export controls.

<!-- -->

-   Malaysia has committed to refrain from banning, or imposing quotas
    on, exports to the United States of critical minerals or rare earth
    elements.  Malaysia has committed to the expedient development of
    its critical minerals and rare earths sectors in partnership with
    U.S. companies, including granting extended operating licenses to
    create certainty for businesses to increase production capacity. 
    Malaysia has committed to ensure no restrictions are imposed on the
    sale of rare earth magnets to U.S. companies.

The United States may positively consider the effect that the Agreement
has on national security, including taking the Agreement into
consideration when taking trade action under section 232 of the Trade
Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862).

Additionally, to support a fair economic relationship between Malaysia
and the United States, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and Bank
Negara Malaysia are in discussion to finalize their mutual understanding
on currency policy.

In the coming weeks, the United States and Malaysia will undertake
domestic formalities in advance of the Agreement entering into force.
