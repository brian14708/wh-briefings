title: Joint Statement on United States-Cambodia Agreement on Reciprocal Trade
---
 
The United States of America (the United States) and the Kingdom of
Cambodia (Cambodia) have reached an **Agreement on Reciprocal Trade** to
strengthen our bilateral economic relationship, which will provide both
countries’ exporters unprecedented access to each other’s markets.  The
Agreement on Reciprocal Trade will build upon our longstanding economic
relationship, including the U.S.-Cambodia Trade and Investment Framework
Agreement signed in 2006.

Key terms of the Agreement on Reciprocal Trade (the Agreement) between
the United States and Cambodia include:

-   Cambodia commits to eliminate tariffs on 100 percent of U.S.
    industrial goods and U.S. food and agricultural products exported to
    Cambodia and has already implemented this commitment.

<!-- -->

-   The United States commits to maintain at 19 percent the reciprocal
    tariffs, as set forth in Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025, as
    amended, on originating goods of Cambodia, and identifies products
    from the list set out in Annex III to Executive Order 14346 of
    September 5, 2025, Potential Tariff Adjustments for Aligned
    Partners, to receive a zero percent reciprocal tariff rate.

<!-- -->

-   The United States and Cambodia commit to address Cambodia’s
    non-tariff barriers that affect bilateral trade in priority areas,
    including addressing import licensing; streamlining regulatory
    requirements and approvals; recognizing U.S. sanitary and
    phytosanitary measures and other measures for food and agricultural
    products; and increasing enforcement against notorious markets for
    counterfeiting and piracy.  

<!-- -->

-   The United States and Cambodia commit to address and prevent
    barriers to U.S. agricultural products in the Cambodian market,
    including with regard to U.S. regulatory oversight and acceptance of
    currently agreed certificates issued by U.S. regulatory
    authorities. 

<!-- -->

-   Cambodia commits to protecting internationally recognized labor
    rights.  Cambodia will adopt and implement a prohibition on the
    importation of goods produced by forced or compulsory labor and
    strengthen enforcement of its labor laws.

<!-- -->

-   Cambodia commits to adopt and maintain high levels of environmental
    protection and to effectively enforce its environmental laws,
    including by taking measures to address illegal logging, fisheries
    subsidies, illegal fishing, and illegal wildlife trade.

<!-- -->

-   The Agreement includes commitments on digital trade, services,
    investment, intellectual property, customs and trade facilitation,
    good regulatory practices, and distortionary behaviors of
    state-owned enterprises.

<!-- -->

-   The United States and Cambodia commit to strengthening economic and
    national security cooperation and to enhancing supply chain
    resilience and innovation through complementary actions to address
    duty evasion and cooperating on investment security and export
    controls.

<!-- -->

-   In addition, the United States and Cambodia take note of the
    forthcoming commercial deal between U.S. and Cambodian companies:

<!-- -->

-   Air Cambodia commits to working jointly with Boeing in support of
    Cambodia’s aviation ecosystem development and Air Cambodia’s growth.

The United States may positively consider the effect that the Agreement
has on national security, including taking the Agreement into
consideration when taking trade action under section 232 of the Trade
Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862).

In the coming weeks, the United States and Cambodia will undertake
domestic formalities in advance of the Agreement entering into force.
