title: Presidential Message on German-American Day, 2025
---
 
Nearly 250 years ago, in the midst of the Revolutionary War, German
military officer Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben helped transform the U.S.
Continental Army from a band of militias into a unified and disciplined
fighting force at Valley Forge, paving the way for our independence. In
the centuries since, the German-American community has immeasurably
fortified our way of life. They have strengthened our schools, fought on
the battlefield in defense of our freedom, developed groundbreaking
innovations, and served our citizens in the highest offices in our land.
Today, we honor the legends of the past and celebrate the pioneers of
the present whose hard work, ingenuity, and faith in God make our
country stronger, freer, and more prosperous.

For many years, the United States and Germany have been enduring
transatlantic partners. To keep our relationship strong, preserve our
rich cultural inheritance, and safeguard the blessings of democracy, my
Administration has led the way in getting our European allies to
dramatically increase defense contributions to NATOâ€”advancing American
interests and ensuring that our security partners uphold their
commitments. Together, we will continue to strengthen our long-standing
friendship and work toward a new era of stability, security, and lasting
peace.

This German-American Day, we honor the determination, courage,
resilience, and towering contributions of German-Americans throughout
our national story. Above all, we pledge to forge a future that
strengthens our shared values and upholds America as one Nation under
God.
