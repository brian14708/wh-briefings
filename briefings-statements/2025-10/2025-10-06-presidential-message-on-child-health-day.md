title: Presidential Message on Child Health Day
---
 
This Child Health Day, and every day, my Administration is committed to
protecting the health and well-being of every American child, equipping
our youngest citizens to lead long and fulfilling lives, and keeping the
American spirit alive and flourishing for years to come.

In recent decades, there has been an unexplained and alarming rise in
chronic illnesses and health problems among American children.  Before
our very eyes, we have seen massive rises in autism, auto-immune
disorders, obesity, diabetes, serious allergies, and mental health
challenges in younger generations. 

My Administration’s Make America Healthy Again Commission is leading the
effort to find out what is going on and provide solutions.  Starting
with reducing chemical exposure and the flood of ultra-processed foods
that pollute children’s plates and returning to real, whole foods that
nourish instead of weaken.  Physical activity is being restored in
schools, once again making exercise an invigorating part of every
child’s day and the Presidential Fitness Test has been reestablished. 

Through this commission, we are also assessing the dangers of widespread
prescriptions of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),
antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and weight loss drugs.  For too long,
the status quo has promoted medication as the first answer to every
challenge, leaving young Americans dependent and often worse off.  My
Administration is committed to finding a better way—encouraging lasting
solutions like exercise, nutrition, and community that builds strong
minds and bodies. 

Earlier this year, I signed into law the *TAKE IT DOWN Act*—a landmark
new law championed by First Lady Melania Trump. Through her leadership
and tireless advocacy, this law provides critical protections for
American children against digital exploitation, including deepfake
abuse, and strengthens safeguards for their online privacy and mental
health. Melania’s commitment to this cause underscores the fact that
protecting our children in the digital age is as vital as looking after
their physical well-being.

Today, the First Lady and I join our fellow Americans in renewing our
resolve to champion the well-being and health of the youngest among us. 
For nearly 250 years, our Nation has been sustained by the vision and
strength of younger generations—and under my leadership, American
children will once again grow, thrive, and lead us into a bigger,
brighter, and healthier future.
