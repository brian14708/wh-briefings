title: Presidential Message on Yom Kippur
---
 
I send my best wishes to the Jewish community before the start of their
solemn observance of Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Hebrew calendar.

Every year, the Jewish faithful spend this Day of Atonement in fasting,
prayer, and spiritual reconciliation.  The last of the Ten Days of
Repentance, believers mark the end of Yom Kippur with the sounding of
the shofar—symbolizing a rekindling of faith and a renewed relationship
with Almighty God.

As you observe this blessed day, my Administration is working to
strengthen our proud national tradition of religious liberty, end
faith-based persecution, and further the sacred cause of peace both at
home and abroad.

We wish the Jewish faithful a meaningful Sabbath of Sabbaths.  May you
be inscribed in the Book of Life, may God bless you, and may He continue
to bless the United States of America.
