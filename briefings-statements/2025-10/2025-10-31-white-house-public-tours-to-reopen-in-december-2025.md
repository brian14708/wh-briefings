title: White House Public Tours to Reopen in December 2025
---
 
The White House will reopen its doors for public tours on Tuesday,
December 2, 2025, with an updated route offering guests the opportunity
to experience the history and beauty of the Peopleâ€™s House.

In celebration of the holiday season, all December tours will feature
the White House Christmas decorations on the State Floor. The
decorations in each room will be thoughtfully designed and curated under
the direction of First Lady Melania Trump. Visitors will have the
opportunity to enjoy the beloved annual tradition that transforms the
White House into a festive reflection of the spirit, warmth, faith, and
hope of the holiday season.

Congressional offices may resume submitting tour requests for their
constituents on Monday, November 3, 2025. Tour availabilities for
December 2025 will open 30 days prior to each potential tour date. Tour
availabilities for January 2026 are slated to be made available to
congressional offices sometime in December. For more information about
public tours of the White House, members of the public are encouraged to
