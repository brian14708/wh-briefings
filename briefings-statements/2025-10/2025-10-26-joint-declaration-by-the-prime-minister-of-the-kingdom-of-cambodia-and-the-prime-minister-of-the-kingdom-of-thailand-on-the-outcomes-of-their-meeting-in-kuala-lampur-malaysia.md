  Lampur, Malaysia
---
 
We, the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Prime Minister
of the Kingdom of Thailand, as witnessed by the President of the United
States of America and the Prime Minister of Malaysia, having met in
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on October 26, 2025, declare the following:

1.  We reaffirm the unwavering commitment to peace and security between
    our two countries — as declared in Putrajaya, Malaysia, on July 28,
    2025 — and reiterate our firm commitment to refrain from the threat
    or use of force, peaceful settlement of disputes, and respect for
    international boundary and of international law, for the promotion
    of peace, security, stability, and prosperity in the region on the
    basis of mutual respect for the independence, sovereignty, equality,
    territorial integrity, and national identity of our respective
    nations. 

<!-- -->

1.  We reaffirm our firm commitment to upholding and implementing the
    agreements reached by both sides at the General Border Committee
    meetings.

<!-- -->

1.  We signed the Terms of Reference (TOR) on the establishment of the
    ASEAN Observer Team (AOT), which will comprise personnel from ASEAN
    Member States with the objective of ensuring the full and effective
    implementation of the ceasefire.  We call on ASEAN Member States to
    provide the appropriate support to ensure the AOT can successfully
    meet its objectives.

<!-- -->

1.  Furthermore, we committed to de-escalating tensions and restoring
    confidence and mutually beneficial relations between the Kingdom of
    Cambodia and the Kingdom of Thailand.  To achieve and reinforce
    these objectives, we agree to the following steps to ensure the full
    and effective implementation of the ceasefire, and restoration of
    peace, security, and stability in the border areas:

-   Implement military de-escalation under the observation and
    verification of the AOT, to include the removal of heavy and
    destructive weapons and equipment from the border and returning them
    back to their respective normal military installations.  In this
    context, both sides will designate their respective teams to discuss
    — with a view to finalizing — a practical and step-by-step action
    plan which will be under the observation of the Interim Observer
    Team, and subsequently the AOT once it is established pursuant to
    the TOR.

<!-- -->

-   Refrain from disseminating or promoting false information,
    accusations, allegations, and harmful rhetoric, whether through
    official government channels or unofficial platforms, in order to
    de-escalate tensions, mitigate negative public sentiment, and foster
    an environment conducive to peaceful dialogue.

<!-- -->

-   Agree to the full and immediate implementation of
    confidence-building measures to restore and maintain confidence,
    mutual trust, and peace along the border; to resolve differences
    peacefully, in the spirit of good neighborliness, friendship, and
    solidarity; and to work towards the restoration of diplomatic
    relations between the two countries. 

<!-- -->

-   Coordinate and implement humanitarian de-mining in the border areas,
    as agreed by the General Border Committee — without prejudice to the
    survey and demarcation of land boundary between both countries — to
    protect civilian lives and contribute to socio-economic development.

<!-- -->

-   Reaffirm our commitment to the settlement of border dispute and
    border demarcation through peaceful means and international law,
    refraining from the threat or use of force or any acts of
    provocation, and recognize the Regional Border Committee, General
    Border Committee, and Joint Boundary Commission (JBC) as the
    bilateral mechanisms to work through border-related issues through
    peaceful means, in accordance with their respective mandates, in
    coordination with local governors, to peacefully manage the
    situation on the ground, including the issues of alleged
    encroachment by either side in accordance with the outcome of the
    discussion under the JBC, and the cessation of all activities which
    expand the scope of the disputes and further escalate tensions. 

1.  Upon effective implementation of above-mentioned measures, both
    sides will recognize the cessation of active hostilities.  Further,
    as a demonstration of Thailand’s desire to promote mutual confidence
    and trust, Thailand undertakes to promptly release the prisoners of
    war.

<!-- -->

1.  We agree to enhance cooperation, information sharing, and strategic
    communications efforts, and strengthen border controls to prevent
    and suppress transnational crimes that impact both our citizens and
    the wider international community.

<!-- -->

1.  We acknowledge the need to chart a course for a bright future not
    bound by conflicts of the past.  Both Governments reaffirm the
    commitment to peacefully resolve disputes in full respect for
    international laws and existing treaties and agreements.  The
    conditions have been created for our nations to look forward and
    embark on building neighborly relations in keeping with the letter
    and spirit of the United Nations Charter and principles enshrined in
    the ASEAN Charter on peaceful conflict resolution, paving the way
    for a new chapter of peace and cooperation between our two nations.

<!-- -->

1.  We express our confidence that this meeting, in the presence of and
    supported by President Donald J. Trump of the United States of
    America and Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim of Malaysia, is a strong
    foundation for mutual respect and the advancement of peace in the
    region.  We note with deep appreciation President Donald J. Trump’s
    significant contributions to advancing the restoration of productive
    bilateral relations between the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Kingdom
    of Thailand.

Signed at Kuala Lumpur on October 26, 2025, in quadruplicate, in the
English language.
