title: Presidential Message on National Forest Products Week
---
 
America’s forests are a source of strength for our economy and a
reflection of our Nation’s natural beauty—they provide the abundant
resources that sustain jobs, build communities, and enrich our lives. 
This National Forest Products Week, we recognize the men and women who
work every day as stewards of our forests and drivers of American
prosperity.  This week and throughout my Presidency, we will advance
policies that support their efforts and secure the benefits of America’s
forests well into the future.

The abundance of our forest products bolsters the national economy by
generating hundreds of billions of dollars every year.  The forest
industry supplies essential materials—from the lumber that builds homes
to the resources that make our communities thrive—supporting millions of
jobs that provide stability and opportunity for American workers.

To harness the full power of our Nation’s bountiful forests, my
Administration is working tirelessly to reverse the barriers imposed by
the previous administration that crushed our economy and stifled
innovation.  Earlier this year, I signed Executive Orders to increase
domestic timber production, enhance forest management, reduce wildfire
risks, and decrease reliance on timber imported from foreign producers. 
I also took action to establish the Make America Beautiful Again
Commission to conserve our Nation’s lands and waters and cut red tape
that stifles effective environmental management.  The Commission is also
expanding access to public lands and waters, ensuring that America’s
forests remain healthy and flourishing.

This week, we acknowledge that America’s forests make our country
strong—and we renew our pledge to preserve our Nation’s rich resources
and bountiful treasures for generations to come.
