title: "United States \u2013 Japan Framework for Securing the Supply of Critical Minerals\
  \ and Rare Earths through Mining and Processing"
---
 
Whereas, critical minerals and rare earths are essential for the
production of advanced technologies;

Whereas, the United States of America (the “United States” or “U.S.”)
and Japan (together, the “Participants”) intend to support the supply of
raw and processed critical minerals and rare earths crucial to the
domestic industries of the United States and Japan;

Whereas, the Participants plan to accomplish this through use of
economic policy tools and coordinated investment to accelerate
development of diversified, liquid, and fair markets for critical
minerals and rare earths;

Whereas, the Participants’ objective is to assist both countries in
achieving resilience and security of critical minerals and rare earths
supply chains, including mining, separation, and processing;

Whereas, the Participants intend to capitalize on their respective
existing mining and processing operations in critical minerals and heavy
and light rare earths as well as new capacity;

Whereas, the Participants recognize that this Framework will continue as
long as both Participants work in good faith and with a cooperative
attitude to strengthen the supply chains between the two countries;

Whereas, the Participants recognize that U.S. and Japanese companies,
through upstream to downstream, are implementing concrete projects to
establish new and secure supply chains, and welcome the continued
advancement of such efforts;

Therefore, the Participants have reached the following recognition on a
common policy framework for the mining and processing of critical
minerals and rare earths.

**Section I**

**Critical Minerals and Rare Earths**

1.  **Securing supply:**  The Participants are intensifying their
    cooperative efforts to accelerate the secure supply of critical
    minerals and rare earths necessary to support domestic industries,
    including advanced technologies and their respective industrial
    bases, by leveraging policy tools such as the United States’ and
    Japan’s financial support mechanisms, trade measures where
    appropriate, and critical minerals stockpiling systems. The
    participants will intensify efforts to promote dialogue amongst
    upstream and downstream companies to facilitate the diversification
    of supply chains.

<!-- -->

1.  **Investment in mining and processing:**  The Participants intend to
    mobilize government and private sector support including for capital
    and operational expenditures via grants, guarantees, loans, or
    equity; offtake arrangements; insurance; or regulatory facilitation.

<!-- -->

1.  **Project selection:**  The Participants intend to jointly identify
    projects of interest to address gaps in supply chains for critical
    minerals and rare earths, including derivative products such as
    permanent magnets, batteries, catalysts, and optical materials.

<!-- -->

1.  **Financing:** In addition to the steps above, within six months of
    the date of this Framework, the Participants intend to take measures
    to provide financial support to selected projects to generate end
    product for delivery to buyers in the United States and Japan and,
    as appropriate, like-minded countries.

<!-- -->

1.  **Investment support:**  The Participants intend to work together to
    develop new or bespoke mechanisms to mobilize private capital and
    strengthen critical minerals and rare earths supply chains.

<!-- -->

1.  **Ministerial:  **The Participants have decided to promote
    investment in mining by convening a bilateral Mining, Minerals and
    Metals Investment Ministerial within 180 days of the date of this
    Framework within which a dialogue with relevant stakeholders will be
    held to identify approaches and priorities for investment to meet
    our joint objectives.

<!-- -->

1.  **Permitting:**  The Participants are taking measures to accelerate,
    streamline, or deregulate permitting timelines and processes,
    including for permits for critical minerals and rare earths mining,
    separation, and processing within their respective domestic
    regulatory systems, consistent with applicable law.

-   **Fair Competition and Pricing Mechanisms:  **The Participants will
    work to secure their critical minerals and rare earths supply chains
    by addressing non-market policies and unfair trade practices,
    including by establishing high-standard marketplaces that reflect
    the real costs of responsible extraction, processing, and trade of
    critical minerals and rare earths, and pricing measures to support
    alternative projects and such high-standard markets, in line with
    their respective policy tools.  The Participants will work with
    international partners to advance these intentions.

<!-- -->

-   **Asset Sales:**  The Participants commit to work together toward
    developing new authorities or strengthening existing authorities and
    diplomatic tools that review and deter critical minerals and rare
    earths asset sales on national security grounds, in accordance with
    their respective domestic laws.

<!-- -->

-   **Scrap:**  The Participants commit to investing in minerals
    recycling technologies and to working together to ensure management
    of critical minerals and rare earth scrap that supports supply chain
    diversification.

<!-- -->

-   **Third parties:**  The Participants intend to work together with
    other international partners as appropriate to ensure supply chain
    security and utilize existing engagement mechanisms.

1.  **Geological mapping:  **The Participants intend to cooperate to
    assist in mapping mineral resources as mutually determined in the
    United States, Japan, and elsewhere, to support diversified critical
    mineral and rare earths supply chains.

<!-- -->

1.  **Rapid Response:  **The Participants are establishing a
    **U.S.-Japan Critical Minerals Supply Security Rapid Response
    Group** under the leadership of the U.S. Secretary of Energy and the
    Japanese Minister of Economy, Trade, and Industry, to identify
    priority minerals and supply vulnerabilities, and develop a
    coordinated plan to accelerate delivery of processed minerals under
    this Framework.

<!-- -->

1.  **Stockpiling:**  The Participants intend to work together to
    consider a mutually complementary stockpiling arrangement, utilizing
    existing national systems in accordance with each country’s
    regulations.

**Section II**

**General** **Matters**

1.  The appropriate authorities of the Participants intend to monitor
    and review projects identified under Section I, paragraph 2.  The
    Participants will develop the elements of the project reviews in
    accordance with their respective domestic laws.

-   The Participants plan to meet, virtually or in-person, at the
    written request of the other Participant within 10 days of the
    receipt of the request.

<!-- -->

-   Either Participant may discontinue its participation in this
    Framework by giving written notification to the other Participant.
     Absent notice to the contrary from the discontinuing Participant,
    this framework would be discontinued on the thirtieth day after the
    date of receipt of the written notification by the other
    Participant.

<!-- -->

-   This Framework sets out a policy and programmatic action plan that
    does not constitute or create rights or obligations under domestic
    or international law, does not give rise to any legal process, and
    does not constitute or create any legally binding or enforceable
    obligations, express or implied.
