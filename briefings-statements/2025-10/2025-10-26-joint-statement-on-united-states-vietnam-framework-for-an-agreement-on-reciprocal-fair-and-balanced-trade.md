title: Joint Statement on United States-Vietnam Framework for an Agreement on Reciprocal,
  Fair, and Balanced Trade
---
 
The United States of America (the United States) and the Socialist
Republic of Viet Nam (Viet Nam) have agreed to **a Framework** for an
**Agreement on Reciprocal, Fair, and Balanced Trade** to strengthen our
bilateral economic relationship, which will provide both countries’
exporters unprecedented access to each other’s markets.  The Agreement
on Reciprocal, Fair, and Balanced Trade will build upon our longstanding
economic relationship, including the U.S.-Viet Nam Bilateral Trade
Agreement signed in 2000 that entered into force in 2001.

Key terms of the Agreement on Reciprocal, Fair, and Balanced Trade
between the United States and Viet Nam will include:

-   Viet Nam will provide preferential market access for substantially
    all U.S. industrial and agricultural exports to Viet Nam.

<!-- -->

-   The United States will maintain at 20 percent the reciprocal
    tariffs, as set forth in Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025, as
    amended, on originating goods of Viet Nam, and will also identify
    products from the list set out in Annex III to Executive Order 14346
    of September 5, 2025, Potential Tariff Adjustments for Aligned
    Partners, to receive a zero percent reciprocal tariff rate. 

<!-- -->

-   The United States and Viet Nam will work constructively in an effort
    to address both countries’ interests in non-tariff barriers that
    affect bilateral trade in priority areas.

<!-- -->

-   Viet Nam has agreed to address many such barriers including, for
    example, by accepting vehicles built to U.S. motor vehicle safety
    and emissions standards; addressing import licenses for U.S. medical
    devices; streamlining regulatory requirements and approvals for U.S.
    pharmaceutical products; fully implementing Viet Nam’s obligations
    under certain international intellectual property treaties to which
    it is a Party; and addressing U.S. concerns with conformity
    assessment procedures.

<!-- -->

-   The United States and Viet Nam have committed to address and prevent
    barriers to U.S. agricultural products in the Vietnamese market,
    including with regard to U.S. regulatory oversight and acceptance of
    currently agreed certificates issued by U.S. regulatory
    authorities. 

<!-- -->

-   The United States and Viet Nam will finalize commitments on digital
    trade, and services and investment

<!-- -->

-   The United States and Viet Nam will engage to address intellectual
    property, labor, environment, customs and trade facilitation, good
    regulatory practices, and any distortionary behaviors of state-owned
    enterprises.

<!-- -->

-   The United States and Viet Nam are committed to strengthening
    cooperation towards our shared goals to enhance supply chain
    resilience, including addressing duty evasion and cooperating on
    export controls.

<!-- -->

-   In addition, the United States and Viet Nam take note of recent
    commercial deals between U.S. and Vietnamese companies in the areas
    of agriculture, aerospace, and energy. 

<!-- -->

-   Vietnam Airlines has agreed to purchase 50 aircraft from Boeing
    which is worth over $8 billion. 

<!-- -->

-   Vietnamese companies have signed twenty memorandums of understanding
    with U.S. companies to purchase U.S. agricultural commodities, with
    a total estimated value of over $2.9 billion.

In the coming weeks, the United States and Viet Nam will work to
finalize the Agreement on Reciprocal, Fair, and Balanced Trade, prepare
the Agreement for signature, and undertake domestic formalities in
advance of the Agreement entering into force.
