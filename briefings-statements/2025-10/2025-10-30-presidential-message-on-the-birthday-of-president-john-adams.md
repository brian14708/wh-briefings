title: Presidential Message on the Birthday of President John Adams
---
 
Today, we celebrate the 290th birthday of President John Adams, a
Founding Father whose intellect, integrity, and devotion to country
helped secure America’s independence and strengthen the foundation of
our Republic.

Born in colonial Massachusetts, John Adams grew up with a deep and
abiding faith, hard work ethic, and commitment to civic virtue.  He
became a respected lawyer known for his sharp mind, dedication to
fairness, and courage.  Those same principles guided him to defend the
Redcoats after the Boston Massacre, to serve as a delegate to both
Continental Congresses, and to stand among the first to call for
independence from Britain.  Adams’s influence continued with his
drafting of Massachusetts’s Constitution—a document of tremendous
importance in its day—and his successful diplomatic missions in Europe
and Britain, which supported the American war effort and helped bring
the American Revolution to its victorious conclusion.    

As our Nation’s second President, John Adams strengthened the Navy,
protected American sovereignty, and defended our national interests amid
global pressures.  He oversaw the move of the Federal Government to
Washington, D.C., helping transform revolutionary ideals into a working
system of self-government.  Through his firm leadership and unwavering
resolve, he made certain that the liberty won by the Patriots of the
Revolution would endure for all generations.

President Adams believed deeply in the rule of law, the importance of
education, and the duty of every citizen to defend the cause of
freedom.  Although he faced fierce opposition, he never wavered in
putting country before politics. 

As we prepare to celebrate 250 years of American independence, my
Administration continues to advance many of the same ideals President
Adams fought for.  We have renamed the Department of Defense to the
Department of War to honor our Nation’s history of military might and to
reaffirm America’s unmatched strength in the world.  We are restoring
the sacred principle of equal justice under the law by rebalancing the
scales of justice in our Nation’s halls of power—and we are standing up
for America’s longstanding traditions of prayer, faith, and trust in
God.  We also continue to advance a foreign policy of peace through
strength that puts our citizens, our values, and our Nation first. 

On this day, we celebrate a man whose conviction helped give birth to
the greatest Nation in history.  May we carry forward President Adams’
legacy of strength, duty, and love of country as we work to continue
ushering in the Golden Age of America.
