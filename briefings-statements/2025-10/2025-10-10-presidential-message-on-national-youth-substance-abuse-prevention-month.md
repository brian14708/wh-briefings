title: Presidential Message on National Domestic Violence Awareness Month
---
 
The shameful scourge of domestic violence is a direct assault on our
Nation’s most sacred and fundamental institution: the family. For a
family to be strong, all its members must feel safe. Domestic violence,
which particularly affects women, who so often are the backbone of our
families, and their vulnerable children, is particularly corrosive This
National Domestic Violence Awareness month, my Administration renews its
commitment to ending domestic violence by restoring the rule of law,
cleaning up our Nation’s streets, and aggressively arresting and
prosecuting every criminal who terrorizes our fellow citizens and their
families.

From the quiet seclusion of our homes and workplaces to the bustling
centers of our cities and towns, every year, the violent plague of
domestic violence inflicts searing pain, trauma, and heartbreak upon as
many as 10 million precious American lives.  As President, I am
steadfastly devoted to uplifting survivors of domestic violence and
ensuring they know they are never alone, and that help and support are
always within reach.  For immediate and confidential support, call the
National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233.

To further safeguard American communities and protect families from
domestic violence, I am securing our southern border, dismantling human
trafficking networks, and conducting the largest mass deportation
operation in American history.  We are removing dangerous illegal
immigrants who have brought bloodshed and mayhem onto our streets—many
of whom have been charged heinous crimes, including domestic abuse,
against citizens of our Nation.  I have also supported our law
enforcement officers who so often must respond to and work to prevent
domestic violence. And I signed into law the TAKE IT DOWN Act—a landmark
step that strengthens protections for children and families against
digital exploitation and deepfakes, which are far too often used by
abusers to target their victims online.

This month, we affirm that the American Dream should be within reach for
our fathers, mothers, daughters, and sons.  Under my leadership, violent
criminals are once again being deported and prosecuted to the fullest
extent of the law—and we are once again a Nation committed to the sacred
principles of law, order, and justice. Together, we will foster safer
homes and stronger communities by striving to eliminate domestic
violence in all its horrific forms, holding perpetrators accountable,
and empowering survivors with unwavering support.
