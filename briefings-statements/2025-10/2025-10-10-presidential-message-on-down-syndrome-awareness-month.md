title: Presidential Message on Down Syndrome Awareness Month
---
 
From the earliest days of our Nation’s Founding, America has been guided
by the sacred truth that every child is created in the holy image and
likeness of God with inherent dignity and worth.  This Down Syndrome
Awareness Month, we recommit to this immortal truth.  We celebrate the
extraordinary individuals living with Down Syndrome who bring joy,
wonder, and meaning to the world—and we extend our heartfelt gratitude
to the families and caregivers who navigate the challenges and blessings
of raising children with developmental disabilities with unconditional
love.

Every year, an estimated 5,000 babies—1 in every 775—are born in the
United States with Down Syndrome.  This condition alters the course of a
child’s development and causes cognitive delays that bring uncertainty
and fear to affected families.  Thankfully, advancements in research,
screening, protocols of care, intervention therapies, and treatments
have extended the quality of life and the life span of children and
adults living with Down Syndrome.  There are now more opportunities than
ever before for independence, meaningful employment, and integration
into classrooms and communities so that all individuals with Down
Syndrome can enjoy full participation in American life.

My Administration continues to proclaim the sanctity and beauty of every
human life.  This month, I renew my commitment to protecting the health
and well-being of all the men, women, and children living with Down
Syndrome—and we recommit to forging a culture, a government, and a
Nation that upholds the dignity of life and respects the divine spark
imprinted on every human soul.
