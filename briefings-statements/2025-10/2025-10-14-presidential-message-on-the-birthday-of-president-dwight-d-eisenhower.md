title: Presidential Message on the Birthday of President Dwight D. Eisenhower
---
 
Today, we celebrate the 135th birthday of an American legend, a
visionary leader, and an enduring icon of duty, service, and discipline:
President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

Born in 1890 to humble beginnings growing up in Abilene, Kansas,
President Eisenhower was raised in the rural American tradition before
emerging as one of the most respected military leaders in the history of
our country.  Guided by his extraordinary commitment to public service,
he rose to the height of his military career as Supreme Commander of the
Allied Expeditionary Force during World War II.  On June 6, 1944, he
orchestrated the epic D-Day invasion of Normandy—playing a key role in
freedom’s triumph over tyranny.

In 1952, a wave of patriotic unity carried Eisenhower to the White House
in a landslide—the last political outsider to become president until I
was first elected in 2016.  As President, Eisenhower led by a principle
that we still abide by today:  Peace can only be secured through
American strength.  He understood that our country must be stable and
prosperous within its borders before extending commitments overseas.  He
boosted domestic trade through the development of the Interstate Highway
System, supported American workers through the creation of the U.S.
Small Business Administration, and eased tensions during the Cold War
through steady diplomacy to protect American interests.

Under my leadership, we are proudly carrying forward the ideals that
President Eisenhower cherished so deeply.  Every day, we are removing
regulatory barriers, unleashing our economy, ending unfair trade
practices, securing our borders, defending the rule of law, rebuilding
our military, putting our Nation’s interests first, and making America
stronger and greater than ever before.

As my Administration continues to promote prosperity at home and peace
abroad, we recommit to furthering President Eisenhower’s America First
vision.  We honor his legacy, we salute his courage, and we commit to
carrying that radiant torch of liberty into the future.

Happy birthday, President Eisenhower!
