title: United States-Australia Framework For Securing of Supply in the Mining and
  Processing of Critical Minerals and Rare Earths
---
 
*October 20, 2025*

Whereas, rare earths and critical minerals are essential for the
production of advanced technologies;

Whereas, the United States of America (the “United States” or “U.S.”)
and the Commonwealth of Australia (“Australia”, and together, the
“Participants”) intend to support the supply of raw and processed
critical minerals and rare earths crucial to the commercial and defense
industries of the United States and Australia;

Whereas, the Participants plan to accomplish this through use of
economic policy tools and coordinated investment to accelerate
development of diversified, liquid, fair markets for critical minerals
and rare earths;

Whereas, the Participants’ objective is to assist both countries in
achieving resilience and security of critical minerals and rare earths
supply chains, including mining, separation, and processing;

Whereas, the Participants intend to capitalize on their respective
existing domestic mining and processing operations in critical minerals
and heavy and light rare earths as well as new capacity to be made
available in 2026.

Therefore, the Participants have reached the following understanding on
a common policy framework for the mining and processing of critical
minerals and rare earths.

**Section I**

**Critical Minerals and Rare Earths**

1.  **Securing supply:**  The Participants are intensifying their
    cooperative efforts to accelerate the secure supply of critical
    minerals and rare earths necessary to support manufacturing
    of defense and advanced technologies and their respective industrial
    bases, including by leveraging existing policy tools such as the
    United States’ industrial demand and stockpiling infrastructure and
    Australia’s Critical Mineral Strategic Reserve.
2.  **Investment in mining and processing:**  The Participants will
    mobilize government and private sector support including for capital
    and operational expenditures via guarantees, loans, or equity;
    finalization of offtake arrangements; insurance; or regulatory
    facilitation.
    1.  **Project selection:**  The Participants will jointly identify
        projects of interest to address gaps in priority supply chains.
    2.  **Financing:**  In addition to the steps above, within 6 months
        of the date of this Framework, the Participants are taking
        measures to provide at least $1 billion in financing to projects
        located in each of the United States and Australia expected to
        generate end product for delivery to buyers in the United States
        and Australia.
    3.  **Investment support:**  The Participants will work together to
        develop new or bespoke mechanisms to strengthen critical
        minerals and rare earths supply chains.
    4.  **Ministerial:**  The Participants have decided to promote
        investment in mining by convening a Mining, Minerals and Metals
        Investment Ministerial within 180 days of the date of this
        Framework.
3.  **Permitting:**  The Participants are taking measures to accelerate,
    streamline, or deregulate permitting timelines and processes,
    including to obtain permits for critical minerals and rare earths
    mining, separation, and processing within their respective domestic
    regulatory systems, consistent with applicable law.
4.  **Price Mechanisms:**  The Participants will work to protect their
    respective domestic critical minerals and rare earths markets from
    non-market policies and unfair trade practices, including through
    the adoption of standards-based systems in which those who adopt the
    standards can trade freely and within a pricing framework including
    price floors or similar measures.  The Participants will also work
    with international partners to develop a future global framework to
    deal with associated international pricing challenges.
5.  **Asset Sales:**  The Participants commit to work in good faith to
    develop new or strengthen existing authorities and diplomatic tools
    that review and deter critical minerals and rare earths asset sales
    on national security grounds.
6.  **Scrap:**  The Participants commit to investing in minerals
    recycling technology and to work together to ensure management of
    critical minerals and rare earth scrap that supports supply chain
    diversification.
7.  **Third parties:**  The Participants will work together with third
    parties as appropriate to ensure supply chain security and utilize
    existing engagement mechanisms.
8.  **Geological mapping:**  The Participants will cooperate to assist
    in mapping mineral resources in Australia, the United States, and
    elsewhere as mutually determined, to support diversified critical
    mineral supply chains.
9.  **Rapid Response:**  The Participants are establishing a
    **U.S.-Australia Critical Minerals Supply Security Response Group**
    under the leadership of the U.S. Secretary of Energy and the
    Australian Minister for Resources to identify priority minerals and
    supply vulnerabilities and develop a coordinated plan to accelerate
    delivery of processed minerals under this Framework.

**Section II**

**General Provisions**

1.  The appropriate authorities of the Participants will carry out
    post-project analysis and implementation.  The specific content of
    the post-project analysis is to be developed between/among the
    Participants, in accordance with their respective domestic laws.
2.  The Participants will meet, virtually or in-person, at the written
    request of the other Participant within 10 days of the receipt of
    the request.
3.  Either Participant may discontinue its participation in this
    Framework by giving written notification to the other Participant.
     Absent notice to the contrary from the discontinuing Participant,
    any such discontinuation would be effective on the thirtieth day
    after the date of receipt of the written notification by the other
    Participant.
4.  The Framework sets out a policy and programmatic action plan that
    does not constitute or create rights or obligations under domestic
    or international law, does not give rise to any legal process, and
    does not constitute or create any legally binding or enforceable
    obligations, express or implied.
