    Birthday of Benjamin Franklin</span>

Today, we celebrate the towering life and legacy of Benjamin
Franklin—printer and philosopher, inventor and diplomat, public servant
and patriot, and one of the most consequential Americans to ever live. 
On what would have been his 320th birthday, we honor his restless
genius, his steadfast devotion to liberty, and his legendary
contributions to our national story.

Born on January 17, 1706, in Boston, Massachusetts, Franklin grew up the
15th of 17 children.  Raised with little formal education, he taught
himself how to read and write, emerging at age 23 as one of the most
successful and influential publishers in the Colonies.  He was also a
passionate innovator, always striving to improve the lives of his fellow
citizens through public service and the marvels of science.  Throughout
his life, he invented the lightning rod and the first bifocal glasses,
harnessed the power of electricity with his famous “key and kite”
experiment, established the first public library and volunteer fire
department, and served as the first Postmaster General, binding the
Colonies together with an organized mail system long before they were
bound together as one Nation.

Of his countless triumphs and successes, his most epic contributions to
our Republic were those that fortified the cause of freedom.  While
living in England as an ambassador for the Pennsylvania Assembly,
Franklin witnessed firsthand the growing British hostility toward the
Colonies.  In 1775, Franklin was selected as a delegate to the Second
Continental Congress, where, together with fellow patriots John Adams
and Thomas Jefferson, he helped draft the Declaration of Independence,
suggesting to Jefferson that he include the immortal phrase:  “We hold
these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.”

Franklin’s unshakable commitment to the causes of the Revolution
ultimately led him across the Atlantic once more, where he played a
pivotal role in securing French support for the patriot cause against
the British Empire and acted as a principal negotiator of the 1783
Treaty of Paris, which ended the Revolutionary War.  After American
independence was finally won, he played a vital role in rallying support
for the ratification of the Constitution in 1788.  Franklin is one of
only six men to have signed both the Declaration of Independence and the
Constitution.

Benjamin Franklin is often remembered as the “First American”—a title
that reflects a life devoted to curiosity, industry, and the cause of
human freedom.  His intellect and character helped shape an American
identity grounded in courage, self-reliance, and civic duty.  Franklin
gave the young country confidence and direction, demonstrating how
knowledge and public service could advance the cause of liberty.  His
legacy endures in our institutions, our Constitution, and the very
character of our Republic—a testament to how one man’s ideas and actions
can echo through the history of a nation for 250 glorious years.

Happy birthday, Benjamin Franklin!
