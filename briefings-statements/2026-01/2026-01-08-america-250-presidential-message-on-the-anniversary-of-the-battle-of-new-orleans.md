  Orleans'

Today, our Nation remembers one of the greatest American tales of might
and one of the grandest displays of American resolve in the history of
our country—the legendary Battle of New Orleans.

As our last major engagement in the War of 1812 and our epic final
struggle against the tyranny of the British empire, the Battle of New
Orleans ensured the hard-fought flame of American liberty would never
extinguish.  Following a series of skirmishes throughout December of
1814, in which the British sought to break the defenses of the revered
Major General Andrew Jackson, Major General Sir Edward Pakenham
committed 8,000 seasoned British regulars to overwhelm the smaller
American force of just 5,700 outside the city.  The British objective: 
Steal the vital commercial and defensive strongpoint situated at the
mouth of the mighty Mississippi River—the city of New Orleans—for the
crown.

The morning of January 8, 1815, dawned damp and foggy as British
soldiers formed long, neat rows of crimson along the swampy marshes of
southern Louisiana.  As the British began their attack, tradition holds
that General Jackson—bracing behind a small canal and several hundred
yards of defensive works—bellowed to his men:  “Give it to them, my
boys!  Let us finish the business today!”

His men did just that.  In less than an hour, American fighters—with
nothing but courage, confidence, and faith—killed, wounded, or captured
more than 2,000 hardened British veterans.  The fog Sir Edward Pakenham
hoped would conceal his attack lifted at the last moment, and his
artillery bombardment from across the river materialized too late.  Sir
Edward himself fell during the battle, and soon after, General Jackson’s
force reigned triumphant with only 71 American casualties as the British
made their retreat.  By the time the smoke cleared, New Orleans was
safe.  The British were forever expelled from American soil.  And
General Jackson was immortalized as an American hero and would later
ascend to the Presidency.

To this day, January 8, 1815, remains one of the most significant days
in our great national story.  More than 200 years later, as we celebrate
our 250th year of American independence, we pay tribute to the heroes
who defied every odd to secure our birthright of liberty.  We honor
their immortal legacy of courage and resilience.  Above all, we vow that
the triumphant spirit of the Battle of New Orleans—and our victory over
foreign influence in the War of 1812—will forever live on in every
American heart.
