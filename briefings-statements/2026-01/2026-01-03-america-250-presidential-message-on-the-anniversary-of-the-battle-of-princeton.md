title: 'America 250: Presidential Message on the Anniversary of the Battle of Princeton'
---
 
On January 3, 1777, General George Washington and his battle-hardened
Continental Army secured a decisive victory over the formidable British
garrison at the Battle of Princeton—an epic clash that reignited the
Revolution and steered the Patriots back on the path to independence.

During the “Ten Crucial Days” following General Washington’s legendary
crossing of the Delaware River, Continental soldiers once again answered
the call of liberty in extraordinary fashion.  After fending off a
hard-pressed British attack at the Second Battle of Trenton, under the
cover of darkness, General Washington led thousands of American soldiers
in a careful evasion of the British Army, leaving campfires burning and
sentries posted to disguise their departure.  In the light of daybreak,
the enemy found an empty camp at Trenton—outwitted once again by the
cunning and courage of General Washington—while the Continental Army
were miles away confronting the British garrison at Princeton.

As battle was joined, the British initially gained the upper hand. 
Charging with fixed bayonets, they overran an American position, and
viciously stabbed Brigadier General Hugh Mercer, one of Washington’s
closest aides, seven times, fatally wounding him.  As fresh Continentals
and militia arrived, though, General Washington himself courageously
rode to the front lines, rallying his troops to stand firm and press
forward, before going on to break the British line and send the enemy
reeling back into town and beyond.  Defeated, the British hoisted a
white flag of surrender into the cold morning air—signaling that the
Continental Army had reigned victorious once again.

That day, General Washington’s men won a crucial victory, revived our
national spirit, and breathed new life into the cause of independence
throughout the Colonies.  Nearly two and a half centuries later, the
patriots’ renewed spirit of determination remains an enduring symbol of
American strength, resilience, and grit.  Today, we pledge to continue
the work of saving our country with the courage that burned in the
hearts of the warriors at Princeton 249 years ago.  We honor their
valiant legacy.  We vow to protect our inheritance of liberty against
all enemies and to forge a future worthy of their sacrifice.
