title: "First Lady Melania Trump Inspires America\u2019s Children to be Curious, Use\
  \ AI to Achieve their Career Ambitions"
---
 
First Lady Melania Trump advanced her mission to improve America’s
children’s understanding of artificial intelligence (AI) today. Her goal
to empower the next generation with AI and education reached thousands
of schools nationwide, in partnership with Zoom Communications.

America’s First Lady inspired participants, “The Age of Imagination is a
new era, powered by artificial intelligence, where one’s curiosity can
be satisfied almost magically, in seconds.”

The First Lady also emphasized that curiosity optimizes AI use, “History
reminds us that curiosity is the driving force behind every great
achievement. The world’s greatest minds – our writers, architects,
scientists, and painters – all had endless interest about human nature,
and they all questioned that which was yet to be answered.”

Zoom’s CEO & Founder Eric Yuan, a clear leader in the TechEd space,
stressed the need for AI safety, “AI is changing how we learn, work, and
connect every day. That’s why it’s so important to help students and
educators build AI literacy and feel confident using these tools in
thoughtful, creative, and ethical ways.”

Mrs. Trump concluded, “Although artificial intelligence can generate
images and information, only humans can generate meaning and purpose.
Choose to let your imagination drive your intellectual progress. But
never use AI as a quick solution. Be intellectually honest with yourself
– use AI as a tool – but do not let it replace your personal
intelligence.”

Mrs. Trump called on the international community to join her mission to
empower children with technology and education during the 2025 United
Nations General Assembly. The First Lady, Melania Trump, will be hosting
the inaugural meeting of Fostering the Future Together at the White
House this spring.

Curiosity For Intellectual Freedom

Thank you, Mr. Yuan, Zoom’s leadership in the TechEd space is unmatched.
Your support directly advances my mission to prepare America’s next
generation to use AI to enhance their education, and ultimately their
careers. Indeed, this is an incredible time.

We are living in the Age of Imagination.

The Age of Imagination is a new era, powered by artificial intelligence,
where one’s curiosity can be satisfied almost magically, in seconds. You
are fortunate to have the capability to fulfill your dreams through the
power of learning, with AI serving as the primary engine for creative
exploration.

History reminds us that curiosity is the driving force behind every
great achievement.  The world’s greatest minds – our writers,
architects, scientists, and painters – all had endless interest about
human nature, and they all questioned that which was yet to be answered.

Are you ready to produce your own movie? Do you want to build the next
Dress to Impress empire? Have you ever wondered how to become the next
master artist? Create your own song?

Every giant, at some point in time, questions the status quo. Their
singular vision pushes humanity in a new direction.

Artificial intelligence is changing today’s world, and your curiosity
should serve as the driving force. For the first time in history, the
young girl dreaming of becoming a fashion designer and the young boy who
wants to stand-up his cool animated superhero series can do so, from
their own home.

Artificial Intelligence provides all the tools needed to implement your
creative vision – today. You can develop movie characters, scripts,
fashion, music, art – the entire ecosystem. All with AI.

But, what do you need to start? You need to harness your Imagination. In
the new AI era, the most powerful skill is knowing what to ask, why it
matters, and how to think beyond the first answer.

I encourage you to be stubbornly curious, think outside the box, and
question everything.

Creators must stretch their minds to think differently. The world of
possibility is endless, and AI is extending the conceptual in ways never
dreamed of before. In the past, memorization unlocked opportunity.
Today, your curiosity will open new doors to meaning, innovation, and
leadership.

But we must remember, although artificial intelligence can generate
images and information, only humans can generate meaning and purpose.
Deep thinking, patience, and staying curious are where purpose begins.

Today, I urge you to take action: use AI to unlock new parts of your
imagination. Lead with your ideas, stay sharp, but remember – never
surrender your thinking to AI.

Choose to let your imagination drive your intellectual progress. But
never use AI as a quick solution. Be intellectually honest with yourself
– use AI as a tool – but do not let it replace your personal
intelligence.

Pursue understanding with passion like no generation before. Make an
impact.

Knowledge is power. Nobody can take it away from you. Good luck and
wishing you a successful year ahead!
