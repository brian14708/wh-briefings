    of Human Life Day, 2026</span>

On July 4, 1776, our Declaration of Independence righteously affirmed
that every human being is endowed by Almighty God with the unalienable
right to life.  In the 250 years since, our commitment to this truth has
been the source of our strength and the foundation of our greatness —
and it has helped America remain the single greatest force for justice
and human flourishing in the history of the world.  This National
Sanctity of Human Life Day, we renew our steadfast commitment to
fostering a culture that respects, upholds, and cherishes the inherent
dignity and infinite worth of every precious human soul.

Today marks the 53rd anniversary of *Roe v. Wade* — a moral and
constitutional atrocity that silenced the American people and stripped
the States of their right to protect the unborn.  Thankfully, in June
2022, the United States Supreme Court corrected this disastrous
decision, and decades of left-wing judicial overreach, by returning
abortion policy to the American people in the States.  During my first
term, I was proud to have appointed three of the Associate Justices who
delivered this triumphant victory for life, liberty, and American
democracy.

From the moment I returned to office as the 47th President of the United
States, I have taken decisive action to protect the unborn and restore a
culture that unapologetically defends the sanctity of life.  I was proud
to enforce the Hyde Amendment and reinstate the Mexico City Policy —
ending taxpayer-funded abortion at home and abroad.  I also pardoned 23
pro-life activists who were unfairly targeted and prosecuted by a
weaponized Department of Justice (DOJ) for practicing their faith and
living their conscience.  At my direction, the DOJ is now investigating
the weaponization of Government against Christians and Americans of
faith.

Last summer, I also proudly signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill —
a monumental win for life and the American family that expands the child
tax credit, increases access to childcare, makes the paid leave tax
credit permanent, protects Medicaid from funding large abortion
providers, and establishes Trump accounts for newborn babies for the
future of our Nation.  My Administration is also committed to supporting
policies that advocate for adoption, promote foster care, and protect
pregnant women and mothers.  At every level of the Federal Government,
my Administration is boldly advancing policies that protect the most
vulnerable among us and promote the growth and success of America’s
families.

Today, we uphold the eternal truth that every human being is created in
the holy image and likeness of God, blessed with infinite worth and
boundless potential.  We celebrate the heroic leaders, parents,
students, and everyday citizens — including those gathering for the
March for Life in Washington, D.C., this weekend — who have courageously
advocated for the most vulnerable and stood up for those who cannot
stand up for themselves.  As President, I pledge to always be a voice
for the voiceless and to never tire in fighting to protect the intrinsic
dignity of every child, born and unborn.

Today, I call on the American people to join me in honoring the dignity
of every human life, including those not yet born, to continue to care
for women in unexpected pregnancies, and to support adoption and foster
care in a more meaningful way so every child can have a loving home. 
Finally, I ask every citizen of this great Nation to listen to the sound
of silence caused by a generation lost to us and then to raise their
voices for all affected by abortion, both seen and unseen.
