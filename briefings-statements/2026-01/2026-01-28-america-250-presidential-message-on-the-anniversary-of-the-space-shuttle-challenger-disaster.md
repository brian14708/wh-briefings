title: 'America 250: Presidential Message on the Anniversary of the Space Shuttle
  Challenger Disaster'
---
 
On this day 40 years ago, America tragically lost 7 brilliant,
visionary, and courageous titans of space exploration aboard the Space
Shuttle Challenger.  On this solemn anniversary, we acknowledge that
their legacies will remain forever etched upon our Nation’s memory—and
we recommit to advancing mankind’s journey beyond the stars with
unwavering strength and an unyielding commitment to excellence.

On the morning of January 28, 1986, millions of Americans sat in
anticipation as a historic launch unfolded on live television.  Aboard
the spacecraft were seven remarkable Americans—scientists, engineers,
aviators, and a high school teacher chosen to help inspire the next
generation of students.  Just 73 seconds after liftoff, that
anticipation was shattered when mechanical failures caused the shuttle
to disintegrate into the cold morning air, transforming wonder and hope
into devastation and disaster in a mere instant.  Yet, from the
smoke-filled sky rose a lasting resolve to honor these fallen American
heroes by continuing their work and advancing the causes they cherished
with greater care and unshakable purpose.

Every day, my Administration is propelling their mission forward by
unleashing the full force of American innovation and technology into the
next era of space exploration.  Last month, I signed an Executive Order
on Ensuring American Space Superiority, which calls for a return to the
Moon by 2028, lays the groundwork for a permanent American lunar
presence, and will help make the United States the first nation to land
an astronaut on Mars.  Under my leadership, we are empowering innovation
in the commercial space industry to increase capabilities and encourage
a vibrant American space economy—because American leadership in space is
crucial to America’s strength, security, and future.

As we celebrate 250 years of American independence, this work is just
the beginning of our next great chapter as we chart the course for a
glorious American future in space.

On the day of this tragedy four decades ago, the great President Ronald
Reagan declared:  “The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future,
and we will continue to follow them.”  Today, under my leadership, we
will continue to abide by this promise—leading boldly on Earth and
beyond—as we carry their lasting legacy into a new Golden Age of
American exploration and discovery.
