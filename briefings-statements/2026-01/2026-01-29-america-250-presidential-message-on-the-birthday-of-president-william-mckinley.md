title: 'America 250: Presidential Message on the Birthday of President William McKinley'
---
 
Today, we celebrate the birthday of the legendary President William
McKinley—a true American trailblazer and titan of American greatness,
who protected our people; expanded our blessings; and secured
unprecedented growth, prosperity, and sovereignty for our beloved
Nation.

Born and raised in Niles, Ohio, McKinley learned as a child the virtues
of faith, duty, and respect, which would go on to define his storied
career.  Following his service in the Union Army during the Civil War,
he was elected to represent the people of Ohio in the United States
House of Representatives, where he famously authored and passed the
McKinley Tariff of 1890—a bold legislative effort to protect American
workers against foreign exploitation.  He later rose to serve as
governor of Ohio, emerging on the national stage as a leading voice for
the forgotten men and women of America—our great workers, laborers, and
tradesmen.

In 1896, McKinley ran for President and won decisively, becoming the
25th President of the United States.  As Commander in Chief, President
McKinley was a fierce advocate for American greatness and heroically led
our country to victory in the Spanish-American War—advancing the
blessings of freedom beyond our shores.  He was also an unwavering
champion for the American worker, and his historic use of tariffs fueled
an economic boom that made our country stronger, wealthier, and more
prosperous than ever before.

Tragically, President McKinley’s devotion to America First principles
ultimately cost him his life when, in 1901, he was viciously
assassinated by a deranged left-wing anarchist.  To this day, he lives
on in our hearts as a martyr of American freedom.

In honor of President McKinley’s historic legacy, on my first day
returning to office, I proudly restored the rightful name of Mount
McKinley to America’s highest peak.  Guided by his vision, my
Administration is also reestablishing a trade policy that promotes
American investment and productivity, enhances our Nation’s industrial
and technological advantages, defends our economic and national
security, and—above all—puts American workers, manufacturers, and
industries first.

On what would have been President McKinley’s 183rd birthday—and as we
celebrate 250 years of American freedom and independence—we honor his
memory, we remember his courage, and we renew our resolve to protect our
workers, to reach further, aim higher, and achieve the full promise and
glory of the American Dream.
