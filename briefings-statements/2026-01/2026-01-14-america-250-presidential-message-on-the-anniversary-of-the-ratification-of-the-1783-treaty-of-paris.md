title: 'America 250: Presidential Message on the Anniversary of the Ratification of
  the 1783 Treaty of Paris'
---
 
On January 14, 1784, the Second Continental Congress ratified the
decisive Treaty of Paris—the binding accord that ended the Revolutionary
War, secured American independence, and triumphantly declared all 13
colonies “to be free sovereign and Independent States.”  Today, we
celebrate this monumental milestone, and we pay tribute to the grit,
greatness, and unyielding resolve of the patriots of 1776 who pledged
their lives, fortunes, and sacred honor for freedom’s cause.

The cessation of hostilities with the British Empire, proclaimed on
April 11, 1783, ended 8 years of brutal warfare and the most significant
struggle for freedom the world had ever seen.  After the fighting ended,
the difficult and lengthy peace talks required strategic negotiation,
moral clarity, and skillful diplomacy.  To achieve lasting peace, the
Second Continental Congress sent a trio of true American titans—Benjamin
Franklin, John Jay, and John Adams—who defended American interests and
fortified our fledgling Republic.  The treaty, signed on September 3,
1783, nearly 2 years after the epic British surrender at Yorktown,
resulted in a glorious affirmation of American sovereignty.

Under the Articles of Confederation, then the governing framework of the
United States, ratification of the treaty required a quorum of nine
States.  On this day 242 years ago, the delegates convened in a State
House in Annapolis, Maryland, and with the final vote from South
Carolina, the treaty was unanimously ratified, and our birthright of
freedom was finally secured.

This year—our 250th year of glorious American independence—we reaffirm
the righteous principles that breathed life into our Republic more than
two centuries ago.  We renew our resolve to uphold and defend peace
through strength, the rule of law, loyalty to our citizens, and faith in
Almighty God.  Above all, we vow that the timeless truths forged by our
forefathers will forever remain a mighty beacon of hope, prosperity, and
liberty to the entire world.
