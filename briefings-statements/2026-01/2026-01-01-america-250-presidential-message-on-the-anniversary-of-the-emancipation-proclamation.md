title: 'America 250: Presidential Message on the Anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation'
---
 
On January 1, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln signed the legendary
Emancipation Proclamation—one of the most significant documents in human
history and a grand edict that paved the way to the liberation of
millions of slaves and the full glory of the American promise.

As the bloody Civil War raged into its second year and the Nation fought
to preserve the Union, President Lincoln made a “fit and necessary”
military decree that would redefine the entire conflict.  With the
Emancipation Proclamation declaring that those held in slavery in the

rebellious states “shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free,” the
purpose of the war shifted—and every Union advance now carried with it
the blazing torch of liberty, justice, and dignity for all.

The Emancipation Proclamation set the stage for the ultimate abolition
of slavery, culminating in the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment
nearly 2 years later.  It endures to this day as a monumental testament
to the divine truth that equality is a sacred birthright granted not by
government but by the hand of Almighty God.  It signaled the dawn of a
new day in our Nation’s journey toward liberty and the inalienable
rights of every citizen.  Its signing remains a morally defining moment
in our national story and an enduring legacy of President Lincoln’s
conviction that our country—which launched a revolution in the pursuit
of freedom and human dignity—is “the last best hope of Earth.” 

Today, in President Lincoln’s honor, we recommit to the eternal truth
that the United States of America is blessed by God; is bound together
by justice; and was, is, and will forever be a great Nation.
