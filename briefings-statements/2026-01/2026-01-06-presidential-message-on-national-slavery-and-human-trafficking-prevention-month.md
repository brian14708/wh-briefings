title: Presidential Message on National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month
---
 
This National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, my
Administration renews our commitment to end the evil of human
trafficking, restore law and order across our country, protect the most
innocent among us, and ensure that every trafficker faces the full force
of American justice.

Under the previous administration, hundreds of thousands of
unaccompanied children who entered our country were lost, with many
being placed in the hands of smugglers and sex traffickers.  This was
not only a failure of policy—it was a moral catastrophe that allowed
perpetrators of modern-day slavery to exploit our country and our
borders.  Since returning to office, I have taken unprecedented action
to shut down these human trafficking pipelines, rescue the innocent
children put in harm’s way, and end the reckless policies that enabled
this crisis.

On my first day in office, I immediately declared a national emergency
at our southern border to stop the invasion of illegal immigrants and
cut off the human trafficking routes that have devastated countless
families.  I designated the criminal cartels—the primary trafficking
networks—as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and initiated the largest
mass deportation operation in American history.

Last summer, I signed the One Big Beautiful Bill into law, a landmark
piece of legislation that dramatically expands the Department of
Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), secures
historic funding for our Border Patrol, and authorizes the construction
of hundreds of miles of new border wall.  My Administration launched a
fund for sex trafficking survivors exploited through online
advertisements to seek compensation from forfeited assets.  We have
sanctioned more than 100 online scam operators, many of which used
forced labor to seize billions of dollars from defrauded Americans and
others worldwide.  We increased funding for the National Human
Trafficking Hotline.  I signed the TAKE IT DOWN Act and Trafficking
Survivors Relief Act to modernize our tools to fight human trafficking
and enable survivors to rebuild their lives.  With these enhanced
resources, our great law enforcement officers are now equipped with the
tools needed to remove dangerous illegal aliens from our streets and
dismantle human trafficking networks.  
  

As a result of these decisive actions, our border has been secured, and
the flood of illegal aliens entering our country has stopped.  For the
seventh consecutive month, Border Patrol has released zero illegal
aliens into our country.  ICE has also launched the Unaccompanied
Children Safety Verification Initiative, partnering with local law
enforcement to ensure that the unaccompanied minors abandoned by the
previous administration are safe, cared for, and not being exploited by
traffickers.  

This month, we continue our resolve to secure a future where American
families can live safely and freely, without the threat of criminal
aliens who have no right to be in our country.  We are shutting down
human trafficking rings, securing our borders, and deporting dangerous
criminals to protect our people, communities, and great Nation.
