title: Presidential Message on Epiphany
---
 
Today, I join the millions of Christians in the United States and around
the world celebrating the Epiphany—a joyous feast day commemorating the
glorious manifestation of Jesus Christ as the Redeemer of mankind,
Prince of Peace, and Savior of the world.

This sacred feast is one of the oldest and holiest days of the Christian
faith.  Centuries before the birth of Jesus, the prophet Isaiah foretold
the miracle of the Epiphany when, according to Holy Scripture, he
declared:  “Nations shall walk by your light, and kings by your shining
radiance.”  That ancient promise was fulfilled in glory when three wise
men journeyed from the east, guided by a magnificent star that would
lead them to the infant Son of God in the humble surroundings of a
stable.

The wise men’s journey first led them to King Herod in Jerusalem, where
they asked, “Where is the newborn king of the Jews?”  Dismissed by
Herod, they journeyed on to the small town of Bethlehem, following the
heavenly sign that drew them to the Messiah.  As the Bible tells us,
“they were overjoyed” at the sight of the star.  Their joy deepened when
they entered the birthplace of God Himself—who, in the most
revolutionary act of love in all of history, took on human flesh to
dwell among His creation.  In humble adoration, the wise men offered
gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh—symbolizing Christ’s role as king
of the universe, His divinity, and His incarnate mission as Savior of
mankind.

Just as the star pierced the stillness of the night sky thousands of
years ago, the light of Christ continues to shine through forces of
darkness.  Every day, the life and divine teachings of Jesus continue to
call all people—and all nations—to live in truth and courage.

Over the last year, the peace, hope, and love of Jesus Christ has
touched our Nation and the world in extraordinary ways.  Before our very
eyes, a new era of peace is sweeping across the globe.  Faith in God is
resurging on American shores.  Religious freedom is coming back like
never before.  As we celebrate 250 years of the United States of
America—a Nation forged in faith, sacrifice, and an enduring trust in
God’s divine providence—we thank our Creator for His extraordinary
blessings and ask for a continued outpouring of grace upon our Nation
and the world.

More than 2,000 years after His birth, Jesus Christ remains a guiding
light for our country and for all of the human race.  This Epiphany, the
First Lady and I join Christians in praying that the light of Jesus
Christ will lead us ever closer to a future filled with justice,
generosity, prosperity, and peace.
