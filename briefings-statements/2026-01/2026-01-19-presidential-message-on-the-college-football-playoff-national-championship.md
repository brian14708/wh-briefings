    Football Playoff National Championship</span>

Tonight, the College Football Playoff National Championship brings a
season of dedication, sacrifice, and hard work to a climactic
conclusion.  It stands as the final measure of months of preparation,
resolve, and competition that have long defined college football—a
beloved and uniquely American tradition.

For more than 150 years, college football has been a cherished fixture
in American culture.  Every fall and winter, massive crowds flock to
stadiums in college towns all across our Nation to witness the epic
display of loyalty, rivalry, tradition, and regional identity erupting
throughout the stands and on the field below.  From the very first
collegiate matchup in 1869, our country’s love of this storied Saturday
ritual has been passed down from one generation to the next and endured
as an iconic American institution. 

At its best, college football reflects our timeless American values of
family, freedom, unity, and hard work and represents the pinnacle of our
national spirit.  It is seen in the players whose focus, discipline, and
unwavering grit are forged in every practice and workout.  It is upheld
by the coaches who set high standards, demand greatness, and help
cultivate incredible student-athletes—and even better Americans—who stop
at nothing to achieve their God-given potential both on and off the
field.  And it is sustained by the fans whose dedication gives college
football its lasting meaning, passion, and glory. 

Melania and I congratulate the Indiana Hoosiers and the Miami Hurricanes
on making it to the College Football Playoff National Championship.  God
bless the talented players and dedicated coaches, the families who love
and support them, and the faithful fans who cheer them on.  May the best
team win!
