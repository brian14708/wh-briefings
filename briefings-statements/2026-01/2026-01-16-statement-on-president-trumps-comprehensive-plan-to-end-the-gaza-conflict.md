    Comprehensive Plan to End the Gaza Conflict</span>

Yesterday, President Donald J. Trump congratulated the formation of the
National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), a vital step
forward in implementing Phase Two of his Comprehensive Plan to End the
Gaza Conflict—a 20-point roadmap for lasting peace, stability,
reconstruction, and prosperity in the region.

The NCAG will be led by Dr. Ali Sha’ath, a widely respected technocratic
leader who will oversee the restoration of core public services, the
rebuilding of civil institutions, and the stabilization of daily life in
Gaza, while laying the foundation for long-term, self-sustaining
governance. Dr. Sha’ath brings deep experience in public administration,
economic development, and international engagement, and is widely
respected for his pragmatic, technocratic leadership and understanding
of Gaza’s institutional realities.

This milestone perfectly aligns with United Nations Security Council
Resolution 2803 (2025), which endorsed President Trump’s Comprehensive
Plan and welcomed the establishment of the Board of Peace. The Board of
Peace will play an essential role in fulfilling all 20 points of the
President’s plan, providing strategic oversight, mobilizing
international resources, and ensuring accountability as Gaza transitions
from conflict to peace and development.

To operationalize the Board of Peace’s vision—under the chairmanship of
President Donald J. Trump—a founding Executive Board has been formed,
composed of leaders with experience across diplomacy, development,
infrastructure, and economic strategy. The appointed members are:

-   Secretary Marco Rubio
-   Steve Witkoff
-   Jared Kushner
-   Sir Tony Blair
-   Marc Rowan
-   Ajay Banga
-   Robert Gabriel

Each Executive Board member will oversee a defined portfolio critical to
Gaza’s stabilization and long-term success, including, but not limited
to, governance capacity-building, regional relations, reconstruction,
investment attraction, large-scale funding, and capital mobilization.

In support of this operating model, the Chairman has appointed Aryeh
Lightstone and Josh Gruenbaum as senior advisors to the Board of Peace,
charged with leading day-to-day strategy and operations, and translating
the Board’s mandate and diplomatic priorities into disciplined
execution.

H.E. Nickolay Mladenov, an Executive Board member, will serve as the
High Representative for Gaza. In this capacity, he will act as the
on-the-ground link between the Board of Peace and the NCAG. He will
support the Board’s oversight of all aspects of Gaza’s governance,
reconstruction, and development, while ensuring coordination across
civilian and security pillars.

To establish security, preserve peace, and establish a durable
terror-free environment, Major General Jasper Jeffers has been appointed
Commander of the International Stabilization Force (ISF), where he will
lead security operations, support comprehensive demilitarization, and
enable the safe delivery of humanitarian aid and reconstruction
materials.

In support of the Office of the High Representative and the NCAG, a Gaza
Executive Board is being established. The Board will help support
effective governance and the delivery of best-in-class services that
advance peace, stability, and prosperity for the people of Gaza. The
appointed members are:

-   Steve Witkoff
-   Jared Kushner
-   Minister Hakan Fidan
-   Ali Al-Thawadi
-   General Hassan Rashad
-   Sir Tony Blair
-   Marc Rowan
-   Minister Reem Al-Hashimy
-   Nickolay Mladenov
-   Yakir Gabay
-   Sigrid Kaag

The United States remains fully committed to supporting this
transitional framework, working in close partnership with Israel, key
Arab nations, and the international community to achieve the objectives
of the Comprehensive Plan. The President calls on all parties to
cooperate fully with the NCAG, the Board of Peace, and the International
Stabilization Force to ensure the swift and successful implementation of
the Comprehensive Plan.

Additional Executive Board and Gaza Executive Board members will be
announced over the coming weeks.
