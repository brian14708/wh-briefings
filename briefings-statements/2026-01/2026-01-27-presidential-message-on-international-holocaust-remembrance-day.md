title: Presidential Message on International Holocaust Remembrance Day
---
 
This International Holocaust Remembrance Day, we remember one of the
darkest periods in human history and one of the gravest atrocities the
world has ever witnessed.  Today, we pay respect to the blessed memories
of the millions of Jewish people, who were murdered at the hands of the
Nazi Regime and its collaborators during the Holocaust— as well as the
Slavs and the Roma, people with disabilities, religious leaders, persons
targeted based on their sexual orientation, and political prisoners who
were also targeted for systematic slaughter.  We renew our resolve that
freedom, justice, and the dignity of the human person will always
conquer the forces of evil, tyranny, and oppression.

On January 27, 1945, 81 years ago today, Allied forces liberated
Auschwitz-Birkenau, the Nazi Regime’s largest concentration and death
camp in World War II, where over one million people were marched to
their senseless deaths.  Within the camp’s barbed-wire electric fence,
those imprisoned there were stripped of their clothing, personal
possessions, and God-given dignity.  Countless were immediately
murdered, and others were subjected to forced labor, starvation,
disease, torture, and medical experiments.  The barbaric conditions knew
no bounds.

The systematic murder of Jewish people across Nazi-occupied Europe
remains an indelible blight on mankind.  In remembrance of all who
perished during the Holocaust and in honor of all those who survived and
rebuilt their lives from the ashes, we renew our pledge that such evil
will never again attain a stronghold in the West.  After I took office
as the 47th President of the United States, I proudly made it this
administration’s priority directing the Federal Government to use all
appropriate legal tools to combat the scourge of anti-Semitism.  My
Administration will remain a steadfast and unequivocal champion for
Jewish Americans and the God-given right of every American to practice
their faith freely, openly, and without fear.

On this solemn day, we remember every man, woman, and child senselessly
killed by the evil, depravity, and hate of the Nazi Regime—and we
commend the survivors who dedicated their lives to sharing their stories
while carrying the unimaginable burden of the seen and unseen scars. 
This International Holocaust Remembrance Day, and every day, we honor
their enduring resilience, faith, and strength—and we recommit to the
sacred truth that every human being is made in the holy image of God.
