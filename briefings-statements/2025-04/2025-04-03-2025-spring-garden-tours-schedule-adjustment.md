title: 2025 Spring Garden Tours Schedule Adjustment
---
 
Spring Garden Tours previously scheduled for Saturday, April 5, 2025,
have been rescheduled for Sunday, April 6, 2025. This decision has been
made out of an abundance of caution and to ensure the safety of all
within proximity to public demonstrations planned near the White House
on Saturday, April 5, 2025.

The White House is working closely with the United States Secret Service
and National Park Service to safely accommodate all ticket holders for
the 2025 Spring Garden Tours, which will continue to be held on Sunday,
April 6, 2025, with the following adjustment. All previously allocated
tickets for Saturday, April 5, will be honored on Sunday, April 6,
between 10:00 AM and 2:30 PM (regardless of the original Saturday time
slot printed on the ticket).

Ticket holders for Sunday, April 6, should plan to continue to adhere to
the time slot noted on their ticket(s). All visitors for the 2025 Spring
Garden Tour will still have the opportunity to explore the South Lawn of
the White House, as well as the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, Rose Garden,
and the White House Kitchen Garden as planned.
