On the evening of April 18, 1775, two lanterns were illuminated from the
tower of The Old North Church in Boston to alert the colonists that
British forces were advancing across the Charles River.  With the alert
signal in place, Paul Revere, a silversmith dedicated to the cause of
independence, mounted a borrowed horse and embarked on a midnight
journey that became a defining moment in American history.  
   
The dangerous mission was threefold.  First, sound the alarm for
colonists in farms and villages throughout the Massachusetts
countryside.  On the way, stop in Lexington to inform the leaders of the
colonial resistance, Samuel Adams and John Hancock, that the British
were coming to arrest them.  Finally, prevent the seizure of military
provisions and munitions stored a few miles west in the town of
Concord.  
   
Disregarding personal peril or consequence, Paul Revere rode with
urgency into the night.  After successfully warning Adams and Hancock,
Revere was intercepted by a British patrol just before reaching
Concord.  Yet, Revere had already achieved his most important
mission—relaying the news of the impending British advancement to his
fellow patriots.  Samuel Prescott and William Dawes evaded detection and
carried the news on to Concord, giving the fledgling colonial army a
critical advantage against the advancing Redcoats.  Paul Revere’s
Midnight Ride enabled our troops to prepare for battle and their
eventual victory.  By early the next morning, the first shots rang out
in Lexington Green, signaling the start of the American Revolution.  
   
In 1860, the American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow immortalized “Paul
Revere’s Ride” in a poem that generations of schoolchildren across
America have read and recited.  On this 250th anniversary, we remember
the stirring words that so beautifully capture the urgency and heroism
of that fateful night:  
   
*“Listen my children, and you shall hear*  
*Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere…*  
   
*A cry of defiance, and not of fear,*  
*A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,*  
*And a word that shall echo forevermore!” *  
   
With these timeless verses, Longfellow ensured that Revere’s harrowing
ride for freedom would never be forgotten.  
   
Paul Revere was a master craftsman, a husband, a father, and a proud son
of liberty, who risked his life to help forge a new Nation.  His
courageous ride ignited patriots across the colonies who rose up to
defend their families, their livelihoods, and their sacred liberties. 
On the 250th anniversary of Paul Revere’s Midnight Ride, we commemorate
the enduring legacy of the famed Boston silversmith, patriot, and
revolutionary hero, whose passion for independence and bold act of
defiance set in motion a war of independence that changed the course of
history and transformed the world.
