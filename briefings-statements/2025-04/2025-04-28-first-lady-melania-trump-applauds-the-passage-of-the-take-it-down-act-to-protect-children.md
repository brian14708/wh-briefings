  \ to Protect Children"
---
 
Today, First Lady Melania Trump expressed great pride in the passage of
the *Take It Down Act* by the U.S. House of Representatives. “Advancing
this legislation has been a key focus since I returned to my role as
First Lady this past January. I am honored to have contributed to
guiding it through Congress,” said Mrs. Melania Trump.

The First Lady thanked House Republican leadership for expediting this
bill and commended Members from both parties who voted to protect young
Americans from malicious digital content. This significant achievement
aligns with her ‘Be Best’ initiative and represents a bipartisan effort
to safeguard children from the dangers of non-consensual intimate
imagery (NCII) and deepfake exploitation online.

“Today’s bipartisan passage of the *Take It Down Act* is a powerful
statement that we stand united in protecting the dignity, privacy, and
safety of our children. I am thankful to the Members of Congress—both in
the House and Senate—who voted to protect the well-being of our youth.
Through this critical legislation and our continued focus with ‘Be
Best,’ we are building a future where every child can thrive and achieve
their full potential,” said First Lady Melania Trump.

The *Take It Down Act*, which passed with strong bipartisan support,
will now head to President Donald J. Trump’s desk for signature. The
President previously voiced his support for the bill during his 2025
Address to a Joint Session of Congress.

a high-profile roundtable discussion on Capitol Hill alongside
lawmakers, NCII survivors, and advocates for online protection to build
momentum for the *Take It Down Act*.

During the roundtable, the First Lady asserted, “As organizations
harness the power of our data, the risk of unauthorized access and
misuse of personal information escalates. We must prioritize robust
security measures and uphold strict ethical standards to protect
individual privacy.” Mrs. Trump and others shared powerful stories of
young survivors of NCII, calling on Congress to act swiftly to pass this
critical legislation. Prior to its passage on the floor of the U.S.
House of Representatives, the bill passed the House Energy and Commerce
Committee on April 8, 2025. The Office of the First Lady
