title: Presidential Message on Armenian Remembrance Day, 2025
---
 
Today we commemorate the Meds Yeghern, and honor the memories of those
wonderful souls who suffered in one of the worst disasters of the 20th
Century. Beginning in 1915, one and a half million Armenians were exiled
and marched to their deaths in the final years of the Ottoman Empire. On
this Day of Remembrance, we again join the Great Armenian Community in
America, and around the World, in mourning the many lives that were
lost.  
   
Every year on April 24th, we reflect on the strong and enduring ties
between the American and Armenian peoples. We are proud of the American
Committee for Armenian and Syrian Relief, a groundbreaking effort
established in 1915 that provided crucial humanitarian support to
Armenian Refugees, and grateful for the thousands of Americans who
contributed or volunteered to help the Armenians expelled from their
homes.  
   
On this day, we bear witness to the strength and resiliency of the
Armenian people in the face of tragedy. We are fortunate that so many
Armenians have brought their rich culture to our shores, and contributed
so much to our Country, including decorated soldiers, celebrated
entertainers, renowned architects, and successful business people.  
   
As we honor the memory of those lost, my Administration remains
committed to safeguarding religious freedom and protecting vulnerable
minorities. We look forward to continuing our strategic partnership with
Armenia, and upholding regional stability as we continue to pursue
enduring prosperity and security.
