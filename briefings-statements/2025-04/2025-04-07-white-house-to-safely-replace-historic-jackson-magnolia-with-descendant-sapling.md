  \ Sapling"

WASHINGTON, D.C. — The White House announced today that one of the
several southern magnolia trees near the South Portico of the White
House, commonly known as the “Andrew Jackson Commemorative – Southern
Magnolia,” has been removed from the White House Grounds on Monday,
April 7, 2025, due to serious safety concerns cited in an official
report. A new sapling, which is a direct descendant of the “Jackson
Magnolia,” will be planted in its place on Tuesday, April 8, 2025.

“After expert analysis and careful coordination between Peter Hart, a
board-certified Master Arborist and registered consulting arborist with
the American Society of Consulting Arborists, National Park Service, the
White House Grounds Superintendent, the White House Executive Residence
and its Office of the Curator, the Offices of the President and the
First Lady, and United States Secret Service, the White House has made
the careful decision to remove the Jackson Magnolia to ensure the safety
of staff, visitors, and the Grounds themselves,” said a White House
spokesperson. “Remnants of the old tree will be preserved by the Office
of the Curator and honored by the White House, and this new tree will
continue the heritage of the ‘Jackson Magnolia’ for generations to
come.”

The collaborative decision regarding the “Jackson Magnolia” follows a
comprehensive assessment by Peter Hart, a board-certified master
arborist and registered consulting arborist with the American Society of
Consulting Arborists, which concluded the tree has “surpassed the time
of serving as an aesthetic and historic landmark due to the potential
harm it may cause because of the risk of structural failure.” The report
also recommended, “to eliminate the risk of personal injury and/or
property damage, this tree should be removed as soon as can be
scheduled.”

The National Park Service provided the following in concurrence with the
report, “Despite ongoing preservation efforts, the ‘Jackson Magnolia’
tree has reached the end of its lifespan and must be removed due to
safety concerns. The average lifespan of a Southern Magnolia is 100
years. A new magnolia sapling from the original tree will continue the
tradition of honoring this tree’s history while investing in the future.
Together with the Executive Residence staff, the National Park Service
remains committed to caring for the White House landscape and grounds,
ensuring its legacy endures for this and future generations.”

**BACKGROUND**  
**Preservation**: Existing procedures and cooperation between the
National Park Service (NPS), White House Executive Residence, and its
Office of the Curator, will ensure the preservation of the salvageable
remnants of the “Jackson Magnolia.”

Per NPS: As the White House Grounds are a part of the National Park
system in accordance with applicable NPS regulations and policy and
General Services Administration rules on disposal of excess government
property, the NPS will—after setting aside a sample of the tree for
historical and archival purposes—transfer any remaining wood from the
Jackson Magnolia to the Executive Residence, which is a Federal
component within the Executive Office of the President.

The White House remains committed to the stewardship and preservation of
its historic grounds and will continue to work closely with
professionals in maintaining the safety, beauty, and historical
integrity of the property.

**New Sapling:** The new sapling is 12 years old and was grown at the
offsite National Park Service Greenhouse in preparation for the removal
of its parent, the “Jackson Magnolia.”

**Jackson Magnolia**: The “Jackson Magnolia” is a Southern magnolia
(Magnolia grandiflora), which is located on the South Grounds of the
White House, on the west side of the South Portico. It is considered one
of the oldest trees on the White House complex, which, according to oral
history, traces its roots back to the era of President Andrew Jackson.
Over the years, it has been carefully maintained, including the addition
of structural support efforts, but its condition has declined beyond
recovery. For more information, click
