Speaker of the House of Representatives  
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Mr. Speaker:  
  
I write to apprise you of developments in Yemen and the broader Middle
East region.

Houthi militants operating from bases in Yemen have perpetrated
piratical aggressions against shipping and have continued to threaten
and attack United States forces in the airspace and waters in and around
Yemen. I will no longer allow this band of pirates to threaten and
attack United States forces and commercial vessels in one of the most
important shipping lanes in the world. We will act to keep Americans
safe. Consistent  
with my commitment to defend United States forces and to uphold
navigational rights and freedoms, I directed the Department of Defense
to take several actions concerning the Houthis in Yemen, described
below.

First, I directed the Department of Defense to move additional forces
equipped for combat into the Middle East to enhance the defensive
capabilities available to United States forces and facilitate necessary
military actions. These forces include capabilities for air and missile
defense of Israel and of locations hosting United States forces as well
as fighter, support, and reconnaissance aircraft to enable strikes on
Houthi targets. The additional forces have deployed to countries in the
Middle East region as detailed in the attached classified annex.

Second, at my direction, forces under United States Central Command have
commenced large-scale strikes in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen to
eliminate the capabilities the Houthis use for attacks on United States
forces and commercial ships in the Red Sea and surrounding waters.
United States Navy ships and aircraft, along with United States Air
Force bombers, fighters, and unmanned aircraft, operating in and around
Yemen, have participated in these strikes. Targets have included Houthi
leadership and equipment, command and control facilities, and munitions
storage facilities. We will continue these decisive military operations
until the Houthi threat to United States forces and navigational rights
and freedoms in the Red Sea and adjacent waters has abated.

I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress
fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law
93-148). I directed these actions  
consistent with my responsibility to protect Americans and United States
interests abroad and in furtherance of United States national security
and foreign policy interests, pursuant  
to my constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive
to conduct United States foreign relations. I appreciate the support of
the Congress in this action.

Sincerely,

Donald J. Trump
