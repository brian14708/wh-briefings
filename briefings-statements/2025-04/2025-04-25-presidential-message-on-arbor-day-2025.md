title: Presidential Message on Arbor Day, 2025
---
 
Arbor Day is set aside to plant, nurture, and celebrate trees.  It was
first observed in Nebraska on April 10, 1872, as a way to populate the
barren plains and provide shelter and shade for the pioneers.  Today,
Arbor Day reflects our commitment to preserving the beauty of God’s
creation while ensuring our forests, parks, and public lands remain
accessible and well-managed.  From towering redwoods and awe-inspiring
sequoias to ornamental dogwoods, stately oaks, cedars, and pines,
America’s trees enhance every community, improving air quality, offering
recreational spaces, and supporting industries vital to our economy.  
   
True stewardship of our natural resources requires responsible forest
management in our natural resources.  In recent years, irresponsible
policies have left our forests overgrown and vulnerable to devastating
wildfires—like those seen in California—that have destroyed millions of
acres, displaced families, and taken countless lives.  That is why I
took action to promote active forest management, clearing hazardous
fuels, thinning dense forests, and ensuring well-maintained
landscapes.  
   
My Administration is also cutting red tape and elevating forestry
projects so we use America’s abundant timber resources instead of
relying on costly imports.  Timber production supports 750,000 jobs and
provides essential materials for construction, energy, and
manufacturing.   
   
By freeing our forests and investing in responsible land management, we
are protecting lives, strengthening our economy, and ensuring that our
forests remain healthy and productive for future generations to come.
