President Donald J. Trump and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni held their
first official meeting yesterday in Washington, D.C., where they
confirmed their resolve to promote a mutually beneficial relationship
and further strengthen the U.S. – Italy strategic alliance across
security, economic, and technological issues.  
  
**<u>U.S.- Italy Cooperation for Security</u>**  
The U.S. and Italy underscore that the war in Ukraine must end, and
fully endorse President Trump’s leadership in brokering a ceasefire and
delivering a just and lasting peace.  
       
The U.S. and Italy reiterate the unwavering commitment to NATO and to
the principle of developing their collective and individual capacity to
contribute to the Alliance’s goals. We therefore commit to ensuring our
national security and defense are aligned and funded to meet the
challenges of today, and critically, the risks of tomorrow.  
       
Our defense cooperation must rely on a deep and extensive transatlantic
supply chain. We are facing a complex security environment, and we are
ready to further increase defense equipment and technology cooperation,
including co-production and co-development that strengthen U.S. and
Italian defense industrial capacity and protect it from foreign
adversaries.  
       
The U.S. and Italy reaffirm their shared commitment to counter illegal
immigration and to ensure that legal migration is used as a tool to
benefit our nations and not to create a security problem for our
citizens. We will step up our common efforts to eradicate international
organized crime groups engaged in migrant smuggling and human
trafficking.  
       
The U.S. and Italy confirm their joint effort to fight the production,
distribution, and sale of illicit synthetic drugs, especially synthetic
opioids and the criminal networks trafficking these drugs, which
collectively damage the health, security, and well-being of our citizens
and people around the world.  
  
**<u>U.S. – Italy Cooperation for Shared Prosperity</u>**  
The United States and Italy agree to work to ensure that trade between
the United States and Europe is mutually beneficial, fair, and
reciprocal.  
       
We highlight the importance of information technology to enabling free
enterprise across the Atlantic. We agreed that a non-discriminatory
environment in terms of digital services taxation is necessary to enable
investments from cutting-edge tech companies.  
       
We welcome American investments in AI computing and cloud services in
Italy to maximize the opportunities of digital transformation and
support Italy as the key regional data hub for the Mediterranean and
North Africa.   
       
Developing a workforce that can deliver on the needs of our economies is
vital. The United States and Italy are proud partners in industrial
endeavors that will benefit employment in both countries, playing a
vital role for each other’s supply chains and strengthening our
industrial bases. Italy will contribute to the maritime renaissance of
the U.S. shipbuilding sector, while the U.S. will look into the
investment opportunities offered by the increasingly positive Italian
business environment, including through the incentives granted by the
new Single Special Economic Zone (SEZ) established in Italy.  
       
The U.S. and Italy cooperate to strengthen energy security by further
encouraging the diversification of Italy’s energy supply source and by
increasing exports of U.S. liquefied natural gas to Italy in a mutually
beneficial manner.  
       
The U.S. and Italy will work together to develop the India–Middle
East–Europe Economic Corridor, one of the greatest economic integration
and connectivity projects of this century, connecting partners by ports,
railways, and undersea cables and stimulating economic development and
integration from India, to the Gulf to Israel, to Italy, and onward to
the United States.   
       
Following the example of the President Trump’s successful Abraham
Accords approach, the U.S. and Italy will cooperate on crucial
infrastructural projects and consider leveraging on the Mattei Plan’s
potential.  
  
**<u>U.S. – Italy Cooperation for Technology</u>**  
The United States and Italy recognize the need to protect our national
critical and sensitive infrastructure and technology, which is why we
commit to using only trusted vendors in these networks. There is no
higher trust than our strategic alliance, which is why there can be no
discrimination when it comes to U.S. and Italian vendors.  
       
We are proud to partner on Space Technology, including through two Mars
Missions in 2026 and 2028, and lunar surface exploration on future
Artemis missions.  
       
As we transition to and innovate on the technologies of the future, such
as 6G, AI, quantum computing, and biotechnology, we also commit to
exploring opportunities for enhanced partnerships in these critical
industries that protect our data from adversaries that would exploit
it.  
  
**<u>Invitation to Visit Italy</u>**  
President Trump accepted Prime Minister Meloni’s invitation to pay an
official visit to Italy in the very near future. There is also
consideration to hold, on such occasion, a meeting between U.S. and
Europe.
