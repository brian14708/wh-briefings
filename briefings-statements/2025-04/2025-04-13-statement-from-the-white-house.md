“U.S. Special Presidential Envoy Steven Witkoff, accompanied by U.S.
Ambassador to Oman Ana Escrogima, conducted talks today in Muscat with
Iranian Foreign Minister Dr. Abbas Araghchi, which were hosted by Omani
Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi. The discussions were very
positive and constructive, and the United States deeply thanks the
Sultanate of Oman for its support of this initiative. Special Envoy
Witkoff underscored to Dr. Araghchi that he had instructions from
President Trump to resolve our two nations’ differences through dialogue
and diplomacy, if that is possible. These issues are very complicated,
and Special Envoy Witkoff’s direct communication today was a step
forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome. The sides agreed to
meet again next Saturday.”
