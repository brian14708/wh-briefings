title: 'America 250: Presidential Message on the Anniversary of our Victory in the
  Spanish-American War'
---
 
On December 10, 1898, the United States signed a historic peace treaty
to end the momentous Spanish-American War.  The treaty reaffirmed the
“Monroe Doctrine” by ending the age-old European foothold in the Western
Hemisphere and signaled to the entire world that America was emerging as
a major superpower not to be underestimated.  Today, we honor the
unwavering courage, conviction, and sacrifice of every hero of liberty
who fearlessly confronted forces of tyranny to defend our honor, our
sovereignty, and our birthright of freedom.

As Cuba’s fight for independence escalated under King Alfonso XIII’s
rule—leading to violent unrest that endangered American lives—the United
States deployed the battleship USS MAINE to Havana, the capital of
Cuba.  On February 15, 1898, a devastating explosion sank the ship,
claiming the lives of more than 260 Americans.  This tragedy propelled
the United States toward a momentous struggle for justice and ignited
our Nation’s righteous determination to defend our interests and
maintain our dominance in the Western Hemisphere.  

The war swiftly unfolded as American troops and sailors advanced with
decisive strength, securing victories from Cuba to the Philippines.  At
the Battle of Manila Bay, United States forces destroyed the entire
royal Spanish fleet within mere hours.  Additional fighting in Cuba was
backed by Theodore Roosevelt’s legendary regiment of “Rough Riders,” a
volunteer cavalry made up of cowboys, miners, and college athletes, who
embodied the full measure of American strength, resilience, and grit.
 These triumphant victories across land and sea brought the Spanish
Empire to its breaking point and solidified the United States of America
as the greatest military force in the world.

On this day 127 years ago, the Treaty of Paris formally ended the
conflict and Spain relinquished its claim to Cuba and ceded Guam, Puerto
Rico, and the Philippines to the United States—a pivotal moment that
marked not only the conclusion of the war but the dawn of America’s role
as a military superpower unlike anything the world had ever seen.

Today, we recognize the territories and partnerships forged by the
Treaty of Paris, where the full force of American freedom has taken
root.  Above all, we renew our commitment to a simple truth:  Peace is
maintained through strength.  My Administration is proudly upholding
this America First vision through our negotiations of historic peace
deals in regions marked by decades of conflict—proving to nations around
the world that we can turn the page on the days of endless wars and
usher in a future defined by everlasting peace.

As we commemorate this anniversary of our victory in the
Spanish-American War, we stand united in our unwavering commitment to
peace, military strength, and the enduring principles that define the
American spirit.
