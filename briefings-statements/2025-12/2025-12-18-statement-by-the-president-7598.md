Today, I have signed into law S. 1071, the “National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026” (the “Act”).  The Act authorizes
fiscal year appropriations for the Department of War (DoW), the
Department of Energy national security programs, the Department of
State, the Department of Homeland Security, the Intelligence Community,
and other executive departments and agencies.  The Act will enable the
DoW to carry out my Peace Through Strength agenda, protect the homeland
from domestic and foreign threats, and strengthen the defense industrial
base, while eliminating funding for wasteful and radical programs that
undermine the warfighting ethos of our Nation’s men and women in
uniform.  Importantly, the Act codifies aspects of over a dozen
Executive Orders and actions taken by my Administration, including those
focused on warfighter lethality, advancing homeland missile defense by
fully supporting the Golden Dome for America plan, restoring America’s
airspace sovereignty, and providing Federal recognition of the Lumbee
Tribe of North Carolina.

Over the next 3 years, the United States will host numerous major events
that necessitate new authorities to combat emerging security threats. 
The Act includes the critical SAFER SKIES Act, which provides State and
local law enforcement with the authority to protect against unmanned
aircraft when they present a threat to the public and creates a new
felony offense for a second violation of national defense airspace.  In
addition, the Act provides key resources to ensure the continued
security of the southern border from illegal immigration and
transnational criminal organizations.

Although I am pleased to support the critical objectives of the Act, I
note that certain provisions of the Act raise concerns.

Certain provisions of the Act, including sections 343, 1032-1035,
1048(d)(4)(B), 1266, 5143, and 8304(a), purport to dictate the position
of the United States in external military and foreign affairs.  My
Administration will treat these provisions consistent with the
President’s constitutional authority as Commander in Chief of the Armed
Forces and the President’s constitutional authority to conduct the
foreign affairs of the United States, which includes the authority to
recognize foreign sovereigns.

Several provisions of the Act, including sections 364(a), 383(d), 737,
851, 1070, 1235, 1245, 1253, 1546, 1622, 1806(c), 3111, 6102(b)(3),
6303, 6502(b), 6521, 6524, 6712, 7213, 8102(b), 8315(1)(A)(iii),
8341(a), 8361(b)(3)(A), 8363(h), and 8521, purport to require the
President to submit information to the Congress — such as deliberative
process and national security information — protected by long-recognized
legal privileges.  My Administration will treat these provisions
consistent with the President’s constitutional authority to withhold
information, the disclosure of which could impair foreign relations,
national security, the deliberative processes of the executive branch,
and the performance of the President’s constitutional duties.

Additionally, section 1622 of the Act purports to require my
Administration to provide the Congress with sensitive national security
information on programs, operations, actions, and activities that become
compromised or fail, and section 6504 of the Act purports to require the
granting of security clearances to certain persons.  My Administration
will implement these provisions only to the extent that they are
consistent with the President’s constitutional authority to control the
dissemination of sensitive national security information.  

Several provisions of the Act, including sections 915(a) and 1046(a),
purport to restrict the President’s authority to control the personnel
and materiel the President believes to be necessary or advisable for the
successful conduct of military missions.  While I share the objectives
of the Congress with respect to maintaining the strength and security of
the United States, my Administration will implement these provisions
consistent with the President’s authority as Commander in Chief.

Other provisions of the Act, including sections 1249, 1268, 1507, 1546,
and 1655, purport to require that the Congress receive a certification,
notification, or report before the President directs certain military or
diplomatic actions, including the withdrawal of troops below a minimum
number in particular theaters.  I reiterate the longstanding
understanding of the executive branch that such provisions encompass
only actions for which such advance certification, notification, or
report is feasible and consistent with the President’s constitutional
authorities as Commander in Chief and his authority to conduct the
foreign affairs of the United States. 

Section 1635 of the Act purports to restrict funding until my
Administration completes actions to realign certain organizational units
related to nuclear weapons platforms, delivery systems, and
communication systems, and provides notice to the Congress.  Section
1638 of the Act similarly purports to restrict funding for the Office of
the Secretary of the Air Force until my Administration notifies the
Congress that certain authorities have been delegated within the
national defense apparatus.  My Administration will treat these
provisions consistent with the President’s exclusive constitutional
authorities as Commander in Chief and will interpret them in a manner so
as not to impair the President’s ability to manage the executive branch.

A number of other provisions of the Act, including sections 552, 565(b),
589D(c)(2), 652, 912(g)(3), 1253(f), 1692(c)(2), 1828(c)(4), 1833(e),
2803, 2887(e), 2888(f), 3111, 3123, 7262, 7277, 7511(a), 8202(a)(2), and
8521, purport to require the President or executive branch officials
under the President’s supervision to recommend certain legislative
measures to the Congress.  My Administration will treat these provisions
consistent with Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution, which grants
the President the discretion to recommend to the Congress “such Measures
as he shall judge necessary and expedient,” if any.

Section 3111 of title XXXI of Division C of the Act purports to require
the submission of budget requests to the Congress in particular forms or
to advance particular objectives.  As the Constitution grants the
President the discretion to recommend “such Measures as he shall judge
necessary and expedient,” if any, my Administration will interpret this
provision in a manner so as to not impair the President’s ability to
manage the executive branch.
