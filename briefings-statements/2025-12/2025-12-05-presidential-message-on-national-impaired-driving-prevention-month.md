title: Presidential Message on National Impaired Driving Prevention Month
---
 
Every year, thousands of Americans are injured or killed by reckless
drivers under the influence of alcohol and drugs.  This National
Impaired Driving Prevention Month, we send our prayers and unending
support to every American who has lost a loved one—and we reaffirm our
commitment to preventing drug and alcohol abuse on our roads, protecting
American lives, and making America safe, healthy, and strong.

Drugs and alcohol distort judgment, reduce reaction time, and compromise
the ability to make safe decisions behind the wheel.  Impaired driving
tragically claims an American life every 42 minutes.  For this reason,
my Administration is working tirelessly to end the substance abuse
crisis once and for all.

Since I returned to office, I have taken a series of bold and
unprecedented steps to halt the flow of illegal drugs into our country
by securing our borders and increasing support for law enforcement. 
Under my leadership, the Office of National Drug Control Policy is
taking action to address and prevent substance use disorders and disrupt
the criminal networks that fuel them.  We are investing hundreds of
millions of dollars in programs like the High Intensity Drug Trafficking
Areas Program and the Drug-Free Communities Support Program to dismantle
drug trafficking organizations and restore order and safety to our
streets.  My Administration is also working to increase access to
treatment so that every American battling drug and alcohol use has a
path to total recovery and we will continue working with our partners in
the states to raise awareness through high visibility enforcement
campaigns, such as *Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over.* 

This month, we remember all those whose lives were stolen by impaired
drivers.  We extend our gratitude to the heroic police officers, first
responders, healthcare workers, and local organizations who are working
on the front lines to prevent these catastrophes.  Above all, we
recommit to preventing these senseless tragedies—and we renew our
resolve to never waver in putting the safety, health, and well-being of
the American people first.
