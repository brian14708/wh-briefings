title: 'America 250: Anniversary of the Battle of Trenton'
---
 
On December 26, 1776, the full might of General George Washington’s
Continental Army was revealed along the frozen riverbanks of
Pennsylvania when the Patriots triumphed at the Battle of Trenton—one of
the most legendary battles in American history, which rescued
the Revolution and rekindled the cause of independence in
the heart of every American.

Just months after the signing of the Declaration of Independence,
the Patriots’ rally for freedomhad nearly collapsed.  Driven from New
York, beaten across New Jersey, and forced into Pennsylvania, the
Continental Army was exhausted, undersupplied, and on the verge of
breaking down.  General Washington determined that only a bold and
decisive victory could reverse the tides of misfortune.  Across the
Delaware River, he saw in the Hessian troops in Trenton, New
Jersey—German soldiers fighting for the
British—a desperately-needed opportunity to seize
back momentum and change the course of the war and the course
of history.

On Christmas night, as a fierce winter storm swept across the region,
Washington ordered 2,400 weary soldiers into boats and began his epic
crossing of the Delaware River—a moment now immortalized in the American
imagination.  Despite extraordinary dangers, his men pushed artillery,
horses, and provisions through ice-choked waters for 11 hours, then
marched 9 gruelingmiles—many without boots on their feet—toward Trenton
through unrelenting cold, leaving a trail of blood in the snowy hills.

At dawn, General Washington’s troops gathered in frigid darkness to
prepare for a surprise strike against the Hessian auxiliaries hired by
the British.  They advanced on the town from two directions.  American
cannons opened fire, Patriot infantry pressed forward, and the Hessian
defenders— caught off guard—struggled to mount an organized response.
 After 2 hours of close
fighting, the 900 Hessian mercenaries surrendered, and the Continental
Army emerged triumphant.

The crossing of the Delaware and the victory at Trenton—steered by
the fearless leadership of General Washington—restored confidence in the
American cause and changed the Revolution. The Patriots’ victory proved
that courage and determination could overcome fear and despair.  Despite
being exhausted, unpaid, under-equipped, and teetering on the edge of
defeat, they valiantly showed the world that they were not only capable
of winning but also that they would never waver in their righteous
crusade for independence and that the American spirit would
always triumph over forces of anguish, adversity, and affliction.

In the harsh winter of 1776, our ancestors demonstrated that, when the
future of our Nation is threatened, Americans endure and prevail.  Their
endurance in the face of cold, hunger, and uncertainty laid the
foundation for the country we now uphold.  Today, we salute the valiant
men whose victory at Trenton secured our proud inheritance of liberty.
 As we approach 250 glorious years of American independence and continue
the work of saving our country, we look to their unwavering grit, valor,
and patriotism—and in their honor, we vow to never stop fighting for the
sacred causes that sustain our Republic, our way of life, and our
birthright of freedom.
