title: "HOME IS WHERE THE HEART IS \u2013 First Lady Melania Trump\u2019s 2025 White\
  \ House Christmas Theme"
---
 
First Lady Melania Trump’s 2025 White House Christmas theme, *Home Is
Where The Heart Is*, illuminates the heartfelt character of America
within the People’s House.

The First Lady’s creative inspiration is drawn from the joys,
challenges, and frequent motion derived from motherhood and business.
“The constant movement has taught me that home is not merely a physical
space; rather, it is the warmth and comfort I carry within, regardless
of my surroundings,” America’s First Lady reflects. “This Christmas,
let’s celebrate the love we hold within ourselves, and share it with the
world around us.  After all, wherever we are, we can create a home
filled with grace, radiance, and endless possibilities.”

**Fostering the Future Red Room**  
First Lady Melania Trump appointed renowned designer, Hervé Pierre, to
oversee the implementation of her creative vision. Blue butterflies
illuminate the “Fostering the Future Red Room,” a transformational
experience dedicated to the foster-care community, a cause the First
Lady has championed since 2021. The striking color combination coupled
with the butterflies symbolic meaning of transformation and renewal
capture the essence of Christmas.

Mr. Pierre also created a limited-edition tour booklet—an artful
keepsake that captures the magic of this year’s White House’s holiday
theme for guests to treasure.

**Time-Honored Tradition**  
Honoring tradition, 75 of Mrs. Trump’s signature wreaths with classic
red bows adorn the White House windows, and more than 50 Christmas
trees, 700 feet of garland, 25,000 feet of ribbon, and 10,000
butterflies fill the halls with holiday warmth.

**Gold Star Families**  
In the Blue Room, the official White House Christmas Tree, an 18-foot
concolor fir from Sidney, Michigan, commemorates Gold Star Families with
gold stars and ornaments representing the official bird and flower of
every U.S. state and territory—a tribute to the resilience, bravery, and
sacrifice of our military personnel and their families.

**250th Anniversary**  
Patriotic exhibits featuring America’s signature red, white, and blue
accentuate the upcoming 250th anniversary of the Nation in the East
Room, while two presidential portraits created from over 6,000 puzzle
pieces are presented in the Green Room, offering families the chance to
be challenged, have fun, and use their imagination together.  

**120 Pounds of Gingerbread**  
The 2025 Gingerbread House is prominently displayed in the State Dining
Room, highlighting the South Portico and offering a glimpse of the
Yellow Oval Room—an artistic culinary triumph, boasting more than 120
pounds of gingerbread. The Grand Foyer features a section of the
historic White House Crèche, which is currently undergoing meticulous
restoration by the White House Curators. As Americans explore the
historic rooms of the White House this holiday season, the 2025
Christmas decorations serve as a reminder that the strength of our
Nation is found in its people—in our shared values, valued traditions,
and the steadfast belief that home is where the heart is.
