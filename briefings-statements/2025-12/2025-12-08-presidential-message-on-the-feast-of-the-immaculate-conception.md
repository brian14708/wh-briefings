title: Presidential Message on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception
---
 
Today, I recognize every American celebrating December 8 as a Holy Day
honoring the faith, humility, and love of Mary, mother of Jesus and one
of the greatest figures in the Bible.

On the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, Catholics celebrate what they
believe to be Mary’s freedom from original sin as the mother of God. 
She first entered recorded history as a young woman when, according to
Holy Scripture, the Angel Gabriel greeted her in the village of Nazareth
with news of a miracle: “Hail, favored one!  The Lord is with you,”
announcing that “you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you
shall name him Jesus.”

In one of the most profound and consequential acts of history, Mary
heroically accepted God’s will with trust and humility:  “Behold, I am
the handmaid of the Lord.  May it be done to me according to your
word.”  Mary’s decision forever altered the course of humanity.  Nine
months later, God became man when Mary gave birth to a son, Jesus, who
would go on to offer his life on the Cross for the redemption of sins
and the salvation of the world.

For nearly 250 years, Mary has played a distinct role in our great
American story.  In 1792, less than a decade after the end of the
Revolutionary War, Bishop John Carroll—the first Catholic bishop in the
United States and cousin of signer of the Declaration of Independence
Charles Carroll—consecrated our young Nation to the mother of Christ. 
Less than a quarter-century later, Catholics attributed General Andrew
Jackson’s stunning victory over the British in the climactic Battle of
New Orleans to Mary.  Every year, Catholics celebrate a Mass of
Thanksgiving in New Orleans on January 8 in memory of Mary’s assistance
in saving the city.

Over the ages, American legends like Elizabeth Ann Seton, Frances Xavier
Cabrini, and Fulton Sheen, who spent their lives glorifying God in
service to others, have held a deep devotion to Mary.  The Basilica of
the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, located in the heart
of our Nation’s Capital, honors Mary as the largest church in North
America.  The timeless hymn “Ave Maria” remains beloved by countless
citizens.  She has inspired the establishment of countless churches,
hospitals, and schools.  Nearly 50 American colleges and universities
bear Mary’s name.  And, just days from now, on December 12, Catholics in
the United States and Mexico will celebrate the steadfast devotion to
Mary that originated in the heart of Mexico—a place now home to the
beautiful Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe—in 1531.  As we approach 250
years of glorious American Independence, we acknowledge and give thanks,
with total gratitude, for Mary’s role in advancing peace, hope, and love
in America and beyond our shores.

More than a century ago, in the midst of World War I, Pope Benedict XV,
the leader of the Roman Catholic Church, commissioned and dedicated a
majestic statue of Mary, Queen of Peace, bearing the infant Christ with
an olive branch so that the Christian faithful would be encouraged to
look to her example of peace by praying for a stop to the horrific
slaughter.  Just a few months later, World War I ended.  Today, we look
to Mary once again for inspiration and encouragement as we pray for an
end to war and for a new and lasting era of peace, prosperity, and
harmony in Europe and throughout the world.

In her honor, and on a day so special to our Catholic citizens, we
remember the sacred words that have brought aid, comfort, and support to
generations of American believers in times of need:

*Hail, Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.  Blessed art thou
among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.  Holy Mary,
Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.
 Amen.*
