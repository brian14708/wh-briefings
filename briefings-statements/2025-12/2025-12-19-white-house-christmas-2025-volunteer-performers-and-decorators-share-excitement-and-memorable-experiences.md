title: 'White House Christmas 2025: Volunteer Performers and Decorators Share Excitement
  and Memorable Experiences'
---
 
First Lady Melania Trump and President Donald J. Trump continued the
cherished annual tradition of welcoming volunteer performers and
decorators from across the country to Washington, D.C., for White House
Christmas 2025: Home Is Where The Heart Is.

A select number of volunteer decorators and performers representing
communities nationwide were invited to take part in this historic
celebration. Over Thanksgiving week, 150 volunteer decorators from 50
states and 2 territories traveled to our Nation’s Capital to help
transform the White House for the holiday season. Ranging in age from 19
to 76 and representing a wide array of professions and backgrounds,
these volunteers contributed their time, talent, and creativity in
service to the People’s House.

In addition, over 25 volunteer performer groups from 22 states were
selected to share their music throughout the season. Group sizes ranged
from solo performers to ensembles of more than 30 members, featuring
choirs, jazz bands, and instrumentalists whose performances reflected
the diversity and richness of American musical traditions. Through their
participation, these volunteers became a special part of White House
history—sharing their artistry and service with visitors and helping
create a Christmas experience defined by joy, creativity, and community.

Below is a brief summary of what communities across America are saying
about their local performers and decorators selected to take part in
White House Christmas 2025.
