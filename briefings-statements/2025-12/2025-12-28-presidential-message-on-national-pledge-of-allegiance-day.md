title: Presidential Message on National Pledge of Allegiance Day
---
 
Today, our Nation proudly celebrates the Pledge of Allegiance—a solemn
and glorious oath that unites every citizen under one God and our
beloved banner of red, white, and blue.  This National Pledge of
Allegiance Day, I encourage every American to rededicate themselves to
our Flag, our heritage, and the eternal principles that have guided our
Republic for nearly 250 years.

The Pledge of Allegiance has been a foundation of American life since it
was first written in 1892.  Its words gave our growing Nation a shared
expression of duty—reminding students, civic leaders, and new Americans
that they were active participants in the American story.  By reciting
it aloud, citizens declare their loyalty to our Flag and to the values
it embodies:  freedom, the rule of law, the dignity of life, and the
duty to serve our country and our communities.

Through the trials of war and economic upheaval, the Pledge has been a
steady reminder of the commitments every citizen makes.  Its words have
inspired soldiers defending freedom abroad, motivated Americans to
safeguard our constitutional way of life here at home, and strengthened
the bonds of patriotism that unite communities all across our land. 
Every generation recites the Pledge grounded in the recognition that to
honor the Flag is to honor the Nation for which it stands.

Today, my Administration is strongly defending the value of American
citizenship and respect for the American Flag.  Last summer, I signed an
Executive Order to preserve the dignity of our Stars and Stripes,
including by vigorously enforcing accountability for acts of Flag
desecration tied to violence and lawlessness—because those who hate our
Flag resent the history, heritage, and heroes it represents even more. 
We are also authorizing the revocation of visas, residency, and
naturalization for foreign nationals who desecrate the banner under
which millions of American heroes have fought and died.  We will never
again allow those who hate our country to openly disrespect our Flag—and
we will never waver in defending the sacred heritage that unites the
American people beneath its banner.

On this National Pledge of Allegiance Day, we renew our devotion to the
ideals that define the United States and to the Flag that symbolizes our
shared destiny:  one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and
justice for all.
