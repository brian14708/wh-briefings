title: Presidential Message on the Eighth Anniversary of Recognizing Jerusalem as
  the Capital of the State of Israel
---
 
On December 6, 2017, during my first term in office, I proudly signed a
proclamation to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel
and to relocate the United States Embassy to that marvelous city—a
transformative step forward in the pursuit of peace in the Middle East. 
Today, 8 years later, my Administration renews its commitment to
ushering in a new era of peace, prosperity, and stability in the region
and all around the world.

For centuries, Jerusalem has been a sacred city of pilgrimage and
worship for Jews, Christians, and Muslims, revered for its rich history
and deep biblical origins.  Since the establishment of the modern State
of Israel in 1948, Jerusalem has served as its cultural and religious
heart and the seat of its government.  However, for decades, weak
politicians refused to formally recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s
capital—despite Congress voting to support the action—because they
believed that moving our embassy would harm the cause of peace in the
region.  Yet delaying the recognition brought us no closer to a lasting
peace agreement and showed that repeating the same approach to old
challenges produces only the same failed results.  In recognizing
Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moving our embassy to that beautiful
city, we acknowledged the rightful capital that stands at the heart of
Israel’s traditions, government, and heritage—and now we stand on the
doorstep of one of the greatest diplomatic achievements in history as a
strong, durable, and everlasting peace is emerging across the Middle
East.

We further strengthened this commitment to peace during my first term by
brokering the historic Abraham Accords, acknowledging Israel’s
sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and securing groundbreaking peace
agreements between Israel and other Arab-Muslim countries.

Ever since I returned to office as the 47th President of the United
States, my Administration has built upon these unprecedented
achievements by once again leading the world with courage, strength, and
resolve—setting the stage for lasting peace in regions around the world
marked by long-standing conflict.  I am proud to have led a significant
peace agreement between the State of Israel and Hamas to end more than 2
years of profound suffering and loss, secure the full liberation of all
hostages, and deliver humanitarian relief to the communities affected by
this deadly war.  This monumental agreement is a massive leap toward an
enduring peace for the Israeli and Palestinian people—one that ensures
security, brings stability, and offers hope for generations to come.

As President, I will always work tirelessly to bring peace to conflicts
in every region and on every continent—and my Administration will never
waver in promoting a foreign policy of peace through strength.
