title: Presidential Message on Wright Brothers Day
---
 
Today our Nation celebrates the heroic moment America took to the skies
when Orville and Wilbur Wright launched the first controlled,
machine-powered aircraft on December 17, 1903.  This Wright Brothers
Day, we honor the genius and bravery of two pioneers from Dayton, Ohio,
and we proudly carry their legacy forward by championing the
imagination, perseverance, and bold ambition that gave rise to their
magnificent achievement.

What the Wright brothers lacked in formal education, they matched with
unrelenting drive.  Despite not earning high school degrees, Orville and
Wilbur taught themselves the mechanical and engineering skills they
needed to build their first aircraft.  They drew inspiration from
European gliders and soon after attempted their own leap into the
uncharted frontier of powered flight.  After 4 years of relentless
research, design, and testing, their work paid off on a cold, gray day
near Kitty Hawk when Orville lifted their *Flyer* into the air for 12
seconds, traveling 120 feet at just under 7 miles per hour.  Orville and
Wilbur’s feat marked the first time in history that man lifted off the
ground in a piloted, mechanized flying machine.

The Wright brothers’ epic feat on the windswept shores of North Carolina
opened a new chapter of innovation for all mankind and began a new era
of American aviation power that continues to propel our country upwards
among the clouds and beyond.  Since that historic day in North Carolina,
the United States has remained the world leader in flight and aviation. 
Less than seven decades later, the Wright brothers’ triumph at Kitty
Hawk led Americans to the moon, and my Administration is focused on
returning there, and beyond to Mars.

We are also continuing the Wright brothers’ proud legacy by presiding
over a new Golden Age of air travel and innovation.  Shortly after I
returned to office, I signed an Executive Order restoring excellence and
safety within the Federal Aviation Administration.  We are ending
disastrous so-called “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion” programs that
put Americans at risk and restoring the sacred principle of merit to
hiring practices.  Through the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, we
are investing $12.5 billion to modernize air traffic control with
cutting-edge technology.

America is also leading the way in supersonic flight.  I have ordered
the administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to conduct
groundbreaking levels of research and development into commercial
supersonic flight, driving new advances in air travel that will
incorporate the latest Artificial Intelligence technologies.

In the 122 years since the Wright brothers’ revolutionary flight, our
Nation has never stopped gazing upward in wonder and hope.  As we
commemorate Orville and Wilbur’s legendary achievement today, we pledge
to carry their vision into every new frontier and keep America’s skies
bright with the innovation, discovery, and unstoppable spirit that drive
our Nation to new heights.
