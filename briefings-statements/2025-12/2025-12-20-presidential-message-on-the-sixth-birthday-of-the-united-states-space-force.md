title: Presidential Message on the Sixth Birthday of the United States Space Force
---
 
On December 20, 2019, I established the United States Space
Force—America’s Guardians of the High Frontier—as the sixth branch
of our Armed Forces.  Today, our Nation thanks the incredible
Guardians who serve with honor and distinction and protect our people,
our homeland, and our glorious way of life beyond the bounds of Earth.

Since the dawn of space exploration, America has been the world leader
in technology, innovation, and discovery.  Every day, the heroic members
of the Space Force carry out this legacy with precision and unrelenting
expertise to ensure that the United States is always prepared to
confront threats originating both on our planet and beyond our
skies.  Through their selfless service, Guardians solidify America’s
continued space superiority by deterring counterspace threats from our
adversaries; delivering space capabilities like satellite
communications, navigation, and missile defense, which empowers the
greatest economy and military in the world; and ensuring safe and fair
access to space for our American businesses and Armed Forces.  From
fortifying our economy to defending our homeland and strengthening our
military, the Space Force is indispensable to our security, our
sovereignty, and our beloved way of life. 

By establishing the United States Space Force, my first Administration
took bold action to strengthen America’s ability to compete, deter, and
win in space.  Today, with adversaries embarking on a relentless crusade
to destroy American space capabilities with counterspace weaponry, the
high frontier is emerging as the next domain in modern warfare.  For
this reason, America’s Guardians and the civilian employees who support
their mission play a crucial role in meeting these
threats—including through the development and implementation of the
Golden Dome, a cutting-edge missile defense shield to safeguard our
citizens and infrastructure from aerial attack,
which received federal funding from this year’s historic One Big
Beautiful Bill.  As a result of our strong leadership, enthusiasm to
serve has surged, with the Space Force shattering expectations by
meeting its annual recruiting goals three months early this
summer.  When America leads in space, America wins—and our military
remains the strongest, most feared, and most lethal in every sphere of
battle.

As Commander in Chief, I join the Nation in celebrating the sixth
birthday of the United States Space Force.  Our Guardians keep
our country safe, strong, and free both on our shores and in the vast
domain of space, and we offer our endless gratitude for their service
and sacrifice.

Semper Supra!
