**Full Remarks by First Lady Melania Trump, As Prepared for Delivery:**

Good afternoon, and thank you all for being here. It is a pleasure to
join you during this beautiful Christmas season, and it is an honor to
welcome you to Blair House.

Blair House holds a special place in the life of our nation. For
generations, this residence has been the quiet, dignified bridge between
the White House and the world. It has offered warmth, security, and
hospitality to kings and queens, presidents and prime ministers, and
leaders from every corner of the globe.

Blair House is an American institution. Built in the 1800’s, this
structure’s legacy transcends generations. As we prepare to celebrate
America’s 250th anniversary, we should reflect on the important role our
institutions play in shaping our nation’s values.  Moreover, we must
strive to do more than merely preserve our institutions, we must grow
them with innovation so that each can shine for future generations.

Today, we celebrate not only this historic home, but the people who make
its mission possible. Your generosity preserves a tradition of American
hospitality.

As First Lady, it is a privilege to once again be part of this special
chapter of American history. Blair House represents grace, stability,
and the confidence of a nation that leads with strength, courtesy and
kindness.

I am grateful to each of you – including the Blair House Foundation
Board of Trustees and Chair, Sarah Perot, for your dedication to this
cause. You help protect a place where diplomacy begins long before the
cameras arrive and where friendships between nations can begin to take
root.

Thank you again and best wishes to you and your families for a very
Merry Christmas, Happy Hannukah, and a joyful and peaceful New Year.
