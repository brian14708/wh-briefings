title: Congressional Bill H.R. 131 Vetoed
---
 
I am returning herewith without my approval H.R. 131, the Finish the
Arkansas Valley Conduit Act. 

The Arkansas Valley Conduit (AVC) is a water pipeline currently being
built to provide municipal and industrial water to communities in
southeastern Colorado.  It was originally authorized as part of the
Fryingpan-Arkansas Project in a bill signed by President Kennedy in
1962.  For decades it was unbuilt, largely because the AVC was
economically unviable.  Under the original plan, the costs of the
project were to be initially funded by the Federal Government, but
repaid by local users, with interest, over a 50-year period following
completion of construction.  But participants were unable to comply with
that repayment obligation.

In 2009, President Obama signed the Omnibus Public Land Management Act
of 2009, which not only reduced the repayment obligation from 100
percent to 35 percent but also provided that miscellaneous revenues from
the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project at large would count towards the AVC cost
share.  Even then, however, construction did not begin until 14 years
later, after the State of Colorado authorized $100 million in loans and
grants for the project.

The current bill would now have the Federal Government extend the
repayment period (on the already-reduced repayment requirement) for an
additional 25 years, creating a 75-year repayment period.  The bill
would also cut the interest rate in half. 

More than $249 million has already been spent on the AVC, and total
costs are estimated to be $1.3 billion.  H.R. 131 would continue the
failed policies of the past by forcing Federal taxpayers to bear even
more of the massive costs of a local water project — a local water
project that, as initially conceived, was supposed to be paid for by the
localities using it.

Enough is enough.  My Administration is committed to preventing American
taxpayers from funding expensive and unreliable policies.  Ending the
massive cost of taxpayer handouts and restoring fiscal sanity is vital
to economic growth and the fiscal health of the Nation.   

For these reasons, I cannot support the Finish the Arkansas Valley
Conduit Act.  Therefore, it is my duty to return H.R. 131 to the House
of Representatives without my approval.
