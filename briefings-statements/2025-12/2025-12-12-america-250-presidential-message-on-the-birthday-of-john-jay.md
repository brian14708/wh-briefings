title: 'America 250: Presidential Message on the Birthday of John Jay'
---
 
Today, our Nation celebrates the 280th birthday of John Jay—the first
Chief Justice of the United States, a titan of American sovereignty, and
a key architect of our laws, our foreign policy, and our glorious
American independence. 

Born in New York City and raised with the timeless values of faith and
civic duty, John Jay answered the call to public service at a moment
when America was still fighting for its right to define itself.  As
President of the Second Continental Congress, he played a central role
in America’s struggle for independence, and after our victory in the
Revolutionary War Jay helped to negotiate the Treaty of Paris—freeing us
from tyranny and ensuring that American sovereignty was recognized all
around the world.

Jay was also a central figure in molding the American constitutional
order.  In 1787 and 1788, he took up his pen to author five essays of
*The Federalist Papers*, articulating the eternal principles of justice
that have defined our federal laws, our system of government, and our
foreign policy for nearly 250 years—including his belief in a
centralized Federal Government to protect the American people from the
influence of nations overseas.  As the first Chief Justice appointed to
the Supreme Court, he set in motion a judicial framework grounded in
integrity, fairness, and the immortal promise of equal justice under the
law.  And as one of our nation’s first great diplomats, the Treaty of
Amity, Commerce, and Navigation that he negotiated with Great Britain
kept America out of the French Revolutionary Wars and ensured a decade
of peace for our fledgling nation.

He carried this same conviction from the national stage and into State
governance as the second Governor of New York, where he oversaw the
construction of roads and canals that supported the state’s early
growth—laying a foundation that would shape major developments and lead
to New York’s legendary skyline and resilient character in the
generations that followed, a legacy I was proud to build upon.

As we prepare to celebrate 250 glorious years of American independence
next year, we recognize John Jay’s lasting contributions to our
government, our traditions, and our national character.  My
Administration remains committed to preserving the principles he
cherished so deeply—including that peace is preserved through strength,
that our Nation’s foreign policy must always put America first, and that
a nation without the rule of law ceases to be a nation at all.  Today,
in John Jay’s honor, we reaffirm our commitment to liberty and justice
for all and to carrying his extraordinary vision forward for years to
come.

Happy birthday, John Jay!
