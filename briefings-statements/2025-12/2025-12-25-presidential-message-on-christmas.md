title: Presidential Message on Christmas
---
 
The First Lady and I send our warmest wishes to all Americans as we
share in the joy of Christmas Day and celebrate the birth of our Lord
and Savior, Jesus Christ.

The story of the Christmas miracle begins more than 2,000 years ago in
Bethlehem, when angels appeared to humble shepherds to share the good
news of a child born to bring hope to the world, declaring, “Glory to
God in the highest.”  Guided by a magnificent star, the shepherds
traveled a great distance to gather around a crowded manger where, in
the dark of night alongside Mary and Joseph, they knelt before the Light
of the World, the source of eternal salvation, and the living Son of
God.

The birth of Jesus revealed the perfect expression of God’s boundless
love and His desire to be close to His people.  More than two centuries
later, we continue to rejoice in the gift of God’s only begotten Son as
the graces of Christ’s life, death, and resurrection continue to pour
out upon all who believe.

This Christmas, we also give thanks for the many blessings that God has
bestowed upon our great Nation.  For nearly 250 years, the principles of
faith, family, and freedom have remained at the center of our way of
life.  As President, I will never waver in defending the fundamental
values that make America the greatest country in the history of the
world—and we will always remain one Nation under God.

Today, especially, we also remember the brave men and women of our Armed
Forces who are unable to be with their families.  While their solemn
mission keeps them far from home this Christmas, their service and
sacrifice protect our freedom and allow Americans all across our country
to celebrate in safety and peace.  We are grateful for their devotion,
and we keep them and their loved ones close in our hearts.

During the Christmas season, we pray for an outpouring of God’s abiding
love, divine mercy, and everlasting peace upon our country and the
entire world.  To every American, and to those celebrating around the
globe, we wish you a very Merry Christmas!
