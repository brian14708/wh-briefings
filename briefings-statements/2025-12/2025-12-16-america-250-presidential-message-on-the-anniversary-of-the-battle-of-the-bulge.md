title: 'America 250: Presidential Message on the Anniversary of the Battle of the
  Bulge'
---
 
Today, we commemorate the 81st anniversary of the legendary Battle of
the Bulge—the largest and deadliest battle fought by American forces in
the Second World War, which culminated in a blistering, brutal, and
breakthrough Allied victory that ultimately forced the Nazi regime into
total surrender.

After a series of sweeping victories across Western Europe—including the
D-Day landings of American, British, and Canadian forces in Normandy,
France—Allied forces were confident that the Nazi army was on the brink
of collapse.  Desperate to halt the Allied advance and reverse their
momentum, Adolf Hitler ordered a massive surprise offensive through the
Ardennes Forest, aiming to split the Allied lines, capture a vital port,
and force peace negotiations on more favorable terms for Germany.

On the frigid morning of December 16, 1944, Nazi troops numbering
approximately 200,000 men launched their full-scale assault on Allied
personnel resting in the Ardennes Forest.  Though they initially gained
ground, the Germans soon encountered the unbreakable resolve and
overwhelming strength of the Allied armies.  With reinforcements pouring
in, more than 500,000 German and 600,000 Allied troops—including 500,000
American soldiers—battled in blinding snow and sub-zero temperatures for
41 excruciating days, including Christmas, as soldiers held the front
lines in defense of our freedom far away from home.

The American-led Allies held firm and withstood relentless assaults,
halting the German advance and inflicting devastating casualties.  They
secured a crucial victory, shattering the resources and manpower of the
enemy and setting the stage for the Allied invasion of Germany and the
eventual collapse and surrender of the Nazi regime.  With 19,000
American soldiers tragically killed during the battle, the Battle of the
Bulge stands as the single deadliest American military engagement of
World War II—a testament to the indispensable role the United States
played in securing the victory of the Allied powers and ending the war. 
Without the sacrifice of our American soldiers, the war would not have
been won, and our world today would look drastically different.

On the anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge, we honor the legacy of
the soldiers who fought to save the world from tyranny, destruction, and
evil.  And as we approach 250 years of American independence, we renew
our resolve that the blessings of freedom are only secured by the
devotion and sacrifices of the patriots willing to defend it.
