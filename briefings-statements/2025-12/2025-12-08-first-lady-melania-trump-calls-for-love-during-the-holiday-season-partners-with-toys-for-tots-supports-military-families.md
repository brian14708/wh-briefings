title: First Lady Melania Trump Calls for Love During the Holiday Season, Partners
  with Toys for Tots & Supports Military Families
---
 
“This Christmas season, you, your friends, and your families should wish
for the ultimate gift – love. After all, love travels further than
Santa’s sleigh and America’s Ospreys,” affirmed First Lady Melania
Trump.

Mrs. Trump arrived with Santa Claus at Marine Corps Base Quantico with
Santa Claus aboard a V-22 Osprey today. To the delight of United States
Marines, volunteers, and military families, Mrs. Trump, Toys for Tots,
and the Toy Association continued their +75-year tradition, bringing
extra joy to millions of children across America.

The First Lady framed the courage and resilience of military children,
telling them, “You are the heart of today’s celebration.” She delivered
remarks to hundreds of children inside a decorated and historic hangar,
helped distribute toys, visited activity stations, and spent time with
families whose loved ones serve both at home and abroad.

Mrs. Trump concluded by wishing all military families a Merry Christmas
and expressing the Nation’s gratitude for the strength, generosity, and
patriotism they share with their communities.

**First Lady Melania Trump’s full remarks, as prepared for delivery:**

Thank you, General Anderson.  It’s wonderful to join everyone here at
Marine Corps Base Quantico.

You might be wondering why Santa asked me to bring him here today.
 Well—this wonderful adventure is filled with Christmas sparkle and lots
of love.

Santa’s reindeer—Rudolph, Dasher, Comet—all of them—they are resting in
the North Pole.  They need to save all of their energy for their great
flight around the world on Christmas Eve.  Santa told me they’re
snuggled beneath warm, fluffy blankets, sipping candy-cane cocoa feeling
the joy and love that will soon be shared with amazing children
everywhere.

So, with his sleigh parked safely with his reindeer, Santa climbed
aboard my Osprey and couldn’t stop smiling. I watched him gazing out of
the window, grinning at all the wonderful American families below. Santa
told me that the Osprey floated through the sky like a giant
snowflake—but it is WAY faster than his sleigh could ever fly.

Today, we are here for one of the most beloved traditions of the holiday
season: Toys for Tots, led by the United States Marine Corps Reserves.
For more than 75 years, Marines and volunteers across America collect
and deliver new toys to children who need a little extra joy during
Christmas. All wrapped with love, and great care.

To everyone here at Quantico, and all those who support the Toys for
Tots Foundation, thank you. This includes the Toy Association’s generous
support. I am grateful for your partnership and dedication to promoting
fun and creativity. You help bring the delight of Christmas morning to
millions of children, and you remind us that: of all American
traditions, kindness and love remain among our most powerful.

To the families of military personnel: you are the heart of today’s
celebration. Your strength in the face of adversity is inspirational.
Some of the children here today have a parent stationed away from home
right now. I know this can be difficult. On behalf of our Nation, thank
you.

And thank you to the parents and guardians who are here today. Your
support and resilience empower our Marines to serve with honor and
distinction. Whether near or far, you illuminate every occasion,
enriching everyone’s life.

This Christmas season, you, your friends, and your families should wish
for the ultimate gift—love. After all, love travels further than Santa’s
sleigh and America’s Ospreys.

Thank you and Merry Christmas!
