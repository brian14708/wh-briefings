**The Honorable Lonnie G. Bunch III**

Secretary, Smithsonian Institution

1000 Jefferson Dr SW

Washington, DC 20560

**Subject: Review of Smithsonian Exhibitions and Materials**

Dear Secretary Bunch,

In our previous correspondence, we requested that the Smithsonian
Institution provide us with certain documentation, including current
exhibition descriptions, draft plans for upcoming shows, upcoming
programming materials, and internal guidelines used in exhibition
development as part of a comprehensive internal review of selected
Smithsonian museums and exhibitions. As noted in that letter, dated
August 12, 2025, we requested that the original materials be submitted
no later than September 11, 2025. In recognition of ongoing staffing
transitions at the Smithsonian, we happily extended the time period for
response. While we received a partial production of materials from your
office on September 18, no other material has been produced by your
office to us in the more than 90 days since that September date.

While we appreciate receiving the initial document production, that
submission fell far short of what was requested, and the overwhelming
majority of requested items remain outstanding. For your reference,
attached hereto as **<u>Exhibit A</u>** is an internal memorandum
prepared by staff members of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
that outlines the partial set of materials received and what we are
still requesting.

Current wall texts and didactics, exhibition proposals and budgets,
object checklists for upcoming programming, internal governance manuals,
and chain-of-command records for content approval are not obscure
archival requests. These are the records that every accredited museum is
expected to maintain and produce without delay, as they provide the
basis for responsible stewardship of significant national collections
and for meeting the rigorous transparency standards imposed by federal
law, the Smithsonian’s own directives, and the professional standards of
the museum field. 

The American Alliance of Museums (AAM), the International Council of
Museums (ICOM), and the Association of Art Museum Directors (AAMD) all
maintain that having this information readily available is best
professional practice.  And, indeed, the Smithsonian Charter—codified at
20 U.S.C. § 46—similarly requires that “a fair and accurate record” be
made of *all* the Institution’s “proceedings.”  This statutory
obligation was later carried forward in Smithsonian Directive 501, which
eliminated any doubt that the Institution must “create and keep complete
and accurate records of its activities; maintain the integrity of those
records; and preserve records of enduring evidential or historical
value.”

As officials designated by the President pursuant to Executive Order
14253, “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” it is our job
to ensure that the Smithsonian is meeting these high standards.

We write this follow up letter with particular urgency and concern that
the museums of the Smithsonian Institution be well positioned to play an
important role during the historic yearlong celebration of our Nation’s
250th birthday that is fast approaching. We wish to be assured that none
of the leadership of the Smithsonian museums is confused about the fact
that the United States has been among the greatest forces for good in
the history of the world. The American people will have no patience for
any museum that is diffident about America’s founding or otherwise
uncomfortable conveying a positive view of American history, one which
is justifiably proud of our country’s accomplishments and record.

We therefore ask for your personal attention to ensuring the fulfillment
of the documents requested in our original letter, which are noted in
**<u>Exhibit A</u>**. We look forward to receiving the complete
materials at the earliest possible date but hopefully no later than
January 13, 2025. We think it would be helpful for you to establish a
chain of custody protocol so that OMB staff can track what materials are
uploaded to the Dropbox by which Smithsonian personnel for the purposes
of our cataloging and processing various asset types (photos vs videos
vs documents, etc.).

As you may know, funds apportioned for the Smithsonian Institution are
only available for use in a manner consistent with Executive Order
14253, “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” and the
fulfillment of the requests set forth in our August 12, 2025 letter.

Thank you in advance for your partnership and urgency. We are confident
that you share our view that the Smithsonian Institution must lead by
example in scholarship, presentation, and accountability. The upcoming
250th anniversary of the founding of our Nation offers a singular
opportunity to justify confidence in the operations of America’s leading
cultural institutions. We are eager to work together to make the
Smithsonian’s contribution to America’s 250th anniversary a triumph.

Sincerely,

**Vince Haley  **

*Assistant to the President and Director of the Domestic Policy Council

*Assistant to the President and Director of the Office of Management and
Budget*

MEMORANDUM FOR DIRECTORS VOUGHT AND HALEY

FROM: OMB STAFF

SUBJECT: STATUS UPDATE ON SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION DOCUMENT PRODUCTION
PURSUANT TO AUGUST 12, 2025 REQUEST

DATE: DECEMBER 15, 2025

1.  You directed this office to monitor and report on the Smithsonian
    Institution’s compliance with the document production request
    transmitted by the White House on August 12, 2025, and reiterated in
    subsequent correspondence.  
2.  To date, the Smithsonian has provided only a limited initial set of
    materials on September 18, 2025, followed by partial uploads to a
    shared Dropbox folder. The overwhelming majority of the Phase 1
    materials originally due no later than September 10, 2025, remain
    outstanding.  
3.  The submitted materials are notably incomplete in several critical
    respects:  
    1.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Current and Upcoming
        Exhibitions</span>: Folders designated for current and future
        exhibitions contain no substantive content. No digital files of
        exhibition wall text, didactic panels, object labels, exhibition
        catalogs, or approved budgets have been produced for any
        exhibition currently on view.  
    2.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">America 250
        Programmin</span>g: Responses consist solely of brief
        descriptive statements (in several instances a single sentence).
        No draft concepts, proposed object checklists, interpretive
        text, speaker lists, event schedules, or supporting planning
        documents have been provided. For example, the National Museum
        of American History only stated that their America 250
        exhibition will consist of “250 objects from across the national
        collections,” without identifying specific objects under
        consideration, and there is no mention of objects that will
        illustrate the impact of the Declaration of Independence
        throughout American History.
    3.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Future Exhibition
        Pipeline (2026–2029)</span>: No index, proposals, projected
        schedules, or preliminary budgets for planned exhibitions have
        been provided.
    4.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Governance and Internal
        Processes</span>: The “Policy and Governance” submission
        contains only generic job descriptions. No organizational
        charts, curatorial manuals, exhibition-approval protocols, or
        related internal guidance have been included.  
    5.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Points of
        Contact</span>: The Institution has not supplied names, titles,
        or contact information for designated representatives at the
        requested museums, impeding direct follow-up.  
4.  The absence of basic exhibition-related materials—particularly wall
    text and didactic content currently presented to the visiting
    public—is difficult to reconcile with standard museum practice and
    the professional obligations articulated by the American Alliance of
    Museums (AAM), the International Council of Museums (ICOM), and the
    Association of Art Museum Directors (AAMD). These organizations
    uniformly require member institutions to maintain readily accessible
    documentation of mission, programming, interpretive content, and
    governance processes. Indeed, the AAMD Standards for Professional
    Practices states: “The director must have a clear understanding of
    the museum’s mission, policies, long-range plan, programs, and
    finances and is responsible for their implementation and *for making
    accurate information about them publicly available*.”
5.  To avoid further delay, we recommend that the Smithsonian be
    directed to provide, no later than December 30, 2025, a full and
    organized response containing, at minimum, the following for each
    museum and unit under its jurisdiction:  
    -   Comprehensive America 250 programming files (draft concepts,
        proposed artwork and checklists, descriptive placards,
        exhibition catalogs, event outlines, and lists of invited
        speakers and events);  
    -   Complete digital files of all wall didactics, labels, and
        education and interpretive materials for exhibitions currently
        on view and digital presence, together with catalogs and
        approved budgets, as well as a full list of the staff
        responsible for creating and approving such materials along with
        information about their educational and professional
        backgrounds;
    -   A full index of traveling and upcoming exhibitions scheduled for
        2026–2029, including proposals, timelines, and preliminary
        budgets; and an index of the permanent collection;
    -   Governance documents, including organizational charts,
        curatorial and staff manuals, job descriptions, grant-related
        documentation and documentation of exhibition approval,
        scheduling, and content-review processes; list of external
        partnerships; and Surveys and evaluations of visitor experience;
        and
    -   Names, titles, brief professional biographies, current CVs, and
        direct contact information for designated points of contact at
        the National Museum of American History, National Museum of
        Natural History, National Air and Space Museum, National Museum
        of African American History and Culture, National Museum of the
        American Indian, Smithsonian American Art Museum, National
        Museum of African Art, and National Portrait Gallery.
