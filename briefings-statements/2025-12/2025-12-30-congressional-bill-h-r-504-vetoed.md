title: Congressional Bill H.R. 504 Vetoed
---
 
I am returning herewith without my approval H.R. 504, the Miccosukee
Reserved Area Amendments Act. 

The subject of this bill is a specific area in the Everglades National
Park known as the “Osceola Camp.”  In 1998, the Congress passed the
Miccosukee Reserved Area Act, which authorized the Miccosukee Tribe of
Indians of Florida (Tribe) to permanently occupy a certain area within
Everglades National Park.  The reserved area did not include the Osceola
Camp.  Nonetheless, the Tribe has a residential community in that area,
including infrastructure for wastewater treatment and water supply, and
is experiencing periodic flooding.  H.R. 504 would require the Secretary
of the Interior, in consultation with the Tribe, to take appropriate
actions to safeguard structures within the Osceola Camp from flooding
events. 

The Osceola Camp was constructed in 1935, without authorization, in a
low area that was raised with fill material.  It served as a family
residence and gift shop initially, and then later a site for air-boat
rides.  None of the current structures in the Osceola Camp are over 50
years old, nor do they meet the other criteria to be considered for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places.

The previous administration developed a plan to protect and replace
unauthorized infrastructure at the Osceola Camp, which could cost up to
$14 million.  But despite seeking funding and special treatment from the
Federal Government, the Miccosukee Tribe has actively sought to obstruct
reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively
voted for when I was elected.

My Administration is committed to preventing American taxpayers from
funding projects for special interests, especially those that are
unaligned with my Administration’s policy of removing violent criminal
illegal aliens from the country.  Ending the massive cost of taxpayer
handouts and restoring fiscal sanity is vital to economic growth and the
fiscal health of the Nation.  This principle carries especially heavy
weight here; it is not the Federal Government’s responsibility to pay to
fix problems in an area that the Tribe has never been authorized to
occupy.  

For these reasons, I cannot support the Miccosukee Reserved Area
Amendments Act.  Therefore, it is my duty to return H.R. 504 to the
House of Representatives without my approval.

THE WHITE HOUSE,
