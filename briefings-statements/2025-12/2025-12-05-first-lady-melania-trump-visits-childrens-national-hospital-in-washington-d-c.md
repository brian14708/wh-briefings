Today, First Lady Melania Trump continued the longstanding annual
tradition of first ladies visiting the Children’s National Hospital
during the Christmas season. Mrs. Trump spent time with young patients
and their families to support the courageous children receiving care.

Mrs. Trump began her visit in the hospital’s atrium and continued on to
the Hematology and Oncology Unit. She read *How Does Santa Go Down the
Chimney?* to a small group of young patients and their families.
Throughout her visit, Mrs. Trump spoke with patients, families, doctors,
nurses, and administrative staff, offering words of encouragement during
this special time of year.

Following her visit, the First Lady remarked, “Visiting Children’s
National during the Christmas season is a tradition I cherish, and I am
grateful for the opportunity to return again this year. Spending time
with these brave children and their families is a reminder of the
strength, hope, and love that define the holiday spirit. I want to thank
the dedicated doctors, nurses, and staff at Children’s National for the
exceptional care they provide during the holiday season and every day.”
