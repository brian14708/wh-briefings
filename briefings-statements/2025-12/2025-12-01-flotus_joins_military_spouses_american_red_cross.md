title: First Lady Melania Trump Joins Military Spouses for American Red Cross Holiday
  Care Package Event at Joint Base Andrews
---
 
First Lady Melania Trump visited Joint Base Andrews to celebrate the
beginning of the Christmas season and honor the strength and service of
America’s military families. Mrs. Trump delivered brief remarks in a
base hangar before joining military spouses to assemble holiday care
packages for deployed Service members.

“Every package built here today is built with American values. Each
represents liberty, love, community, and honor. Each is delivered with
heart and love. The foundation of our great nation,” exclaimed America’s
First Lady Melania Trump.

The event highlighted the resilience, sacrifice, and unwavering
commitment of military families—particularly the spouses who shoulder
the unique responsibilities of military life. Mrs. Trump expressed deep
gratitude for their service to the Nation and emphasized the importance
of supporting those who spend the holidays separated from loved ones.

The care-package project was made possible through a collaboration with
the American Red Cross, which provides support to Service members and
their families throughout the year.

The First Lady was joined by several Cabinet spouses, including: Mrs.
Jennifer Hegseth, Mrs. Kathryn Burgum, Mrs. Cheryl Hines, Mrs. Liz
Wright, Mrs. Lisa Collins, and Mrs. Marlo Greer.

The Office of the First Lady shared its appreciation with the leadership
and personnel of Joint Base Andrews for facilitating this special event
and for their year-round contributions to the mission success of
countless trips and engagements by the President and the First Lady.
