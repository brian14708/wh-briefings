title: Presidential Message on National Entrepreneurship Month
---
 
During National Entrepreneurship Month, we acknowledge the builders and
dreamers who give life to the American economy, turn their ideas into
action, and create the jobs that strengthen families and communities
across our Nation.  Entrepreneurs have always been the heartbeat of our
country and the engine of its unmatched competitive spirit.  Their
vision carries forward the conviction that tomorrow will be more
prosperous than today, and my Administration will always support their
ambition and drive towards a better future.

For too long, suffocating regulation, crushing taxes, and needless
bureaucracy have stood between innovators and their dreams. 
Entrepreneurs poured their energy into compliance instead of creativity,
and countless ideas with the power to reshape lives never reached the
market.  Under my leadership, bureaucracy will never be a barrier to
success—and I will restore the freedom that allows American ingenuity to
thrive.

My Administration is unleashing the power of American enterprise like
never before.  For every new regulation forced onto the books, ten
others must be eliminated, which frees entrepreneurs to build without
being restrained by endless red tape.  We are restoring full and
immediate expensing for business research and development, and we are
supporting innovation in emerging technologies like crypto and
blockchain—initiatives that give entrepreneurs the tools they need to
compete and win.  We are preserving the 199A small business deduction, a
policy that is generating billions in economic growth and creating more
than a million Main Street jobs.

It has never been easier to build new American factories, invest in
American towns, expand American research, and equip American innovators
with the foundation they need to succeed.  Through the Made in America
Manufacturing Initiative, we are cutting $100 billion in unnecessary
regulation, while strengthening protective tariffs to shield our
industries from unfair foreign competition and dishonest practices that
threaten our economic and national security.  This is the Golden Age for
American enterprise—one that will keep our country the greatest force
for prosperity and wealth the world has ever known.

Today, 34 million entrepreneurial businesses generate well over 40% of
America’s economic activity and create two out of every three new
private sector jobs.  When our greatest minds are empowered, the entire
Nation ignites with innovation.  This month we renew our commitment to
the brilliant entrepreneurs who dream big, build boldly, and carry
forward the spirit that preserves America as the most powerful hub of
economic power and industrial might in history.
