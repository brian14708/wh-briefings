title: Presidential Message on National Lung Cancer Awareness Month
---
 
This National Lung Cancer Awareness Month, we renew our commitment to
defeating lung cancer and supporting every American who faces this
devastating disease.  Throughout November, we stand beside the families
who fight cancer with courage, faith, and perseverance, and we
strengthen our resolve to build a country where fewer lives are cut
short by chronic illness.

Lung cancer remains one of the deadliest diseases in our country,
claiming nearly one in five cancer deaths.  This year alone, it will
take more than 124,000 lives, and over 226,000 Americans will receive a
lung cancer diagnosis for the first time.  Behind every statistic is a
story of anguish and endurance.   

As President, I encourage preventative care and a healthy lifestyle to
reduce the toll of lung cancer.  The health of our Nation begins with
the health of our people.  When Americans support their health and seek
regular screenings, they protect their future, their families, and make
our country stronger.

My Administration is advancing hospital and insurance billing
transparency to empower every patient to meet the cost of their
treatment without breaking the bank.  Through the $50 billion Rural
Health Transformation Program in the One Big Beautiful Bill, we are
expanding the capabilities of rural hospitals, increasing the number of
healthcare providers, and ensuring that quality, lifesaving care reaches
the most remote corners of our Nation for those suffering from every
illness and disease, including lung cancer.

This month and every month, we stand beside those fighting the terrible
disease of lung cancer and remember those we have lost.  Together, we
pledge that no American will face this struggle alone, and that our
country will continue to work for a healthier, stronger, and more
hopeful tomorrow.
