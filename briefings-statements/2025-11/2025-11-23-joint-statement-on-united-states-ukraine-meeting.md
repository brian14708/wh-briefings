---
 
On 23 November 2025, representatives of the United States and Ukraine
met in Geneva for discussions on the U.S. peace proposal. The talks were
constructive, focused, and respectful, underscoring the shared
commitment to achieving a just and lasting peace.  
   
Both sides agreed the consultations were highly productive. The
discussions showed meaningful progress toward aligning positions and
identifying clear next steps. They reaffirmed that any future agreement
must fully uphold Ukraine’s sovereignty and deliver a sustainable and
just peace. As a result of the discussions, the parties drafted an
updated and refined peace framework.  
   
The Ukrainian delegation reaffirmed its gratitude for the steadfast
commitment of the United States and, personally, President Donald J.
Trump for their tireless efforts aimed at ending the war and the loss of
life.  
   
Ukraine and the United States agreed to continue intensive work on joint
proposals in the coming days. They will also remain in close contact
with their European partners as the process advances.  
   
Final decisions under this framework will be made by the Presidents of
Ukraine and the United States.  
   
Both sides reiterated their readiness to continue working together to
secure a peace that ensures Ukraine’s security, stability, and
reconstruction.
