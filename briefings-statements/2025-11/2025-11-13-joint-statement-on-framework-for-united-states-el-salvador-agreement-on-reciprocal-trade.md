title: Joint Statement on Framework for United States-El Salvador Agreement on Reciprocal
  Trade
---
 
The United States of America (United States, or U.S.) and the Republic
of El Salvador (El Salvador) have agreed to a **Framework** for an
**Agreement on Reciprocal Trade** (Agreement) that further strengthens
and builds upon our longstanding economic relationship, including the
Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement
(CAFTA-DR), which entered into force for the United States and El
Salvador in 2006.

Key terms of the Agreement between the United States and El Salvador
will include:

-   El Salvador has committed to addressing a wide range of non-tariff
    barriers affecting trade in priority areas, including streamlining
    regulatory requirements and approvals for U.S. exports, such as
    pharmaceutical products and medical devices; removing import
    restrictions on remanufactured goods; accepting U.S. auto standards;
    streamlining certificate of free sale requirements, accepting
    electronic certificates; removing apostille requirements; and
    expediting product registration requirements for U.S. exports.

-   El Salvador also has committed to address and prevent barriers to
    U.S. agricultural products in its market, including with regard to
    U.S. regulatory oversight and acceptance of currently agreed
    certificates issued by U.S. regulatory authorities.

<!-- -->

-   El Salvador has committed to move forward with certain international
    intellectual property treaties and provide transparency and fairness
    regarding geographical indications, while ensuring that market
    access for U.S. agricultural exporters will not be restricted due to
    the mere use of certain cheese and meat terms.

<!-- -->

-   El Salvador has recommitted to preventing barriers to services and
    digital trade with the United States and committed to refrain from
    imposing discriminatory digital services taxes.  The United States
    and El Salvador will support a permanent multilateral moratorium on
    customs duties on electronic transmissions.

<!-- -->

-   El Salvador has committed to continue facilitating trade, as well as
    adopting and implementing good regulatory practices.

<!-- -->

-   El Salvador has reinforced its commitment to protect internationally
    recognized labor rights.  El Salvador will prohibit the importation
    of goods produced by forced or compulsory labor.

<!-- -->

-   El Salvador has committed to adopt and maintain high levels of
    environmental protection and to effectively enforce its
    environmental laws.  El Salvador has also committed to take measures
    to improve forest sector governance and combat illegal logging,
    strengthen enforcement of its fisheries-related measures, and combat
    illegal wildlife trade and illegal mining, and work toward accepting
    the World Trade Organization (WTO) *Agreement on Fisheries
    Subsidies*.

<!-- -->

-   El Salvador has committed to address potential distortionary actions
    of state-owned enterprises and to address industrial subsidies that
    may have an impact on the bilateral trading relationship.

<!-- -->

-   The United States and El Salvador have committed to strengthen
    economic and national security cooperation to enhance supply chain
    resilience and innovation through complementary actions to address
    non-market policies of other countries, as well as addressing duty
    evasion and cooperating on government procurement, investment
    security, and export controls.

In the coming weeks, the United States and El Salvador will work to
finalize the Agreement, prepare the Agreement for signature, and
undertake domestic formalities in advance of the Agreement entering into
force.  Given El Salvador’s commitment to take significant steps to
advance a stronger and more reciprocal trade relationship, the United
States will remove the reciprocal tariffs on El Salvador’s exports to
the United States for certain qualifying exports that cannot be grown,
mined, or naturally produced in the United States in sufficient
quantities, as well as certain products, such as textiles and apparel
products, originating under the CAFTA-DR.  In addition, the United
States may positively consider the effect that the Agreement has on
national security, including taking the Agreement into consideration
when taking trade action under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of
1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862).  The United States and El Salvador
look forward to closing the Agreement soon.
