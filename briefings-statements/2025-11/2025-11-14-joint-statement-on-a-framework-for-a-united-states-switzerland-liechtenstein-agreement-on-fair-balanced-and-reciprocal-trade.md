title: "Joint Statement on a Framework for a United States \u2013 Switzerland \u2013\
  \ Liechtenstein Agreement on Fair, Balanced, and Reciprocal Trade"
---
 
Today, the United States of America (United States), the Swiss
Confederation (Switzerland), and the Principality of Liechtenstein
(Liechtenstein) (collectively, Participants) express through this
Framework their intention to negotiate an Agreement on Fair, Balanced,
and Reciprocal Trade (Agreement). Through the Agreement, the
Participants intend to create a dynamic and balanced trading
relationship on a reciprocal and mutually advantageous basis, with a
view toward creating good, high-paying jobs and economic growth in their
markets. The Participants share a desire to make trade fairer, easier,
and more substantial. The Participants further share a desire to foster
secure and resilient supply chains and a conducive business environment
to attract high-quality and trusted investment. Switzerland intends to
take action to balance its trade with the United States, including by
purchasing U.S. goods, facilitating investment in the United States, and
removing tariff and non-tariff barriers for U.S. goods. The Participants
intend to immediately begin negotiations of the Agreement with the aim
to make significant progress, and if possible conclude the Agreement, by
the first quarter of 2026, subject to their respective domestic
processes.

The Participants intend for the negotiations of the Agreement to focus
on the following key areas:

1.  I**nvestment, Commercial Considerations, and Opportunities**

<!-- -->

1.  Switzerland and Liechtenstein support the increase of foreign direct
    investment by Swiss and Liechtenstein enterprises into the United
    States. Switzerland intends to encourage and facilitate at least
    $200 billion of investment into the United States, across all 50
    states, over the next five years, to create manufacturing and
    research and development jobs. Liechtenstein intends to encourage
    and facilitate at least $300 million of investment into the United
    States and increase by 50 percent over the next five years the
    number of jobs created by its private sector in the United States.
     Switzerland and Liechtenstein intend to encourage and facilitate
    one third of these investments by the end of 2026. The United States
    intends to determine, in its application of reciprocal tariffs, if
    Switzerland and Liechtenstein have taken appropriate steps to
    encourage and facilitate these investments and associated job
    creation. If needed, the Participants intend to jointly discuss the
    steps taken to encourage and facilitate such investment and job
    creation and determine additional measures for investment promotion
    and facilitation.
2.  The Participants intend to encourage their enterprises to promote
    and develop training and apprenticeship programs, including
    Registered Apprenticeship programs, for U.S. workers in key
    high-growth sectors in the United States, taking into account their
    current and future investments. The Participants intend to cooperate
    on this issue.
3.  Switzerland and Liechtenstein intend to work together with the
    United States on addressing potential distortions of bilateral trade
    and investment arising from industrial subsidies or actions of
    state-owned enterprises.
4.  The Participants intend to create the best possible environment to
    encourage and facilitate cross-border investments and job creation.

2\. **Tariffs**

1.  Recognizing the Treaty of 29 March 1923 between Switzerland and
    Liechtenstein on Accession of the Principality of Liechtenstein to
    the Swiss Customs Area, the United States intends to apply the same
    tariff treatment to both Switzerland and Liechtenstein.
2.  Switzerland and Liechtenstein intend to improve market access for
    U.S. goods, through the application of zero duties on all U.S.
    industrial goods, U.S. seafood, and certain U.S. agricultural goods,
    and through the application of tariff rate quotas for a number of
    other U.S. agricultural goods.
3.  The United States intends to apply the higher of either the U.S.
    most-favored-nation (MFN) tariff rate or a tariff rate of 15
    percent, comprised of the MFN tariff and a reciprocal tariff, on
    originating goods of Switzerland and Liechtenstein and to apply only
    the U.S. MFN tariff rate on certain products listed in the
    “Potential Tariff Adjustments for Aligned Partners” Annex to
    Executive Order 14346 (Modifying the Scope of Reciprocal Tariffs and
    Establishing Procedures for Implementing Trade and Security
    Agreements).
4.  The United States intends to promptly ensure that the MFN tariff and
    the tariff imposed pursuant to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion
    Act of 1962 (Section 232) do not exceed 15 percent for originating
    pharmaceutical goods and semiconductors of Switzerland and
    Liechtenstein subject to Section 232 tariffs. The United States
    intends to positively consider the effect of the Agreement on
    national security, including when taking action under Section 232.
5.  The Participants intend for the benefits of the Agreement to accrue
    predominantly to the Participants. If the Participants determine
    that the benefits are not accruing predominantly to the
    Participants, the Participants may modify the Agreement with rules
    of origin necessary to achieve that objective.
6.  The Participants intend to cooperate, where relevant, on matters
    relating to transshipment and circumvention practices, in accordance
    with their respective domestic laws and regulations.

3\. **Non-Tariff Barriers and Related Matters**

1.  The United States and Switzerland each intend to accord to
    conformity assessment bodies located in the territory of the other
    treatment no less favorable than they accord to conformity
    assessment bodies located in their own respective territories.
    Treatment under this paragraph includes procedures, criteria, fees,
    and other conditions relating to accrediting, approving, licensing,
    or otherwise recognizing conformity assessment bodies.
2.  The Participants intend to apply the World Trade Organization(WTO)
    *Decision of the Technical Barriers to Trade Committee on Principles
    for the Development of International Standards, Guides and
    Recommendations* (2000) to determine relevant international
    standards within the meaning of Articles 2 and 5 and Annex 3 of the
    WTO *Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade*, and intend to
    negotiate provisions clarifying this understanding. With respect to
    automobiles, Switzerland intends to work with the United States to
    facilitate the recognition of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety
    Standards.
3.  The Participants intend to advance cooperation in mutually agreed
    strategic sectors, including medical devices. Switzerland intends to
    facilitate the acceptance of medical devices cleared or approved by
    the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
4.  The United States acknowledges the efforts made by Switzerland to
    facilitate trade in beef and beef products. Switzerland intends to
    work with the United States to address specific measures that
    restrict market access for U.S. poultry and poultry products,
    strengthening opportunities for U.S. agricultural exports in
    Switzerland. The United States and Switzerland intend to cooperate
    on streamlining sanitary requirements for labelling and
    certificates, particularly for beef, bison, and dairy products.
5.  The Participants intend to discuss robust commitments related to
    intellectual property rights protection and enforcement, including
    transparent and fair treatment of geographical indications.
6.  The Participants intend to continue to provide an open and
    competitive environment for service suppliers. Accordingly,
    Switzerland and Liechtenstein intend to consider opportunities to
    provide service suppliers additional access to their markets.

    labor-related trade issues, and work to address forced labor,
    including forced child labor, and the worst forms of child labor in
    supply chains. Switzerland and Liechtenstein intend to continue to
    protect internationally recognized labor rights.
8.  Switzerland and Liechtenstein intend to continue to adopt and
    implement high levels of environmental protections, effectively
    enforce their respective environmental laws, and work together with
    the United States on trade-related environmental measures, including
    those that may affect trade between each of them and the United
    States.
9.  The Participants intend to negotiate commitments on good regulatory
    practices to ensure greater transparency, predictability, and
    participation throughout the regulatory lifecycle.
10. With a view to achieving greater reciprocal benefits from
    participation in their procurement markets, the Participants
    reaffirm their commitments under the WTO plurilateral *Agreement on
    Government Procurement* and their other binding international
    procurement obligations, and intend to clarify that states that are
    not party to these agreements do not benefit from non-discriminatory
    treatment in procurement at the central governmental level covered
    by such agreements*,* including through further implementation
    measures in their respective national procurement frameworks, if
    necessary.
11. The United States and Switzerland intend to foster the use of
    technology solutions that allow for full pre-arrival processing,
    paperless trade, and digitalized customs procedures.

    security, including on addressing non-market policies of third
    countries.
