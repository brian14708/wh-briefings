title: Joint Statement on Framework for United States-Ecuador Agreement on Reciprocal
  Trade
---
 
President Donald J. Trump and President Daniel Noboa affirm a shared
vision of growth for both of our countries, grounded in democratic
values, private initiative, and a rules-based environment for commerce
and innovation.  Seeking to strengthen our commercial and economic
relationship, the United States of America (United States, or U.S.) and
the Republic of Ecuador (Ecuador) have agreed to a Framework for an
Agreement on Reciprocal Trade (Agreement) that will provide access to
each other’s markets and increase alignment on economic and national
security matters.  

The Agreement will build upon longstanding economic engagement,
including under the U.S.-Ecuador Trade and Investment Council Agreement,
which was signed in 1990 and updated in 2020, expanding opportunities
and fueling long-term growth.

Key terms of the Agreement between the United States and Ecuador will
include:

-   **Tariffs:**  Ecuador has committed to reduce or eliminate tariffs
    in key sectors for the United States, including machinery, health
    products, ICT goods, chemicals, motor vehicles, and certain
    agricultural products.  Ecuador also intends to establish
    tariff-rate quotas on a number of other agricultural goods.  The
    United States commits to remove its reciprocal tariffs on certain
    qualifying exports from Ecuador that cannot be grown, mined, or
    naturally produced in the United States in sufficient quantities.

<!-- -->

-   **Non-Tariff Barriers:  **The United States and Ecuador will work
    together to address Ecuador’s non-tariff barriers that affect trade
    in priority areas.  Ecuador has committed to address such barriers,
    including, for example:

<!-- -->

-   Agriculture:  Ecuador is reforming its import licensing and facility
    registration systems for food and agricultural products to enhance
    transparency and predictability and reduce onerous and unnecessary
    barriers to U.S. agricultural exports.  Ecuador has committed to
    ensuring that market access will not be restricted due to the mere
    use of certain cheese and meat terms.

<!-- -->

-   Trade Facilitation:  Ecuador will continue to advance trade
    facilitation measures, including by ending pre-shipment inspection
    mandates, establishing contingency plans for its Single Window, and
    expanding its Authorized Economic Operator program to include
    express delivery carriers within three months.

<!-- -->

-   Intellectual Property:  Ecuador has committed to ensure transparency
    and fairness regarding geographical indications and to address
    issues identified in the Office of the United States Trade
    Representative’s 2025 Special 301 Report.  The United States and
    Ecuador will continue to finalize commitments on international
    intellectual property treaties.

<!-- -->

-   Labor: ** **Ecuador has committed to protect internationally
    recognized labor rights and strengthen enforcement of its labor
    laws.  In addition, Ecuador will adopt and implement a prohibition
    on the importation of goods produced by forced or compulsory labor.

<!-- -->

-   Environment:  Ecuador has committed to adopt and maintain high
    levels of environmental protection and to effectively enforce its
    environmental laws.  Ecuador has also committed to take measures to
    improve forest sector governance and combat illegal logging;
    encourage a more resource efficient economy; fully implement the
    obligations of the World Trade Organization (WTO) *Agreement on
    Fisheries Subsidies*; strengthen enforcement of its
    fisheries-related measures; and combat illegal wildlife trade.

<!-- -->

-   Services:  Ecuador has committed to not introduce new discriminatory
    barriers to services and remove barriers on advertising services.

<!-- -->

-   **Digital Trade:**  Ecuador has committed to facilitate digital
    trade, including through commitments to not impose digital service
    taxes that discriminate against U.S. companies and to support
    adoption of a permanent moratorium on customs duties on electronic
    transmissions at the WTO.

<!-- -->

-   **Economic and National Security:**  The United States and Ecuador
    are committed to strengthening economic and national security
    cooperation and enhancing supply chain resilience and innovation
    through complementary actions to address non-market policies as well
    as combatting duty evasion and cooperating on investment security
    and export controls.

The United States and Ecuador are working to finalize the Agreement,
prepare the Agreement for signature, and undertake domestic formalities
in advance of the Agreement entering into force.  Given Ecuador’s
commitments to take significant steps to advance a more reciprocal trade
relationship, the United States will remove its reciprocal tariffs on
certain qualifying exports from Ecuador to the United States.

The United States and Ecuador will review progress on implementation of
the Agreement and continue close coordination on trade and investment
matters through their Trade and Investment Council.
