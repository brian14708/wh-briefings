title: Presidential Message on Victory Day for World War I
---
 
On this day 107 years ago, the immortal causes of liberty, sovereignty,
and human dignity were secured in glory at the conclusion of World War
I—one of the most extraordinary displays of U.S. military might in the
history of our country.  Today, we remember the sacrifice of every hero
of freedom who shed his blood for the survival of our civilization, and
we renew our pledge to always defend the needs, values, and interests of
the American people first.

Following the first shots of World War I in the summer of 1914, the
European continent descended into fiery chaos, dragging the western
world into grueling and treacherous warfare.  After a series of deadly
German submarine attacks against the United States, in 1917, America
righteously entered the war to protect its citizens, defend its
interests, and secure the cause of peace—triggering a decisive turning
point in the conflict and signaling the unrivaled strength of the U.S.
Armed Forces to the entire world.  Bolstered by the unmatched prowess of
American industry, millions of young men courageously departed their
homes and families to halt the Central Powers’ vicious reign of conquest
and oppression.

On November 11, 1918, an armistice between the Allies and Germany forced
tyranny to its knees, marking the triumphant end of one of the deadliest
conflicts in human history.  Over the course of the war, American
Soldiers, Sailors, and Marines gave everything they had for the future
of freedom.  Tragically, more than 320,000 suffered casualties, but
their sacrifices were not in vain.  Without the heroic bravery of our
American soldiers, the war would not have been won, and our world today
would look drastically different.

From the Battle of Verdun to the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, from the Somme
to Belleau Wood to Flanders Fields, the Great War marked a critical
turning point for U.S. military strength, initiating the dawn of
American air power, advancing battlefield medicine, and revolutionizing
the nature of warfare and weaponry both on land and at sea.  Today, my
Administration is proudly upholding this hard-won legacy of Peace
Through Strength.  Since I took office, I have negotiated a series of
historic peace agreements—including a deal to end the devastating war in
Gaza—helping nations around the world move beyond longstanding conflicts
of the past toward a shared future of peace, prosperity, and success.

More than one century following the end of World War I, we honor the
valiant American Service members whose victory sent a resounding message
to the entire world:  No tyranny can topple the strength of the American
military, no nation can compete with the power of American industry, and
no adversary can withstand the unwavering vigor of the American spirit. 
As we approach 250 glorious years of American independence and continue
the work of saving our country, we look to their grit, valor, and
patriotism—and in their honor, we vow to never stop fighting for the
sacred causes that sustain our Republic, our way of life, and our
birthright of freedom.
