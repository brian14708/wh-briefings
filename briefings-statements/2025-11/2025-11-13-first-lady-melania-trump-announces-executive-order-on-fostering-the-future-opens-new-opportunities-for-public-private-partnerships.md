title: First Lady Melania Trump Announces Executive Order on Fostering the Future,
  Opens New Opportunities for Public-Private Partnerships
---
 
First Lady Melania Trump successfully organized a new Executive Order
entitled, “Fostering the Future for American Children and
Families.” Under Mrs. Trump’s leadership, this unprecedented
presidential order unites Federal resources with innovative public- and
private-sector partnerships to provide more pathways to success for
young people who have experienced foster care. The First Lady joined
President Donald J. Trump at today’s historic signing ceremony at the
White House. The **Executive Order on Fostering the Future for American
Children and Families **contains the following provisions that have been
central to Mrs. Trump’s focus as First Lady, among others geared toward
maximizing strategic partnerships with Americans of faith and
modernizing the child welfare system: 

-   **Fostering the Future Pledge & Future Commitments: **Establishes
    a *Fostering the Future* program to secure government,
    private-industry, nonprofit, and academic partners’ commitments for
    new educational and employment pathways for youth transitioning out
    of foster care;

<!-- -->

-   **Online Resource and Planning Hub:** Authorizes the creation of
    a *Fostering the Future* online platform for current and former
    foster youth to develop customized plans for their self-sufficiency
    and success by connecting them with critical resources;

<!-- -->

-   **Increased Access to Federal Support:** Increases access to
    Education and Training Vouchers and federal grants to support more
    time-limited and credentialed programs that promote educational
    success, workforce advancement, and financial literacy for young
    people transitioning out of care; and

<!-- -->

-   **Expanded Educational Opportunities:** Expands educational
    opportunities by facilitating state use of scholarship programs
    funded by tax-credited donations to scholarship-granting
    organizations for children in foster care.

 As a result of this new executive order, and as part of First Lady
Melania Trump’s *Fostering the Future* initiative, public and
private-sector partners can make commitments to expand access to
mentorships, scholarships, technology, and workforce training for youth
who have experienced foster care. These pledges will reflect a shared
national effort to ensure every young person has the tools to build a
strong and independent future. The following Federal partners announced
new commitments as part of this effort: 

-   **The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS):** In
    addition to implementing the directives of the Fostering the Future
    Executive Order, the Administration for Children and Families (ACF)
    will also launch a Fostering the Future-aligned initiative to keep
    children safely with their families and reduce unnecessary entries
    into foster care while also increasing the availability of foster
    homes for children and youth. ACF will also announce a new pilot
    program to donate decommissioned federal laptops to youth in foster
    care to help bridge the digital divide and increase access to online
    resources that are critical for a successful transition to
    adulthood.

<!-- -->

-   **The U.S. Department of Treasury** and the **U.S. Department of
    Housing and Urban Development:** These Departments are committed to
    hosting a series of roundtables across the country to learn from
    youth transitioning from foster care about unique obstacles to
    financial literacy and opportunities to support them on a pathway to
    sustained financial well-being. These Departments will establish
    policies and programs to help ensure that the transition process
    from foster care includes a strong financial literacy foundation. An
    initial statement of findings from the roundtables will be made
    available in Spring 2026.

<!-- -->

-   **U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM): **OPM announced a new
    opportunity for youth and young adults who have been in foster care
    to obtain federal jobs via the *Pathways Programs* – a special
    federal government hiring authority for early career talent. In
    consultation with youth who have experienced foster care, OPM will
    collaborate with federal agencies to identify internships and
    early-career employment that provide hands-on experience in
    government. To strengthen readiness for public service, OPM will
    build a dedicated applicant portal and incorporate a speaker series
    and other professional development activities to help participants
    build skills, networks, and confidence to succeed in the range of
    opportunities available through federal service.

Private-sector organizations looking to join First Lady Melania Trump in
supporting Fostering the Future, are invited to sign the Fostering the
Future Pledge at
[WhiteHouse.Gov/FosteringTheFuture](https://whitehouse.gov/fosteringthefuture). 

First Lady Melania Trump established *Fostering the Future* in
2021. *Fostering the Future*, a Be Best initiative, offers scholarships
at the university and college levels to individuals within the foster
care community. Scholarship recipients acquire essential knowledge vital
for obtaining an entry-level position, ultimately leading to financial
independence. Melania Trump’s Fostering the Future’s distinguished
participating universities include, but are not limited to Vanderbilt
University, University of Miami, Villanova University, Florida
International University, and Oral Roberts University.

**Full text of First Lady Melania Trump’s remarks, as prepared for
delivery:**

It’s truly inspiring to see everyone gathered here together, united in
support of this remarkable initiative and community. As I stand here and
observe the audience, I recognize the vital importance of each one of
you—to this mission—to our future generations.

In particular, I would like to thank the cabinet secretaries, congress
members, scholarship donors, and various organizations for their
unending advocacy.

A special thank you to my husband for his enduring commitment to
Fostering the Future. The President has prioritized America’s foster
care children, and shortly, he will sign our Fostering the Future
Executive Order.

Too many people from the foster care community end up homeless, in
danger on America’s streets.

It was 2021 when I developed the idea to establish an impactful platform
with an important mission: to provide individuals from the foster care
community the ability to secure an entry-level job position, and in
turn… financial independence.

Fostering the Future, a Be Best initiative, provides individuals from
the foster care community with technology-based scholarships to attend
colleges and universities throughout America. Fostering the Future sets
these individuals on their career paths, but more significantly, it
equips each scholarship recipient with a fundamental foundation of
knowledge that will endure throughout their lifetimes.

Permanency for those who embody the fleeting.

I applaud the American Universities that have joined my
mission—institutions like Vanderbilt University, University of Miami,
and Villanova University.

Following graduation, scholarship recipients from my program are
prepared to enter the workforce, and, ultimately, become leading
executives. Predictably, they will manage thousands of employees and
generate significant value for American communities—through job
creation, access to healthcare, food security, and other societal
benefits.

This Executive Order, “Fostering the Future for American Children and
Families,” gives me tremendous pride. It is both, empathetic and
strategic. It will certainly be impactful.

It aims to establish a comprehensive network connecting federal
departments and agencies, private sector businesses, higher-learning
institutions, and charitable organizations. This will create new
educational and employment opportunities countrywide. Our faith-based
organizations will continue playing a vital and consequential role.

My hope, of course, is that this level of coordinated collaboration will
sustain. But today, I call on leadership from these various
organizations, including the private sector, to join my effort. Rise
above the ease of inaction.

I predict this small spark today will ignite a profound and lasting
nationwide movement. Our united resolve will foster a thriving future
filled with compassion and innovation.

Together, we will illuminate the pathway for today’s foster children to
become tomorrow’s builders.

And tomorrow’s builders will foster the future of America’s legacy.
