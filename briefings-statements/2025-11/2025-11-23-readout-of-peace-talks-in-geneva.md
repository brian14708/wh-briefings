*Between Secretary Rubio, Special Envoy Witkoff, Mr. Kushner, Secretary
Driscoll, and the Ukrainian Delegation*  
 

Today, Secretary Rubio, Special Envoy Witkoff, Mr. Jared Kushner, and
Secretary Driscoll held an extensive and productive meeting with the
Ukrainian delegation to review the latest draft agreements under
discussion. The conversation was candid, detailed, and conducted in a
spirit of partnership and shared purpose.  
  
The Ukrainian delegation affirmed that all of their principal
concerns—security guarantees, long-term economic development,
infrastructure protection, freedom of navigation, and political
sovereignty—were thoroughly addressed during the meeting. They expressed
appreciation for the structured approach taken to incorporate their
feedback into each component of the emerging settlement framework.  
   
Ukrainian representatives stated that, based on the revisions and
clarifications presented today, they believe the current draft reflects
their national interests and provides credible and enforceable
mechanisms to safeguard Ukraine’s security in both the near and long
term. They underscored that the strengthened security guarantee
architecture, combined with commitments on non-aggression, energy
stability, and reconstruction, meaningfully addresses their core
strategic requirements.  
   
Secretary Rubio and his team reiterated the United States’ firm
commitment to ensuring that Ukraine’s sovereignty, security, and future
prosperity remain central to the ongoing diplomatic process. They
emphasized that this work is driven by President Trump’s goal of ending
a war that has taken the lives of millions of people and preventing
further loss of life through a durable and enforceable peace. Both sides
welcomed the steady progress made and agreed to continue consultations
as the agreements move toward final refinement.  
   
The meeting concluded with a shared understanding that today marked a
significant step forward, and that continued close coordination will be
essential as the Parties work toward a durable, comprehensive peace.
