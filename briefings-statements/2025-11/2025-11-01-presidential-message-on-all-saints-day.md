On All-Saints’ Day, the First Lady and I join Christians across our
Nation in celebrating the saints who have gone before us and now share
in the glory of God.  Their examples remind us that the strength of our
country rests in the goodness of its people—and that through faith and
virtue, our Nation can endure in liberty and truth.

From our earliest days, the United States has drawn inspiration from
holy men and women whose witness shaped our people and deepened our
faith.  The Blessed Virgin Mary, Patroness of the United States, has
long been honored as a symbol of grace for our country.  Saint Frances
Xavier Cabrini poured out her life in service to the most poor and needy
among us; Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton formed generations through her
schools of faith and learning; and Saint John Neumann led his flock with
humility, courage, and unrelenting devotion.  Their example, and those
of all the saints, demonstrates that faith transforms nations as surely
as it transforms hearts.

Our country has long cherished the freedom of religion that allows faith
such as theirs to flourish.  My Administration is committed to defending
this sacred right, upholding the freedom of every believer to worship,
speak, and live according to their beliefs.  We are standing firm
against those who seek to persecute or marginalize people of faith,
protecting churches, schools, and communities from religious
discrimination, and ensuring that Christian values maintain their
rightful place at the center of American life.  As we remember the
perfect example of Christ and the legacy of His saints, we renew our
promise to live as one Nation under God, defending liberty, seeking
justice, and striving always toward the good that His truth reveals.

Tomorrow, on All Souls’ Day, Christians will remember all those who have
entered the eternal sleep of peace.  Today, the faithful honor the
saints who light the path toward Christ and call our Nation to
holiness.  May their example guide our Republic forward in faith, hope,
and freedom.
