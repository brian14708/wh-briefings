title: "First Lady Melania Trump Named \u201CPatriot of the Year\u201D"
---
 
The First Lady was named “Patriot of the Year,” an honor Fox Nation
awards to “heroes and patriots who have shown unwavering dedication to
the values that make our country great.”

The First Lady’s speech awakened the “spirit of ambition,” inviting
Americans to “celebrate everyone who dares to think differently, for it
is these courageous Americans who are the heartbeat of our
civilization.”  

Drawing from her creative side, Mrs. Trump confessed, “most innovators
know—it’s lonely when you are close to the edge of imagination—when you
have a deep belief in your own power to create new realities.  This is
exactly where real change begins.”

Mrs. Trump also addressed the cynics, “Every breakthrough starts with
one person daring to imagine what’s never been done. Her friends call it
unrealistic, her family declares its ‘far-fetched’—but the human spirit
moves forward anyway, turning vision into reality.  One mind, one idea,
one act of courage.”

And the First Lady ended the evening with a challenge to America: “make
a personal pledge to celebrate ambition and scale imagination to create
a more advanced and prosperous society.”  

Since returning to the White House for a second term, Melania Trump has
driven a focused, results-oriented agenda across domestic and global
fronts:

1.  Championed the *TAKE IT DOWN Act* through Congress and into law
2.  Secured $25 Million in the President’s budget to provide housing
    support for youth who have experienced foster care
3.  Launched America’s Presidential AI Challenge
4.  Visited Americans impacted by catastrophic events in North Carolina,
    California, and Texas
5.  Celebrated the United States Navy’s 250th Anniversary in Norfolk,
    Virginia
6.  Hosted the first White House AI Education Task Force Roundtable
7.  Established *Fostering the Future Together* during the United
    Nations General Assembly, a global coalition advancing education and
    technology for kids
8.  Reunified eight children and their families displaced by the
    Russia-Ukraine conflict
9.  Expanded her signature philanthropic initiative, *Fostering the
    Future*
10. Launched her Artificial Intelligence Audiobook, *Melania*
11. Produced her new feature film, *Melania*

Here are First Lady Melania Trump’s full remarks, as prepared for
delivery, at the Fox Nation Patriot Awards.

**Pledge to Celebrate Ambition and Scale Imagination**

I applaud American Dreamers and Innovators who embrace originality.

Let’s embrace the spirit of ambition.

Let’s celebrate everyone who dares to think differently, for it is these
courageous Americans who are the heartbeat of our civilization.  

Trust me, I know a little bit about challenging convention.

Patriotism in our country dates back to our rebellious founders, who
raged against British rule, seeking independence from the Crown.  They
all defied expectations, politically and intellectually.  Each shared a
common trait – they reinvented how things work.  

We all have an image of Benjamin Franklin flying his kite in a lightning
storm – the original innovator in science and technology.  Thomas
Jefferson pioneered architecture and design.  Hamilton – our banking
system.

Each built an extraordinary life – and in doing so, built a stronger
America.  Their personal ambition became a public good, benefitting us
all.

We see it again and again – personal achievement fuels collective
progress.  When someone creates from conviction – a song, a movement, an
idea – it ripples outward, uniting our people.

Daring to chase your dream is the American way.  Innovation isn’t
accidental here – it’s in our DNA.

In this country, innovation is a form of patriotism.

But most innovators know – it’s lonely when you are close to the edge of
imagination – when you have a deep belief in your own power to create
new realities.  

This is exactly where real change begins.  

American ingenuity built Silicon Valley, landed humans on the moon, and
powered every industrial leap forward – from our winding railroads to
Artificial Intelligence.  Our great capital markets fuel development,
and every day we celebrate our cultural disruptors from music to art and
my new favorite frontier – The Silver Screen.

The silver screen and I have been in deep conversation lately.  You may
have heard the news – I produced a new film with Amazon MGM named –
*Melania*.  

What does the world want to know about becoming America’s First Lady?
 The idea came to me shortly after the presidential election — a
first-of-its-kind capturing the twenty days of my life before the
inauguration.

Twenty intense days of transformation – from private citizen to First
Lady – balancing my business, my philanthropy – “Fostering the Future,”
building my East Wing team and the White House staff, and, of course,
caring for my family.  

Creatively, my film provides a snapshot into a defining moment in
history.  But what’s equally powerful is its ripple effect.  My single
vision united photographers, filmmakers, music makers, writers, and
creative visionaries across New York, Palm Beach, D.C., and L.A.,
leading to an impactful bi-coastal collaboration – driving job growth
and impact far beyond the screen.

Every breakthrough starts with one person daring to imagine what’s never
been done. Her friends call it unrealistic, her family declares its
“far-fetched” – but the human spirit moves forward anyway, turning
vision into reality.  

One mind, one idea, one act of courage.

Risk and reinvention aren’t optional – they’re obligations. Be
relentless in experimentation.  Never stop trying new things.  Keep
pushing yourself to grow, both intellectually and personally.  Embrace
different perspectives, even opposing ones.

Open your mind.  Then change the world through your talent and hard
work.

We talk a lot about “the greater good.”  The truth is, the greater good
is built by the few who dare to think differently.  It’s the designer
who imagines beauty where others see data.  It’s the engineer who stays
up all night refining an algorithm that reshapes an entire industry.

Those who produce, give.  They create employment, tools, knowledge, and
eventually – cities.  And from their creation, the common good rises –
naturally, beautifully, inevitably.

So America, tonight, let’s make a personal pledge to celebrate ambition
and scale imagination to create a more advanced and prosperous society.
  Individual productivity is not selfish. It’s the heartbeat of
civilization.
