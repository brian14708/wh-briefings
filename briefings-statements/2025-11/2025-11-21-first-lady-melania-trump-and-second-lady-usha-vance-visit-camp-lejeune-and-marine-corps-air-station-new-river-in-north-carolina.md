title: First Lady Melania Trump and Second Lady Usha Vance Visit Camp Lejeune and
  Marine Corps Air Station New River in North Carolina
---
 
On Wednesday this week, First Lady Melania Trump and Second Lady Usha
Vance visited Camp Lejeune and Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) New River
in North Carolina, where they spent the day meeting with students,
educators, military families and Service members from both
installations.

Mrs. Trump and Mrs. Vance began the day at Lejeune High School where
they joined a classroom to observe presentations by high school students
on social media, artificial intelligence (AI), and technology. The
engagement was linked to the First Lady’s emphasis on AI education
through efforts like the Presidential AI Challenge and Fostering the
Future Together, a BE BEST initiative. Mrs. Trump and Mrs. Vance then
delivered brief comments and participated in a photo opportunity with
students and United Service Organizations (USO) volunteers who were
working to assemble care packages for deployed Service members with
families on base.

Next, Mrs. Trump and Mrs. Vance visited an DeLalio Elementary School to
visit kindergarten and 1st grade classrooms and observe reading and
writing lessons. They finished their visit to the school by
participating in arts-and-craft activities 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade
students.

The visit concluded with a gathering at MCAS New River, where Mrs. Vance
expressed gratitude to the Marines and Service members at Camp Lejeune.
She touched on the Vice President’s service and Marine Corps’ strong
traditions he proudly upholds. She highlighted the strength of
Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) schools and military
families, praising their commitment to community and children’s
education. She introduced the First Lady, commending her dedication to
supporting children and families through Fostering the Future, a BE BEST
initiative.

Mrs. Trump honored the Marine Corps’ recent 250th birthday, touched on
the impact that artificial intelligence is having on modern warfare, and
recognized outstanding Marines for their leadership and service. As the
holiday season approaches—a time when many military families will
celebrate with an empty seat at the table—the First Lady and Second Lady
expressed their deep gratitude for the strength, resilience, and
sacrifice of those who serve and the loved ones who care, love, support,
and serve alongside them. Both ladies shared their heartfelt
appreciation to military personnel, educators, students, and families at
MCAS New River and Camp Lejeune for their warm welcome and for their
steadfast service to the United States.
