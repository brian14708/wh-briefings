title: Presidential Message on National Native American Heritage Month
---
 
This National Native American Heritage Month, we celebrate Native
Americans’ enduring contributions to our Nation’s greatness.

From the earliest days of our Republic, our founding principles have
endured and guided us.  Liberty, equality, and the rule of law—these
ideals have guided our country for two and a half centuries, and will
continue to light our way for generations to come.  But America is more
than these abstract ideas—it is a nation.  America is a country with
borders, laws, and institutions.  We are a people—with a common
language, history, and culture—and we share a bright future.  As we
prepare to celebrate 250 glorious years of American independence, we
honor the generations of Native Americans whose service have
strengthened our country.

As President, I remain committed to advancing the prosperity and
well-being of all Native Americans.  Shortly after retaking office, I
delivered on a promise to advance full federal recognition of the great
Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina—a recognition that was long overdue.  We
are also expanding educational freedom and opportunity by allowing
students eligible to attend Bureau of Indian Education Schools to use
their federal funding for the education option that best meets their
needs, including private, faith-based, or public charter schools.    

Native Americans have played an instrumental role in helping make the
United States the greatest Nation in the world.  Their rich culture,
traditions, and achievements continue to enrich our society and
strengthen the promise of America.
