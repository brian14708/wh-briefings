title: Presidential Message on National Diabetes Month
---
 
During National Diabetes Month, we recognize the millions of Americans
living with diabetes and we renew our commitment to building a healthier
Nation.

America is suffering from a health crisis.  Six in 10 Americans now live
with at least one chronic disease, nearly 40 percent are pre-diabetic,
and over ten percent are diabetic.  The global comparisons make clear
that the health of our people is on an alarming trajectory—and this
concern is especially urgent when it comes to America’s children.  Close
to 30 percent of our youth show signs of pre-diabetes and over 40
percent are overweight or obese.  Today’s children are tomorrow’s
workforce, caregivers, and leaders—we can no longer afford to ignore
this crisis.  Through my Administration’s Make America Healthy Again
Commission, we are addressing this challenge head on by pursuing truth,
restoring gold standard science, and advancing innovations that restore
children’s health and our Nation’s future.

There are clear reasons behind this rise in obesity and diabetes in
children, and they reveal both the depth of the problem and the
opportunity before us.  The American diet has shifted dramatically
toward ultra-processed food and physical activity has declined.,.  My
administration is focusing our efforts where policy and action will make
the greatest impact—advancing critical research, driving innovation, and
delivering results for diseases that begin in childhood and extend into
adulthood, including diabetes.   

As we take action to prevent chronic disease and support healthier
futures, we are also making sure Americans living with diabetes today
can access the medications they need. During my first term, I took
action to lower insulin copays for many seniors to just $35. And in
April, I signed an Executive Order to further reduce drug
prices—including lowering the cost of insulin to as low as $0.03 plus a
small administrative fee for low-income patients and the uninsured—so
than no American is forced to choose between their health and their
financial security.

Diabetes is a life-changing disease, but it does not have to control
your life.  With early detection, healthy choices, and the right care,
Americans can live stronger, fuller, and more prosperous lives.  This
month, I urge citizens to take charge of their health and know their
risks.  Together, we will confront diabetes, protect future generations,
and Make America Healthy Again.
