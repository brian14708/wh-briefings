title: Presidential Message on Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month
---
 
Our Nation’s critical infrastructure is foundational to every American’s
way of life—protecting our national security, facilitating our economic
stability, and ensuring our public safety.  During Critical
Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month, we recommit to making
America’s systems and networks powerful, modern, and more resilient than
ever before.

Immediately after retaking office, I signed an Executive Order to
unleash American energy to restore our Nation’s capacity to produce the
critical resources that power our economy.  By reasserting our energy
dominance, we are rebuilding our supply chains, strengthening our
industrial base, and fortifying the critical infrastructure that keeps
our country safe, all while lowering costs and creating good-paying jobs
for Americans.     

As we modernize the foundations of American strength, we are also
building the digital infrastructure that will define the future.  The
United States is in a race to achieve global dominance in the
technological development of our time: artificial intelligence (AI). 
Winning this battle will usher in a new era of human flourishing,
economic competitiveness, and national security for the American
people. 

My Administration is taking a whole-of-government approach to win the AI
race by accelerating innovation, building AI infrastructure, and leading
in international diplomacy and security.  Since my return to office,
American AI companies have announced infrastructure totaling more than
$400 billion—more investment than the Apollo Program and Manhattan
Project combined.  We are also rapidly developing next-generation AI
data centers and modernizing our electrical grids and communications
networks to power and connect this unprecedented buildout.  With the
support of the First Lady, who champions efforts to prepare students and
workers for this new technological era, we are ushering in a new era of
American ingenuity and leadership.

Across every sector vital to our prosperity—energy, transportation,
communications, defense, and beyond—America’s critical infrastructure is
being strengthened and renewed.  These assets, systems, and networks are
the backbone of our country’s success, and my Administration is
improving each one of them—empowering States and municipalities to make
smart infrastructure choices that both increase resilience and benefit
taxpayers.  Through commonsense, risk-informed approaches we are
building new infrastructure, modernizing existing systems, and driving
innovations that protect our people, power our economy, and keep our
Nation the most advanced, dependable, and resilient country in the
world.
