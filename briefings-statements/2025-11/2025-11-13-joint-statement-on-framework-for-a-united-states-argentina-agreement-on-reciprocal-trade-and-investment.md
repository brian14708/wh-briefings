title: Joint Statement on Framework for a United States-Argentina Agreement on Reciprocal
  Trade and Investment
---
 
President Donald J. Trump and President Javier Milei reaffirm the
strategic alliance between the United States of America (United States,
or U.S.) and the Argentine Republic (Argentina), grounded in shared
democratic values and a common vision for free enterprise, private
initiative, and open markets. 

In pursuit of a stronger, more balanced economic partnership, the United
States and Argentina have agreed to a Framework to deepen bilateral
trade and investment cooperation.  This Framework for an Agreement on
Reciprocal Trade and Investment (Agreement) seeks to drive long-term
growth, expand opportunity, and create a transparent and rules-based
environment for commerce and innovation. 

The outcome reflects the countries’ shared ambition and values, and
builds on actions Argentina has already taken to modernize its trade and
investment regime and foster reciprocal conditions.

Key elements of the deal will include:

-   **Tariffs:**  The countries will open their markets to each other on
    key products.  Argentina will provide preferential market access for
    U.S. goods exports, including certain medicines, chemicals,
    machinery, information technologies products, medical devices, motor
    vehicles, and a wide range of agricultural products.  In recognition
    of Argentina’s ambitious reform agenda and its trade commitments,
    and consistent with Argentina’s compliance with relevant supply
    chain and economic security requirements, the United States will
    remove the reciprocal tariffs on certain unavailable natural
    resources and non-patented articles for use in pharmaceutical
    applications.  In addition, the United States may positively
    consider the effect that the Agreement has on national security,
    including taking the Agreement into consideration when taking trade
    action under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as
    amended (19 U.S.C. 1862).  Furthermore, the countries have committed
    to improved, reciprocal, bilateral market access conditions for
    trade in beef.

-   **Elimination of Non-Tariff Barriers:**  Argentina has dismantled
    many non-tariff barriers that restricted access to its market,
    including import licensing, ensuring a more level playing field for
    international trade, and with this Agreement has committed not to
    require consular formalities for U.S. exports to Argentina. 
    Argentina will also phase out the statistical tax for U.S. goods.

<!-- -->

-   **Standards and Conformity Assessment:**  Argentina is aligning with
    international standards in sectors to facilitate trade.  Argentina
    will allow U.S. goods that comply with applicable U.S. or
    international standards, U.S. technical regulations, or U.S. or
    international conformity assessment procedures to enter Argentina
    without additional conformity assessment requirements, and will
    continue to eliminate non-tariff barriers that affect trade in
    priority areas.  Argentina will accept importation of vehicles
    manufactured in the United States to U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle
    Safety Standards and emissions standards, and will accept U.S. Food
    and Drug Administration certificates and prior marketing
    authorizations for medical devices and pharmaceuticals.

<!-- -->

-   **Intellectual Property:**  Argentina has taken action against a
    major, notorious, regional market for counterfeit goods and will
    continue to improve enforcement against counterfeit and pirated
    goods, including in the online environment.  Argentina has also
    committed to address structural challenges cited in the Office of
    the United States Trade Representative’s 2025 Special 301 report,
    including patentability criteria, patent backlog, and geographical
    indications, as well as to work towards aligning its intellectual
    property regime with international standards. 

<!-- -->

-   **Agricultural Market Access:**  Argentina has opened its market to
    U.S. live cattle, committed to allow market access for U.S. poultry
    within one year, and agreed not to restrict market access for
    products that use certain cheese and meat terms.  Argentina will
    simplify product registration processes for U.S. beef, beef
    products, beef offal, and pork products, and will not apply facility
    registration for imports of U.S. dairy products.  The United States
    and Argentina intend to work together to address non-tariff barriers
    affecting trade in food and agricultural products. 

<!-- -->

-   **Labor:**  Argentina has reaffirmed its commitment to protect
    internationally recognized labor rights.  In addition, Argentina
    will adopt and implement a prohibition on the importation of goods
    produced by forced or compulsory labor and strengthen enforcement of
    labor laws.

<!-- -->

-   **Environment:**  Argentina has committed to take measures to
    further combat illegal logging; encourage a more resource efficient
    economy, including in the critical minerals sector; and fully
    implement the obligations of the World Trade Organization (WTO)
    *Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies*.

<!-- -->

-   **Economic Security Alignment:**  Argentina will enhance cooperation
    with the United States to combat non-market policies and practices
    of other countries.  The two countries have also committed to
    identifying tools to align approaches to export controls, investment
    security, duty evasion, and other important topics.  

<!-- -->

-   **Commercial Considerations and Opportunities:**  Argentina and the
    United States will cooperate to facilitate investment and trade in
    critical minerals.  The two countries also agreed to work toward
    stabilizing the global soybean trade.

<!-- -->

-   **Confronting State-Owned Enterprises and Subsidies:**  Argentina
    has committed to address potential distortionary actions of
    state-owned enterprises and to address industrial subsidies that may
    have an impact on the bilateral trading relationship.

<!-- -->

-   **Digital Trade:**  Argentina has committed to facilitating digital
    trade with the United States by recognizing the United States as an
    adequate jurisdiction under Argentine law for the cross-border
    transfer of data, including personal data; and by refraining from
    discrimination against U.S. digital services or digital products. 
    Argentina also intends to recognize as valid under its law
    electronic signatures that are valid under U.S. law.

The United States and Argentina will work expeditiously to finalize the
text of the Agreement for signature and undertake their respective
domestic formalities in advance of the Agreement entering into force. 

The countries will review implementation of the Agreement and continue
close coordination on trade and investment matters through the Trade and
Investment Framework Agreement, and the Innovation and Creativity Forum
for Economic Development.
