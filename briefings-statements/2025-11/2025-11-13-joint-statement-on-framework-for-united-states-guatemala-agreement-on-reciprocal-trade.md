title: Joint Statement on Framework for United States-Guatemala Agreement on Reciprocal
  Trade
---
 
The United States of America (United States, or U.S.) and the Republic
of Guatemala (Guatemala) have agreed to a **Framework** for an
**Agreement on Reciprocal Trade** (Agreement) that further strengthens
and builds upon our long-standing economic relationship, including the
Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement
(CAFTA-DR), which entered into force for the United States and Guatemala
in 2006.

Key terms of the Agreement between the United States and Guatemala will
include:

-   Guatemala has committed to addressing a wide range of non-tariff
    barriers affecting trade in priority areas, including streamlining
    regulatory requirements and approvals for U.S. exports including
    pharmaceutical products and medical devices; removing import
    restrictions on remanufactured goods; accepting U.S. auto standards;
    and streamlining certificate of free sale requirements, accepting
    electronic certificates, removing apostille requirements, and
    expediting product registration requirements for U.S. exports.

<!-- -->

-   Guatemala has committed to address and prevent barriers to U.S.
    agricultural products in its market, including with regard to U.S.
    regulatory oversight and acceptance of currently agreed certificates
    issued by U.S. regulatory authorities. Guatemala also committed to
    maintain science- and risk-based regulatory frameworks and efficient
    authorization processes for agricultural products.

<!-- -->

-   Guatemala has committed to a robust standard for intellectual
    property protection and enforcement, including fully implementing
    certain international intellectual property treaties and taking
    steps to resolve many long-standing intellectual property issues
    identified in the Office of the United States Trade Representative’s
    Special 301 Report. 

<!-- -->

-   Guatemala has committed to provide transparency and fairness
    regarding geographical indications, while ensuring that market
    access will not be restricted due to the mere use of certain cheese
    and meat terms.

<!-- -->

-   Guatemala has committed to facilitate digital trade, including by
    refraining from imposing digital services taxes or other measures
    that discriminate against U.S. digital services or U.S. products
    distributed digitally, ensuring the free transfer of data across
    trusted borders, and supporting a permanent multilateral moratorium
    on customs duties on electronic transmissions at the World Trade
    Organization (WTO).

<!-- -->

-   Guatemala has committed to take effective actions to implement the
    Joint Initiative on Services Domestic Regulation.

<!-- -->

-   Guatemala has committed to continue facilitating trade, including by
    following best practices in customs, and adopt and implement good
    regulatory practices.

<!-- -->

-   Guatemala has committed to protect internationally recognized labor
    rights. In furtherance of this commitment, Guatemala will prohibit
    the importation of goods produced by forced or compulsory labor and
    strengthen its labor laws and their enforcement.

<!-- -->

-   Guatemala has committed to adopt and maintain high levels of
    environmental protection and to effectively enforce its
    environmental laws. Guatemala has also committed to take measures to
    improve forest sector governance and combat illegal logging,
    strengthen enforcement of its fisheries-related measures, combat
    illegal wildlife trade and illegal mining, and fully implement the
    WTO *Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies*.

<!-- -->

-   Guatemala has committed to address potential distortionary actions
    of state-owned enterprises and to address industrial subsidies that
    may have an impact on the bilateral trading relationship.

<!-- -->

-   Guatemala has committed to strengthen economic and national security
    cooperation to enhance supply chain resilience and innovation
    through complementary actions to address non-market policies of
    other countries, as well as addressing duty evasion and cooperating
    on investment security and export controls.

<!-- -->

-   Guatemala has committed to take steps to restrict access to central
    level procurement covered by its free trade agreement commitments
    for suppliers from non-free trade agreement partners, permitting
    exemptions as necessary, in a manner comparable to the United
    States’ procurement restrictions.

In the coming weeks, the United States and Guatemala will work to
finalize the Agreement, prepare the Agreement for signature, and
undertake domestic formalities in advance of the Agreement entering into
force. Given Guatemala’s commitment to take significant steps to advance
a stronger and more reciprocal trade relationship, the United States
will remove the reciprocal tariffs on Guatemala’s exports to the United
States for certain qualifying exports that cannot be grown, mined, or
naturally produced in the United States in sufficient quantities, as
well as certain products, such as textiles and apparel products,
originating under the CAFTA-DR. The United States and Guatemala look
forward to closing the Agreement soon.
