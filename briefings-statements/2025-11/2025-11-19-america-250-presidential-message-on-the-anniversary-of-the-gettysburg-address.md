title: 'America 250: Presidential Message on the Anniversary of the Gettysburg Address'
---
 
Today, our Nation marks the 162nd anniversary of the Gettysburg Address,
the brief yet immortal speech through which President Abraham Lincoln
transformed a battlefield of sacrifice into a hallowed testament to our
enduring principles and the nation built to defend them.  In honoring
that day of solemn dedication, we reflect on what it means to be a
country united by liberty, tested by conflict, and strengthened by the
conviction that our best days will always lie ahead. 

In July of 1863, a fierce battle that determined the fate of our Union
unfolded in the hills and fields of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.  Commanded
by Union General George Meade and Confederate General Robert E. Lee,
soldiers from the North and South fought relentlessly in the most
consequential battle of the Civil War.  After a brutal three-day
struggle, Confederate forces were defeated at an immense price, and the
battlefield was scarred by the loss of more than 7,000 men from all
walks of life.  When President Lincoln visited the battlefield on
November 19th to commemorate those who had perished in the fight, he did
not boast of Union victory or vengeance.  He spoke instead of renewal,
hope, and the debt our Nation owed to those who had given the last full
measure of devotion.

In his address, President Lincoln dedicated a cemetery and reconsecrated
a Nation to its founding promise.  He proclaimed that beyond the
challenges that pitted a nation against itself, Americans are bound by a
shared history and commitment to preserving our hard-won freedom.  His
words lifted the gaze of an embattled Nation from the graves at
Gettysburg to the horizon of a more perfect Union.  He reminded
Americans that liberty is never self-sustaining—rather, it survives only
through the courage and conviction of those willing to fight for it. 
President Lincoln’s address transformed sorrow into strength and loss
into purpose, binding the Nation’s wounds and reminding Americans that
those who fought and perished did not die in vain, but fought to secure
a new birth of freedom for our country.

More than two and a half centuries later, President Lincoln’s message
still reaches across time to remind us of our proud history, our common
bond, and our duties as Americans.  He called upon the people of this
country in every age to stand as one Nation, preserve our liberty, and
always defend our God-given right to self-government.  As we prepare to
celebrate 250 glorious years of American independence, we renew our
commitment to those timeless principles and continue our work to ensure
that our great Nation remains worthy of the ultimate sacrifices that
built and preserved it.  We will always remember our fallen heroes,
cherish our freedom, honor our heritage, and forever uphold that a
government of the people, by the people, and for the people, shall not
perish from the earth.
