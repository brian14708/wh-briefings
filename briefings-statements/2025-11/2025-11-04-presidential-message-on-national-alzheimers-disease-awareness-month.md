title: "Presidential Message on National Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Awareness Month"
---
 
During National Alzheimer’s Disease Awareness Month, we recognize the
immense toll this devastating illness takes on millions of Americans and
the families, friends, and caregivers who love and care for them.  We
honor their strength and compassion, and we recommit to advancing
awareness and accelerating the research and innovation needed to
prevent, treat, and cure Alzheimer’s disease.

There are an estimated 7 million Americans living with Alzheimer’s
disease, a heartbreaking reality that affects families in every
community.  Confronting this disease requires renewed commitment to the
health and well-being of our people.  Through the Make America Healthy
Again Commission, my Administration is taking decisive action to reform
America’s food, health, and scientific systems to identify the root
causes of the chronic disease epidemic.

We are also reinvigorating America’s scientific enterprise to ensure our
Nation remains the global leader in discovery and innovation.  To
empower researchers to achieve breakthroughs in science, such as a cure
for Alzheimer’s, my Administration is maximizing the impact of federal
research investments to reward results and accelerate progress.  We are
cutting burdensome red tape so scientists can focus on discovery instead
of bureaucracy, and we are returning to Gold Standard Science to restore
integrity, transparency, and accountability across America’s scientific
establishment. 

With the unmatched talent of America’s scientists, innovators, and
medical professionals, we will continue advancing the search for a cure
and improving the lives of those affected by Alzheimer’s.  We stand with
all who suffer from this disease and we remain steadfast in our resolve
to end this disease once and for all.
