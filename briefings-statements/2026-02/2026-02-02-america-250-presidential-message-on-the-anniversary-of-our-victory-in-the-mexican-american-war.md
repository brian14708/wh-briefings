title: 'America 250: Presidential Message on the Anniversary of Our Victory in the
  Mexican-American War'
---
 
Today marks the 178th anniversary of our Nation’s triumph in the
Mexican-American War—a legendary victory that secured the American
Southwest, reasserted American sovereignty, and expanded the promise of
American independence across our majestic continent.

Guided by the steadfast belief that our Nation was destined by divine
providence to expand to the golden shores of the Pacific Ocean,
following the bloody War of 1812, the United States was confidently
advancing westward and boldly emerging as a continental superpower
unlike anything the modern world had ever seen.  The people of Texas
declared independence from Mexico in 1836, and by the spring of 1846,
they voted to join the United States—forcing a reckoning over unsettled
border disputes.  That April, Mexican forces launched an ambush along
the Rio Grande, killing 11 and wounding 6 American troops.

With the promise of Manifest Destiny beating in every American heart,
President James K. Polk took swift action to defend our Nation’s
security, our dignity, and our sovereign borders.  In May of 1846, the
United States declared war on Mexico, with two American titans—Generals
Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott—leading the charge.  Despite being
vastly outnumbered in battle, American forces consistently reigned
victorious through their superior military strategy, modern military
capabilities, and steadfast devotion to protecting the national
interest.  After a series of victories in the Mexican territories of
California and New Mexico, in a triumphant victory for American
sovereignty, the United States heroically captured the capital of Mexico
City in September of 1847—paving the way to the Treaty of Guadalupe
Hidalgo on February 2, 1848, formally ceding 525,000 square miles of new
land to the United States, representing 55% of pre-war territory.

Since taking office as the 47th President of the United States, guided
by our victory on the fields of Mexico 178 years ago, I have spared no
effort in defending our southern border against invasion, upholding the
rule of law, and protecting our homeland from forces of evil, violence,
and destruction.  My Administration is halting the flow of deadly drugs
entering our country through Mexico, ending the invasion of illegal
aliens along our southern border, and dismantling narco-terrorist
networks all across the Western hemisphere.  I have secured historic
trade deals with El Salvador, Argentina, Ecuador, and Guatemala,
allowing greater and more streamlined market access.  We stopped a
hostile foreign power from controlling the Panama Canal.  We are
reestablishing American maritime dominance.  And we are aggressively
pursuing an America First policy of peace through strength and will
continue to reassert the Trump Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine to
ensure the Hemisphere remains safe, prosperous, and free.  We will never
waver in putting our people, our interests, and our country first.

On this anniversary of one of our Nation’s earliest displays of military
might—and particularly as we celebrate 250 glorious years of American
independence—we honor the memory of the brave men who gave their lives
in service to our Nation.  One hundred and seventy-eight years later,
their legacy lives on in our enduring strength, our commitment to
sovereignty, and the unmatched power of the American spirit.
