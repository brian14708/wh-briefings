First Lady Melania Trump visited children with rare and serious diseases
at The Children’s Inn at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for
Valentine’s Day. Mrs. Trump joined the children, their families, and
staff members for an afternoon of creativity, connection, and
encouragement.

“Love reveals itself in many forms, especially in the hardest moments of
care and compassion,” said Mrs. Trump. “The Children’s Inn provides
important support to children who have been diagnosed with rare and
serious diseases. Returning to The Children’s Inn at NIH is a special
reminder of warmth that exists here year-round thanks to the profound
resilience of these young people and the dedication of those working to
provide comfort, hope, and support during clinical trials. I wish them
all a very happy Valentine’s Day.”

“We were deeply honored to welcome First Lady Melania Trump back to The
Children’s Inn,” said Jennie Lucca, Chief Executive Officer of The
Children’s Inn. “Her visit brought joy and comfort to our children and
families at a time when compassion and encouragement mean so much. This
Valentine’s Day celebration served as a heartfelt reminder that our
families are surrounded by care, support, and hope throughout their
medical journey.”

During her visit, Mrs. Trump made handmade valentines during arts and
crafts activities with children and youth who are receiving care through
NIH clinical trials. Mrs. Trump also spent time speaking with families
and staff, expressing her appreciation for the compassion and dedication
shown to children facing serious medical challenges.

The Children’s Inn at NIH is a nonprofit that provides a free
residential “place like home” to reduce the burden of illness, make
childhood possible, and help advance medical research. Families with
children, teens, and young adults participating in leading-edge studies
at the NIH Clinical Center, the nation’s premier biomedical research
hospital, have been welcomed at The Inn since 1990.

First Lady Melania Trump previously celebrated Valentine’s Day at The
Children’s Inn in 2018, 2019, and 2020, continuing a tradition of
highlighting the resilience of children and families and the importance
of compassion in healing.
