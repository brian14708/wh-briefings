title: First Lady Melania Trump Champions U.S. Fashion Leadership
---
 
“Human nature resides in the discipline of detail. Everything is in the
detail,” proclaimed First Lady Melania Trump. Mrs. Trump continued,
“It’s a testament as to why America’s fashion industry can lead the rest
of the world.”

The First Lady entered her 2025 inaugural gown into the Smithsonian
National Museum of American History’s First Ladies Collection today, a
rare distinction held by only a few First Ladies in history.  

“The human condition is captured within every stitch—the idea to endure
and rise above mediocrity—to reach the highest level—America’s destiny,”
said First Lady Melania Trump.

Designed by Mr. Hervé Pierre, the strapless off-white silk crepe gown
trimmed with black silk gazar was paired with a reproduction of a 1955
diamond brooch by Harry Winston, worn on a black ribbon choker. Mrs.
Trump described the gown as a testament to the originality, creativity,
and craftsmanship behind American fashion.

Mrs. Trump continued, “It is no easy feat to construct such a complex
garment. Behind every true couture piece stands a superior team of
patternmakers, seamstresses, and artisans who transform a creative idea
into reality.”  

The presentation ceremony included remarks from Smithsonian Secretary
Dr. Lonnie G. Bunch III, Museum Director Anthea M. Hartig, and Mrs.
Melania Trump. The First Ladies Collection, established in 1912, remains
one of the Smithsonian’s most popular exhibitions and holds a more than
100-year-old tradition of displaying the inaugural attire of First
Ladies. Today some 1,000 objects in the First Ladies Collection
represent a range of materials from inaugural gowns and other dresses to
personal effects and White House ephemera.

First Lady Melania Trump is the first non-consecutive First Lady to
donate an inaugural gown for a second time, and only the second First
Lady in history to have two inaugural ball gowns represented in the
collection—the last being First Lady Ida McKinley in 1897 and 1901.

Visitors can view Mrs. Trump’s gown beginning this afternoon in the
First Ladies exhibition at the National Museum of American History. The
museum is open daily from 10:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. with free admission.

**Full Remarks by First Lady Melania Trump (As Prepared for Delivery)**

Good morning, Secretary Bunch. Thank you for inviting me to join you at
the Smithsonian today. The Smithsonian Museum is an important cultural
jewel. It is my great honor to be surrounded by so many special people
to celebrate this momentous occasion.

Human nature resides in the discipline of detail. Everything is in the
detail.

This is not a dress.

This is more than 50 years of education, experience, and wisdom realized
with each thread, each stitch, each sharp edge. The meticulously formed
black shape “Z” on the front bodice summons decades of my early
memories, life experiences, and influences. And, all of these stories
are tucked deep within its crisp, strong seams—forever.

Mr. Hervé Pierre’s sophisticated knowledge of couture design has
solidified his position as a fearlessly independent visionary. Harry
Winston, one of America’s most consequential jewelers, designed the
diamond brooch in 1955. Mr. Winston’s headline-grabbing historic piece
was loaned to me, specifically for the inauguration. The minimal black
neckpiece framed the radiant floral diamond cluster, creating harmony
with my overall look.

The beautiful contrast between black and white sets a mood rich with
emotion. American imagination appears in different creative forms,
across all types of canvases—and often serves up a clear perspective.
This dress speaks with a distinct point of view—a modern silhouette,
bold and dignified, and ruthlessly chic.

It is no easy feat to construct such a complex garment. Behind every
true couture piece stands a superior team of patternmakers,
seamstresses, and artisans who transform a creative idea into reality.
My team of experts who constructed this gown have obsessed to master
their discipline. I am proud to collaborate with each of them.

The human condition is captured within every stitch—the idea to endure
and rise above mediocrity—to reach the highest level—America’s destiny.
This black and white masterpiece showcases America’s pure spirit of
originality, superior engineering, and boundless creativity. It’s a
testament as to why America’s fashion industry can lead the rest of the
world.

Personally, I relish the entire design process, from start to finish. It
takes time, it’s slow, but the end result is always magical. If you had
a chance to see my new film, *MELANIA*, you are well aware of what it
took to bring this technical marvel to life.

We must take pride not only in the small rituals of self-care, but in
the courageous act of self-expression—our outward appearance to the
world. The art of presenting oneself can be cultivated over a lifetime,
yet even the young girl who takes care of herself from the inside out
with precision every morning, leaves for school with a more confident
step, and a steady gaze—confident to claim her place in the world. This
spark pays dividends and stays with her for a lifetime.

I am honored to have our creative vision on display here, once again,
within the walls of this institution, indefinitely.
