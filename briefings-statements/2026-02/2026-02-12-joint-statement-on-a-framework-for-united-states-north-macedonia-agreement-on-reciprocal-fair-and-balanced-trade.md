title: Joint Statement on a Framework for United States-North Macedonia Agreement
  on Reciprocal, Fair, and Balanced Trade
---
 
 The United States of America (United States) and the Republic of North
Macedonia (North Macedonia) have agreed to a Framework for an Agreement
on Reciprocal, Fair, and Balanced Trade (Agreement) to strengthen our
bilateral economic relationship, which will provide both countries’
exporters expanded access to each other’s markets. The Agreement will
strengthen our trade relationship, support shared strategic interests,
promote economic growth, and deepen our transatlantic partnership. 

Key terms of the Agreement will include: 

• North Macedonia will eliminate customs duties for all U.S. industrial
and agricultural goods exported to North Macedonia. 

• The United States will maintain at 15 percent the reciprocal tariffs,
as set forth in Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2005, as amended, on
originating goods of North Macedonia, and will also identify products
from the list set out in Annex III to Executive Order 14346 of September
5, 2025, Potential Tariff Adjustments for Aligned Partners, as amended,
to receive a zero percent reciprocal tariff rate. The United States and
North Macedonia may consider other tariff modifications following
conclusion of the Agreement, taking into account trade balances and
other appropriate factors. 

• The United States and North Macedonia will work to address U.S.
concerns with non-tariff barriers imposed by North Macedonia that affect
bilateral trade in priority areas. 

• The United States and North Macedonia commit to hold consultations to
address and prevent barriers to U.S. agricultural products in the
Macedonian market. 

• The United States and North Macedonia have committed to strengthen
economic and national security cooperation to enhance supply chain
resilience and innovation through complementary actions to address
non-market policies of other countries, as well as to combat duty
evasion and cooperate on investment reviews and export controls. This
commitment includes cooperating to ensure that international procurement
obligations benefit only those countries that have taken on the same
commitments. 

• The United States and North Macedonia note their intention to
facilitate and enhance commercial ties. 

• On energy sector opportunities, the United States and North Macedonia
take note of the construction of an important new gas interconnector
between North Macedonia and Greece, which will allow North Macedonia to
enhance energy security and diversify energy sources, including through
purchases of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG). North 

Macedonia will commence purchase of U.S. LNG upon completion of the new
gas interconnector. 

• North Macedonia commits to adopt and maintain high levels of
environmental protections and to effectively enforce its environmental
laws. 

• The United States and North Macedonia will discuss commitments on
intellectual property protection and enforcement, including on
geographical indications. 

• The United States and North Macedonia will engage to address labor
issues. 

• The United States and North Macedonia recognize the importance of
high-standard commitments on digital trade in order to foster an open
and competitive digital economy. North Macedonia has committed not to
impose a digital service tax and to support adoption of a permanent
moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions at the World
Trade Organization (WTO). 

• The United States and North Macedonia recognize the importance of
facilitating trade in services. North Macedonia reaffirms its commitment
to the WTO Joint Initiative on Services Domestic Regulation. 

The United States and North Macedonia will work to finalize the
Agreement, prepare the Agreement for signature, and undertake domestic
formalities in advance of the Agreement entering into force.
