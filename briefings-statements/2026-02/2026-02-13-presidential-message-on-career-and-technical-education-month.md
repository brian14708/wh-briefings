title: Presidential Message on Career and Technical Education Month
---
 
For 250 years, our Nation has been built by the hard work, ingenuity,
and unwavering determination of patriots who work with their skilled
hands and brilliant minds to make our country strong.  This Career and
Technical Education Month, we reaffirm our commitment to preparing
American workers and students to carry this proud tradition forward and
to equipping them with the skills they need to forge a great American
future.

Every day, my Administration is working to promote and expand career and
technical education to increase employment opportunities, boost
productivity, and usher in a new era of economic growth marked by
emerging industries and cutting-edge technologies.  Today, Americans
have more pathways than ever before to develop the skills they need for
success.  As the economy roars back with explosive job growth and
unprecedented investments in science and technology, America’s
competitiveness depends on our ability to close the gap between the
demand for skill and the qualified workers ready to step up and lead.  A
strong workforce drives economic growth and national innovation—creating
a stronger, more secure, and more prosperous America.

My Administration is committed to increasing and enhancing career
education opportunities to equip millions of workers and students with
practical skills to thrive in their careers.  To advance this goal, last
April, I proudly signed an Executive Order to realign federal priorities
with the need for skilled and highly trained workers. Building on this
effort, last July, I signed into law a new student aid program, known as
Workforce Pell Grants, to support learners who want to use Federal
financial assistance to enroll in short-term, in-demand fields. Then, in
August, my Administration released *America’s Talent Strategy* to
provide a blueprint for aligning our education and workforce systems to
unleash the unbridled potential of American talent. In addition, we took
several actions to advance artificial intelligence education for
American youth. 

We are slashing ineffective programs, investing in better employment and
earning outcomes, and identifying alternative methods for workers to
receive credentials of value beyond a traditional higher education
degree.  Through our historic Trump Accounts initiative, we are
expanding financial literacy and teaching our young people the virtues
of capitalism.  And we have implemented a bold plan to expand
apprenticeships with the ambitious goal of reaching and surpassing one
million active registered apprentices.

This month, we honor the hardworking men and women who stand at the
center of American innovation, ingenuity, and determination.  My
Administration will never waver in preparing our workers and students to
lead our Nation into a radiant American future defined by skill,
tenacity, excellence, and strength.
