title: "Joint Statement on United States \u2013 Bangladesh Agreement on Reciprocal\
  \ Trade"
---
 
The United States of America (the United States) and the People’s
Republic of Bangladesh (Bangladesh) have agreed to an Agreement on
Reciprocal Trade (Agreement) to strengthen our bilateral economic
relationship.  The Agreement will provide U.S. and Bangladeshi exporters
unprecedented access to each other’s respective markets.  The Agreement
will build upon our longstanding economic relationship, including the
U.S.-Bangladesh Trade and Investment Cooperation Forum Agreement
(TICFA), signed in 2013.

Key terms of the Agreement will include:

-   Bangladesh commits to provide significant preferential market access
    for U.S. industrial and agricultural goods, including: chemicals;
    medical devices; machinery and motor vehicles and parts; information
    and communicational technology (ICT) equipment; energy products; soy
    products; dairy products; beef; poultry; and tree nuts and fruit.

<!-- -->

-   The United States will reduce the reciprocal tariff rate, as
    initially set forth in Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025, to 19
    percent on originating goods of Bangladesh, and will identify
    products from the list set out in Annex III (Potential Tariff
    Adjustments for Aligned Partners) to Executive Order 14346 of
    September 5, 2025 (Modifying the Scope of Reciprocal Tariffs and
    Establishing Procedures for Implementing Trade and Security
    Agreements) to receive a zero percent reciprocal tariff rate.

<!-- -->

-   The United States commits to establish a mechanism that will allow
    for certain textile and apparel goods from Bangladesh to receive a
    zero reciprocal tariff rate.  This mechanism will provide that a
    to-be-specified volume of apparel and textile imports from
    Bangladesh can enter the United States at this reduced tariff rate,
    but this volume shall be determined in relation to the quantity of
    exports of textiles, e.g. U.S. produced cotton and man-made fiber
    textile inputs, from the United States.

<!-- -->

-   The United States and Bangladesh commit to address Bangladesh’s
    non-tariff barriers that affect bilateral trade and investment in
    priority areas, including by Bangladesh: accepting vehicles built to
    U.S. Federal motor vehicle safety and emissions standards; accepting
    U.S. Food and Drug Administration certificates and prior marketing
    authorizations for medical devices and pharmaceuticals; and removing
    any import restrictions or licensing requirement on U.S.
    remanufactured goods or their parts. 

<!-- -->

-   Bangladesh commits to permit the free transfer of data across
    trusted borders; support the adoption of a permanent moratorium on
    customs duties on electronic transmissions at the World Trade
    Organization; follow science and risk-based processes to allow the
    import of safe U.S. food and agricultural goods; remove barriers in
    the insurance market; digitalize its customs procedures; and adopt
    and implement good regulatory practices.

<!-- -->

-   Bangladesh commits to protect internationally recognized labor
    rights, including: adopting and implementing a prohibition on the
    importation of goods produced by forced or compulsory labor;
    amending its labor laws to ensure that workers’ rights to freedom of
    association and collective bargaining are fully protected; and
    strengthening enforcement of its labor laws.

<!-- -->

-   Bangladesh commits to adopt and maintain high levels of
    environmental protection and effectively enforce its environmental
    laws; improve customs and trade facilitation; and address
    distortions caused by subsidies and state-owned enterprises.

<!-- -->

-   Bangladesh commits to a robust standard for intellectual property
    protection and enforcement, including ratifying or acceding to and
    fully implementing certain international intellectual property
    treaties.  Bangladesh commits to groundbreaking provisions on
    geographical indications that will preserve U.S. market access,
    particularly for U.S. cheese and meat producers who rely on the use
    of common names.

<!-- -->

-   The United States and Bangladesh are committed to strengthening
    economic and national security alignment to enhance supply chain
    resilience and innovation through complementary actions to address
    unfair trade practices worldwide, as well as by combatting duty
    evasion, cooperating on export controls, and sharing information on
    inbound investment in our respective territories.

<!-- -->

-   Bangladesh commits to strengthen and enforce comprehensive
    anti-corruption laws.

<!-- -->

-   The United States shall work through its U.S. institutions such as
    the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM Bank) and the U.S.
    International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), if eligible, to
    consider supporting investment financing in critical sectors in
    Bangladesh in collaboration with U.S. private sector partners,
    consistent with applicable law.

<!-- -->

-   Finally, the United States and Bangladesh take note of recent and
    forthcoming commercial deals in the areas of agriculture, energy,
    and technology: 

<!-- -->

-   Procurement of aircraft.

<!-- -->

-   Purchases of approximately $3.5 billion of U.S. agriculture
    products, including wheat, soy, cotton, and corn.

<!-- -->

-   Purchases of energy products, with an estimated value of $15 billion
    over 15 years.

<!-- -->

-   The United States and Bangladesh, consistent with their respective
    internal procedures, will promptly finalize the Agreement on
    Reciprocal Trade, and undertake domestic formalities in advance of
    the Agreement entering into force.
