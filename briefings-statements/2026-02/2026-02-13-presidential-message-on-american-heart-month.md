title: Presidential Message on American Heart Month
---
 
This American Heart Month, my Administration renews our pledge to
protect the American heart and to keep the American people safe, strong,
healthy, and free.

Sadly, one of the gravest threats to American lives today is the deadly
affliction of heart disease, which imposes hardship on untold numbers of
families.  For this reason, as President, I urge every American to take
charge of their health to decrease the possibility of a heart attack or
stroke.  Genetics play a role in cardiovascular disease, but
implementing targeted lifestyle choices and preventative measures—such
as getting regular check-ups, exercising, controlling blood pressure and
cholesterol, and maintaining a balanced diet—can improve the odds
against illness, disability, and death for any individual regardless of
family history.

Under my leadership, the Make America Healthy Again Commission is
working tirelessly to improve the quality of life and longevity for
every American and to ensure our healthcare system addresses the root
causes of chronic disease.  My Administration has secured historic
agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers to significantly lower the
price Americans pay for some of the world’s most popular drugs that can
help with heart disease, obesity, and other conditions, and launched
TrumpRx.gov to ensure American patients can access those lower prices. 
We have also introduced the Great Healthcare Plan, building on our
historic efforts to provide Most-Favored-Nation price relief for
prescription drugs.  I urge Congress to enact this comprehensive plan,
which will substantially benefit millions of Americans.

This American Heart Month, I encourage every citizen to make lifestyle
changes and take preventative measures to improve the odds against
illness, disability, and death.  We pray for the families devastated by
loss, we honor the resilience of the survivors of heart disease, and
above all, we rededicate ourselves to working toward a future where
heart disease does not deprive the American people of long, productive,
and fulfilling lives.
