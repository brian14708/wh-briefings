title: Presidential Message on Lunar New Year
---
 
Today, I send my best wishes to the millions of people of Asian heritage
in the United States and around the world observing Lunar New Year and
celebrating the Year of the Horse.

Lunar New Year is an ancient holiday marked by thanksgiving and joy.  It
is a time to acknowledge the blessings of family and friends, reflect on
the accomplishments and challenges of the past year, and plan for the
future with anticipation and renewed hope.  Around the globe, Lunar New
Year is ushered in with spectacular firework displays, festivals,
traditional music, feasts, and gatherings, which strengthen community
and family bonds.  It is also a fitting time to recognize the
contributions of many legendary Asian Americans for their contributions
to our culture, our prosperity, and our way of life.

Tradition holds that the horse represents momentum, vitality, passion,
freedom, and adventure—traits that our Nation has embodied for 250
glorious years of American independence.  On this Lunar New Year, we
celebrate these enduring virtues and carry them with us as we continue
building upon America’s Golden Age.  As family, friends, and communities
gather to welcome the start of Lunar New Year, the First Lady and I join
in wishing you a year filled with health, happiness, good fortune, and
peace.

Happy New Year!
