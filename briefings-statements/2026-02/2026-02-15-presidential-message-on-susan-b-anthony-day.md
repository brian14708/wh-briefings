title: Presidential Message on Susan B. Anthony Day
---
 
Today, we honor the life and legacy of Susan B. Anthony—a true American
giant and an unwavering advocate for the cause of human dignity.  On
what would have been her 206th birthday, we recommit to the timeless
truth she spent her life defending:  that every human being is made in
the holy image of God.

Susan B. Anthony was a champion for women’s suffrage, abolition, the
sanctity of life, and the dignity of work.  During her storied life, she
co-founded the National Woman Suffrage Association, traveled the Nation
delivering inspiring speeches to crowds of thousands, and never stopped
fighting to advance the cause of liberty.  Her tireless efforts later
laid the foundation for the ratification of the 19th Amendment—securing
women’s right to vote.  Anthony is also remembered for her fierce moral
clarity in condemning abortion and her steadfast work to end slavery.

My Administration is proudly carrying forth the torch of Anthony’s
legacy by fearlessly protecting life, women, and families.  We are
bolstering federal support for adoption, expanding vital resources for
expectant mothers, defending equal opportunities for women and girls in
athletics, ending taxpayer-funded abortion, and upholding the First
Amendment freedoms that made Anthony’s extraordinary advocacy possible.

As we honor the monumental contributions of Susan B. Anthony to our
great American story, we recommit as one people to building a Nation
where every citizen can thrive, every child is cherished, and the
blessings of liberty and justice are secured for all.
