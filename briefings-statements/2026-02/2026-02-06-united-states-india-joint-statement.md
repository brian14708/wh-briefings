The United States of America (United States) and India are pleased to
announce that they have reached a framework for an Interim Agreement
regarding reciprocal and mutually beneficial trade (Interim Agreement).
Today’s framework reaffirms the countries’ commitment to the broader
U.S.-India Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) negotiations, launched by
President Donald J. Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February
13, 2025, which will include additional market access commitments and
support more resilient supply chains. The Interim Agreement between the
United States and India will represent a historic milestone in our
countries’ partnership, demonstrating a common commitment to reciprocal
and balanced trade based on mutual interests and concrete outcomes.

Key terms of the Interim Agreement between the United States and India
will include:

-   India will eliminate or reduce tariffs on all U.S. industrial goods
    and a wide range of U.S. food and agricultural products, including
    dried distillers’ grains (DDGs), red sorghum for animal feed, tree
    nuts, fresh and processed fruit, soybean oil, wine and spirits, and
    additional products.

<!-- -->

-   The United States will apply a reciprocal tariff rate of 18 percent
    under Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports
    With a Reciprocal Tariff to Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute
    to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits),
    as amended, on originating goods of India, including textile and
    apparel, leather and footwear, plastic and rubber, organic
    chemicals, home décor, artisanal products, and certain machinery,
    and, subject to the successful conclusion of the Agreement, will
    remove the reciprocal tariff on a wide range of goods identified in
    the Potential Tariff Adjustments for Aligned Partners Annex to
    Executive Order 14346 of September 5, 2025 (Modifying the Scope of
    Reciprocal Tariffs and Establishing Procedures for Implementing
    Trade and Security Agreements), as amended, including generic
    pharmaceuticals, gems and diamonds, and aircraft parts.

<!-- -->

-   The United States will also remove tariffs on certain aircraft and
    aircraft parts of India imposed to eliminate threats to national
    security found in Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting
    Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), as amended;
    Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into
    the United States), as amended; and Proclamation 10962 of July 30,
    2025 (Adjusting Imports of Copper Into the United States). 
    Similarly, consistent with U.S. national security requirements,
    India will receive a preferential tariff rate quota for automotive
    parts subject to the tariff imposed to eliminate threats to national
    security found in Proclamation 9888 of May 17, 2019 (Adjusting
    Imports of Automobiles and Automobile Parts Into the United States),
    as amended.  Contingent on the findings of the U.S. Section 232
    investigation of pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients,
    India will receive negotiated outcomes with respect to generic
    pharmaceuticals and ingredients.

<!-- -->

-   The United States and India commit to provide each other
    preferential market access in sectors of respective interest on a
    sustained basis.

<!-- -->

-   The United States and India will establish rules of origin that
    ensure that the benefits of theAgreement accrue predominately to the
    United States and India. 

<!-- -->

-   The United States and India will address non-tariff barriers that
    affect bilateral trade. India agrees to address long-standing
    barriers to the trade in U.S. medical devices; eliminate restrictive
    import licensing procedures that delay market access for, or impose
    quantitative restrictions on, U.S. Information and Communication
    Technology (ICT) goods; and determine, with a view towards a
    positive outcome, within six months of entry into force of the
    Agreement whether U.S.-developed or international standards,
    including testing requirements, are acceptable for the purposes of
    U.S. exports entering the Indian market in identified sectors.
    Recognizing the importance of working together to resolve
    long-standing concerns, India also agrees to address long-standing
    non-tariff barriers to the trade in U.S. food and agricultural
    products.

<!-- -->

-   For the purposes of enhancing ease of compliance with applicable
    technical regulations, the United States and India intend to discuss
    their respective standards and conformity assessment procedures for
    mutually agreed sectors. 

<!-- -->

-   In the event of any changes to the agreed upon tariffs of either
    country, the United States and India agree that the other country
    may modify its commitments.

<!-- -->

-   The United States and India will work towards further expanding
    market access opportunities through the negotiations of the BTA. The
    United States affirms that it intends to take into consideration,
    during the negotiations of the BTA, India’s request that the United
    States continue to work to lower tariffs on Indian goods.

<!-- -->

-   The United States and India agree to strengthen economic security
    alignment to enhance supply chain resilience and innovation through
    complementary actions to address non- market policies of third
    parties, as well as cooperation on inbound and outbound investment
    reviews and export controls.

<!-- -->

-   India intends to purchase $500 billion of U.S. energy products,
    aircraft and aircraft parts, precious metals, technology products,
    and coking coal over the next 5 years. India and the United States
    will significantly increase trade in technology products, including
    Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and other goods used in data
    centers, and expand joint technology cooperation.

<!-- -->

-   The United States and India commit to address discriminatory or
    burdensome practices and other barriers to digital trade and to set
    a clear pathway to achieve robust, ambitious, and mutually
    beneficial digital trade rules as part of the BTA.

The United States and India will promptly implement this framework and
work towards finalizing the Interim Agreement with a view to concluding
a mutually beneficial BTA consistent with the roadmap agreed in the
Terms of Reference.
