title: Presidential Message on the Daytona 500
---
 
As we await the roar of engines at the starting line of the Daytona 500,
we celebrate the “Great American Race” as an iconic showcase of our
Nation’s ingenuity, competitive spirit, and proud tradition of
excellence.

Throughout our Nation’s 250-year history, Americans have pushed
boundaries, built boldly, and steered our country toward victory.  The
Daytona 500 reflects the hard work and determination that have driven
our Nation forward by transforming ambition into action and innovation
into progress.  America’s drive to win will continue to fuel our Nation
for generations to come because we will never stop building, never stop
dreaming, and never stop striving for greatness. 

While NASCAR brings millions of fans together, they are united by
something greater than who wins the race:  faith in God, love of family,
and pride in our great American Flag.  These great American ideals
extend far beyond the race track—they guide us as one Nation under God. 
As the cheers of patriots echo in honor of this glorious national
tradition, we are reminded of the enduring spirit of freedom that makes
America strong. 

Melania and I send our best wishes to all those gathered at the “World
Center of Racing” for a safe and fun race, and we give thanks to the men
and women of our Armed Forces, whose selflessness and devotion to duty
protect the freedoms we hold dear.  May God bless you, and may He
continue to bless the United States of America.
