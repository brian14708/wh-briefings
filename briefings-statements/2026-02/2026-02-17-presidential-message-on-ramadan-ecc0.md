title: Presidential Message on Ramadan
---
 
Today, I send my greetings and best wishes to all those celebrating
Ramadan.

Every Ramadan stands as a reverent season of spiritual renewal,
reflective meditation, and appreciation for God’s countless blessings. 
This sacred time for many Americans emphasizes prayer and fasting,
strengthens familial and community ties, and affirms our shared values
of compassion, charity, mercy, and humility.

The God-given right to freely worship is a hallmark of our Nation and a
pillar of our prosperity and strength.  For this reason, every day, my
Administration is ensuring that all citizens can practice their faith,
follow their conscience, and worship freely—because freedom of religion
means the freedom to practice your religion proudly and without fear of
persecution.

In this season of grace and goodwill, I offer my prayers for happiness
and fulfillment at home, unity and peace throughout the world, and
blessings in the year to come.
