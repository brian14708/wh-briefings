title: Presidential Message on Ash Wednesday
---
 
Today, the First Lady and I join the millions of Christians in the
United States and around the world in observing Ash Wednesday—a solemn
day of prayer and repentance and the beginning of the Lenten season.

Every Ash Wednesday, Christians receive ashes in the shape of a cross on
their foreheads as a visible reminder of our belonging to Jesus Christ
and our enduring need for penance.  For the next 40 days, in remembrance
of Jesus’ 40 days of temptation in the desert, followers of Christ will
pray, fast, and give alms to deepen their faith, reflect on His
redeeming Passion and death, and prepare their hearts for the coming
Easter miracle.

As the holy season of Lent begins, we are reminded that the practices of
prayer, fasting, and almsgiving have been foundational to our strength
from the earliest days of our national story.  From the Colonists who
turned to prayer and fasting in the heart of the Revolutionary War to
the unmatched compassion and generosity of America’s churches,
hospitals, and charitable institutions, these righteous acts of faith
over the centuries have always stood at the center of our identity, our
heritage, and our way of life.

This Ash Wednesday, as we remember the Passion and ultimate sacrifice of
Christ on the cross, we send our best wishes for a meaningful Lenten
season.  Above all, as we prepare for the triumphant resurrection of
Jesus Christ on Easter Sunday—the greatest miracle in the history of
mankind—we pause to remember those sacred words:  “This is the time of
fulfillment.  The Kingdom of God is at hand.  Repent, and believe in the
Gospel.”
