title: First Lady Melania Trump Announces 2026 White House Easter Egg Roll
---
 
First Lady Melania Trump is pleased to announce initial details for the
148th White House Easter Egg Roll. The Easter Egg Roll will take place
on Monday, April 6, 2026, on the South Lawn of the White House. Families
with children 13 years old and younger are invited to join the
President, First Lady, White House staff, and their families for a day
of festivities.

The White House Easter Egg Roll is a timeless White House tradition,
dating back to 1878 during the Presidency of Rutherford B. Hayes. This
year, the White House Easter Egg Roll will honor America’s 250th
birthday by incorporating patriotic themes throughout the event. The
President and First Lady look forward to continuing this entertaining
tradition and making it a truly memorable experience for all.
