title: "First Lady Melania Trump Secures Another Russian \u2013 Ukrainian Child Reunification"
---
 
United States First Lady Melania Trump successfully united Russian and
Ukrainian children with their families today. For the third time, the
U.S. First Lady has helped facilitate the return of children to their
families after they were separated because of the regional conflict.

The American First Lady stated, “I appreciate that Russia and Ukraine
are dedicated to bringing back the children who have been displaced
because of the circumstances surrounding this conflict. Although all
parties are cooperating and our communications remain robust, I urge
Russia and Ukraine to intensify their efforts to ensure the safe return
of every child to their families and guardians.”

Mrs. Trump and her representative continue to engage in discussions with
both countries.  She added, “Today marks the third reunification since I
have been working strategically with both nations. I have no doubt more
progress will come.”
