title: 'America 250: Presidential Message on the Anniversary of the Battle of the
  Alamo'
---
 
On this day 190 years ago, a small band of patriots defiantly stood
against the Mexican Army at the Battle of the Alamo—one of the most
legendary displays of American courage, resilience, and devotion to
liberty in the history of our country.

Following years of authoritarian abuses and repression under the
tyrannical rule of Mexican President Santa Anna, growing outrage among
Texan settlers erupted into the Texas Revolution in the fall of 1835. 
Seeking to stop the rebellion and strengthen his grip on power, in
February of 1836, Santa Anna marched his troops north to reclaim San
Antonio de Béxar from Texan control.  At the heart of the city stood the
Alamo, a former Mexican mission turned fortress, defended by just over
200 Texan settlers.  On February 23, as Mexican forces closed in, the
Alamo became their last line of defense.

On that fateful day, more than 1,800 Mexican forces unleashed a
bombardment of cannon and musket fire against the defenders of the
Alamo.  With immortal heroes like William Travis of South Carolina,
Kentucky-born Jim Bowie, and Tennessee’s Davy Crockett, settlers from
Texas and across the United States stood firm for an extraordinary 13
days, severely depleting the Mexican army.  Legend holds that these 13
days also bought crucial time for Sam Houston, Commander in Chief of the
Texas Army, to build the rest of the forces that would later win Texas’
independence.

Though the Alamo fell and almost every defender was killed, their
sacrifice was not in vain.  The martyrs of the Alamo ignited a flame
that could not be extinguished, rallying Texan forces under the immortal
battle cry: “Remember the Alamo.”  Just weeks later, that cry thundered
across the fields of San Jacinto, where Texan forces defeated Santa Anna
and the Mexican Army and secured the long-awaited glory of
independence.  A decade later, Texas officially joined the United
States, forever enshrining its legacy of courage and sacrifice into the
American story.

On the 190th anniversary of the Battle of the Alamo, we remember the
legion of heroes who stood up to tyranny and evil in the face of certain
death.  Their story is a testament to the immense cost of securing
liberty and reminds us that history is shaped by those willing to stand
firm when all hope seems lost.  Guided by their spirit, particularly as
we celebrate 250 glorious years of American independence, my
Administration will continue to defend our homeland against foreign
invaders and enemies who seek to destroy our country—and we will never
waver in protecting the sacred rights that make America the greatest
bastion of freedom in the world.
