  \ on Education, Tech, and the Foster Community"
---
 
Sierra Burns, a participant in the Melania Trump Foster Youth to
Independence Program, and Everest Nevraumont, a 11-year-old Alpha School
student, AI-advocate, and TedX speaker, joined First Lady Melania Trump
in the First Lady’s Box for the 2026 State of the Union. Together, they
represent the spirit of Mrs. Trump’s BE BEST Fostering the Future
initiative: advancing opportunity and empowering young Americans through
technology and education.

“Sierra and Everest embody my ongoing mission to uplift America’s foster
youth and expand opportunity for our next generation through education
and technology,” said First Lady Melania Trump. “I am proud to have them
join me at this historic event. Sierra and Everest represent the young
people across America whose personal experience, drive, and
self-motivation reflect the goals of my BE BEST Fostering the Future
initiatives.”

Over the last year, Mrs. Trump led a Presidential Executive Order on
Fostering the Future, secured $30 million for foster youth housing, and
successfully launched both the Presidential Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Challenge, and Fostering the Future Together—a global coalition to
empower children through education and technology. Today, Melania
Trump’s Fostering the Future platform includes top schools across the
nation, such as Vanderbilt University, Villanova University, University
of Texas, University of Alabama, University of Miami, University of
Georgia, the Ohio State University, University of Florida, and several
other notable academic institutions. The First Lady’s recent K-12 AI
Workshop with Zoom included approximately 2,600 schools across America.
