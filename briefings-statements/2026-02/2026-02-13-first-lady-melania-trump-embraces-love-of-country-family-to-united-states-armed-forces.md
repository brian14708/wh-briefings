First Lady Melania Trump shared a nostalgia-filled message about the
role love letters have played in America’s military community in her
remarks to military families and service members at Pope Army Airfield
and Fort Bragg in North Carolina.  

Mrs. Trump said, “Love letters have symbolized the union of patriotism
and family devotion among our soldiers for 250 years. The harmony of
love of country and love of family is what makes us uniquely American.
It is this very balance which strengthens our military and builds our
communities.”

President Trump and the First Lady joined the military and their
families at Fort Bragg and Pope Army Airfield the day before Valentine’s
Day. The First Lady added, “The President and I are grateful to be with
you—to honor the passion you share through unmatched bravery,
resilience, and service to our great Nation.”

President Trump and the First Lady saluted military families and the
heroic members of the United States Army Special Forces who carried out
the successful mission in Venezuela to bring Nicolas Maduro to justice.
First Lady Melania Trump has long been an ardent supporter of America’s
military.

**On Love of Country and Love of Family**

Good afternoon and thank you for your warm welcome.

The President and I are grateful to be with you—to honor the passion you
share through unmatched bravery, resilience, and service to our great
Nation.

Thank you for defending our freedom.  

It is with immense pleasure for me to address the Fort Bragg and Pope
Army Airfield community today. To our great armed forces of the United
States stationed all over the world, I have a nostalgia-filled message:
Happy Valentine’s Day!

Love letters have symbolized the union of patriotism and family devotion
among our soldiers for 250 years. The harmony of love of country and
love of family is what makes us uniquely American. It is this very
balance which strengthens our military and builds our communities.

And now, it is my distinct honor to introduce your
Commander-in-Chief—our leader who maintains a mission of peace through
strength—President Donald J. Trump.
