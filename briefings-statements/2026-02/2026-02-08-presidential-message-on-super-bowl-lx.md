title: Presidential Message on Super Bowl LX
---
 
This Super Bowl Sunday, I send my best wishes to the athletes and
coaches of the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks as they
take the field and to the millions of Americans gathering across the
country to watch these two storied franchises compete on one of the
grandest and most legendary stages in all of sports.

As our country proudly marks 250 glorious years of American
independence, tonight’s game carries special meaning.  In many ways, the
story of our country’s most popular sport mirrors our own American
journey.  As our Nation industrialized in the early twentieth century,
football emerged in working communities and reflected the same values of
grit, tenacity, and discipline that defined the American worker.  As our
country’s economy expanded, the game grew along with our Nation’s
prosperity.  And as advances in technology connected Americans from
coast to coast, football entered households everywhere, turning Sundays
into traditions shared across generations.

Before kickoff this evening, during the playing of our National Anthem,
we remember the patriots who secured our independence 250 years ago
through courage, sacrifice, and an unwavering belief in the cause of
liberty.  We pause to honor the brave men and women of our Armed Forces
who carry that legacy forward, defending and preserving our way of life
throughout history and into the future.  Their service makes possible
the freedoms we hold dear, including the privilege to gather with family
and friends on a Sunday night to watch football and the blessing to live
in the strongest and freest Nation the world has ever known.

Tonight’s game is more than just a championship—it’s a uniquely American
tradition that reflects the distinct passion and perseverance of our
country.  On the field, players and coaches bring years of hard work,
preparation, and commitment to football’s biggest night.  Across the
country, millions of fans come together to cheer on their teams and
share in a moment of history.  Today, every American is a football fan.

Melania and I congratulate both teams on earning their place in Super
Bowl LX, and we wish them luck as they compete for the National Football
League’s iconic Vince Lombardi Trophy.  May tonight’s game reflect the
best of football and the enduring triumph of the American spirit—and may
the best team win!
