title: 'America 250: Presidential Message on the Birthday of Thomas Edison'
---
 
Today, we celebrate our Nation’s most prolific inventor and a man who
never stopped pushing the spirit of American innovation:  the legendary
Thomas Edison.  On what would have been his 179th birthday, we honor his
life, determination, and extraordinary legacy of American
entrepreneurship and ingenuity and look to his example as we continue
building the Golden Age of America.

Born into humble means in Ohio and raised in Michigan, Thomas Edison’s
life represents the resilience and determination that it takes to build
the American Dream.  Edison had virtually no formal education and was
afflicted with deafness at a young age.  Despite these challenges, he
was a voracious reader who constantly tinkered with mechanics,
electricity, and scientific experiments.  In his early twenties, he
received his first patent for an electrical recorder and soon devoted
himself entirely to invention and innovation.  He would ultimately go on
to develop more than 1,000 patents and design some of the greatest
inventions of his time, including the phonograph, the motion picture
camera, the alkaline storage battery, and most famously, the
incandescent light bulb.  Through constant trial and error, his
inventions bettered the lives of everyday Americans and people all
around the world.

My Administration is proudly carrying Thomas Edison’s legacy forward
into the 21st century, ushering in a new Golden Age of American
innovation and ingenuity.  Since returning to office, we have empowered
the next generation of innovators by deregulating industries and
enacting historic tax cuts for small businesses. And I will always
remain committed to ensuring America retains our competitive edge across
every sphere.

As we celebrate Thomas Edison’s timeless contributions to our way of
life, we are reminded that technological advancement is achieved through
hard work, tenacity, and an unwavering commitment to forging a great
American future.  On his birthday, I call on every American to dare to
dream big, achieve the impossible, and embrace the opportunity to be an
outsider because, like Thomas Edison, it is the outsiders who change the
world.

Happy birthday, Thomas Edison!
