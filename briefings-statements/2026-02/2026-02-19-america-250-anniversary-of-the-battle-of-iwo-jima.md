title: 'America 250: Anniversary of the Battle of Iwo Jima'
---
 
Today, our Nation commemorates the 81st anniversary of the Battle of Iwo
Jima—a monumental struggle that advanced the cause of victory in the
Pacific Theater during the Second World War.

Under a clear morning sky on February 19, 1945, the United States
Marines prepared to storm the beaches of Iwo Jima, a remote but heavily
fortified island 750 miles from Tokyo.  For years, American forces had
been locked in a great island-by-island campaign across the Pacific
against imperial Japan.  Iwo Jima’s capture promised a vital foothold
for Allied operations and a critical step toward the enemy’s homeland.

When the first Marines charged ashore, they came under fire from
Japanese defenders hidden in bunkers and tunnels carved into the
island’s rocky terrain.  Determined to take the island, Marines pressed
deeper inland over 5 punishing weeks, backed by the thunder of American
Naval firepower and fighting yard by yard through smoke, ash, and the
fire of guns amid constant shelling and ferocious infantry charges.

As the brutal fight raged on, individual acts of unmatched courage began
to define the battle.  Among the countless heroes was the legendary
Corporal Hershel “Woody” Williams.  Tasked with destroying deeply
entrenched enemy positions, Woody advanced time and again under intense
gunfire, armed with nothing but a flamethrower.  For more than 4 hours,
he singlehandedly cleared a path for American tanks after the rest of
his comrades fell—retreating from the front line five times to resupply
before returning and successfully completing his mission.  Woody’s
extraordinary valor earned him the Medal of Honor.  In total, 27 Medals
of Honor were awarded for actions at Iwo Jima, the most of any single
battle in World War II.

After 36 days of brutal combat, Japanese resistance ended, securing Iwo
Jima’s place among the most consequential and hard-fought battles in
American history.  Early in the campaign, the raising of the Stars and
Stripes atop Iwo Jima’s highest peak, Mount Suribachi, became an
enduring image—an unmistakable symbol of American resolve, sacrifice,
and victory in the Pacific.

Of the 70,000 servicemen who fought at Iwo Jima, nearly 7,000 of
America’s finest Marines gave their lives on the island in defense of
our freedom—offering the full measure of their devotion to the Republic
they served until their very last breath.  As we commemorate the Battle
of Iwo Jima and as we celebrate 250 years of American independence, we
remember the enormous sacrifices of the Greatest Generation, and we
renew our solemn promise to honor their legacy by defending the
liberties they secured.
