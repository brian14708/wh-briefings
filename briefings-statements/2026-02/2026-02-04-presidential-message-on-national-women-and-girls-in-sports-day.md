title: Presidential Message on National Women and Girls in Sports Day
---
 
From youth leagues and high school varsity to the Olympic Games and the
heights of professional sports, for decades, women and girls have
exemplified the very best of American athletics.  This National Women
and Girls in Sports Day, we celebrate every female athlete for their
devotion to excellence and for their incredible contributions to
America’s character, culture, and unwavering competitive spirit.

Emboldened by the promise of the American Dream, through hard work,
dedication, and resilience, every citizen can fulfill their God-given
potential on any field, court, or track.  More than half a century ago,
Title IX of the Education Amendments Act enshrined this promise into
federal law, marking a pivotal moment for equal opportunity for women
and girls.  Since then, the number of female athletes has grown
remarkably—and my Administration remains committed to expanding
opportunities for women and girls to compete, grow, and succeed at every
level.

Since I took office as the 47th President of the United States, America
has once again proudly championed youth athletics, which instills in our
Nation’s girls the skills they need to grow stronger, develop healthy
habits, and overcome challenges—not only as athletes but as young
citizens.  Last year, I proudly signed multiple Executive Orders to
uphold Title IX, end the unfair participation of men in women’s sports,
and preserve and expand scholarships for collegiate women’s sports.  My
Administration’s policy is simple:  Any program that rejects biological
reality and deprives women of fair and safe athletic opportunities will
not receive federal funds.  Under my leadership, every woman’s safety,
dignity, and work ethic will always be protected.

Female athletes go beyond breaking records or winning championships—they
redefine what is possible, elevate their sports, and inspire the next
generation of girls to achieve greatness.  Today and every day, we
recommit to preserving the timeless values that sports provide and to
building a future where every young girl, collegiate athlete, and
professional competitor pushes further, reaches higher, and dreams
bigger.
