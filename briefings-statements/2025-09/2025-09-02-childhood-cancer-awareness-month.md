title: Childhood Cancer Awareness Month
---
 
This Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, our Nation stands with the
thousands of families who face the tremendous challenges of childhood
cancer.  We acknowledge their fortitude, faith, and unbreakable
spirit—and we solemnly honor the memories of the precious young souls
taken far too soon.

Tragically, over the last 50 years, rates of child cancer have
skyrocketed by more than 40 percent.  To reverse these devastating
trends, my Administration’s Make America Healthy Again initiative is
working towards our goal of rooting out all chronic illnesses and health
problems in children—including cancer—by getting toxins out of our
environment, poisons out of our food supply, and ensuring our children
are healthy and strong.

To further deliver hope to every child battling cancer, my
Administration remains steadfast in our mission to finding a cure for
these vicious diseases and advancing new, less invasive, and more
effective treatments for all forms of cancer.  We are investing in
preventative care and stopping cancer before it can take root by
encouraging healthy eating, identifying leading causes of childhood
cancer, and expanding access to cutting-edge therapies.

At the same time, we are committed to easing the financial burden for
families whose children face cancer.  No parent should have to choose
between paying for treatment and keeping a roof over their head.  That
is why we are requiring hospitals and insurers to disclose actual
prices—not estimates—and making drug and treatment costs comparable
across providers, creating a more affordable and high-quality healthcare
system.

This September, we vow to continue our work to deliver our youngest
warriors the support they need to achieve ultimate victory over
cancer—and to give every child the opportunity to live the great
American life they deserve.
