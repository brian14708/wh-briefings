title: Presidential Message on Rosh Hashanah
---
 
I send my warmest greetings to every American celebrating Rosh
Hashanah—the start of the new year for the Jewish faith and a holy time
of prayer, community, and spiritual reflection.

During this sacred time, Jewish believers begin the Ten Days of
Repentance, culminating in Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the year in
Judaism.  As the Jewish community gathers for this special time of
spiritual renewal, my Administration recommits to upholding religious
liberty and ending faith-based persecution—including the scourge of
anti-Semitism.  Above all, we pledge to build a future of peace—and to
recognize the dignity imprinted on every human soul.

I offer my best wishes and heartfelt prayers for a season of reflection
and renewal.  Have a blessed Rosh Hashanah!
