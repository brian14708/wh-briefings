title: Presidential Message on the 78th Birthday of the United States Air Force
---
 
Since 1947, the men and women of the United States Air Force have been
the fearless guardians of our skies, heroically maintaining order,
stability, and peace among the clouds and across our horizons.  On the
78th birthday of the United States Air Force, we celebrate this storied
branch’s enduring legacy as the most elite airpower force in the history
of the world—and we commend the grit, dedication, and selfless service
of the thousands of Airmen who live by the timeless motto: “Aim High…
Fly-Fight-Win.”

Over the decades, the Air Force has built a rich and proud heritage of
air dominance, technical prowess, tactical capability, and unrivaled
lethality.  Every day, the warriors of the United States Air Force serve
around the globe—whether engaged in combat operations, natural disaster
response, nuclear deterrence, or homeland defense—keeping America safe,
strong, and free.

As Commander-in-Chief, I am advancing an Air Force that promotes peace
through strength and ensures America’s unmatched dominance in the
skies.  In June, the world witnessed an unprecedented demonstration of
firepower, precision, and professionalism when Air Force pilots and crew
members obliterated Iran’s nuclear capabilities in a highly complex and
perfectly executed mission.  The overwhelming success of Operation
Midnight Hammer proved that our Air Force can complete any mission,
defeat any foe, and inflict absolute devastation on our enemies from the
sky—anywhere in the world and at the time of our choosing. 

Operation Midnight Hammer was a testament to training, preparation,
experience, and exceptional teamwork across the entire Air Force.  The
brave Airmen tasked with this mission, and the Service members who
supported their flights, made our Nation proud and the world a safer
place.  They represent the best of America—and reflect the skill,
bravery, loyalty, and unflinching resolve of every Airman who swears the
oath.

As we commemorate 78 years of the United States Air Force, Melania joins
me in celebrating the incredible American patriots in the world’s finest
air force—and the families who share the blessings and sacrifices of
military service.
