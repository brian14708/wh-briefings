title: First Lady Melania Trump Concludes Second Day of U.K. State Visit with Focus
  on Children, Families, and Community
---
 
First Lady Melania Trump participated in a series of events
today alongside members of the Royal Family and Lady Starmer as part of
the State Visit to the United Kingdom. The day’s program highlighted
creativity, community, and the well-being of children—central themes of
the First Lady’s BE BEST initiative.

In Windsor, The First Lady joined Her Majesty Queen Camilla for a tour
of Queen Mary’s Dolls’ House and the Royal Library at Windsor Castle.
Together, they viewed historic works from the Royal Collection before
meeting schoolchildren who were creating and illustrating their own
miniature books. The First Lady enjoyed conversing with the children as
they worked on their art projects. Each child received a gift bag that
included White House honey with a commemorative tag and a challenge coin
from the First Lady.

At Frogmore House & Gardens, The First Lady met with Her Royal Highness
The Princess of Wales and U.K. Chief Scout Dwayne Fields for an outdoor
program with the Squirrel Scouts. The children took part in leaf
stamping and bug house activities before receiving their “Go Wild”
Badges at a ceremony attended by the First Lady and the Princess. The
First Lady and the children worked together creatively and
joyfully. Each Scout was presented with a gift bag including White House
honey, a challenge coin, and a red, white, and blue Scouting America
neckerchief. Before departing, the Scouts shared a touching note for the
First Lady, thanking her for the visit and wishing her a safe flight
back to the United States.

In the afternoon, The First Lady traveled to Chequers Court for a
private lunch with Lady Starmer. Following lunch, they observed a
display by the “Red Devils,” an elite unit of the British Army Parachute
Regiment.

The First Lady later attended President Trump’s Joint Press Conference
with Prime Minister Starmer before departing the United Kingdom.
