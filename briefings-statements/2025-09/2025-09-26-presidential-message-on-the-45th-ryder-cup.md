title: Presidential Message on the 45th Ryder Cup
---
 
Today, I look forward to joining thousands of fans on Long Island, New
York, to root for Team USA as we begin our epic duel with Team Europe
for the 45th Ryder Cup.

As one of the greatest rivalries in the history of sports, the Ryder Cup
is golf’s ultimate team event.  Golf instills self-reliance and personal
accountability on and off the course.  Championship golf requires
tremendous skill, determination, and focus—but at the Ryder Cup, it is
patriotism, teamwork, and camaraderie that inspire the players to
greatness.  From the fiery chants of “U-S-A” to the giants of the game
leading each team, the Ryder Cup is one of the most unique scenes in
sports—and this year’s matches will be truly legendary.

Our Nation is especially pleased to host Team Europe at the iconic
Bethpage Black Course.  As one of the most challenging and prestigious
public courses in our country, Bethpage is a fitting venue for golf’s
preeminent national event.  In America, all are welcome to play, but
only the best will be hailed as champions.

As we prepare to celebrate 250 glorious years of American independence,
the Ryder Cup also reminds us of our special relationship with the
United Kingdom and our shared cultural heritage with the continent of
Europe.  The sportsmanship and good-hearted competition that will be on
display throughout this weekend serve as a shining example to the world
that our countries stand united in the common causes of freedom,
excellence, and the pursuit of greatness.

As the matches begin, Melania and I congratulate the PGA of America for
organizing such a tremendous event, and we send our best wishes to our
team captain, Keegan Bradley, and the 12 champions representing our
great Nation.

We look forward to a wonderful weekend of golf.  Go USA!
