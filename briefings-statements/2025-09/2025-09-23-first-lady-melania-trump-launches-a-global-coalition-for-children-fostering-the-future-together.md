title: First Lady Melania Trump Launches a Global Coalition for Children Fostering
  the Future Together
---
 
First Lady Melania Trump launched Fostering the Future Together—a global
coalition of nations committed to enhancing the well-being of children
through the promotion of education, innovation, and technology.

The U.S. First Lady shared Fostering the Future Together’s mission; “to
ensure that every child can flourish in the digital era.” She affirmed,
“Innovation is wonderful. Our nations benefit from advancements in
technology—saving lives, expanding access to knowledge, connecting
people, and of course, safety.”

The First Lady reinforced her mission to prioritize the development of
children at the intersection of technology and education. She artfully
stated, “Great minds have turned marbles into microchips, paper
airplanes into drones, and kites into satellites.”

The First Lady’s remarks were given during the 80th session of the UN
General Assembly, “Remember, our next generation will use tech to
revolutionize how we live, travel, design, and connect.”

Fostering the Future Together’s objectives during this initial phase
include:

-   Prioritization of personal development of children.
-   Unification of efforts surrounding children, technology, and
    education.
-   Collaboration with the private sector to provide access to
    innovative education technology, including artificial intelligence,
    robotics, and blockchain.
-   Exchange of solutions encompassing advantages and risks of
    artificial intelligence.

The members of Fostering the Future Together will include the spouses—or
equivalent representatives—of heads of government. Fostering the Future
Together will be implemented by participating members at the local
level, within their respective countries. Mrs. Trump will host Fostering
the Future Together’s inaugural meeting at the White House during the
first quarter of 2026.
