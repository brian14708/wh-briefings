title: National Hunting and Fishing Day
---
 
Every day, our Nation’s hunters and fishers embody the timeless American
values of freedom, self-reliance, and stewardship.  From the plains of
Texas and the mountains of Montana to the wilderness of Alaska and the
majestic peaks of the Rocky Mountains, for nearly 250 years, our hunters
and fishers have traversed our treasured lands and carried forth a
storied legacy of recreation, conservation, and competition.  This
National Hunting and Fishing Day, we celebrate generations of American
hunters, anglers, and sportsmen who have kept these incredible
traditions alive.

As President, I remain committed to protecting our Nation’s natural
treasures and expanding access for all Americans.  In my first term, I
signed the Great American Outdoors Act, the most significant
conservation achievement since Theodore Roosevelt’s presidency,
designated 1.3 million new acres of wilderness, added 1,645 miles of new
trails to the National Recreational Trails System, and expanded hunting
and fishing opportunities across more than 2.3 million acres of land.   

Building on these massive successes from my first term, this year, I
signed an Executive Order establishing the Make America Beautiful Again
Commission.  Through the Commission, my Administration is prioritizing
the expansion of recreational access to public lands and waters,
ensuring that all Americans can enjoy the beauty of the outdoors.  We
are also incentivizing conservation efforts, promoting active forest
management, advancing proper stewardship of our country’s public lands,
and maintaining high standards to ensure that Americans have the
cleanest air and drinking water in the world.

This month, we recognize the outdoorsmen who represent the very best of
the American spirit.  We pledge to ensure that our great Nation’s
bountiful lands and waters, unrivaled natural beauty, and proud emblems
of American history remain magnificent for our children and
grandchildren—all while ensuring economic prosperity for our Nation and
every future generation of American patriots.
