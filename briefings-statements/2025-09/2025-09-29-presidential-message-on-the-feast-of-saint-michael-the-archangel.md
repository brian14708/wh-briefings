title: Presidential Message on the Feast of Saint Michael the Archangel
---
 
Today, I salute the millions of Christian believers in the United States
and around the world observing the Feast of Saint Michael the Archangel.

According to sacred Scripture, when the Devil rebelled against God in
Heaven, Saint Michael and his legion of angels cast Satan down to
Earth—triumphantly reasserting God’s sovereignty over all creation.  For
2,000 years, Christians have looked to Saint Michael the Archangel for
protection, strength, and courage in times of conflict, distress, and
doubt.

In 1886, nearly 140 years ago, Pope Leo XIII, leader of the Roman
Catholic Church, fearing for the future of the western world, introduced
the legendary Prayer to Saint Michael, which is still recited to this
day in churches and homes all across our Nation and throughout the
world:

*Saint Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle.  Be our defense
against the wickedness and snares of the Devil.  May God rebuke him, we
humbly pray, and do thou, O Prince of the heavenly hosts, by the power
of God, cast into hell Satan, and all the evil spirits, who prowl about
the world seeking the ruin of souls.  Amen.*
