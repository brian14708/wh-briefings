title: Presidential Message on National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month
---
 
Every day, drug and alcohol addiction shatters families, destabilizes
neighborhoods, derails careers, and steals the lives of countless
Americans.  This National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month, my
Administration reaffirms its commitment to standing alongside every
person struggling with the heavy burdens of addiction—and to supporting
their path to total and complete recovery with compassion, clarity, and
resolve.

Tragically, tens of millions of Americans live with substance abuse
disorders—a crisis that reaches every community, crosses every
generation, and leaves no corner of our Nation untouched.  Though
addiction is a disease, recovery is achievable.  With love,
determination, and support, countless citizens across our Nation are
breaking free from their addictions and building new and glorious
futures.  For this reason, my Administration is committed to making it
easier for victims of substance abuse to totally and fully recover.

To end the scourge of drug and alcohol abuse, we are shutting down the
deadly pipeline of fentanyl and other illicit drugs at our borders.  We
are investing $44 billion into prevention, treatment, and recovery—and
we are strengthening proven programs like the High Intensity Drug
Trafficking Areas Program and the Drug-Free Communities Program.  These
efforts are empowering local leaders to confront these crises directly,
efficiently, and effectively.

My Administration is also working tirelessly to end the plague of
addiction before it begins.  Every day, we are expanding education to
prevent drug use, especially among children.  We are widening access to
treatment so recovery can start without delay.  We are dismantling
cartels and lethal drug networks, inflicting the full force of American
justice on drug traffickers, and encouraging healthy living through our
historic Make America Healthy Again Commission.

During National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month, we renew our
resolve to build a future where every American has the chance to live
free from addiction—and to lead long, healthy, happy, hopeful, and
vigorous American lives.
