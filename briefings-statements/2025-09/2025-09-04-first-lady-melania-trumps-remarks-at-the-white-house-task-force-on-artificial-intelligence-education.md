**First Lady Melania Trump’s Remarks (As Prepared for Delivery)**

We are living in a Moment of Wonder.

Thank you for joining me to address this important issue, Secretaries
Wright, McMahon, Rollins, and Chavez-DeRemer. It’s wonderful to be here
today alongside private sectors leaders like Mr. Pichai, Mr. Krishna,
Mr. Wilson and the many other visionaries from across industry.

We are living in a moment of wonder, and it is our responsibility to
prepare America’s children.

Cars now steer themselves through our cities, robots hold steady hands
in the operating room, and drones are redefining the future of war.
Inventions of first-generation humanoids, factory automation, and
autonomous vehicles have surged from private sector investment.  Every
one of these advancements is powered by AI.

The robots are here. Our future is no longer science fiction.

Data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis shows that AI innovation is
clearly boosting America’s GDP growth. Surely, this is not a trend, for
AI will serve as the underpinning of every business sector in our
nation, including education, life sciences, finance, and design.

In fact, I predict AI will represent the single largest growth category
in our nation during this administration—and I won’t be surprised if AI
becomes known as the greatest engine of progress in the history of the
United States of America.

But, as leaders and parents we must manage AI’s growth responsibly.
During this primitive stage, it is our duty to treat AI as we would our
own children—empowering, but with watchful guidance.

Today, this room is filled with the brightest minds of our time.  As
such, I challenge you to focus on three strategic priorities of AI’s
ecosystem so America can lead in shaping a new, magnificent world:
Infrastructure & Energy, National Security, and of course—Talent.

We must ensure America’s talent, our workforce, is prepared to sustain
AI’s progress, and the Presidential AI Challenge is our first major step
to galvanize America’s parents, educators, and students with this
mission.

English is the new “coding language” for many, and with it, creativity
will flow from every corner of America, sparking new industries,
careers, and jobs. By supporting the Presidential AI Challenge, you are
investing in our youth—America’s next era builders. I would be remiss if
I didn’t thank our very determined Director of the Office of Science and
Technology Policy, Mr. Michael Kratsios. Michael’s vision will have a
profound effect on how emerging technology shapes our future.
