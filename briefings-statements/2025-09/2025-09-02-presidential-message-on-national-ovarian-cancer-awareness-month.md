title: Presidential Message on National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month
---
 
During National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, we proudly stand
alongside every heroic American mother, grandmother, sister, and
daughter who is courageously battling ovarian cancer.  We solemnly
remember the cherished loved ones whose lives were tragically cut short
by this devastating disease.  Above all, we recommit to eradicating all
forms of cancer, and to building a healthier, stronger, and more
vigorous American future.

My Administration remains determined to ensuring that future generations
live free from all forms of cancer.  For this reason, I established the
Make America Healthy Again commission, tasked with addressing the root
causes of diseases like ovarian cancer.  Additionally, we have taken
decisive action to ensure transparency in healthcare pricing, lower the
cost of prescription drugs, expand access to telehealth, and give
terminally ill patients the right to try experimental drugs that could
save their lives—ensuring that women who are battling ovarian cancer
have the vital support and resources they need to successfully battle
and conquer their disease.

This month, our Nation unites in prayer and resolves to defeat ovarian
cancer—and to bring hope, healing, and comfort to every patient and
family suffering from it.  Together, with the incredible work of
scientists, researchers, and medical professionals, we will forge a
future free from the ravages of cancer, and we will make America
healthier and greater than ever before.
