title: Presidential Message on National Farm Safety and Health Week
---
 
For nearly 250 years, our Nation has been sustained by the hard work,
dedication, and vital contributions of our incredible farmers, ranchers,
and foresters.  This National Farm Safety and Health Week, we pledge to
keep our farming communities safe, healthy, and prosperous—and we renew
our resolve to keep our glorious agricultural heritage alive and
flourishing for generations to come.

Agriculture is among the most demanding and hazardous industries in the
United States.  From managing powerful equipment to preparing for
unpredictable and extreme weather, farmers face unique challenges each
and every day.  For this reason, we must continue to prioritize their
safety and health.  I encourage all who work in the agricultural
industry to renew their commitment to adopting proven safety protocols
and prioritizing the wellbeing of themselves and those around them.

As we observe National Farm Safety and Health Week, we reaffirm our
commitment to the countless men and women who feed our families, nourish
our communities, and sustain our Nation.
