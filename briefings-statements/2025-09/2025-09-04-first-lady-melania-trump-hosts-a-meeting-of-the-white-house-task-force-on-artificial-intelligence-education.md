title: First Lady Melania Trump Hosts a Meeting of the White House Task Force on Artificial
  Intelligence Education
---
 
First Lady Melania Trump will host a meeting of the White House Task
Force on Artificial Intelligence (AI) Education today alongside members
of the Task Force and private sector leaders from American industry.

“I predict AI will represent the single largest growth category in our
nation during the Trump Administration—and I won’t be surprised if AI
becomes known as the greatest engine of progress in the history of the
United States of America. But, as leaders and parents we must manage
AI’s growth responsibly. During this primitive stage, it is our duty to
treat AI as we would our own children—empowering, but with watchful
guidance. We are living in a moment of wonder, and it is our
responsibility to prepare America’s children,” **said First Lady Melania
Trump**.

**Background:**

This will be the second meeting of the White House Task Force on
Artificial Intelligence Education since President Donald J. Trump signed
an Executive Order on Advancing Artificial Intelligence Education for
American Youth on April 23, 2025.

This meeting, hosted by First Lady Melania Trump, will feature remarks
by Mrs. Trump, Task Force members, and private sector leaders from the
more than 135+ pledges made to support AI education across America.

Mrs. Trump has been a champion of online protection of children and
youth through her BE BEST initiative, which galvanized bipartisan
support for the [*TAKE IT DOWN
Act*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/05/icymi-president-trump-signs-take-it-down-act-into-law/#:~:text=Trump%20signed%20the%20TAKE%20IT,Sen.),
which was signed into law by President Trump on May 19, 2025.

Mrs. Trump also made news by using AI technology for the audiobook of
her New York Times bestselling book, “Melania.” On Tuesday, August 26,
the First Lady [launched](https://orise.orau.gov/ai-challenge/) a
nationwide Presidential Artificial Intelligence Challenge inviting every
student and educator (K-12) to “unleash their imagination and showcase
the spirit of American innovation” by visiting [AI.Gov](/www.ai.gov/%3c)
to sign up.
