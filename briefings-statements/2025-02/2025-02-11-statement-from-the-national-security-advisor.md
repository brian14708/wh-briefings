title: Statement from the National Security Advisor

“Today, President Donald J. Trump and his Special Envoy Steve Witkoff
are able to announce that Mr. Witkoff is leaving Russian airspace with
Marc Fogel, an American who was detained by Russia. President Trump,
Steve Witkoff and the President’s advisors negotiated an exchange that
serves as a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are
moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in
Ukraine. Since President Trump’s swearing-in, he has successfully
secured the release of Americans detained around the world, and
President Trump will continue until all Americans being held are
returned to the United States. By tonight, Marc Fogel will be on
American soil and reunited with his family and loved ones thanks to
President Trump’s leadership.”

  – National Security Advisor Mike Waltz
