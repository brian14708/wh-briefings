“Today’s jobs report reveals the Biden economy was far worse than anyone
thought, and underscores the necessity of President Trump’s pro-growth
policies. During his first weeks in office, President Trump declared a
national energy emergency to Make America Energy Dominant Again, pledged
to cut 10 regulations for every new regulatory action, and outlined a
plan to deliver the largest tax cut in history for hardworking
Americans. President Trump is delivering on his promise to restore our
broken economy, revive small business optimism, create jobs, and ignite
a new Golden Age for America.”
