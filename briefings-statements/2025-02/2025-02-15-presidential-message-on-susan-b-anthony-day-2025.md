title: Presidential Message on Susan B. Anthony Day, 2025
---
 
Today, we celebrate the birthday of Susan B. Anthony, a warrior for
women and hero of Equality, Justice, and the Constitutional rule of law.

For her entire life, Susan B. Anthony was fiercely devoted to the
principle that every American, regardless of race or sex, is born with
the God-given right to enjoy the blessings of Life, Liberty, and the
pursuit of Happiness. Years later, her fearless crusade for Equality
culminated in the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment of the
Constitution, which blocked states from denying citizens the right to
vote on the basis of sex. Throughout her storied life, she also emerged
as a champion of the abolitionist movement and a tireless advocate for
the sanctity of life.

As President, I have already taken historic action to advance the sacred
causes that Susan B. Anthony cherished so deeply. I was honored to sign
an Executive Order safeguarding women’s sports—ensuring the survival of
free and competitive spaces for female athletes. Additionally, I was
proud to order the end of taxpayer-funded abortion—a big win for the
most vulnerable among us.

While my Administration continues to honor the legacy of Susan B.
Anthony and promote our shared cause of Liberty and Justice for all, I
also want to thank our Nation’s First Lady, Melania Trump, for
previously hosting a White House celebration with America’s youth to
honor the centennial anniversary of the ratification of the Nineteenth
Amendment. I know she looks forward to continuing to help empower and
support girls and women in the United States and around the globe.

Today, Melania joins me in paying tribute to Susan B. Anthony’s
perseverance, leadership, and monumental achievements. Let us continue
her life’s work of creating a culture that celebrates the enduring
triumph of Freedom, the dignity of life, and the full glory of the
American promise.
