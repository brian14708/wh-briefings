---
 
First Lady Melania Trump announced that the White House will officially
open for public tours on Tuesday, February 25, 2025.

“The President and I are excited to reopen the White House to those
interested in the extraordinary story of this iconic and beautiful
landmark. There is much to learn about the American Presidency, the
First Families who have lived here, and our Nation’s rich history from a
firsthand experience at the White House. This opportunity is unique
among nations around the globe—a tradition we are honored to continue
for the hundreds of thousands of visitors who come each year,” said
First Lady Melania Trump.

Public tours must be requested through Members of Congress, and requests
may be submitted up to three months in advance. Tours are scheduled on a
first-come-first-served basis.

Tours are self-guided, typically last 45 minutes, and will generally be
available from 7:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. Tuesday through Thursday as well
as 7:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Friday through Saturday (excluding Federal
holidays or unless otherwise noted). When possible, public tour hours
will be extended based on the official White House schedule. For more
