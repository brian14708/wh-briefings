title: Presidential Message on Super Bowl LIX
---
 
I look forward to joining the fans in New Orleans for Super Bowl LIX to
cheer on two great teams—the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia
Eagles—as they battle for the National Football League’s Vince Lombardi
Trophy.  
   
The coaches, players, and team staff on the field tonight represent the
best of the best in professional football, but they also embody the best
of the American Dream.  Their hard work, dedication, and tenacity is
admirable, and their individual journeys are as inspiring as the drive
and determination that has led them to this extraordinary moment.  They
also represent the hopes and dreams of our Nation’s young athletes as we
restore safety and fairness in sports and equal opportunities among
their teams.  
   
Football is America’s most popular sport—for good reason—it fosters a
sense of national unity, bringing families, friends, and fans together
and strengthening communities.  This annual tradition transcends our
differences and personifies our shared patriotic values of family,
faith, and freedom heroically defended by our military service members,
law enforcement officers, and first responders.  We value their devotion
to protecting our great Nation and salute their selfless service.  
   
This year, the Super Bowl returns to the Caesars Superdome for a record
setting 8th time.  While thousands of fans from across our Nation gather
in New Orleans to cheer on their favorite team, we remember that 14
families will be missing a loved one who was tragically murdered during
a senseless terrorist attack while celebrating the New Year on Bourbon
Street.  Our thoughts are also with the 35 individuals injured during
the attack whose lives were changed forever that fateful night, and our
prayers will remain with them for continued strength, comfort, and
healing.   
   
Tonight, we look forward to a terrific game and the crowning of the
Super Bowl Champions.  Melania joins me in sending our best wishes for a
great Super Bowl Sunday.  May the best team win, and may God bless you,
your family, and the United States of America.
