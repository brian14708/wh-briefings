Yesterday, President Donald J. Trump and His Majesty King Abdullah II of
Jordan held a warm and productive working meeting at the White House.
King Abdullah congratulated President Trump on his very successful first
weeks in office, and thanked the President for his leadership in
securing the release of hostages from Gaza and a temporary pause in
hostilities. The President affirmed the strength of relations between
the United States and Jordan, and thanked His Majesty for the Kingdom’s
longstanding commitment to promoting and advancing regional peace.

President Trump and King Abdullah also discussed the situation in Gaza.
The President reiterated that Hamas must release all hostages, including
all Americans, by Saturday, and asked for the King’s assistance in
ensuring that Hamas, as well as the leaders of the region, understand
the severity of the situation.

The two leaders also discussed the President’s goal of ensuring that
Gaza is rebuilt beautifully after the conflict ends, and providing
options for the people of Gaza that allow them to live in security and
dignity, and free of Hamas’s tyranny.
