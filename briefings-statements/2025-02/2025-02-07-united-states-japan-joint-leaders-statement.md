President Donald J. Trump and Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru held their
first official meeting today in Washington, D.C., where they affirmed
their determination to pursue a new golden age for U.S.-Japan relations
that upholds a free and open Indo-Pacific and brings peace and
prosperity to a violent and disorderly world.   
   
**<u>U.S.-Japan Cooperation for Peace</u>**  
 The two leaders expressed their shared desire for bilateral security
and defense cooperation under the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual
Cooperation and Security to grow stronger than ever, and emphasized that
the U.S.-Japan Alliance remains the cornerstone of peace, security and
prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. Japan reiterated its
unwavering commitment to fundamentally reinforce its own defense
capabilities, which the United States welcomed.  
   
The United States underscored its unwavering commitment to the defense
of Japan, using its full range of capabilities, including nuclear
capabilities. The two leaders reaffirmed that Article V of the
U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security applies to the
Senkaku Islands, and reiterated their strong opposition to any action
that seeks to undermine Japan’s longstanding and peaceful administration
of the Senkaku Islands.  
   
In line with the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security
and the U.S.-Japan Guidelines for Defense Cooperation, Japan reaffirmed
its role in maintaining peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region by
seamlessly responding to any situation from peacetime to contingencies.
This has been further enabled by Japan’s 2015 Legislation for Peace and
Security, which enhances U.S.-Japan Alliance deterrence and response
capabilities.  
   
In order to address an increasingly severe and complex security
environment, the two leaders confirmed that they intend to further
strengthen U.S.-Japan deterrence and response capabilities by enhancing
defense and security cooperation, including by upgrading the respective
command and control frameworks of U.S. and Japanese forces, increasing
bilateral presence in Japan’s Southwest Islands, increasing readiness
through more realistic training and exercises, further enhancing U.S.
extended deterrence, and promoting defense equipment and technology
cooperation, including co-production, co-development, and co-sustainment
that bolsters allied supply chains and strengthens U.S. and Japanese
defense industrial capacity, including maritime. The United States and
Japan intend to continue their strong partnership in civil space and on
aeronautics, science, and human exploration, including on the upcoming
Crew-10 mission to the International Space Station that includes U.S.
and Japanese astronauts as well as lunar surface exploration on future
Artemis missions. The United States and Japan also intend to expand
bilateral security cooperation in cyberspace by leveraging new
technologies such as artificial intelligence and secure and resilient
cloud services to deepen information-sharing. The United States welcomed
Japan’s commitment, underpinned by a favorable trend of its defense
budget increase, to building capabilities by FY 2027 to consolidate its
primary responsibility for defending Japan, and, building on this
significant foundation, to fundamentally reinforcing its defense
capabilities beyond FY 2027.    
   
In order to maintain deterrence and mitigate the impact on local
communities, the two leaders confirmed the vital importance of the
steady implementation of the realignment of U.S. forces in Japan in
accordance with the Okinawa Consolidation Plan, including the
construction of the Futenma Replacement Facility at Henoko and the
return of Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Futenma.    
   
The two leaders instructed their foreign and defense ministers to
convene a Security Consultative Committee (SCC: “2+2”) meeting at an
early date to implement the above-mentioned cooperation in an
expeditious manner.  
   
**<u>U.S.-Japan Cooperation for Growth and Prosperity</u>**  
   
The two leaders affirmed that bilateral economic cooperation, including
on economic security, forms an indispensable part of Alliance
cooperation. As close economic partners, the United States and Japan
provide the largest amount of foreign direct investment and create high
quality jobs in each other’s countries. Industries of both countries
continue to play a vital role for each other’s supply chains.  
  
To chart an unwavering course for strengthening economic ties and
elevating the economic partnership to the next level, the two leaders
will seek to: promote business opportunities and significantly increase
bilateral investment and employment; strengthen their industrial bases
and collaborate to lead the world in developing critical technologies
such as AI, quantum computing, and leading-edge semiconductors; enhance
efforts to counter and build resilience against economic coercion; and
jointly promote growth in the Indo-Pacific region underpinned by a free
and fair economic order. They also resolved to continue discussions on
aligning policies to further promote and protect critical and sensitive
technologies, including through export controls, and to enhance supply
chain resilience. With a shared commitment to the integrity of travel
systems that underpin economic prosperity, they intend to strengthen
efforts to vet travelers and routinely and securely share information to
combat technology theft, travel by criminals, and illegal immigration.  
   
The two leaders announced their intention to strengthen energy security
by unleashing the United States’ affordable and reliable energy and
natural resources, and by increasing exports of U.S. liquefied natural
gas to Japan in a mutually beneficial manner. They also welcomed efforts
to diversify critical minerals supply chains and to collaborate on
developing and deploying cutting-edge small modular reactor and other
advanced nuclear reactor technology.  
   
The two leaders instructed their relevant ministers in charge to
strengthen U.S.-Japan economic cooperation to achieve these shared
goals.  
   
**<u>U.S.-Japan Coordination in the Indo-Pacific</u>**  
   
The two leaders shared views on the severe and complex security
environment and expressed their determination to continuously cooperate
to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific. As part of such cooperation,
the two leaders intend to advance multilayered and aligned cooperation
among like-minded countries, including Japan-Australia-India-U.S.
(Quad), Japan-U.S.-Republic of Korea (ROK), Japan-U.S.-Australia, and
Japan-U.S.-Philippines. Through these relationships, the United States,
Japan, and like-minded partners can deliver high quality infrastructure
investments in the region, including the deployment of Open Radio Access
Networks in third countries.  
   
The two leaders reiterated their strong opposition to any attempts by
the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to change the status quo by force
or coercion in the East China Sea. The two leaders reaffirmed their
strong opposition to the PRC’s unlawful maritime claims, militarization
of reclaimed features, and threatening and provocative activities in the
South China Sea.  
   
The two leaders emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and
stability across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of
security and prosperity for the international community. They encouraged
the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues, and opposed any attempts
to unilaterally change the status quo by force or coercion. The two
leaders also expressed support for Taiwan’s meaningful participation in
international organizations.  
   
The two leaders expressed their serious concerns over and the need to
address the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s (DPRK’s) nuclear and
missile programs and reaffirmed their resolute commitment to the
complete denuclearization of the DPRK. Both countries underscored the
need to deter and counter the DPRK’s malicious cyber activities and the
DPRK’s increasing military cooperation with Russia. In addition, both
countries affirmed the importance of the Japan-U.S.-ROK trilateral
partnership in responding to the DPRK and upholding regional peace and
prosperity. Japan reiterated its determination to achieve an immediate
resolution of the abductions issue, which the United States
supported.   
   
**Invitation to Visit Japan**  
   
President Trump accepted an invitation from Prime Minister Ishiba for an
official visit to Japan in the near future.
