title: Public Comment Invited on Artificial Intelligence Action Plan
---
 
**WASHINGTON, D.C.** – President Trump’s recent Artificial Intelligence
(**AI**) Executive Order shows that this Administration is dedicated to
America’s global leadership in AI technology innovation. This Order
directed the development of an AI Action Plan to sustain and enhance
America’s global AI dominance. Today, the American people are encouraged
to share their policy ideas for the AI Action Plan by responding to a
Request for Information (**RFI**), available on [the Federal Register’s
website](https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2025-02305/request-for-information-development-of-an-artificial-intelligence-action-plan) through
March 15.

“The Trump Administration is committed to ensuring the United States is
the undeniable leader in AI technology. This AI Action Plan is the first
step in securing and advancing American AI dominance, and we look
forward to incorporating the public’s comments and innovative ideas,”
said Lynne Parker, Principal Deputy Director of the Office of Science
and Technology Policy (**OSTP**).

The AI Action Plan will define priority policy actions to enhance
America’s position as an AI powerhouse and prevent unnecessarily
burdensome requirements from hindering private sector innovation. With
the right governmental policies, continued U.S. AI leadership will
promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national
security.

Today’s RFI from OSTP seeks input from interested public parties,
including academia, industry groups, private sector organizations,
state, local and tribal governments, and others on actions that should
be included in the AI Action Plan.

Comments can be submitted online and will be accepted until **11:59PM on
March 15, 2025.**
