title: Statement on Trump White House Victory Against the Associated Press
---
 
“As we have said from the beginning, asking the President of the United
States questions in the Oval Office and aboard Air Force One is a
privilege granted to journalists, not a legal right. We stand by our
decision to hold the Fake News accountable for their lies, and President
Trump will continue to grant an unprecedented level of access to the
press. This is the most transparent Administration in history.”
