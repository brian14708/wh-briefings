title: Presidential Message on the 2025 Daytona 500
---
 
Today, I look forward to joining tens of thousands of American Patriots
in Daytona Beach, Florida, for the “Great American Race”—the legendary
Daytona 500—and the official start to the 2025 NASCAR Cup Series.

This iconic race showcases the fastest, most fearless drivers in
motorsports, who represent our Nation’s love of tradition, competition,
and automotive innovation. The Daytona 500 brings together people from
all walks of life—from lifelong racing fans to first-time
spectators—they all join in celebrating a shared passion for speed,
adrenaline, and the thrill of the race. From the roar of the engines on
the track to the echo of “The Star-Spangled Banner” soaring through the
stands, the Daytona 500 is a timeless tribute to the speed, strength,
and unyielding spirit that make America great. That spirit is what will
fuel America’s Golden Age, and if we harness it, the future is truly
ours.

Since the very beginning, NASCAR has carried forth a proud tradition of
honoring our heroic Service members for their unwavering courage. While
fans from around the world gather today at Daytona International
Speedway, we extend our unending gratitude to the selfless men and women
in uniform who risk their lives to keep us safe. When the engines start
or the checkered flag waves, and all 500 thrilling miles in between, our
Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, Coast Guardsmen, and Guardians stand
ready to defend cherished traditions like this—and for that, we are
truly thankful.

Melania and I send our best wishes for a safe and successful race. May
God bless our Armed Forces, and may He continue to bless the United
States of America.
