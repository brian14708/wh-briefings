“Last night, 29 Mexican Cartel Members were extradited to the United
States. President Trump directed the Department of Justice and the
Department of State to make this happen, and Attorney General Bondi and
Secretary of State Rubio did a tremendous job in getting this done. The
group of cartel members, who will soon arrive on American soil, includes
one of the most evil cartel bosses in the world, Rafael Caro Quintero,
who tortured and murdered DEA Agent Kiki Camerena in 1985. The previous
Administration allowed these criminals to run free and commit crimes all
over the world. The Trump Administration is declaring these thugs as
terrorists, because that is what they are, and demanding justice for the
American people.”
