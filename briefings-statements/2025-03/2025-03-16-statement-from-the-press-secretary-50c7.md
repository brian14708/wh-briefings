title: Statement from the Press Secretary

“President Donald J. Trump signed a Proclamation Invoking the Alien
Enemies Act regarding the Invasion of the United States by the Foreign
Terrorist Organization Tren De Aragua, using his core powers as
President and Commander-in-Chief to defend the American People from an
urgent threat.

TDA is one of the most violent and ruthless terrorist gangs on planet
earth. They rape, maim and murder for sport. TDA is responsible for some
of the most heinous crimes that have occurred on US soil in recent
years, including the murders of Laken Riley and Jocelyn Nungaray.

TDA is a direct threat to the national security of the United States.

This weekend, at the President’s direction, the Department of Homeland
Security successfully arrested nearly 300 Tren de Aragua terrorists,
saving countless American lives. Thanks to the great work of the
Department of State, these heinous monsters were extracted and removed
to El Salvador where they will no longer be able to pose any threat to
the American People.

President Trump will always put the safety of the American People first
— and he will never allow foreign terrorist enemies to operate on
American soil and endanger our people. They will be found, restrained
and removed — and their networks will be destroyed.”
