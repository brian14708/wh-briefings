This Ash Wednesday, we join in prayer with the tens of millions of
American Catholics and other Christians beginning the holy season of
Lent—a time of spiritual anticipation of the passion, death, and
Resurrection of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

During the Lenten season, Christians spend 40 days and 40 nights
praying, fasting, and giving alms to deepen our faith and strengthen our
belief in the Gospel.  Today, followers of Christ wear crosses of ash on
their foreheads—a sacred reminder of our mortality and our enduring need
for Christ’s infinite mercy and redeeming love.

As we solemnly contemplate Jesus Christ’s suffering and death on the
cross this Lent, let us prepare our souls for the coming glory of the
Easter miracle.

We offer you our best wishes for a prayerful and enriching Lenten
season.  May Almighty God bless you, and may He continue to bless the
United States of America.
