In line with presidential-level discussions between President Donald J.

bilateral technical-level talks with the Ukrainian delegation March
23-25 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Following those discussions:

-   The United States and Ukraine have agreed to ensure safe navigation,
    eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial
    vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea.
-   The United States and Ukraine agreed that the United States remains
    committed to helping achieve the exchange of prisoners of war, the
    release of civilian detainees, and the return of forcibly
    transferred Ukrainian children.
-   The United States and Ukraine agreed to develop measures for
    implementing President Trump’s and President Zelenskyy’s agreement
    to ban strikes against energy facilities of Russia and Ukraine.
-   The United States and Ukraine welcome the good offices of third
    countries with a view toward supporting the implementation of the
    energy and maritime agreements.
-   The United States and Ukraine will continue working toward achieving
    a durable and lasting peace.

The United States reiterated to both sides President Donald J. Trump’s
imperative that the killing on both sides of the Russia-Ukraine
conflict must stop, as the necessary step toward achieving an enduring
peace settlement. To that end, the United States will continue
facilitating negotiations between both sides to achieve a peaceful
resolution, in line with the agreements made in Riyadh.  
  
The United States expresses gratitude to Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman for his leadership and hospitality in once again facilitating
these important discussions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
