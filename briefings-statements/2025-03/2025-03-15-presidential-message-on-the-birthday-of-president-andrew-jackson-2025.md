title: Presidential Message on the Birthday of President Andrew Jackson, 2025
---
 
Today, we celebrate the birthday of our seventh Commander-in-Chief,
Andrew Jackson, “the People’s President.”

Throughout his life, Andrew Jackson was a steadfast patriot.  Raised on
the battlefield of the Revolutionary War, he was just 13 years old when
he left home with his two older brothers to fight for Independence.  At
14, he was the only surviving member of his immediate family.  During
the War of 1812, he went on to lead a ragtag militia to a resounding
victory over the British in the epic Battle of New Orleans.  As a fierce
defender of democracy and a warrior for the people, he ran for President
in 1828, shocking the establishment class when he won the popular vote
in a landslide.

To return power to the people, President Jackson cut ten percent of the
Federal workforce and fearlessly combatted forces of corruption in our
Nation’s Capital.  He imposed tariffs on foreign nations to safeguard
American workers and pay off our national debt.  Through it all, he
defied relentless slanders and smears—including the infamous “corrupt
bargain” of the 1824 election—in defense of our Country.

My Administration is proudly upholding the vision of President Jackson’s
historic movement by reining in unwieldy government spending, advancing
a strong manufacturing base, and restoring a Government that answers to
the American People.  Every day, we are dismantling bloated bureaucracy,
cutting wasteful programs, slashing excess regulations, bringing back
fair trade, restoring our manufacturing base, and ensuring that not a
single American tax dollar goes to waste.

President Jackson is an American icon, a military hero, and a gallant
guardian of democracy.  As we commemorate his 258th birthday, we commit
to furthering his legacy, expanding his vision, honoring his memory, and
restoring the full might of American democracy for many years to come. 
Today, I am once again proud to hang his portrait in the Oval Office of
the People’s House.

As our Nation prepares to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the signing
of the Declaration of Independence next year, President Jackson’s
birthday is a particularly meaningful opportunity to remember the heroes
who embody the best of the American Spirit—and whose legacy continues to
inspire us and lead our Nation to a future of greatness.

Happy birthday, President Jackson!
