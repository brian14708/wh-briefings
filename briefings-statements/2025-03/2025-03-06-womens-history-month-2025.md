By the President of the United States of America  
   
A Proclamation

        Every day, without fame or fanfare, women inspire, support, and
strengthen their families, communities, and our country.  Women’s
History Month presents a great opportunity to celebrate the tremendous
impact women continue to have on our Nation.  
  
        The First Lady and I honor American women from all generations
and all backgrounds who have been integral to our prosperity and
productivity, and who have made an indelible mark on the soul and
heartbeat of our Nation.   
  
        I am especially proud to acknowledge and celebrate the brilliant
and talented female trailblazers in my Administration.  They are leaders
in business, experts in foreign and domestic policy, authorities in
national security, great legal minds, as well as dedicated public
servants who put the American people first.  Together, we are working to
honor the women in our history.  
  
        No longer will our Government promote radical ideologies that
replace women with men in spaces and opportunities designed for women,
or devastate families by indoctrinating our sons and daughters to begin
a war with their own bodies.  Instead, my Administration will safeguard
the great American values of family, truth, well-being, and freedom.   
  
        By fulfilling my promise to protect women and girls from gender
extremism we have brought back common sense to society.  And, most
Americans — nearly 80 percent — are supportive.  
  
        On day one, I delivered on my promise to sign an Executive Order
recognizing that women are biologically female, and men are biologically
male.  As a result, the United States will no longer allow “X” gender
marker on Government forms, and the United States Passport Office will
now only issue passports with a “M” or “F” sex marker matching an
individual’s biological sex at birth.   
  
        I also signed an Executive Order to protect women’s sports and
directed the Department of Education and other executive departments and
agencies to launch Title IX action against federally funded schools and
States who refuse to uphold fair competition and dignity for female
athletes.  Responding to my Administration’s clear and concise
standards, the National College Athletic Association, representing
530,000 student-athletes, and State athletic associations across the
country changed their policies to limit competition in women’s sports to
female student-athletes only.  By recognizing there are only two sexes,
restoring Title IX protections, and protecting families, my
Administration is empowering women every day.   
          I am also delivering on my promise to secure our borders,
deport illegal criminal aliens, rebuild our economy, school choice, make
America healthy again, and improve access to in vitro fertilization —
and I have only just started.  I will never stop fighting for America’s
women and families.  
  
        Today and every day, America’s daughters ignite the dreams and
develop the character of our next generation.  Their contributions to
America’s excellence are worthy of praise and recognition, now and
forever.  
  
        NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United
States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the
Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March
2025 as Women’s History Month.  I call on all Americans to celebrate the
exceptional women in their lives and around our country.  
  
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
sixth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five,
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred
and forty-ninth.  
  
  
                              DONALD J. TRUMP
