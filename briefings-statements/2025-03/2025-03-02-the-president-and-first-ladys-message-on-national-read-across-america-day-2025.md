  \ Day, 2025"

Today, we join students, parents, teachers, librarians, and Americans
all across our country in commemorating National Read Across America
Day—an occasion to celebrate the importance of reading and the
unparalleled power of literacy.

Books have always been the bedrock of a great life and a great future. 
The simple act of opening a new book expands our knowledge, transforms
our minds, and inspires strong leaders and thoughtful citizens.  Whether
we are turning through the pages of a book on ancient history, an
adventure novel, or classic literature, books will always be the
frontier of American imagination and the gateway to the American Dream.

Literacy is a critical component of personal growth, success, and
leading lives of happiness and fulfillment, which is why we are fully
committed to promoting reading and ensuring America’s children receive
the outstanding education they deserve.  The White House has taken
direct action through Executive Order to end indoctrination in our
classrooms and by directing the Department of Education to empower
parents across America to choose the school that best suits their
children’s needs and values.

On National Read Across America Day, and every day, our Administration
remains committed to instilling a profound love of reading in our youth
and forming the next generation of patriotic leaders.  The next chapter
of our Nation’s Golden Age begins with opening a new book—and harnessing
the full potential of our youngest generation.
