title: Presidential Message on Nowruz, 2025
---
 
Warmest wishes to all those in the United States and around the globe
celebrating the ancient holiday of Nowruz.    
   
Nowruz is a joyous occasion for the Persian people, marking the
beginning of spring, and the Persian New Year.
 This long-standing tradition presents a time to reflect on the
blessings of the previous year and prepare for the coming spring with a
renewed spirit of optimism.  
   
The Persian people with their vibrant culture and exceptional talents in
fields such as math, science, law, technology, and the arts, make many
integral contributions to society.  On behalf of the United States, I
extend my kindest regards for a joyous holiday.  
Nowruz Pirouz!
