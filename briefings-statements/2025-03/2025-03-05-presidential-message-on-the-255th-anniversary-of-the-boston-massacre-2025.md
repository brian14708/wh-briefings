title: Presidential Message on the 255th Anniversary of the Boston Massacre, 2025
---
 
Today our Nation commemorates the 255th anniversary of the Boston
Massacre—the singular event that ignited the movement for American
independence.  To this day, it stands as a defining crucible of the
American Revolution.

The years leading up to this tragic moment were marked by escalating
tensions between the Patriots and the British Parliament.  The
imposition of unjust global trade regimes and burdensome taxes,
including the Stamp Act and the Townshend Acts, inspired the American
Colonies in their bid for Freedom. 

On the wintry evening of March 5, 1770, a fight broke out in the city of
Boston, Massachusetts, between the British Redcoats and unarmed American
Colonists.  The violence escalated as the soldiers fired their muskets
into the crowd at the Custom House.  When the smoke cleared on King
Street, three civilians were dead, two fatally wounded, and six more
injured. 

This massacre sparked outrage among the Colonists.  It has echoed
throughout history as a seminal moment in the long and fraught battle
for American liberty.  Roughly five years later, the first shots were
fired in Revolutionary War—and the American Colonists ultimately secured
their independence, paving the way for the birth of the greatest Nation
in the history of the world. On this, the 255th Anniversary of the
Boston Massacre, we pay tribute to and honor those who have paid the
ultimate price in defense of America’s cherished values.
