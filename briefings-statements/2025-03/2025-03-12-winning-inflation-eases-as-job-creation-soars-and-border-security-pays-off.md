title: 'WINNING: Inflation Eases as Job Creation Soars and Border Security Pays Off'
---
 
*“Today’s CPI report shows inflation is declining and the economy is
moving in the right direction under President Trump. Core consumer
prices, which is the best measure of inflation, dropped to its lowest
level in FOUR years. This inflation report, much like last week’s jobs
report, is far better than the media predicted and the so-called
‘experts’ expected. When will they learn to stop doubting President
Trump? As he successfully did in his first term, President Trump is
driving down costs through massive deregulation and energy dominance.
The entire Trump Administration will continue to focus on fixing the
economic and inflation nightmare created by the Biden-Harris
Administration to unlock the Golden Age of America.”  **— Karoline
Leavitt, White House Press Secretary***

Today’s Consumer Price Index showed inflation “[eased more than
expected](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/03/12/inflation-tariffs-recession-cpi-markets-wall-street/)”
in February as Americans finally see some welcome relief following years
of unending Bidenflation — with core inflation at its lowest level in
nearly four years and mortgage
rates [dropping](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-12/us-mortgage-rates-drop-for-a-sixth-week-to-lowest-since-december?srnd=homepage-americas) to
their lowest levels since December.

**And the wins don’t stop there. **President Trump’s commitment to
deregulation and leveling the playing field for American workers
continues to attract unprecedented investment in manufacturing and job
creation:

-   GE
    Aerospace [announced](https://www.geaerospace.com/news/press-releases/ge-aerospace-invest-nearly-1b-us-manufacturing-2025) it
    will invest $1 billion in its U.S.-based manufacturing operation
    across 16 states — creating 5,000 new jobs.
-   Asahi Group Holdings, one of the largest Japanese beverage
    makers, [announced](https://www.wsj.com/business/japan-beer-maker-asahi-looks-to-invest-more-in-the-u-s-as-president-trump-wields-tariffs-c23eaab1?mod=latest_headlines) a
    $35 million investment to boost production at its Wisconsin plant.
-   Merck [opened](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-opens-vaccine-manufacturing-facility-north-carolina-2025-03-11/) its
    $1 billion North Carolina manufacturing facility as it plans to
    invest $8 billion in the U.S. over the next several years.

Meanwhile, new reports indicate migration to the U.S. through Panama’s
Darien Gap
has [dropped](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-10/migration-to-the-us-through-panama-jungle-route-plunges-99?srnd=homepage-americas&embedded-checkout=true) by
99% and would-be illegal border crossers are [turning
around](https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/trump-border-immigration-reverse-migration-150854c4) amid
the Trump Administration’s commitment to border security.

America is roaring back.
