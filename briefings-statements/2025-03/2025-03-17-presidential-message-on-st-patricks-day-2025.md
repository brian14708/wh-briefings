Today, I join the Irish-American community and citizens across our
Nation in commemorating Saint Patrick’s Day—a time to celebrate the rich
blessings of Irish culture and honor the life and legendary spirit of
Saint Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland.  
   
More than 1,600 years ago, Saint Patrick ventured through the emerald
fields and ancient valleys of Ireland to introduce the Gospel of Jesus
Christ to the Celtic people.  Over his life, he courageously withstood
years of persecution and threats on his life, yet continued to bring
hearts, minds, and souls to the Christian faith.  
   
Legend holds that Saint Patrick used the three-leaved shamrock to
explain the mystery of the Holy Trinity to Irish unbelievers and during
40 days of fasting, exiled all snakes and demons lurking on the Emerald
Isle into the sea.  To this day, thanks to his life of ministry and
service to God, Saint Patrick’s legacy lives on around the world.  
   
On this Saint Patrick’s Day, millions of Irish-Americans will celebrate
the extraordinary life of Saint Patrick with festivities honoring Irish
culture and our nation’s shared values of faith, family, and freedom. 
As we observe Saint Patrick’s Day, we remember his life’s work, paying
tribute to his sacrifices and cherishing the unique bond of friendship
between the United States and Ireland.  
   
Happy Saint Patrick’s Day!
