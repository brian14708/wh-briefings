**Outcomes of the United States and Russia Expert Groups  
On the Black Sea  
in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia  
March 23-25, 2025**

In line with presidential-level discussions between President Donald J.
Trump and President Vladimir Putin, the United States
facilitated bilateral technical-level talks with the
Russian delegation March 23-25 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Following those
discussions:

-   The United States and Russia have agreed to ensure safe navigation,
    eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial
    vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea.
-   The United States will help restore Russia’s access to the world
    market for agricultural and fertilizer exports, lower maritime
    insurance costs, and enhance access to ports and payment systems for
    such transactions.
-   The United States and Russia agreed to develop measures for
    implementing President Trump’s and President Putin’s agreement to
    ban strikes against energy facilities of Russia and Ukraine.
-   The United States and Russia welcome the good offices of third
    countries with a view toward supporting the implementation of the
    energy and maritime agreements.
-   The United States and Russia will continue working toward achieving
    a durable and lasting peace.

The United States reiterated President Donald J. Trump’s imperative that
the killing on both sides of the Russia-Ukraine conflict must stop, as
the necessary step toward achieving an enduring peace settlement. To
that end, the United States will continue facilitating negotiations
between both sides to achieve a peaceful resolution, in line with the
agreements made in Riyadh.  
  
The United States expresses gratitude to Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman for his leadership and hospitality in once again facilitating
these important discussions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
