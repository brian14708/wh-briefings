title: Presidential Message on Ramadan
---
 
Today, I send my warmest greetings for the holy month of Ramadan—a
sacred time of fasting, prayer, and communal gathering.  
   
It is a time to draw hope, courage, and inspiration to lead lives of
holiness and virtue.  
   
As millions of Muslim Americans begin their Ramadan observances, my
Administration recommits to upholding religious liberty that is such an
integral part of the American way of life.  Above all, we renew our
resolve to building a future of peace, and to recognizing the dignity
imprinted on every human soul.  
   
This Ramadan, I offer my best wishes for a season of joyous reflection
on God’s endless grace and infinite love.  May God bless you and your
families during this wondrous season.
