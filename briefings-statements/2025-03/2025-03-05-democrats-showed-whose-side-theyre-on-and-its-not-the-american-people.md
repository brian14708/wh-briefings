Tonight, President Donald J. Trump delivered bold, forward-looking
remarks before a joint session of Congress — highlighting the historic
accomplishments already achieved in his second term and setting the
course for four years of prosperity and strength.

Unfortunately, Congressional Democrats were too consumed by their own
hatred of President Trump, refusing to show support for lowering taxes,
fighting childhood cancer, capturing terrorists, protecting women and
girls in sports, or law and order — to name only a few.

As Dana Perino
[said](https://x.com/Pfeiffer47/status/1897140004931166311), “The
Democratic Party still has no common sense. They have no ideas and they
have no heart. They couldn’t even stand for the most inspiring moments
of the speech.”

**Tonight, Democrats refused to applaud:**
