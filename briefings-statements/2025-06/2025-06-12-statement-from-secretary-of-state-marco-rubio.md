“Tonight, Israel took unilateral action against Iran. We are not
involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting
American forces in the region. Israel advised us that they believe this
action was necessary for its self-defense. President Trump and the
Administration have taken all necessary steps to protect our forces and
remain in close contact with our regional partners. Let me be clear:
Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel.”
