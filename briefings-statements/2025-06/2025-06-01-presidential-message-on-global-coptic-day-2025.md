title: Presidential Message on Global Coptic Day, 2025
---
 
Today, I join the Coptic Orthodox Christian community in observing
Global Coptic Day—a celebration of the ancient heritage, rich culture,
and reverent worship of the Coptic Orthodox Church.

Tracing its roots to Saint Mark, the apostle of Jesus Christ and
Evangelist who brought the Christian faith to Egypt in the first
century, the Coptic Church has been a beacon of Christendom in Africa
for nearly 2,000 years.  The Coptic community has left an indelible mark
on the hearts of millions of Christians—most evidently seen in their
timeless contributions to Christian theology and culture.

This Global Coptic Day, we also pause to reflect upon the vicious and
ongoing persecution of Coptic Orthodox Christians in Africa and across
the Middle East.  In 2015, 21 Coptic construction workers were brutally
executed by ISIS terrorists in Libya.  Like persecuted Christians all
around the world, these heroic martyrs refused to renounce their
faith—They exemplified their sacrificial love and steadfast devotion to
God, even in the face of certain death.  The Copts’ persistence amid
relentless persecution is a living testament to their unbreakable
resolve and fearless dedication to spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

As we remember the extraordinary contributions and tragic martyrdoms of
Coptic Orthodox Christians, my Administration renews its commitment to
vigorously defending the right to religious liberty, a bedrock of the
American way of life.  I was honored to recently establish the Religious
Liberty Commission, a team of religious leaders tasked with ensuring
that Americans can freely practice their faith without government
interference.  I also signed an Executive Order to eradicate the
pervasive anti-Christian bias sweeping across our Nation—correcting the
unjust abuses, investigations, and persecutions of faithful Christians
that occurred under the previous administration.

As our Nation celebrates Global Coptic Day, we pray for an increased
love of God and a rebirth of religious faith both in the United States
and around the world.  Today and every day, may the treasured traditions
of the Coptic Orthodox Christian community serve as a light for all
Americans—and may their unwavering devotion to Christ inspire our Nation
to renew our love, faith, and trust in Almighty God.
