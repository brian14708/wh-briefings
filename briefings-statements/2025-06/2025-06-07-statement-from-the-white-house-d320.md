title: Statement from the White House

“In recent days, violent mobs have attacked ICE Officers and Federal Law
Enforcement Agents carrying out basic deportation operations in Los
Angeles, California. These operations are essential to halting and
reversing the invasion of illegal criminals into the United States. In
the wake of this violence, California’s feckless Democrat leaders have
completely abdicated their responsibility to protect their citizens.
That is why President Trump has signed a Presidential Memorandum
deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen to address the lawlessness that has
been allowed to fester. The Trump Administration has a zero tolerance
policy for criminal behavior and violence, especially when that violence
is aimed at law enforcement officers trying to do their jobs. These
criminals will be arrested and swiftly brought to justice. The
Commander-in-Chief will ensure the laws of the United States are
executed fully and completely.”

-Karoline Leavitt, White House Press Secretary
