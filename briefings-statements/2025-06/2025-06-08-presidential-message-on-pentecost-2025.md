title: Presidential Message on Pentecost, 2025
---
 
Today, I join in prayer with Christians joyfully celebrating the descent
of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost—one of the most sacred events of the
Christian faith. We commemorate the fulfillment of Jesus Christ’s
earthly mission and the birth of His holy and living Church.  
   
On Pentecost, 50 days after Jesus Christ’s resurrection from the dead on
Easter Sunday, the Holy Spirit descended upon His Apostles in the form
of a mighty wind—empowering them to speak in tongues and proclaim the
good news of the Gospel to lands and peoples near and far.  “Repent and
be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the
forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy
Spirit,” the Apostle Peter boldly declared.  
   
Equipped with the courage, clarity, and grace of Almighty God, in the
years that followed, the Apostles went on to withstand tremendous danger
to bring hearts, minds, and souls to the Christian faith—marking the
beginning of the Church, against which even the evils of hell shall not
prevail.  More than 2,000 years later, the Holy Spirit continues to
descend upon all those who proclaim Christ’s name—enabling them to
spread The Gospel.  
   
As we celebrate this glorious feast day, we also honor all Christians
who, like the Apostles, have willingly endured persecution because of
their faith.  My Administration will always defend the right of every
American to worship God freely and without fear.  For this reason, I
created the White House Faith Office and proudly instituted the White
House Religious Liberty Commission to safeguard and promote America’s
founding principle of religious freedom.  Under my leadership, we are
protecting God in the public square and emboldening every believer to
live their faith freely, openly, and without threat of persecution.  
   
As we celebrate the miracle of Pentecost and birth of Christ’s Church,
we pray that the Holy Spirit fills our Nation and her people with
abundant grace—bringing us peace, protection, and God’s presence.  
   
May God bless you, and may He continue to bless the United States of
America.  Have a blessed Pentecost!
