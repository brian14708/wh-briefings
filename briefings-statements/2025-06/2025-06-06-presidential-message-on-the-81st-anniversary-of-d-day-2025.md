title: Presidential Message on the 81st Anniversary of D-Day, 2025
---
 
In the pre-dawn hours of June 6, 1944, American and Allied forces
stormed a 50-mile stretch of beach in Normandy, France, winning a
crucial victory that turned the tide of World War II and changed the
course of history.  The largest amphibious invasion in history—Operation
Overlord—was achieved through meticulous planning, utilizing 13,000
aircraft and gliders, 23,400 paratroopers, 5,000 ships and landing
craft, and roughly 160,000 American, British, and Canadian troops.  By
nightfall, the valiance and intrepidity of the Allied soldiers, sailors,
airmen, marines and merchant mariners had carried the day, establishing
beachheads on all five of the landing beaches – Omaha, Utah, Sword,
Gold, and Juno.  This victory, though, was achieved at great cost.  More
than 9,000 Allied service members were killed or wounded that day, to
ensure that freedom would once again prevail over the European
continent.

On the 81st anniversary of D-day, we pause to pay homage to the
warfighters whose indescribable valor, fierce determination, and
unwavering patriotism delivered this pivotal victory for the global
cause of freedom.  The monumental victory forged on land, at sea, and in
the skies of Normandy led to the liberation of Europe, the defeat of the
evil Nazi regime, and the preservation of democracy.  We are grateful
for those young men who answered their nations’ calls and faced the
carnage of war in order to defeat tyranny—and we are eternally indebted
to the souls who gave their lives in this noble struggle.  It is our
solemn obligation to remember their heroic stories, honor their
sacrifices, and ensure that the freedom for which they died for may
never again be in peril.
