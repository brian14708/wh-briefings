title: "Presidential Message on National Men\u2019s Health Week, 2025"
---
 
For far too long, the health, happiness, and well-being of our Nation’s
men have been neglected, contributing to a troubling reality: men in the
United States have a life expectancy five years shorter than women. They
visit healthcare providers less frequently and often delay critical
care. Men tend to have their first heart attack an average of 10 years
earlier than women.

This neglect has been compounded by a vicious campaign against
masculinity. This war on manhood has left many American men in a state
of loneliness, confusion, and emptiness, with devastating consequences:
men in the United States are four times more likely to commit suicide
and more than twice as likely to overdose than women.

This National Men’s Health Week, I make a solemn pledge to honor the men
in America: we will always have your back—and we will never waver in our
promise to embolden you to lead long, healthy, and safe lives.

Just last month, I proudly signed an Executive Order to deliver
most-favored-nation pricing to American patients, improve access to
quality medical care, and lower the price of medications.  Together,
with my Make America Healthy Again Commission, we are empowering men to
prioritize their health and prolong their lives. 

Under my leadership, we will relentlessly pursue a healthier future for
the men of our nation. We will always lift you up rather than tear you
down, and we will champion the voices, values, and wellness of
hardworking American men across our country.
