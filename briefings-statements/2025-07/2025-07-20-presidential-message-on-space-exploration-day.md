title: Presidential Message on Space Exploration Day
---
 
On July 20, 1969, Apollo 11 successfully landed the first crewed mission
on the Moon, launching mankind into a new and uncharted era of human
ingenuity.  As the entire world watched in awe, American astronauts
stepped onto the lunar surface and planted the beautiful Stars and
Stripes on the rocky soil.  Our flag stood as a marker of National
achievement, signaling to the entire world the unmatched might and
unwavering resilience of the American spirit.

Today, my Administration is building on the legacy of Apollo 11 by
reigniting the United States’ leadership in space and shaping the future
of American space exploration.  During my first term, I proudly
reestablished the National Space Council and created the Space Force,
making space policy a national priority and ensuring that our Nation’s
interests are protected beyond Earth. 

Through the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, we secured a historic
investment in human space exploration to ensure that America’s efforts
in the realm of space remain innovative, efficient, and unmatched by
other nations.  We are refocusing the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration’s (NASA) Artemis campaign returning Americans to the
Moon—this time to stay—and putting the first boots on Mars.  At the same
time, we are expanding partnerships with the greatest aerospace
companies in the world to launch rockets, build landers, and deliver
advanced technology that will drive a new and unparalleled era of space
exploration.

With our incredible Guardians in the U.S. Space Force protecting
America’s interests in space, we are securing the systems that power
exploration, defense, and communication.  We are building strength,
expanding freedom, and ensuring that the American flag remains the
ultimate symbol of leadership across the final frontier.
