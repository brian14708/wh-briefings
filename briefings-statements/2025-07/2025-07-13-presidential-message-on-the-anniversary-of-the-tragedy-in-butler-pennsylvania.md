title: Presidential Message on the Anniversary of the Tragedy in Butler, Pennsylvania
---
 
One year ago today, at 6:11 pm—eight minutes after taking the stage on
the grounds of Butler Farms to address thousands of Americans gathered
at a campaign rally—rifle fire broke out, and an assassin’s bullet came
within a quarter inch of ending my life and silencing our movement to
restore American greatness.  Yet, by the hand of providence and the
grace of Almighty God, my life was spared.  As we commemorate one year
since the harrowing events of July 13, 2024, we reaffirm that the
American spirit has and will always triumph over forces of evil and
destruction.

Those who carry scars from that July evening defended our Republic
during one of our Nation’s darkest hours—running to the injured amid
chaos and uncertainty to provide comfort and lifesaving care.  Doctors
and first responders rushed to help the wounded, rallygoers guided their
fellow citizens to safety, and patriots raised their fists in the air in
an outpouring of support and national pride.  These men and women
arrived at the rally grounds as ordinary Americans, but left as heroes. 
They represent the very best of our Nation, and we are forever indebted
for their kindness and compassion.

However, one name stands above all for selfless service and ultimate
sacrifice on that fateful day.  The world will never forget the tragic
loss of Corey Comperatore, a firefighter, veteran, and devoted husband
and father.  When gunfire erupted, Corey did not hesitate to protect his
wife and two daughters.  He died a hero, and we are eternally grateful
for his inspiring love, valor, and faithfulness.

It remains my firm conviction that God alone saved me that day for a
righteous purpose: to restore our beloved Republic to greatness and to
rescue our Nation from those who seek its ruin.  One year after the
attempt on my life in Butler, our country is in the midst of a new
Golden Age.  History will remember the would-be assassin for his
cowardice and failure, but the magnificent legacy of the heroes of July
13, 2024, will forever be etched upon the heart of our Nation.  Today,
we pay tribute to their spirit of love, unity, and resilience—and we
proclaim with one voice the epic battle cry that has reverberated all
across the world: “Fight, fight, fight!”
