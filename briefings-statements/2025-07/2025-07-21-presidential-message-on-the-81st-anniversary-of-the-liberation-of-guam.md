title: Presidential Message on the 81st Anniversary of the Liberation of Guam
---
 
Today, on the 81st anniversary of the liberation of Guam from Imperial
Japanese control, our Nation proudly honors the strength, courage, and
unbreakable resilience of every hero of liberty who gallantly fought to
free the people of Guam and establish a foothold from which we would win
the Second World War.

On July 21, 1944, American forces stormed the beaches of Guam to conquer
tyranny and restore the righteous promise of American sovereignty in the
Pacific.  As Imperial Japanese forces tried to hold their ground, they
struggled to withstand the full might of the U.S. Armed Forces.  After
three weeks of gruesome and blood-soaked warfare in jungles, caves, and
rugged hills, America triumphed—regaining control of Guam and putting
U.S. forces within striking distance of ending the war in the Pacific.

As we commemorate America’s hard-earned victory in Guam, our Nation also
solemnly pays tribute to the more than 1,200 Service members and more
than 1,000 residents of Guam who made the ultimate sacrifice to liberate
the American territory.

To this day, the liberation of Guam remains etched upon our Nation’s
history as a bold reassertion of American sovereignty at a time when our
future and our freedom were in peril.  Under my leadership, the United
States remains committed to upholding a foreign policy of peace through
strength—and we will never waver in defending our interests, our
citizens, our territory, and our glorious way of life from all enemies,
foreign and domestic.
