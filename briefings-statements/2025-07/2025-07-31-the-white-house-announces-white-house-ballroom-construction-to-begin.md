title: The White House Announces White House Ballroom Construction to Begin
---
 
**Washington, D.C.** — For 150 years, Presidents, Administrations, and
White House Staff have longed for a large event space on the White House
complex that can hold substantially more guests than currently allowed.
President Donald J. Trump has expressed his commitment to solving this
problem on behalf of future Administrations and the American people.  
   
The White House is one of the most beautiful and historic buildings in
the world, yet the White House is currently unable to host major
functions honoring world leaders and other countries without having to
install a large and unsightly tent approximately 100 yards away from the
main building entrance. The White House State Ballroom will be a
much-needed and exquisite addition of approximately 90,000 total square
feet of ornately designed and carefully crafted space, with a seated
capacity of 650 people — a significant increase from the 200-person
seated capacity in the East Room of the White House.  
   
In recent weeks, President Trump has held several meetings with members
of the White House Staff, the National Park Service, the White House
Military Office, and the United States Secret Service to discuss design
features and planning.   
   
President Trump has chosen McCrery Architects as lead architect, which
is well-known for their classical architectural design and based in our
nation’s capital. CEO Jim McCrery said: “Presidents in the modern era
have faced challenges hosting major events at the White House because it
has been untouched since President Harry Truman. I am honored that
President Trump has entrusted me to help bring this beautiful and
necessary renovation to The People’s House, while preserving the
elegance of its classical design and historical importance.”  
   
The construction team will be headed by Clark Construction, and the
engineering team will be led by AECOM.   
   
The project will begin in September 2025, and it is expected to be
completed long before the end of President Trump’s term.   
   
President Trump, and other patriot donors, have generously committed to
donating the funds necessary to build this approximately $200 million
dollar structure. The United States Secret Service will provide the
necessary security enhancements and modifications.   
   
The White House Ballroom will be substantially separated from the main
building of the White House, but at the same time, it’s theme and
architectural heritage will be almost identical. The site of the new
ballroom will be where the small, heavily changed, and reconstructed
East Wing currently sits. The East Wing was constructed in 1902 and has
been renovated and changed many times, with a second story added in
1942.   
   
The White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles said the following:
“President Trump is a builder at heart and has an extraordinary eye for
detail. The President and the Trump White House are fully committed to
working with the appropriate organizations to preserving the special
history of the White House while building a beautiful ballroom that can
be enjoyed by future Administrations and generations of Americans to
come.”   
   
The White House will continue to provide the American public with
updates on this project at
