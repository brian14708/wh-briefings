  Trade

Today, the United States of America (the United States) and the Republic
of Indonesia (Indonesia) agreed to a Framework for negotiating an
Agreement on Reciprocal Trade to strengthen our bilateral economic
relationship, which will provide both countries’ exporters unprecedented
access to each other’s markets.  The Agreement on Reciprocal Trade will
build upon our longstanding economic relationship, including the
U.S.-Indonesia Trade and Investment Framework Agreement, signed on July
16, 1996.

Key terms of the Agreement on Reciprocal Trade between the United States
and Indonesia will include:

-   Indonesia will eliminate approximately 99 percent of tariff barriers
    for a full range of U.S. industrial and U.S. food and agricultural
    products exported to Indonesia.
-   The United States will reduce to 19 percent the reciprocal tariffs,
    as set forth in Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025, on
    originating goods of Indonesia, and may also identify certain
    commodities that are not naturally available or domestically
    produced in the United States for a further reduction in the
    reciprocal tariff rate.
-   The United States and Indonesia will negotiate facilitative rules of
    origin that ensure that the benefits of the agreement accrue
    primarily to the United States and Indonesia.
-   The United States and Indonesia will work together to address
    Indonesia’s non-tariff barriers that affect bilateral trade and
    investment in priority areas, including exempting U.S. companies and
    originating goods from local content requirements; accepting
    vehicles built to U.S. federal motor vehicle safety and emissions
    standards; accepting FDA certificates and prior marketing
    authorizations for medical devices and pharmaceuticals; removing

    medical devices, and other manufactured goods from certain
    requirements; taking steps to resolve many long-standing
    intellectual property issues identified in USTR’s Special 301
    Report; and addressing U.S. concerns with conformity assessment
    procedures.  Indonesia will work to address barriers for U.S.
    exports, including through the removal of import restrictions or
    licensing requirements on U.S. remanufactured goods or their parts;
    the elimination of pre-shipment inspection or verification
    requirements on imports of U.S. goods; and the adoption and
    implementation of good regulatory practices.
-   The United States and Indonesia have also committed to address and

    implement the Joint Initiative on Services Domestic Regulation,
    including submitting its revised Specific Commitments for
    certification by the World Trade Organization (WTO).

    and take effective actions to address global excess capacity in the
    steel sector and its impacts.

    implement a prohibition on the importation of goods produced by
    forced or compulsory labor; amend its labor laws to ensure that
    workers’ rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining
    are fully protected; and strengthen enforcement of its labor laws.
