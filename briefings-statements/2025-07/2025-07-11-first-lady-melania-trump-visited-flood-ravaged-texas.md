souls. Deepest sympathy from all of us to the community—to everyone who
lost a loved one—we are grieving with you. Our Nation is grieving with
you.”

“We just met with the wonderful families. We prayed with them. We
hugged. We held hands. They shared their stories, and I met beautiful
young ladies who gave me this special bracelet from the camp in honor of
all the little girls who lost their lives. We are here to honor them and
also to give support and help. I will be back—I promised them. I pray
for them and am giving them my strength and love.”

During the visit, Mrs. Trump was gifted a charm bracelet by the Hotze
Family, which she wore on her wrist to honor the memory of the young
girls who lost their lives. She was also gifted a Camp Mystic Song Book.
The Office of First Lady Melania Trump remains committed to supporting
the well-being of children and youth, including during times of crisis.
Through her BE BEST initiative and additional outreach, Mrs. Trump
continues to advocate for young people to ensure they are not forgotten
in the aftermath of disaster or while experiencing trauma or loss.
