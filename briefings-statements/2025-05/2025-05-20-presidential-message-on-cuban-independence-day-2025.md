title: Presidential Message on Cuban Independence Day, 2025
---
 
On May 20, 1902, after years of fierce warfare in the late 19th century,
the Cuban flag was raised for the first time in a mighty victory for the
cause of freedom.  This Cuban Independence Day, we honor the courageous
patriots who broke free from Spanish colonial rule to heroically embrace
the eternal values of liberty, sovereignty, and human dignity.  My
Administration offers its heartfelt support to the people of Cuba as
they once again seek to secure their God-given rights—and we recommit to
assisting them in their righteous pursuit of self-government.

For far too long, the communist Cuban regime has trampled on the rights
of its people to lead lives of freedom—and has caused endless poverty,
suffering, and hardship.  America will continue to work alongside our
allies and partners in the Western Hemisphere to bring stability,
liberty, cooperation, and a free future to the people of Cuba.

As President, I also stand firmly united with the millions of Cuban
Americans who have courageously escaped the horrors of Cuban communism,
rejected the evils of tyranny, and built their lives, families, and
futures on American shores.  America benefits greatly from the strength,
warmth, and generosity of millions of Cuban Americans, who have
contributed to our way of life.

Today, we honor the strength of all those who have dedicated their lives
to fighting for their beloved homeland.  We pay tribute to the
distinctive role Cuban Americans have played in our national story. 
Above all, we renew our resolve to support the Cuban people in their
quest for security, prosperity, and independence.
