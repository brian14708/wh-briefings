title: General Terms for the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great
  Britain and Northern Ireland Economic Prosperity Deal
---
 
**<span style="text-decoration: underline">Context and
Objectives</span>**  
President Donald J. Trump and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer committed
to deliver shared prosperity for American and British citizens alike.
Our governments have a unique opportunity to enhance our economic
partnership through the **U.S.-UK Economic Prosperity Deal** (EPD).

A first of its kind, the United States and the United Kingdom expect the
EPD to address three core objectives, based on fairness and reciprocity:

1.  To grow the quality and volume of mutually beneficial trade between
    the United States and the United Kingdom, creating good, high-paying
    jobs and growth in both countries;
2.  To remove barriers to make it easier for American and British
    businesses to operate, invest and trade in both countries; and
3.  To ensure that the Special Relationship is rooted in an enduring
    economic partnership that is fair, reciprocal, future-facing, and
    built on a shared vision of the challenges that face our economies.

This document serves to define the general terms for the EPD that set
forth the shared desires of the United States and the United Kingdom to
make bilateral trade fairer, easier, and more substantial. Alongside
this document covering our trading relationship, we are continuing
discussions toward a transformative technology partnership between our
countries.

The United States and United Kingdom are immediately beginning
negotiations of the EPD to develop and formalize the proposals made in
this document. Once the initial proposals have been formalized and
implemented, the United States and United Kingdom understand that the
EPD can further be expanded over time to cover additional areas. Each
country intends to continue to improve market access under the EPD.

Both the United States and the United Kingdom recognize that this
document does not constitute a legally binding agreement.

1.  **Addressing Tariffs**  
    (a) Following a reasonable period of negotiation: (i) the United
    Kingdom intends to reduce its applied tariff rates on a preferential
    basis on a range of originating goods of the United States in
    sectors of importance to the United States; and (ii) the United
    States intends to reduce its applied tariff rates on a preferential
    basis on a range of originating goods of the United Kingdom in
    sectors of importance to the United Kingdom. The countries intend to
    coordinate the timing of their respective tariff reductions to be as
    soon as practicable, taking into consideration their respective
    domestic processes. On request of the United Kingdom, the United
    States will consider reducing its applied tariff rates for a UK
    territory or territories for whose international relations the
    United Kingdom is responsible on a preferential basis.  
    (b) U.S. beef exports to the United Kingdom are currently subject to
    a 20 percent tariff within a quota of 1,000 metric tons (mt). The
    United Kingdom will remove the 20 percent tariff. Additionally, the
    United Kingdom will create a preferential duty-free quota of 13,000
    mt for U.S. beef. In return, the United States will reallocate to
    the United Kingdom 13,000 mt of its existing “Other Countries”
    tariff rate quota (TRQ) for beef. Additionally, the United Kingdom
    will offer a preferential duty-free TRQ of 1.4 billion liters for
    U.S. ethanol.  
    (c) The United States intends to provide certain key UK imports with
    modified reciprocal tariff treatment, based on our balanced trading
    relationship and shared national security priorities. Any such
    modifications will be consistent with those shared national security
    priorities, including priorities identified in future U.S. Section
    232 investigations.  
    (i) The United States will create a quota of 100,000 vehicles for UK
    automotive imports at a 10 percent tariff rate, and an accompanying
    arrangement for attendant auto parts for such autos.  
    (ii) The United Kingdom will work to promptly meet U.S. requirements
    on the security of the supply chains of steel and aluminum products
    intended for export to the United States and on the nature of
    ownership of relevant production facilities. Understanding the
    United Kingdom will meet these requirements, the United States will
    promptly construct a quota at most favored nation (MFN) rates for UK
    steel and aluminum and certain derivative steel and aluminum
    products.  
    (iii) Contingent on the findings of the U.S. Section 232
    investigation on pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients, and
    consistent with the United Kingdom’s compliance with the supply
    chains security requirements described in subparagraph (ii), the
    United States and the United Kingdom intend to promptly negotiate
    significantly preferential treatment outcomes on pharmaceuticals and
    pharmaceutical ingredients. The United Kingdom confirms that it will
    endeavor to improve the overall environment for pharmaceutical
    companies operating in the United Kingdom.  
    (iv) In addition to products already addressed in this document, the
    United States and the United Kingdom intend to adopt a structured,
    negotiated approach to other  
    sectors that may be subject to Section 232 investigations or other
    tariff measures with a view to a significantly preferential outcome.
    Any such approach is contingent on the United Kingdom ensuring the
    security of supply chains, using appropriate measures, of products
    intended for export to the United States and on the findings of
    related U.S. investigations of, or other tariff measures related to,
    such sectors.  
    (d) To ensure U.S. and UK firms can benefit from these changes in
    practice, both countries intend to apply rules of origin that
    maximize bilateral trade and prevent non-participants from using our
    bilateral arrangement to circumvent tariffs. The United States
    affirms that it intends to take into consideration during the
    negotiations of the EPD the United Kingdom’s request that the United
    States continues to work to lower tariffs on UK goods imposed by
    U.S. executive authority as well as those subject to Congressional
    approval.

    comply with the importing country’s sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS)
    standards and other mutually agreed standards. The United Kingdom
    and the United States commit to working together to improve market
    access for agricultural products, to highlight concerns, and to
    increase agricultural cooperation on areas such as certain export
    verification programs to facilitate greater trade, and more formal
    bilateral engagement through international standard setting
    bodies.  
    (b) The United Kingdom and the United States each confirms its
    intent to accord to conformity assessment bodies of the other

    paragraph includes procedures, criteria, fees, and other conditions
    relating to accrediting, approving, licensing, or otherwise
    recognizing conformity assessment bodies.  
    (c) Both countries intend to build on an existing set of Mutual
    Recognition Agreements (MRAs) by negotiating additional agreements,
    as appropriate, across certain industrial goods and advance toward
    an agreement on services domestic regulation.  
    (d) The United Kingdom and United States intend to discuss the
    principles and criteria used in order to recognize a standard as an
    international standard. The United Kingdom and the United States
    will further commit to discuss respective applicable standards for
    mutually agreed sectors of interest and, within those specified
    sectors, to agree which of the other’s relevant domiciled standards
    development organizations (SDOs) currently meet recognized
    international principles.

    security, including by coordinating to address non-market policies
    of third countries.

    investment security measures, export controls, and ICT vendor
    security, building on the current levels of close alignment on trade
    and investment security measures.  
    (c) In order to ensure more competitive, reciprocal, and secure
    access to our procurement markets, both countries reaffirm their
    procurement commitments under the Agreement on Government
    Procurement (GPA) and their respective free trade agreements, and
    intend to discuss the implementation of our respective procurement
    commitments, including through the United Kingdom’s new National
    Security Unit for Procurement and the United Kingdom’s new powers
    under the Procurement Act 2023, which provides that non-“treaty
    states” are not guaranteed non-discriminatory treatment in
    procurement.  
    (d) Both countries confirm that they will negotiate as part of the
    EPD provisions on duty evasion customs cooperation to combat evasion
    schemes and the illegal transshipment of goods from countries
    subject to antidumping, countervailing duties, safeguards, etc.,
    which undermine economic security.

1.  **Commercial Considerations and Opportunities**  
    Both countries commit to continuing to identify mutually beneficial
    goods, services, investment opportunities and commercial
    transactions that serve to increase economic integration in critical
    industries and defense preparedness, leveraging government policies,
    licenses, and programs and private-sector participation to
    facilitate such transactions.

1.  **Other Matters**  
    (a) Both countries confirm that they intend to discuss high-standard
    commitments related to intellectual property rights protection and
    enforcement, labor practices (including addressing forced labor in
    supply chains), and environmental policies and practices.

    territories for whose international relations it is responsible.  
    (c) The United Kingdom and the United States recognize that the
    purpose of this arrangement is to deepen our trade relationship
    based on mutual trust and a shared commitment to fair and reciprocal
    trade. On request of either country, the United Kingdom and the
    United States will consult with a view to considering any changes
    that may need to be made to this arrangement to ensure that it
    remains mutually beneficial.  
    (d) The United States or the United Kingdom may terminate this
    arrangement by giving written notice to the other. The United
    Kingdom and the United States further plan to discuss procedures for
    review and termination as part of the negotiations of the EPD.
