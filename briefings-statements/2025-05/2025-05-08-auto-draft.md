**First Lady Melania Trump’s Remarks at a Celebration of Military
Mothers**

Motherhood: The life-changing event that makes women invincible and
exposed at the same time. It’s remarkable, really, that my son’s life
creates unimaginable, unpredictable concerns and thrills for me, even
until this day.

All caring mothers understand this rare feeling. Nothing against
fathers, of course, but in my opinion, and I am sure everyone in this
room agrees—only a mother can grasp this particular point.

Military Mothers and America, together, have developed an extraordinary,
parallel journey. They are filled with stories of personal sacrifice,
determination, loss, and healing. Certainly, only military mothers have
experienced this level of grace and resilience, of American life.

And finally, aging—a sudden shift in family dynamics, an unexpected
positioning change in life when caretakers become the caregivers. If
this has happened within your family, you understand the precious nature
of motherhood.

Here now, in the White House, at this pivotal moment, I urge you to
prioritize your well-being. Nurture yourself, for your strength is the
bedrock of a brighter future for our children. By caring for ourselves,
we empower the next generation to thrive. Together, let’s build a legacy
of resilience and hope. Your journey matters. Embrace it!

And indeed, the sacred strength of women is a profound force. With
unwavering love and nurturing wisdom, we have the ability to inspire,
uplift, and shape the future hearts of our children. This power, rooted
in compassion and resilience, is a beacon of hope that lights the way
for generations to come.

Let us unite to honor the beauty of motherhood, champion the grace of
our journey, and inspire those who follow.

A mother’s love and wisdom empower our children to flourish, instilling
in them the courage to reach their fullest potential.

Motherhood. Happy Mother’s Day!
