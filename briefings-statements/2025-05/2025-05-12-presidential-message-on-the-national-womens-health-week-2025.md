title: "Presidential Message on the National Women\u2019s Health Week, 2025"
---
 
During National Women’s Health Week, we promote and support the health
and well-being of our Nation’s mothers, daughters, sisters, wives, and
friends.    
   
From my first day in office, my Administration has worked to protect
women and girls from gender extremism and has brought common sense and
biological reality back to America. Moreover, the Make America Healthy
Again Commission was established to address the root causes of our
Nation’s health crisis—from poor nutrition and chronic diseases to
preventable conditions – issues impacting women across the nation.  By
advancing food transparency, promoting physical fitness, and restoring
health education, we are working to give women, and all Americans,
stronger futures and better quality of life.  
   
My Administration is confronting the high cost of healthcare, which
places a tremendous toll on American families.  We are working to
improve price transparency, stop surprise billing, and ensure patients
have clear information about their coverage before receiving care. 
Historic steps have been taken to lower prescription drug prices,
including capping the cost of insulin and expanding access to low-cost
generics.  By holding providers accountable and putting patients first,
we are lowering costs, improving care delivery, and restoring fairness
to the American healthcare system.   
   
This week, we reaffirm our commitment to improve women’s health so that
they may live fuller and healthier lives, ensuring that all generations
of American women thrive and continue to drive the success of our
Nation.
