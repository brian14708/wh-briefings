title: First Lady Melania Trump Welcomes Children to the White House for Take Our
  Daughters and Sons to Work Day
---
 
Today, First Lady Melania Trump welcomed children to the White House
with a patriotic arts and crafts activity in the Kennedy Garden as part
of the White House’s annual Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day
celebration. Children of staff in the Executive Office of the President
joined Mrs. Trump in decorating wooden American flags with red and blue
markers, star stickers, and fluffy red, white, & blue pom-pom balls.

“It is always special to see children’s creativity and spirit on
display, especially here at the White House where so many hardworking
men and women support the success of our Nation every day,” said First
Lady Melania Trump.

The event comes a day after Mrs. Trump joined President Trump in signing
the “TAKE IT DOWN” Act and reflects the First Lady’s BE BEST initiative,
which emphasizes the importance of supporting the well-being of children
and youth. The White House proudly hosted this activity, which
highlighted Mrs. Trump’s ongoing commitment to encouraging confidence
and the success of the next generation.
