title: "First Lady Melania Trump\u2019s Statement on the Presidential Proclamation\
  \ Honoring National Foster Care Month"
---
 
First Lady Melania Trump issued a statement supporting President Donald
J. Trump’s official Proclamation designating May 2025, as National
Foster Care Month. The date of the Proclamation is notable because May
7, 2025, also marks the anniversary of the First Lady’s Be Best
initiative, which was launched in 2018.

“I am proud of the work I have done to support the foster care community
during the past several years, and I am pleased to join my husband in
honoring the families, caregivers, and advocates who provide shelter,
stability, and inspiration to our children. I acknowledge the tireless
dedication of our American foster families who play a critical role in
helping children realize their full potential.”

First Lady Melania Trump’s Be Best initiative supports children’s
well-being, including individuals within the foster care community,
through her Fostering the Future platform. The full text of the
Presidential Proclamation on National Foster Care Month is available on
