title: "Presidential Message on National Missing Children\u2019s Day, 2025"
---
 
Every day, thousands of children are reported missing—a devastating
reality that inflicts deep scars not only on them, but also on their
loved ones, who do not know if or when they will embrace their children
again.  Tragically, this crisis was worsened by the open border policies
of the previous administration.

This National Missing Children’s Day, my Administration resolves to
protect the most innocent among us—and to strike down every predator,
trafficker, kidnapper, and abuser who targets our young people with the
full force of the law.

As President, I am successfully working to seal our southern border,
defend the dignity of all human life, and end the vicious scourge of
child sex trafficking.  One of my first actions in office was to declare
a national emergency at the southern border.  I also designated cartels
as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global
Terrorists to end their campaign of violence and mayhem. 

As we secure the border, deport criminal illegal aliens, and stop the
trafficking and smuggling of children into our country, my
Administration is doing everything in its power to recover our missing
children, and reunite them with their loved ones.  Under my leadership,
justice on our border, order in our communities, and peace in our
families is being swiftly restored.

As our Nation commemorates National Missing Children’s Day, we offer our
love, prayers, and support to those families who are searching for a
missing child.  My Administration pledges to assist our law enforcement
agencies in returning every missing child back to the comfort of their
homes and families, where they belong.  We will continue our work of
building a future where every child is safe, valued, and empowered to
lead a great American life of purpose, opportunity and fulfillment.
