title: Message on National Nurses Day, 2025
---
 
On National Nurses Day, we thank the extraordinary men and women who
have dedicated their lives to the critical and noble profession of
nursing—providing quality, compassionate, and essential care to all
patients.  
   
Nursing is our Nation’s largest healthcare profession, with an estimated
4.3 million actively licensed registered nurses.  From the frontlines of
war to our local hospitals, nurses have shown an unwavering commitment
to those in need, serving others and providing hope, help, and healing
during times of crisis.    
   
Nurses are providing critical care to millions of Americans struggling
with chronic diseases.  Six in ten Americans live with at least one
chronic disease, and four in ten are affected by two or more chronic
diseases.  These numbers have increased significantly in recent years,
causing hardships for the Americans suffering from these conditions
while putting immense pressure on our healthcare system.  My
Administration recognizes this critical issue and is committed to Making
America Healthy Again.  Through our initiative, we will address the root
causes of chronic disease, reduce its prevalence, and ensure that nurses
have the support they need in order to continue providing life-saving
care.  
   
We are also refocusing Public Service Loan Forgiveness on its original
intent of encouraging Americans to enter essential public service roles,
such as nursing.  By doing so, we hope to inspire a new generation of
Americans to pursue careers in vital public services, contributing to a
healthier, stronger Nation.  
   
Nurses reflect the character of America and epitomize the inexhaustible
capacity of the human spirit.  As we stand at the threshold of our new
Golden Age, our nurses stand ready to make America stronger and
healthier than ever before.  On this National Nurses Day, Melania and I
join with every citizen in extending our wholehearted gratitude and
utmost respect to these invaluable healthcare professionals.
