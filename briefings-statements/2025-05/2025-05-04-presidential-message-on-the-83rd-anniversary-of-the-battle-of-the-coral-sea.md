title: Presidential Message on the 83rd Anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea
---
 
Today, I extend my heartfelt greetings to the people of Australia as we
commemorate the 83rd anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea—a
pivotal moment in the fight against tyranny and a defining chapter in
the enduring alliance between our two nations.

At the height of World War II, American and Australian forces fought for
4 grueling days against enemy naval and air forces at the Coral Sea.
 Through their heroic bravery, their unwavering resolve, and the grace
of Almighty God, our Allied forces halted at great cost a major enemy
advancement for the first time in the Pacific Theatre, and sank an enemy
aircraft carrier for the first time—marking a significant turning point
in the war and paving the way for the enemy’s eventual defeat. 

As we commemorate this historic battle, we also remember the 656 Allied
service members who gave their lives for our liberty.  The courage of
those fallen heroes not only changed the course of the war but also
forged a glorious bond between the United States and Australia that
endures to this day—a friendship that remains foundational to
Indo-Pacific security and prosperity.

Today, we honor the fearless determination of those who fought at the
Coral Sea, and we solemnly remember those who laid down their lives to
secure the future of freedom.  Their sacrifice will forever be etched in
our hearts, and our nations remain eternally grateful.
