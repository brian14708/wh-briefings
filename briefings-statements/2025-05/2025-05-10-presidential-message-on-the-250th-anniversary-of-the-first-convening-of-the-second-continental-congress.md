title: Presidential Message on the 250th Anniversary of the First Convening of the
  Second Continental Congress
---
 
On this day 250 years ago, a mighty assembly of statesmen, thinkers,
lawyers, and patriots gathered at Independence Hall in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, to formally convene a revolutionary body to guide America
to its independence. On May 10, 1775, our Nation’s forefathers convened
the Second Continental Congress—a historic body that would go on to
adopt the Declaration of Independence, the grandest and most important
political document ever put to pen.  
   
Following the famous “shot heard ‘round the world” at the Battles of
Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775—the first major armed
hostilities of the Revolutionary War, in which the British Army
attempted to seize American military supplies and arrest American
leaders—it became clear to the patriots that their conflict with the
British Crown had escalated beyond mere disagreement.  Despite the
colonists’ tireless efforts on behalf of peace, war was all but
certain.  In the wake of the Boston Massacre, the imposition of the
Intolerable Acts, and the lasting injustice of taxation without
representation, Americans had formed the First Continental Congress in
the fall of 1774 to seek redress for their grievances.  By the spring of
1775, following the lives taken at Lexington and Concord, a new Congress
was convened—and America’s righteous crusade for independence was
formally underway.  
   
Comprised of true American titans like John and Samuel Adams, Thomas
Jefferson, Roger Sherman, Benjamin Franklin, John Hancock, James
Madison, John Jay, and George Washington—whom Congress later appointed
as the Commander in Chief of the Continental Army—the Second Continental
Congress was made up of some of the boldest, fiercest, and most
visionary men ever to walk the face of the Earth.  This remarkable body
would go on to preside over the Revolutionary War, establish critical
international alliances, and maintain unity among the 13 Colonies as
America secured its independence and ultimately emerged as a new
Nation.  
   
The Second Continental Congress set in motion our independence, our
venerated political traditions, and the birth of the greatest Republic
ever created.  As we commemorate 250 years since its first convening, we
recommit to the ideals of our Nation’s founding.  We summon the courage
of our Founding Fathers.  Above all, as we approach 250 years of
glorious independence, we proudly invoke the spirit of 1776 to build a
proud, hopeful, and radiant future.
