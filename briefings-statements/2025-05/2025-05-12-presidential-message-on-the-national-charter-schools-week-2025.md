title: Presidential Message on the National Charter Schools Week, 2025
---
 
From the earliest days of our Republic, great schools and teachers have
fortified the American mind and emboldened generations of students to
achieve the American Dream.  This National Charter Schools Week, my
Administration renews its commitment to defend American charter schools,
advance school choice, and protect the sacred right of every parent to
be the steward of their children’s education.  
   
Since the first American public charter school opened in 1992, charter
schools have provided children—especially those in low-income and urban
areas—with the opportunity to grow, succeed, and fulfill their God-given
potential, regardless of their zip code or financial situation.  Today,
there are more than 8,000 operational charter schools in America
empowering parents to pursue the right educational fit for their
children.  Charter school students are outperforming their peers in math
and reading—and in the overwhelming majority of states, charter school
enrollment growth is exceeding school-aged population growth.  
   
As President, I am steadfastly committed to promoting choice,
opportunity, and innovation in American classrooms.  Since taking
office, I proudly signed an Executive Order to expand educational
freedom and opportunity for families.  It is the official policy of my
Administration that parents have the fundamental right to oversee the
education, upbringing, and moral formation of their children.  
   
Last month, I also took action to create new educational and workforce
development opportunities for our Nation’s youth in the realm of
artificial intelligence, so that our children will be equipped with the
skills they need to be leaders in the digital age.  Additionally, I
signed an order directing the Secretary of Education to take all
necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of
Education—handing education authority back to the States, where it
belongs.  America’s schools should be shining examples to the rest of
the world, and my Administration will never waver in its commitment to
empowering parents and renewing safety, security, and sanity in our
classrooms.   
   
This National Charter Schools Week, we celebrate the tremendous
accomplishments of charter school students, parents, teachers, and
advocates.  We renew our pledge to support freedom in education in all
its forms, whether through homeschooling or charter, public, or
religious schools.  Above all, we remember that great schools are the
gateway to a great, hopeful, and prosperous American future.
