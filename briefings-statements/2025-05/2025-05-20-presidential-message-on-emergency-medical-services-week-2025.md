title: Presidential Message on Emergency Medical Services Week, 2025
---
 
Over 240 million times a year – nearly seven times every second – an
American in need dials 911. With one simple call, Americans can activate
a team of highly-skilled and experienced emergency medical professionals
to evaluate and administer lifesaving care anytime, anywhere.

Our Emergency Medical Service (EMS) providers are made up of ordinary
Americans who demonstrate extraordinary courage, compassion, and
devotion to duty. When seconds count and lives hang in the balance, we
can always count on EMS providers to act swiftly and valiantly in
rendering expert medical care.

While we salute and honor the service of our emergency medical
technicians, paramedics, emergency medicine nurses and physicians every
week, this National EMS Week, we pay special tribute to those who
selflessly sacrifice so others may live.

We recognize the sacrifice our EMS providers make each and every day in
every corner of our country. Whether on an ambulance or in an emergency
room, aboard aircraft or sea-faring vessels, Americans rest easy knowing
that the greatest and most field-tested medical providers anywhere in
the World are standing by to respond in a moment’s notice.

This week, my Administration honors every EMS professional who is
selflessly working on the frontlines of crisis to aid others in their
hour of need. We offer our unending gratitude to every noble
professional and volunteer whose strength, fortitude, and determination
keeps America safe.
