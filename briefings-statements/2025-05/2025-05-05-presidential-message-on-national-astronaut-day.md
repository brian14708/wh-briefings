title: Presidential Message on National Astronaut Day
---
 
Sixty-four years ago today, a brave American sat in the cockpit of the
Mercury rocket, ready to face the unknown.  After years of scientific
advancement and growing competition in space exploration, Commander Alan
B. Shepard undertook a dangerous mission that held the promise of
groundbreaking achievement, national pride, and a future defined by
American leadership in space.

With three simple words—“light this candle”—Shepard launched into the
vast expanse of space, becoming the first American to break the bounds
of Earth.  His spacecraft, *Freedom 7*, was a tribute to the seven
Project Mercury astronauts, and to one of our Nation’s founding
principles: freedom.  

That same spirit of courage, innovation, and resolve has defined
American space exploration ever since.  Just 8 years later, Neil
Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin planted the Stars and Stripes on the Moon. 
Last month, we saw the same strength again when I ordered the rescue of
stranded astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, whose 8-day mission
turned into a 286-day journey aboard the International Space Station. 
It was the vitality of our Nation’s space programs that rose to the
challenge and brought them safely home.  

As we celebrate National Astronaut Day, we honor the legacy of those who
have blazed the trail into the final frontier.  Under my leadership,
America’s space program will continue to push the boundaries of
discoveries, with bold plans for lunar missions, Mars exploration, and
beyond.  By fostering innovation, strengthening our partnerships with
private space companies, and advancing our technological capabilities,
we are ensuring that the United States remains the global leader in
space for generations to come.
