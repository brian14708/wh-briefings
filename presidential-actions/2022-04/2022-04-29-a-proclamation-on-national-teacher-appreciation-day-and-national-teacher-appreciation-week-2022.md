title: "A Proclamation on National Teacher Appreciation Day and National Teacher Appreciation\
  \ Week,\_2022"

As the husband of a lifelong educator, who continues to teach full-time
as First Lady, I have often heard Jill say:  “Teaching is not what you
do.  It’s who you are.”  Our Nation’s teachers are selfless, dedicated,
and caring individuals who devote themselves to the well-being and
progress of our students.  During this National Teacher Appreciation Day
and throughout National Teacher Appreciation Week, we honor educators
who touch the lives of students across America and who are essential to
building the future of our Nation.  
  
One of the greatest gifts our schools give to students and educators is
time spent with one another — the daily opportunities to learn and grow
together, face to face.  There is no substitute for the wisdom this
experience brings.  That is why, when I took office, I made it a
priority to reopen schools as quickly and safely as possible.  Today, I
am proud that more than 99 percent of schools are open for full-time
in-person instruction.  By following the science and making vaccines
available for students, educators, and staff, we got kids back to school
safely.  
  
My Administration is working tirelessly to support educators. The
American Rescue Plan provided a historic $122 billion investment to our
Nation’s schools so they could safely reopen for in-person instruction,
address students’ mental health needs, hire more teachers, and make up
for lost learning. Teachers have long been underpaid, and these funds
help school districts increase compensation to recruit and retain the
teachers that students need.  
      
To counter the negative impacts of the pandemic on student learning, our
educators have returned to the classroom with creative solutions.  They
have partnered with communities to implement safety measures, increase
students’ access to mental health support, and equip them with critical
life skills.  Teachers have also found new ways to address unfinished
learning and engage meaningfully with students and families.  To support
our educators, the Department of Education is offering unprecedented
resources to help teachers meet student needs.  My Administration is
also committed to strengthening pathways into the teaching profession
for future educators of color, ensuring a more diverse workforce.  
       
I will never forget the educators who encouraged me as a child.  Many of
us remember our favorite teachers — the ones who instilled confidence in
us, who encouraged us to dream boldly, and who helped us believe that we
could achieve anything.  On National Teacher Appreciation Day and during
National Teacher Appreciation Week, we pay tribute to educators who
empower students across the country with the knowledge and skills they
need to reach their potential and achieve their dreams.  
      
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States
of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 3, 2022, as
National Teacher Appreciation Day and May 1 through May 7, 2022, as
National Teacher Appreciation Week.  I call upon all Americans to
recognize the hard work and dedication of our Nation’s teachers and to
observe this day and this week by supporting teachers through
appropriate activities, events, and programs.  
      
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-sixth.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
