title: "A Proclamation Honoring the Victims of the Attack in Kabul,\_Afghanistan"
---
 
As a mark of respect for the U.S. service members and other victims
killed in the terrorist attack on August 26, 2021, in Kabul,
Afghanistan, by the authority vested in me as President of the United
States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at
half-staff at the White House and upon all public buildings and grounds,
at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of
the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the
United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset, August
30, 2021.  I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for
the same length of time at all United States embassies, legations,
consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military
facilities and naval vessels and stations.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-sixth.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
