title: Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to Export
  Control Regulations
---
 
On August 17, 2001, the President issued Executive Order 13222 pursuant
to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et
seq.)*.  In that order, the President declared a national emergency with
respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national
security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States related to
the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended. 
Because the implementation of certain sanctions authorities, including
sections 11A, 11B, and 11C of such Export Administration Act of 1979,
consistent with section 1766(b) of Public Law 115-232, the Export
Control Reform Act (50 U.S.C. 4601 note), is to be carried out under the
International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the national emergency
declared on August 17, 2001, must continue in effect beyond August 17,
2021.  Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13222, as amended by
Executive Order 13637 of March 8, 2013.

This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and transmitted
to the Congress.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

August 6, 2021.
