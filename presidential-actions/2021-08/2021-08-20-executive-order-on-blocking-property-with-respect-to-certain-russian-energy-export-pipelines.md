  Export Pipelines
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq*.) (IEEPA), the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq*.) (NEA), the
Protecting Europe’s Energy Security Act of 2019 (Title LXXV, National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020, Public Law 116-92), as
amended by section 1242 of the National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116-283) (PEESA), and section 301 of title
3, United States Code,

I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, in
order to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 14024 of April 15, 2021 (Blocking Property
With Respect To Specified Harmful Foreign Activities of the Government
of the Russian Federation), hereby order:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 1.</span>  (a)  With
respect to any foreign person identified by the Secretary of State, in
consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, in a report to the
Congress pursuant to section 7503(a)(1)(B) of PEESA, all property and
interests in property of such person that are in the United States, that
hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come
within the possession or control of any United States person are blocked
and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise
dealt in.  
     (b)  Sanctions under subsection (a) of this section shall not apply
to any foreign person with respect to whom a waiver under section
7503(f) of PEESA has been issued.  
     (c)  The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply
except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders,
directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and
notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit
granted prior to the date of this order.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 2.</span>  The Secretary
of State shall implement section 7503(b) of PEESA as it applies to
visas, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall implement section
7503(b) of PEESA as it applies to admission and parole.  Such
implementation shall be consistent with any exceptions or waivers
provided by statute, or in regulations, orders, or directives that may
be issued pursuant to this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 3.</span>  The
prohibitions in section 1 of this order include:  
     (a)  the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods,
or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and
interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and  
     (b)  the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods,
or services from any such person.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 4.</span>  (a)  Any
transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or
avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the
prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.  
     (b)  Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set
forth in this order is prohibited.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 5.</span>  I hereby
determine that the making of donations of the types of articles
specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to,
or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in
property are blocked pursuant to this order would seriously impair my
ability to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order
14024, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of
this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 6.</span>  For the
purposes of this order:  
     (a)  the term “entity” means a partnership, association, trust,
joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;  
     (b)  the term “foreign person” means an individual or entity that
is not a United States person;  
     (c)  the term “person” means an individual or entity; and  
     (d)  the term “United States person” means any United States
citizen, lawful permanent resident, entity organized under the laws of
the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States
(including foreign branches), or any person in the United States.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 7.</span>  For those
persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to
this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United
States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other
assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be
taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual.  I
therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in
addressing the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14024,
there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made
pursuant to section 1 of this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 8.</span>  The Secretary
of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby
authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and
regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA
and PEESA, as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. 
The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law,
redelegate any of these functions within the Department of the
Treasury.  All departments and agencies of the United States shall take
all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the
provisions of this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 9.</span>  Nothing in this
order shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official
business of the Federal Government or the United Nations, including its
programs, funds, and other entities and bodies, as well as its
specialized agencies and related organizations, by employees, grantees,
and contractors thereof.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 10.</span>  (a)  Nothing
in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:  
          (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department
or agency, or the head thereof; or  
          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.  
     (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
