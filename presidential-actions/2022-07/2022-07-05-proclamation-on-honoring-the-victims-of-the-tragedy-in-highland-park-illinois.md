title: "Proclamation on Honoring The Victims Of The Tragedy In Highland Park,\_Illinois"
---
 
     As a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of gun
violence perpetrated on our Independence Day, July 4, 2022, in Highland
Park, Illinois, by the authority vested in me as President of the United
States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at
half-staff at the White House and upon all public buildings and grounds,
at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of
the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the
United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset, July 9,
2022.  I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the
same length of time at all United States embassies, legations, consular
offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities
and naval vessels and stations.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of
July, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-seventh.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
