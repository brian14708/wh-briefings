title: "Message to the Congress on the Continuation of the National Emergency with\
  \ Respect to Transnational Criminal\_Organizations"

TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:

Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to significant
transnational criminal organizations that was declared in Executive
Order 13581 of July 24, 2011, under which additional steps were taken in
Executive Order 13863 of March 15, 2019, is to continue in effect beyond
July 24, 2022.

The activities of significant transnational criminal organizations
have reached such scope and gravity that they threaten the stability of
international political and economic systems.  Such organizations are
becoming increasingly sophisticated and dangerous to the United States;
they are increasingly entrenched in the operations of foreign
governments and the international financial system, thereby weakening
democratic institutions, degrading the rule of law, and undermining
economic markets.  These organizations facilitate and aggravate violent
civil conflicts and increasingly facilitate the activities of other
dangerous persons.

Significant transnational criminal organizations continue to pose an
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign
policy, and economy of the United States.  Therefore, I have determined
that it is necessary to continue the national emergency with respect
to significant transnational criminal organizations declared
in Executive Order 13581.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

    July 21, 2022
