title: "Executive Order on Establishing an Emergency Board to Investigate Disputes\
  \ Between Certain Railroads Represented by the National Carriers\u2019 Conference\
  \ Committee of the National Railway Labor Conference and Their Employees Represented\
  \ by Certain Labor\_Organizations"
---
 
     Disputes exist between certain railroads represented by the
National Carriers’ Conference Committee of the National Railway Labor
Conference and their employees represented by certain labor
organizations.  The railroads and labor organizations involved in these
disputes are designated on the attached list, which is made part of this
order.

The disputes have not heretofore been adjusted under the provisions of
the Railway Labor Act, as amended, 45 U.S.C. 151-188 (RLA).

I have been notified by the National Mediation Board that in its
judgment these disputes threaten substantially to interrupt interstate
commerce to a degree that would deprive a section of the country of
essential transportation service.

NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as President by the
Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 10 of
the RLA (45 U.S.C. 160), it is hereby ordered as follows:

Section 1.  Establishment of Emergency Board (Board).  There is
established, effective 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on July 18,
2022, a Board composed of a chair and two other members, all of whom
shall be appointed by the President to investigate and report on these
disputes.  No member shall be pecuniarily or otherwise interested in any
organization of railroad employees or any carrier.  The Board shall
perform its functions subject to the availability of funds.

Sec. 2.  Report.  The Board shall report to the President with respect
to the disputes within 30 days of its creation.

Sec. 3.  Maintaining Conditions.  As provided by section 10 of the RLA,
from the date of the creation of the Board and for 30 days after the
Board has submitted its report to the President, no change in the
conditions out of which the disputes arose shall be made by the parties
to the controversy, except by agreement of the parties.

Sec. 4.  Records Maintenance.  The records and files of the Board are
records of the Office of the President and upon the Board’s termination
shall be maintained in the physical custody of the National Mediation
Board.

Sec. 5.  Expiration.  The Board shall terminate upon the submission of
the report provided for in section 2 of this order.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

    July 15, 2022.
