title: "A Proclamation on the Death Of Abe\_Shinzo"
---
 
The longest serving Prime Minister in Japan’s history, Abe Shinzo was a
proud servant of the Japanese people and a faithful friend to the United
States.  He worked with American Presidents of both parties to deepen
the Alliance between our nations and advance a common vision for a free
and open Indo-Pacific. Even in the moment he was attacked and killed, he
was engaged in the work of democracy, to which he dedicated his life.  

As a mark of respect for the memory of Abe Shinzo, former Prime Minister
of Japan, by the authority vested in me as President of the United
States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at
half-staff at the White House and upon all public buildings and grounds,
at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels
of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the
United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset, July 10,
2022.  I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the
same length of time at all United States embassies, legations, consular
offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities
and naval vessels and stations.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of July,
in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence
of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-seventh.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
