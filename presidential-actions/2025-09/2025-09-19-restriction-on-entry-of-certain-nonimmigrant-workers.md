title: Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers
---
 
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

The H-1B nonimmigrant visa program was created to bring temporary
workers into the United States to perform additive, high-skilled
functions, but it has been deliberately exploited to replace, rather
than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor.
 The large-scale replacement of American workers through systemic abuse
of the program has undermined both our economic and national security.
 Some employers, using practices now widely adopted by entire sectors,
have abused the H-1B statute and its regulations to artificially
suppress wages, resulting in a disadvantageous labor market for American
citizens, while at the same time making it more difficult to attract and
retain the highest skilled subset of temporary workers, with the largest
impact seen in critical science, technology, engineering, and math
(STEM) fields.   
     The number of foreign STEM workers in the United States has more
than doubled between 2000 and 2019, increasing from 1.2 million to
almost 2.5 million, while overall STEM employment has only increased
44.5 percent during that time.  Among computer and math occupations, the
foreign share of the workforce grew from 17.7 percent in 2000 to 26.1
percent in 2019.  And the key facilitator for this influx of foreign
STEM labor has been the abuse of the H-1B visa.   
     Information technology (IT) firms in particular have prominently
manipulated the H-1B system, significantly harming American workers in
computer-related fields.  The share of IT workers in the H-1B program
grew from 32 percent in Fiscal Year (FY) 2003 to an average of over 65
percent in the last 5 fiscal years.  In addition, some of the most
prolific H-1B employers are now consistently IT outsourcing companies.
 Using these H 1B-reliant IT outsourcing companies provides significant
savings for employers:  one study of tech workers showed a 36 percent
discount for H-1B “entry-level” positions as compared to full-time,
traditional workers.  To take advantage of artificially low labor costs
incentivized by the program, companies close their IT divisions, fire
their American staff, and outsource IT jobs to lower-paid foreign
workers.   
     Further, the abuse of the H-1B visa program has made it even more
challenging for college graduates trying to find IT jobs, allowing
employers to hire foreign workers at a significant discount to American
workers.  These effects of abuse of H-1B visas have coincided with
increasing challenges in the labor market in which H-1B workers serve.
 According to a study from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, among
college graduates ages 22 to 27, computer science and computer
engineering majors are facing some of the highest unemployment rates in
the country at 6.1 percent and 7.5 percent, respectively — more than
double the unemployment rates of recent biology and art history
graduates.  Recent data reveals that unemployment rates among workers in
computer occupations jumped from an average of 1.98 percent in 2019 to
3.02 percent in 2025.  
     Reports also indicate that many American tech companies have laid
off their qualified and highly skilled American workers and
simultaneously hired thousands of H-1B workers.  One software company
was approved for over 5,000 H-1B workers in FY 2025; around the same
time, it announced a series of layoffs totaling more than 15,000
employees.  Another IT firm was approved for nearly 1,700 H-1B workers
in FY 2025; it announced it was laying off 2,400 American workers in
Oregon in July.  A third company has reduced its workforce by
approximately 27,000 American workers since 2022, while being approved
for over 25,000 H-1B workers since FY 2022.  A fourth company reportedly
eliminated 1,000 jobs in February; it was approved for over 1,100 H-1B
workers for FY 2025.   
     American IT workers have reported they were forced to train the
foreign workers who were taking their jobs and to sign nondisclosure
agreements about this indignity as a condition of receiving any form of
severance.  This suggests H-1B visas are not being used to fill
occupational shortages or obtain highly skilled workers who are
unavailable in the United States.    
     The high numbers of relatively low-wage workers in the H-1B program
undercut the integrity of the program and are detrimental to American
workers’ wages and labor opportunities, especially at the entry level,
in industries where such low-paid H-1B workers are concentrated.  These
abuses also prevent American employers in other industries from
utilizing the H-1B program in the manner in which it was intended:  to
fill jobs for which highly skilled and educated American workers are
unavailable.   
     The abuse of the H-1B program is also a national security threat.
 Domestic law enforcement agencies have identified and investigated
H-1B-reliant outsourcing companies for engaging in visa fraud,
conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy under the Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act, and other illicit activities to encourage
foreign workers to come to the United States.  
     Further, abuses of the H-1B program present a national security
threat by discouraging Americans from pursuing careers in science and
technology, risking American leadership in these fields.  A 2017 study
showed that wages for American computer scientists would have been 2.6
percent to 5.1 percent higher and employment in computer science for
American workers would have been 6.1 percent to 10.8 percent higher in
2001 absent the importation of foreign workers into the computer science
field.   
     It is therefore necessary to impose higher costs on companies
seeking to use the H-1B program in order to address the abuse of that
program while still permitting companies to hire the best of the best
temporary foreign workers.   
     The severe harms that the large-scale abuse of this program has
inflicted on our economic and national security demands an immediate
response.  I therefore find that the unrestricted entry into the United
States of certain foreign workers who are described in section 1 of this
proclamation would be detrimental to the interests of the United States
because such entry would harm American workers, including by
undercutting their wages.  
     Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the
Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby
ordered:   
   
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.

United States of aliens as nonimmigrants to perform services in a
specialty occupation under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of the INA, 8
U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b), is restricted, except for those aliens
whose petitions are accompanied or supplemented by a payment of $100,000
— subject to the exceptions set forth in subsection (c) of this section.

     (c)  The restriction imposed pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of
this section shall not apply to any individual alien, all aliens working
for a company, or all aliens working in an industry, if the Secretary of
Homeland Security determines, in the Secretary’s discretion, that the
hiring of such aliens to be employed as H-1B specialty occupation
workers is in the national interest and does not pose a threat to the
security or welfare of the United States.  
   
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Compliance</span>.

     (c)  The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of
State shall coordinate to take all necessary and appropriate action to
implement this proclamation and to deny entry to the United States to
any H-1B nonimmigrant for whom the prospective employer has not made the

and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.
