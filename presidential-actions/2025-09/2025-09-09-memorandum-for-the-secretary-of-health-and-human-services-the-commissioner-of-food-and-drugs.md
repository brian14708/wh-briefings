SUBJECT:       Addressing Misleading Direct-To-Consumer

               Prescription Drug Advertisements

In 1962, the Congress vested the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with
the authority to regulate prescription drug advertising.  These
advertisements can mislead the public about the risks and benefits,
encourage medications over lifestyle changes, inappropriately intervene
in the physician-patient relationship, and advantage expensive drugs
over cheaper generics.

The FDA has historically stipulated that a manufacturer, packer, or
distributor must provide the public with materially complete information
that fairly balances both the benefits and the risks of the drug.  Over
time, however, the FDA’s requirements have permitted drug companies to
include less information, particularly in broadcast advertising, and
drug manufacturer advertising has skyrocketed in recent decades.

My Administration will ensure that the current regulatory framework for
drug advertising results in fair, balanced, and complete information for
American consumers. 

The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall therefore take
appropriate action to ensure transparency and accuracy in
direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertising, including by
increasing the amount of information regarding any risks associated with
the use of any such prescription drug required to be provided in
prescription drug advertisements, to the extent permitted by applicable
law.  The Commissioner of Food and Drugs shall take appropriate action
to enforce the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act’s prescription drug
advertising provisions, and otherwise ensure truthful and non-misleading
information in direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertisements.  

This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
