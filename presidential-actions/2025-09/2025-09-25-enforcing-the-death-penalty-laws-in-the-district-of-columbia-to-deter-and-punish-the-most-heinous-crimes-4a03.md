MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

               THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY FOR THE DISTRICT

                  OF COLUMBIA

SUBJECT:       Enforcing the Death Penalty Laws in the

               District of Columbia to Deter and Punish

               the Most Heinous Crimes

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.  Federal law
provides for the death penalty for criminals found guilty of especially
aggravated crimes (18 U.S.C. 3591(a)).  Capital punishment is an
essential part of how our justice system deters and punishes the most
reprehensible crimes that often involve grotesque and lethal violence
against innocent Americans.

Restoring Federal capital punishment has been a priority for my
Administration since its first day under Executive Order 14164 of
January 20, 2025 (Restoring the Death Penalty and Protecting Public
Safety). 

This priority warrants particular emphasis given the public safety
threats in our Nation’s capital, as described in Executive Order 14333
of August 11, 2025 (Declaring a Crime Emergency in the District of
Columbia).  My Administration has undertaken numerous successful actions
to address the emergency declared and to protect public safety, as a
result of which crime in the District of Columbia has fallen
dramatically in recent weeks.  Faithful implementation of the capital
punishment laws will be part of this continuing work.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Enforcing the Law Relating to
Capital Punishment</span>.  (a)  The Attorney General and the United
States Attorney for the District of Columbia shall fully enforce Federal
law with respect to capital punishment in the District of Columbia by
seeking the death penalty in all appropriate cases where, following full
examination of the evidence and other relevant information, the
applicable factors justify a sentence of death.

\(b\)  The Attorney General and the United States Attorney for the
District of Columbia shall, to the maximum degree practicable, pursue
Federal jurisdiction with respect to cases involving crimes committed in
the District of Columbia for which the death penalty is available under
Federal law.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. 
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
