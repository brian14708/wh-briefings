title: Assuring the Security of the State of Qatar
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, and in recognition of the enduring
alliance between the United States and the State of Qatar, it is hereby
ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  Over the
years, the United States and the State of Qatar have been bound together
by close cooperation, shared interests, and the close relationship
between our armed forces.  The State of Qatar has hosted United States
forces, enabled critical security operations, and stood as a steadfast
ally in pursuit of peace, stability, and prosperity, both in the Middle
East and abroad, including as a mediator that has assisted the United
States’ attempts to resolve significant regional and global conflicts.
 In recognition of this history, and in light of the continuing threats
to the State of Qatar posed by foreign aggression, it is the policy of
the United States to guarantee the security and territorial integrity of
the State of Qatar against external attack.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Commitment</span>.  (a)  The
United States shall regard any armed attack on the territory,
sovereignty, or critical infrastructure of the State of Qatar as a
threat to the peace and security of the United States.

\(b\)  In the event of such an attack, the United States shall take all
lawful and appropriate measures — including diplomatic, economic, and,
if necessary, military — to defend the interests of the United States
and of the State of Qatar and to restore peace and stability.

\(c\)  The Secretary of War, in coordination with the Secretary of State
and the Director of National Intelligence, shall maintain joint
contingency planning with the State of Qatar to ensure a rapid and
coordinated response to any foreign aggression against the State of
Qatar.

\(d\)  The Secretary of State shall reaffirm this assurance to the State
of Qatar and coordinate with allies and partners to ensure complementary
measures of support.

\(e\)  The Secretary of State shall continue to partner with the State
of Qatar as and when appropriate for conflict resolution and mediation
in recognition of the State of Qatar ‘s extensive diplomatic and
mediation experience.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Implementation</span>.  All
executive departments and agencies shall take appropriate steps,
consistent with law, to implement this order.  

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. 
(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(d)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Department of State.
