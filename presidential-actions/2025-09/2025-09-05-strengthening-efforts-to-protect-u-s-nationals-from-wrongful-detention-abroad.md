title: Strengthening Efforts to Protect U.S. Nationals from Wrongful Detention Abroad
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the Robert Levinson
Hostage Recovery and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act (22 U.S.C. 1741
*et seq.*) (Levinson Act), it is hereby ordered: 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  The United
States must strengthen efforts to protect U.S. nationals from wrongful
detention abroad.  The United States Government is committed to using
every tool available to curb this coercive tactic used by foreign
adversaries and must hold such adversaries to account.  No American
should fear being taken as a political pawn by rogue states.  Wrongful
detentions are an affront to the rule of law and aim to undermine our
leadership on the world stage.  The United States will not tolerate
these attacks on our sovereignty and U.S. nationals. 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Designation</span>.  The
Secretary of State may designate any foreign country the government of
which directly engages in or provides support for the wrongful detention
of a U.S. national as a State Sponsor of Wrongful Detention based on one
or more of the following criteria: 

\(a\)  the wrongful detention of a U.S. national occurs in the foreign
country;

\(b\)  the government of the foreign country has failed to release a
wrongfully detained U.S. national after having been notified by the
United States that the detention has been determined wrongful by the
Secretary of State; or

\(c\)  actions taken by the government of the foreign country indicate,
based on the totality of the circumstances:

\(i\)   that the government is responsible for, complicit in, or
materially supports the wrongful detention of a U.S. national; or

\(ii\)  a pattern in which the government is responsible for, complicit
in, or materially supports the unjust or unlawful detention of third
country nationals in which cases the United States has a national
interest, using criteria similar to those used by the Department of
State in wrongful detention determinations. 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Responses</span>.  Upon
designation of a foreign country as a State Sponsor of Wrongful
Detention under section 2 of this order, the Secretary of State shall
review existing authorities to respond to and deter the actions of a
government of a foreign country as outlined in section 2 of this order
and take steps to implement the following actions, as appropriate and to
the extent consistent with law, including the Levinson Act, including: 

\(a\)  imposing sanctions available under the International Emergency
Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*); 

\(b\)  making designations under section 7031(c) of the Department of
State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2024
(division F of Public Law 118–47; 8 U.S.C. 1182 note), as carried
forward by the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2025 (division A
of Public Law 119-4), or similar provisions in subsequent acts; 

\(c\)  applying inadmissibility available under the Immigration and
Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 *et seq.*) and, as appropriate,
coordinating with the Department of Homeland Security on the enforcement
thereof; 

\(d\)  imposing geographic travel restrictions prohibiting the use of a
United States passport for travel to or through the designated country
under 22 U.S.C. 211a, Executive Order 11295 of August 5, 1966 (Rules
Governing the Granting, Issuing, and Verifying of United States
Passports), and 22 C.F.R. 51.63(a)(3); 

\(e\)  restricting assistance provided to the government of the country
under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 *et seq.*) or
any other Federal law; and  

\(f\)  restricting the export of certain goods to the country under the
Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 *et seq.*), the Export Control
Reform Act of 2018 (50 U.S.C. 4801 *et seq.*), or any other Federal law.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Termination of
Designation</span>.  The Secretary of State may terminate the
designation of a foreign country under section 2 of this order based
on: 

\(a\)  a determination by the Secretary of State that the government of
the foreign country:

(i)    has released the U.S. nationals wrongfully detained within the
territory of the foreign country; 

\(ii\)   has demonstrated changes in leadership or policies with respect
to wrongful detention; and

\(iii\)  has provided credible assurances that the government of the
foreign country will not engage or be complicit in or support acts
described in section 2 of this order; or

(b)  the discretion and direction of the President.
