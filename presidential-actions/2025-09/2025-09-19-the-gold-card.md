title: The Gold Card
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  My
Administration has worked relentlessly to undo the disastrous
immigration policies of the prior administration.  Those policies
produced a deluge of immigrants, without serious consideration of how
those immigrants would affect America’s interests.  

Most significantly, the prior administration permitted millions of
aliens to enter the United States illegally, to the detriment of public
safety, national security, and the rule of law.  International cartels,
transnational criminal organizations, terrorists, and foreign malign
actors took advantage of those open borders policies.  The prior
administration also permitted abuse of the refugee process, swamping
towns and cities with aliens and, in some cases, forcing them to declare
emergencies to combat the crisis.  

It is a priority of my Administration to realign Federal immigration
policy with the Nation’s interests by ending illegal immigration and
prioritizing the admission of aliens who will affirmatively benefit
the Nation, including successful entrepreneurs, investors, and
businessmen and women.  

To advance that policy, I hereby announce the Gold Card, a visa program
overseen by the Secretary of Commerce that will facilitate the entry of
aliens who have demonstrated their ability and desire to advance the
interests of the United States by voluntarily providing a significant
financial gift to the Nation.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Gold Card</span>.  (a)
 The Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with the Secretary of State
and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall establish a “Gold Card”
program authorizing an alien who makes an unrestricted gift to the
Department of Commerce under 15 U.S.C. 1522 (or for whom a corporation
or similar entity makes such a gift) to establish eligibility for an
immigrant visa using an expedited process, to the extent consistent with
law and public safety and national security concerns.  The requisite
gift amount shall be $1 million for an individual donating on his or her
own behalf and $2 million for a corporation or similar entity donating
on behalf of an individual.    

\(b\)  In adjudicating visa applications, the Secretary of State and the
Secretary of Homeland Security shall, consistent with applicable law,
treat the gift specified in subsection (a) of this section as evidence
of eligibility under 8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(1)(A), of exceptional business
ability and national benefit under 8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(2)(A), and of
eligibility for a national-interest waiver under 8 U.S.C.
1153(b)(2)(B).  

\(c\)  The Secretary of Commerce shall deposit the gifts contributed
under subsection (a) of this section in a separate fund in the
Department of the Treasury and use them to promote commerce and American
industry, consistent with the statutory authorities of the Department of
Commerce, *see, e.g.*, 15 U.S.C. 1512.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Implementation</span>.  The
Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of
Homeland Security shall, within 90 days of the date of this order, take
all necessary and appropriate steps to implement the Gold Card program. 
Among other things, they shall, to the extent consistent with applicable
law and their respective statutory authorities, including the limits on
the numbers of visas specified in 8 U.S.C. 1151 *et seq.*:  

\(a\)  Establish a process for application and expedited adjudication of
Gold Card petitions, visa issuance, and adjustment of status.  

(b)  Specify the date on which applicants (or sponsors if applicable)
may begin to submit gifts for consideration under the Gold Card
program.  

\(c\)  Establish a process for a Gold Card holder sponsored by a
corporation or similar entity to abandon his or her status and for the
Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to consider
the original gift as evidence of eligibility under 8 U.S.C.
1153(b)(1)(A), of exceptional business ability and national benefit
under 8 U.S.C. 1153 (b)(2)(A), and of eligibility for a
national-interest waiver under 8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(2)(B), for a different
individual specified by the corporation or similar entity.  The
transferee shall otherwise be subject to the same procedures as an
original visa applicant, including appropriate screening for public
safety and national security.  

\(d\)  Establish administrative fees to cover the cost of expedited
processing under subsection (a) of this section.  

\(e\)  Establish maintenance and transfer fees for corporations or
similar entities sponsoring individuals under the Gold Card program.

\(f\)  Consider expanding the Gold Card program to visa applicants under
8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(5).

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Severability</span>.  If any
provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any
person, is held to be invalid, the remaining provisions and applications
shall not be affected thereby.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">General
Provisions</span>.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to
impair or otherwise affect:

  
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

  
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.  

\(c\)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.  

\(d\)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Department of Commerce.

THE WHITE HOUSE,
