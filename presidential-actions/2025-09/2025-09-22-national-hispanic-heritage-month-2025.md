BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

During National Hispanic Heritage Month, we recognize the extraordinary
contributions of Hispanic-American citizens past and present — and we
honor their vibrant spirit, unyielding resilience, and inspiring
commitment to our shared American values.

Hispanic-American patriots have served on the front lines of our
military, law enforcement, border security, and in public service.  They
have enlivened our communities and enthusiastically embodied our
national promise — defending our sovereignty, protecting our flag, and
living out the eternal values of faith, family, and freedom.  Every day,
my Administration is working tirelessly to bring opportunity,
prosperity, and success to citizens of every background.

As we celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month, we recognize the
resounding strength and success of the Hispanic-American community.  We
honor their tremendous contributions to our culture, economy, and
future.  Above all, we recommit to making America stronger and greater
than ever before.

To honor the achievements of Hispanic Americans, the Congress, by Public
Law 100-402, as amended, has authorized and requested the President to
issue annually a proclamation designating September 15 through October
15 as “National Hispanic Heritage Month.”

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 15 through
October 15, 2025, as National Hispanic Heritage Month.  I call on public
officials, educators, librarians, and all Americans to observe this
month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day
of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
fiftieth.

                             DONALD J. TRUMP
