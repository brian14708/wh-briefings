title: Unlocking Cures for Pediatric Cancer with Artificial Intelligence
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose and Policy</span>.  My
Administration is committed to driving innovation to prevent and treat
childhood diseases, including through the use of artificial intelligence
(AI).  Pediatric cancer remains the leading cause of disease-related
death for children in the United States aged 1-19 years, and its
incidence has increased by more than 40 percent since 1975.

As outlined in my joint address to the Congress in March, reversing this
trend is one of the top priorities for the Make America Healthy Again
(MAHA) Commission established in Executive Order 14212 of February 13,
2025 (Establishing the President’s Make America Healthy Again
Commission).  AI presents an opportunity to more quickly achieve this
aim.

In 2019, my Administration created the Childhood Cancer Data Initiative
(CCDI), a Federal investment in childhood cancer research of $50 million
in funding every year for 10 years to address the critical need to
collect, generate, and analyze childhood cancer data.  The CCDI is
building a foundational data infrastructure, aggregating and generating
new data, and using this data to make new discoveries.

AI can be used to build upon this data initiative to produce meaningful
solutions to pediatric, adolescent, and young adulthood cancer.  This
application of AI has the potential to transform the Nation’s current
care and research approach for pediatric cancer -– as well as our
healthcare and research infrastructure more broadly –- through use of
the rich and multimodal data, secured with appropriate individual
privacy protections, to develop early and superior diagnostics, identify
cures and optimize treatments, and advance medicine that will save
lives.

For too long, we have watched our children and their families battle
cancer and its long-term chronic effects while healthcare systems often
rely on outdated technologies and can be slow to adopt certain
innovations.  We must prioritize investment in AI-enabled science, build
world-class scientific datasets, and empower researchers and clinicians
with the tools needed to translate data and AI capabilities into
improved care.  

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. *2*.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Harnessing American AI
Innovation</span>.  The MAHA Commission, in coordination with the
Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary), the Assistant to the
President for Science and Technology (APST), and the Special Advisor for
AI and Crypto, and in alignment with the implementation of America’s AI
Action Plan, shall work to develop innovative ways to utilize advanced
technologies such as AI to unlock improved diagnoses, treatments, cures,
and prevention strategies for pediatric cancer.  The initial focus shall
be on identifying opportunities to accelerate the progress of AI-driven
solutions at the CCDI, including by making data platforms and tools
available as part of the CCDI Data Ecosystem and funding research
projects at National Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Centers that
prioritize:

(a)  improving data infrastructure by consolidating data from multiple
sources for AI-ready analysis and utilizing AI to better select
participants for clinical trials;

(b)  enhancing data analysis of complex biologic systems with AI tools
to radically improve predictive modeling of patient response, disease
progression, and treatment toxicity and to turn multi-omics data and
imaging data into novel diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic
biomarkers; and

(c)  improving clinical trial design, access, and outcomes for patients
by incorporating multimodal data and using AI approaches to maximize
utilization of the information from clinical trials and improve
accessibility, recruitment, administration, conduct, and interpretation
of clinical trial results.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Increasing Investment and
Engagement in Pediatric Cancer Research and Care Infrastructure</span>.
 The MAHA Commission, in coordination with the Secretary, the Director
of the Office of Management and Budget, the Director of the National
Institutes of Health, and the APST, shall prioritize expanding pediatric
cancer research and advancements in care by identifying and implementing
strategies for:

(a)  increasing investment from existing Federal funds for the CCDI and
other Federal Government initiatives that address pediatric cancer; and

(b)  encouraging the private sector to make use of the most advanced
technologies to unlock cures for pediatric cancer, including those based
on AI, to the maximum possible extent.

<u>Sec</u>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Improving Data Sharing and
Empowering Patients</span>.  The Secretary, in consultation with the
APST, shall work to ensure that AI innovation is appropriately
integrated into current work on interoperability to maximize the
potential for electronic health record and claims data to inform private
sector and academic research and clinical trial design, while ensuring
that patients and parents control their health information.  In
addition, the Secretary shall work to finalize interoperability
standards for patient data to be used with AI that appropriately account
for structured and unstructured data and enable safe and
privacy-compliant exchanges of data.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Definition</span>.  For the
purposes of this order, “artificial intelligence” or “AI” has the
meaning set forth in 15 U.S.C. 9401(3).

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.
 (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

\(c\)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(d)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Department of Health and Human Services.
