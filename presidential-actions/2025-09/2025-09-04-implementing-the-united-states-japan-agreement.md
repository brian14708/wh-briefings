title: "Implementing The United States\u2013Japan Agreement"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq*.) (IEEPA), the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq*.), section 232 of the
Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862) (section 232),
section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and
section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby determine and
order:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.  On July
22, 2025, I announced a framework agreement between the United States
and Japan (Agreement), which lays the foundation for a new era of United
States-Japan trade relations grounded in principles of reciprocity and
our shared national interests.  The Agreement establishes a tariff
framework that levels the playing field for American producers and
accounts for American national security needs.  In my judgment, the
Agreement is necessary and appropriate to address the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports
With a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to
Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), as
amended, and to reduce or eliminate the threats to national security
found in Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of
Aluminum Into the United States), as amended; Proclamation 9705 of March
8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), as amended;
Proclamation 9888 of May 17, 2019 (Adjusting Imports of Automobiles and
Automobile Parts Into the United States), as amended; and Proclamation
10962 of July 30, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of Copper Into the United
States).  The Agreement will reduce the United States trade deficit,
boost the economy of the United States, and address the consequences of
the United States trade deficit, including by strengthening the
manufacturing and defense industrial base of the United States.

Under the Agreement, the United States will apply a baseline 15 percent
tariff on nearly all Japanese imports entering the United States,
alongside separate sector-specific treatment for automobiles and
automobile parts; aerospace products; generic pharmaceuticals; and
natural resources that are not naturally available or produced in the
United States.  This new tariff framework, combined with expanded United
States exports and investment-driven production, will help reduce the
trade deficit with Japan and restore greater balance to the overall
United States trade position.

Japan, meanwhile, will provide American manufacturing, aerospace,
agriculture, food, energy, automobile, and industrial goods producers
with breakthrough openings in market access across key sectors. 
Specifically, the Government of Japan is working toward an expedited
implementation of a 75 percent increase of United States rice
procurements within the Minimum Access rice scheme and purchases of
United States agricultural goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer,
bioethanol (including for sustainable aviation fuel), as well as other
United States products, in amounts totaling $8 billion per year.  The
Government of Japan is also working to accept for sale in Japan United
States-manufactured and United States-safety-certified passenger
vehicles without additional testing.  Separately, Japan will purchase
United States-made commercial aircraft, as well as United States defense
equipment.

Critically, unlike any other agreement in American history, the
Government of Japan has agreed to invest $550 billion in the United
States.  These investments — which will be selected by the United States
Government — will generate hundreds of thousands of United States jobs,
expand domestic manufacturing, and secure American prosperity for
generations.

In my judgment, I determine that the following actions are consistent
with the national interest of the United States and are necessary and
appropriate to address the national emergency declared in Executive
Order 14257, as amended, and to reduce or eliminate the threats to
national security found in Proclamation 9704, as amended; Proclamation
9705, as amended; Proclamation 9888, as amended; and Proclamation 10962.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Tariffs</span>.  (a)
 The additional *ad valorem* rate of duty applicable to products of
Japan shall be determined by a product’s current *ad valorem* (or *ad
valorem* equivalent) rate of duty under column 1 of the Harmonized
Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) (“Column 1 Duty Rate”).
 For a product of Japan with a Column 1 Duty Rate in the HTSUS that is
less than 15 percent, the sum of its Column 1 Duty Rate and the
additional *ad valorem* rate of duty pursuant to this order shall be 15
percent.  For a product of Japan with a Column 1 Duty Rate that is at
least 15 percent, the additional rate of duty pursuant to this order
shall be zero percent.  Treatment of specific or compound duty rates
shall be identical to the treatment provided to products of the European
Union as outlined in Executive Order 14326 of July 31, 2025 (Further
Modifying the Reciprocal Tariff Rates).  The duties described in this
subsection shall apply in lieu of the additional *ad valorem *duties
previously imposed on products of Japan under Executive Order 14257, as
amended.

(b)  Except as provided in subsection (a) of this section, the terms of
Executive Order 14257, as amended, shall continue to apply to products
of Japan.

(c)  The Secretary of Commerce (Secretary), in consultation with the
United States Trade Representative; the Secretary of Homeland Security,
acting through the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection
(CBP); and the Chair of the United States International Trade Commission
(ITC), shall determine whether modifications to the HTSUS are necessary
or appropriate to effectuate this order and may make such modifications
through notice in the *Federal Register*.

(d)  The tariffs set forth in subsection (a) of this section shall apply
retroactively to products of Japan entered for consumption or withdrawn
from warehouse for consumption on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight
time on August 7, 2025.  Any refunds shall be processed pursuant to
applicable laws and CBP’s standard procedures for such refunds.

\(e\)  The Secretary may issue rules, regulations, guidance, and
procedures to carry out the provisions of this section, including rules
for determining what are “products of Japan” for purposes of this
section.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Aerospace</span>.  (a)  With
respect to products of Japan that fall under the World Trade
Organization Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft, except for unmanned
aircraft, the tariffs imposed through the following Presidential actions
and subsequent amendments to those actions shall no longer apply, as of
the date of publication of the *Federal Register* notice described in
subsection (b) of this section:

\(i\)    Executive Order 14257, as amended;

\(ii\)   Proclamation 9704, as amended;

\(iii\)  Proclamation 9705, as amended; and

(iv)   Proclamation 10962.

*Federal Register*, the Secretary, in consultation with the Chair of the
ITC and the Commissioner of CBP, shall publish a notice in the *Federal
Register* modifying the HTSUS consistent with this section.

\(c\)  The Secretary may issue rules, regulations, guidance, and
procedures to carry out the provisions of this section, including rules
for determining what are “products of Japan” for purposes of this
section.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Automobiles and Automobile
Parts</span>.  (a)  As of the date of publication of the *Federal
Register* notice described in subsection (b) of this section, in lieu of
the additional section 232 *ad valorem *duties imposed on products of
Japan in Proclamation 10908 of March 26, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of
Automobiles and Automobile Parts Into the United States), as amended,
the additional *ad valorem* rate of duty applicable to an automobile or
automobile part that is a product of Japan and subject to duties under
Proclamation 10908, as amended, shall be determined by the product’s
Column 1 Duty Rate.  For a product of Japan with a Column 1 Duty Rate
that is less than 15 percent, the sum of its Column 1 Duty Rate and the
additional automobile or automobile part section 232 *ad valorem* rate
of duty pursuant to this order shall be 15 percent.  For a product of
Japan with a Column 1 Duty Rate that is at least 15 percent, the
additional automobile or automobile part section 232 *ad valorem* rate
of duty imposed shall be zero percent.

\(b\)  Within 7 days of the date of publication of this order in the
*Federal Register*, the Secretary, in consultation with the Chair of the
ITC and the Commissioner of CBP, shall publish a notice in the *Federal
Register* modifying the HTSUS consistent with this section.

procedures to carry out the provisions of this section, including rules
for determining whether automobiles and automobile parts are “products
of Japan” for purposes of this section.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Products Not Subject to
Reciprocal Tariffs</span>.  (a)  To implement the terms of the
Agreement, the Secretary is authorized to modify the reciprocal tariff
rate imposed under Executive Order 14257, as amended, to zero percent
for products of Japan that are natural resources unavailable (or
unavailable at sufficient scale to satisfy domestic demand) in the
United States, generic pharmaceuticals, generic pharmaceutical
ingredients, and generic pharmaceutical chemical precursors.

\(b\)  In determining when and for which products to modify the
reciprocal tariff rate to zero percent, the Secretary shall act in a
manner consistent with the national interests of the United States; the
purposes of this order; the need to deal with the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 14257, as amended; and the need to reduce or
eliminate the threats to national security that I found pursuant to
section 232.  The Secretary shall also consider factors he deems
appropriate, including the scope and nature of the commitments of the
Government of Japan under the Agreement; the scope and nature of the
commitments of the United States under the Agreement; the actions taken
by the Government of Japan to implement its commitments under the
Agreement; and the actions taken by the United States to implement its
commitments under the Agreement.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Monitoring and
Modifications</span>.  (a)  The Secretary shall monitor the progress of
Japan’s implementation of its commitments under the Agreement and shall,
from time to time, update me on the status of Japan’s implementation.

(b)  Should Japan fail to implement its commitments under the Agreement,
I may modify this order as necessary to deal with the emergency declared
in Executive Order 14257, as amended, and to reduce or eliminate the
threats to national security found in Proclamation 9704, as amended;
Proclamation 9705, as amended; Proclamation 9888, as amended; and
Proclamation 10962.

and to employ all powers granted to the President, including those
