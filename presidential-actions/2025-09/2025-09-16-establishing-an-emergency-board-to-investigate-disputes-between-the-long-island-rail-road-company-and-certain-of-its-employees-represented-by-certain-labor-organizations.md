  Rail Road Company and Certain of its Employees Represented by Certain Labor Organizations

Disputes exist between the Long Island Rail Road Company and certain of
its employees represented by certain labor organizations.  The labor
organizations involved in these disputes are the Transportation
Communications Union, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and
Trainmen, the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, the International

the Railway Labor Act, as amended, 45 U.S.C. 151-188 (RLA). 

Parties empowered by the RLA have requested that the President establish
an emergency board pursuant to section 9A of the RLA (45 U.S.C. 159a). 

Section 9A(c) of the RLA provides that the President, upon such request,
shall appoint an emergency board to investigate and report on the
disputes.
