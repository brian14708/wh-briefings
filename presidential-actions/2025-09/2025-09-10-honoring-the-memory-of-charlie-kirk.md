title: Honoring the Memory of Charlie Kirk
---
 
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a mark of respect for the memory of Charlie Kirk, by the authority
vested in me as President of the United States by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order that the flag
of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and
upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval
stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the
District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its
Territories and possessions until sunset, September 14, 2025.  I also
direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same length of
time at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and
other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval
vessels and stations.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
fiftieth.

                              DONALD J. TRUMP
