**IV. Timeline for delivery**

The Participants intend to establish and convene a Ministerial-Level
Working Group within six months of the date this MOU becomes operative.
 The Working Group is intended to serve as a strategic forum to guide
bilateral cooperation, set priorities, and oversee the implementation of
joint initiatives.  Furthermore, within twelve months of the date this
MOU becomes operative, and every year thereafter, the Participants
intend to convene formal discussions to assess progress under this MOU
and determine the scope and direction of the subsequent phase of
collaborative programs, taking into account emerging opportunities,
policy developments, and shared strategic interests.
