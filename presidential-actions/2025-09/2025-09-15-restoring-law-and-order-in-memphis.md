SUBJECT:       Restoring Law and Order in Memphis

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.  The city
of Memphis, Tennessee, is suffering from tremendous levels of violent
crime that have overwhelmed its local government’s ability to respond
effectively.  This situation has become dire in one of our Nation’s most
historic cities.  According to data from the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, Memphis in 2024 had the highest rate of violent crime per
capita, including some of the highest per capita rates of murder,
robbery, and aggravated assault, and property crimes such as burglary,
larceny, and motor vehicle theft, in the country.  The city, a beacon of
American culture that was Elvis’s home and is often called the
birthplace of rock and roll and the blues, should be safe and secure for
all of its citizens and Americans who visit its historic landmarks such
as Graceland, Beale Street, and the Memphis Pyramid.  To restore public
safety and order, State and local leaders have requested Federal
assistance, and I will act quickly to ensure that Federal authorities
assist Memphis law enforcement to the fullest possible extent.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Memphis Safe Task
Force</span>.  (a)  There is hereby established a Memphis Safe Task
Force (Task Force), whose objective shall be to end street and violent
crime in Memphis to the greatest possible extent through the promotion
and facilitation of hypervigilant policing, aggressive prosecution,
complex investigations, financial enforcement, and large-scale
saturation of besieged neighborhoods with law enforcement personnel, and
which shall coordinate closely with State officials in Tennessee and
local officials in Memphis to share information, develop joint
priorities, and maximize resources to make Memphis safe and restore
public order.  The Task Force shall be chaired by an individual selected
and appointed by the Attorney General, who shall direct all Task Force
functions and who shall coordinate with the Assistant to the President
and Homeland Security Advisor.  The Task Force shall also include
representatives from the following executive departments and agencies
(agencies), as designated by the head of the relevant agency:

(i)     the Department of the Treasury;

Task Force determines.  The head of an agency designated by the Chairman

\(c\)  The Task Force may, to the extent permitted by law, request
operational assistance from and coordinate with the Memphis Police
Department, the Tennessee Highway Patrol, the Memphis Area Transit
Authority, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, the Tennessee

Attorney’s Office, the Memphis City Prosecutor’s Office, the Shelby
County Sheriff’s Office, Shelby County Pretrial Services, the Shelby
County Probation Section, and other Federal, State, and local officials
as appropriate.

\(d\)  The Task Force shall utilize the strategies and principles of
Federal, State, and local law enforcement coordination developed and
deployed pursuant to Executive Order 14252 of March 27, 2025 (Making the
District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful), and Executive Order 14333 of
August 11, 2025 (Declaring a Crime Emergency in the District of
Columbia), as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to
coordinate and ensure effective integrated action by Federal, State, and
local law enforcement authorities to address extensive and pervasive
criminal activity and reduce crime in Memphis; enforce Federal
immigration law; provide the Memphis Police Department with assistance
to facilitate the recruitment, retention, and enhancement of
capabilities of its police officers; dramatically increase the Federal,
State, and local law enforcement presence and Federal coordination with
State and local law enforcement, as appropriate; and coordinate strict
enforcement of applicable quality-of-life, nuisance, and public-safety
laws, including those laws prohibiting assault, battery, larceny,
graffiti and other vandalism, unpermitted disturbances and
demonstrations, noise, trespassing, public intoxication, drug
possession, sale, vagrancy and use, and traffic violations, to make
Memphis safe and secure again.

\(e\)  The Task Force shall report to me as necessary through the
Assistant to the President and Homeland Security Advisor regarding
safety in Memphis and the tasks set forth in subsection (d) of this
section.  As part of this reporting, the Attorney General, in
consultation with the Task Force, shall assess whether public-safety
circumstances in Memphis require additional executive action.

 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Mobilizing the National Guard
to Protect Memphis</span>. (a)  The Secretary of War shall request that
the Governor of Tennessee, under section 502 of title 32, United States
Code, make available National Guard units of Tennessee to support public
safety and law enforcement operations in Memphis, in such numbers and
for such duration as the Governor may deem necessary and appropriate to
assist with the activities of the Task Force.  The Attorney General and
the Secretary of Homeland Security shall request such National Guard
support as necessary and appropriate to accomplish this mission.

\(b\)  The Secretary of War is further authorized to coordinate with
State Governors and authorize the mobilization and training of further
National Guard personnel, under section 502 of title 32, United States
Code, to support the activities of the Task Force as he may deem
necessary and appropriate to augment this mission.
