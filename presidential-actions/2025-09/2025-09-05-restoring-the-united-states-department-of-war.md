title: Restoring the United States Department of War
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<u>Section</u> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  On August 7,
1789, 236 years ago, President George Washington signed into law a bill
establishing the United States Department of War to oversee the
operation and maintenance of military and naval affairs.  It was under
this name that the Department of War, along with the later formed
Department of the Navy, won the War of 1812, World War I, and World War
II, inspiring awe and confidence in our Nation’s military, and ensuring
freedom and prosperity for all Americans.  The Founders chose this name
to signal our strength and resolve to the world.  The name “Department
of War,” more than the current “Department of Defense,” ensures peace
through strength, as it demonstrates our ability and willingness to
fight and win wars on behalf of our Nation at a moment’s notice, not
just to defend.  This name sharpens the Department’s focus on our own
national interest and our adversaries’ focus on our willingness and
availability to wage war to secure what is ours.  I have therefore
determined that this Department should once again be known as the
Department of War and the Secretary should be known as the Secretary of
War. 

<u>Sec</u>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Implementation</span>.  (a) 
The Secretary of Defense is authorized the use of this additional
secondary title — the Secretary of War — and may be recognized by that
title in official correspondence, public communications, ceremonial
contexts, and non-statutory documents within the executive branch. 

(b)  The Department of Defense and the Office of the Secretary of
Defense may be referred to as the Department of War and the Office of
the Secretary of War, respectively, in the contexts described in
subsection (a) of this section.

(c)  The provisions of this section shall also apply, as appropriate, to
subordinate officials within the Department of Defense, who may use
corresponding secondary titles such as Deputy Secretary of War or Under
Secretary of War in the contexts described in subsection (a) of this
section.

(d)  All executive departments and agencies shall recognize and
accommodate the use of such secondary titles in internal and external
communications, provided that the use of such titles does not create
confusion with respect to legal, statutory, or international
obligations.

\(e\)  Statutory references to the Department of Defense, Secretary of
Defense, and subordinate officers and components shall remain
controlling until changed subsequently by the law.

(f)  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of War
shall submit to the President, through the Assistant to the President
for National Security Affairs, a notification for transmittal to the
Congress of any office, executive department or agency, component, or
command that begins using a secondary Department of War designation.

(g)  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of War
shall submit to the President, through the Assistant to the President
for National Security Affairs, a recommendation on the actions required
to permanently change the name of the Department of Defense to the
Department of War.  This recommendation shall include the proposed
legislative and executive actions necessary to accomplish this renaming.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. 
(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(d)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Department of War.
