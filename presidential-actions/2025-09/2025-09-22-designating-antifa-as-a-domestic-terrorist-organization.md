title: Designating Antifa as a Domestic Terrorist Organization
---
 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Antifa as a Terrorist
Threat</span>.  Antifa is a militarist, anarchist enterprise that
explicitly calls for the overthrow of the United States Government, law
enforcement authorities, and our system of law.  It uses illegal means
to organize and execute a campaign of violence and terrorism nationwide
to accomplish these goals.  This campaign involves coordinated efforts
to obstruct enforcement of Federal laws through armed standoffs with law
enforcement, organized riots, violent assaults on Immigration and
Customs Enforcement and other law enforcement officers, and routine
doxing of and other threats against political figures and activists.
 Antifa recruits, trains, and radicalizes young Americans to engage in
this violence and suppression of political activity, then employs
elaborate means and mechanisms to shield the identities of its
operatives, conceal its funding sources and operations in an effort to
frustrate law enforcement, and recruit additional members.  Individuals
associated with and acting on behalf of Antifa further coordinate with
other organizations and entities for the purpose of spreading,
fomenting, and advancing political violence and suppressing lawful
political speech.  This organized effort designed to achieve policy
objectives by coercion and intimidation is domestic terrorism.

 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Designation as a Domestic
Terrorist Organization</span>.  Because of the aforementioned pattern of
political violence designed to suppress lawful political activity and
obstruct the rule of law, I hereby designate Antifa as a “domestic
terrorist organization.”  All relevant executive departments and
agencies shall utilize all applicable authorities to investigate,
disrupt, and dismantle any and all illegal operations — especially those
involving terrorist actions — conducted by Antifa or any person claiming
to act on behalf of Antifa, or for which Antifa or any person claiming
to act on behalf of Antifa provided material support, including
necessary investigatory and prosecutorial actions against those who fund
such operations.

 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. 
(a)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law. 
This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(b)  This order shall be published in the *Federal Register.*

THE WHITE HOUSE,
