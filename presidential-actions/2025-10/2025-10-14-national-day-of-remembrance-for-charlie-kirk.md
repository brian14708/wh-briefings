title: National Day of Remembrance for Charlie Kirk

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

On the afternoon of Wednesday, September 10, 2025, pure evil struck when
the legendary Charlie Kirk was assassinated in broad daylight in a
campus courtyard, triggering a groundswell of righteous fury all across
our land.  Today, our Nation honors the immortal memory of Charlie — a
father, a husband, a Christian martyr, and a titan of the American
conservative movement.  We honor his life, we send our condolences to
his beautiful family, and we pledge to advance the values for which he
laid down his life.

Every day, Charlie devoted himself to a set of simple causes:  Defending
the truth, encouraging debate, and spreading the Gospel of Jesus
Christ.  He was gracious and articulate beyond measure, always welcomed
opposing perspectives, and never deviated from his noble goal of
bridging our political, cultural, and philosophical divides.

As we mourn this extraordinary loss, my Administration will continue to
do everything in its power to end this devastating wave of political
violence.  No civilized country can endure a culture where open debate
is met with gunfire, the pursuit of truth is met with bloodshed, and
love of country is met with seething hatred.  In Charlie’s absence, we
are now tasked with continuing his mission of giving voice to our
cherished American ideals with confidence and clarity.  Like him, we
must not flinch in the face of darkness and hostility — and we must
never waver in speaking the truth with joyful and steadfast resolve.

Today, on what would have been his 32nd birthday, our Nation honors the
loving memory of Charlie Kirk.  We offer our condolences to his
beautiful wife, Erika, and two precious children.  We call on every
American to pray for peace in our public square.  Above all, we renew
our resolve to always defend our principles of truth, faith, and the
open exchange of ideas.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 14, 2025, as a
National Day of Remembrance for Charlie Kirk.  I call on the American
people to assemble on this day in their respective places of worship,
there to pay homage to Charlie’s memory.  I invite the people of our
Nation to pray for the advancement of peace, truth, and justice all
across our country.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
fiftieth.

                             DONALD J. TRUMP
