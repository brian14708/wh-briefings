MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY

THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET

THE ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT FOR NATIONAL SECURITY AFFAIRS

THE ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT AND HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISOR

SUBJECT:       Construction of Arctic Security Cutters

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  The United
States faces an urgent and growing threat in the Arctic region posed by
strategic competition, aggressive military posturing, and economic
encroachment by foreign adversaries.  These actions undermine United
States sovereignty; jeopardize critical shipping lanes; and threaten
energy, mineral, and national defense interests.

The United States Coast Guard’s fleet of icebreakers and Arctic-capable
vessels remains insufficient to meet current operational demands and
presents a national security risk.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Restriction on Construction of
Vessels in Foreign Shipyards</span>.  (a)  Pursuant to 14 U.S.C. 1151(b)
and 10 U.S.C. 8679(b), I find that it is in the national security
interest of the United States to construct up to four Arctic Security
Cutters (ASCs) abroad.  Within 60 days of the date of this memorandum,
the United States Coast Guard, through the Secretary of Homeland
Security, informed by the Icebreaker Collaboration Effort, shall submit
to the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the
Assistant to the President and Homeland Security Advisor, and the
Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a plan to phase
the construction of ASCs in a manner that promotes the on-shoring of
expertise necessary to build follow-on icebreakers domestically.

\(b\)  This memorandum shall not preclude continued investment in the
United States industrial base or future domestic construction of ASCs.
 Rather, it is a time-limited measure to bridge a critical capability
gap.

(c)  The Director of OMB shall transmit this memorandum to the Congress
consistent with 14 U.S.C. 1151(b) and 10 U.S.C. 8679(b)(2).

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Termination and Sunset
Clause</span>.  This authorization shall terminate 4 years from the date
of this memorandum unless extended by the President or terminated
earlier through appropriate Presidential action.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.
 (a)  Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or
otherwise affect:

\(i\)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or
agency, or the head thereof; or

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary,
administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\)  This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable
law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

\(c\)  This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in
equity by any party against the United States, its departments,
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other
person.
