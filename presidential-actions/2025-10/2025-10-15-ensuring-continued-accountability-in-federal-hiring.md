title: Ensuring Continued Accountability in Federal Hiring
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.  In just 8
months, my Administration has dramatically reduced the size of the
Federal workforce, improving the efficient delivery of Government
services while prioritizing hiring in national security, immigration
enforcement, public safety, and other roles that further my
Administration’s priorities and benefit American taxpayers.  The results
of this approach have surpassed the ratio of four departures for each
new hire set forth in Executive Order 14210 of February 11, 2025
(Implementing the President’s “Department of Government Efficiency”
Workforce Optimization Initiative).  To protect and expand upon these
historic improvements, and to ensure that the Federal Government is
optimally staffed to meet critical mission needs and implement the
agenda that the American people elected me to pursue, Federal hiring
shall be subject to the following policies and procedures going forward.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policies and Procedures to
Govern Federal Hiring</span>.  No Federal civilian position that is
vacant may be filled, and no new position may be created, except as
provided for in this order or required by applicable law.  Except as set
forth in section 3 of this order, this policy applies to all executive
departments and agencies (agencies) regardless of their sources of
operational or programmatic funding.

(a)  Compliance with the Merit Hiring Plan.  Any Federal hiring shall be
consistent with the Merit Hiring Plan issued by the Assistant to the
President for Domestic Policy and the Director of the Office of
Personnel Management (OPM) on May 29, 2025, pursuant to Executive Order
14170 of January 20, 2025 (Reforming the Federal Hiring Process and
Restoring Merit to Government Service).

(b)  Strategic Hiring Committees.  Within 30 days of the date of this
order, each agency head shall establish a Strategic Hiring Committee to
approve the creation or filling, as applicable, of each vacancy within
their agency.  The Strategic Hiring Committee shall include the deputy
agency head and the chief of staff to the agency head, along with such
other senior officials as the agency head may designate.  The Strategic
Hiring Committee shall ensure that agency hiring is consistent with the
national interest, agency needs, and the priorities of my
Administration.  Agency Strategic Hiring Committees shall provide
written notice of approved hires to OPM following the approval of such
hires.

(c)  Annual Staffing Plans and Quarterly Updates.

(i)    Within 60 days of the date of this order, each agency shall
prepare an Annual Staffing Plan, in coordination with OPM and the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB), to ensure that new career appointments
in the upcoming fiscal year are in the highest-need areas and aligned
with the priorities of my Administration.  Agencies shall submit final
Annual Staffing Plans to OPM and OMB.  In these plans, agencies shall
seek to improve operational efficiency; eliminate duplicative or
unnecessary functions and positions; reduce unnecessary or low-value
contractor positions; promote employee accountability; enhance delivery
of essential services; appropriately prioritize hiring for national
security, homeland security, and public safety positions; and implement
the recruitment initiatives described in the Merit Hiring Plan.  Going
forward, agencies shall prepare, in coordination with OPM and OMB,
Annual Staffing Plans to implement at the start of each new fiscal year.

(ii)   Agencies shall comply with the Annual Staffing Plans throughout
the fiscal year, but agencies may update their plans during the course
of the year based on enactment of relevant appropriations or authorizing
legislation, or otherwise amend their plans in coordination with OPM and
OMB.

(iii)  Agencies shall submit updates to OPM and OMB at the beginning of
each quarter, beginning with the second quarter of the 2026 fiscal year,
showing progress in implementing their Annual Staffing Plans.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Exceptions</span>.  (a)  This
order does not apply to:

(ii)   non-career positions requiring Presidential appointment or Senate
confirmation;

(iii)  non-career positions in the Senior Executive Service;

(iv)   Schedule C or Schedule G positions in the excepted service;

\(vii\)  appointment of officials through temporary organization hiring
authority pursuant to section 3161 of title 5, United States Code.

(b)  This order does not limit or prohibit the appointment or hiring of
any other non-career employees or officials if approved by an agency
head appointed by the President or another official appointed by the
President.

(c)  This order does not limit or prohibit any appointment or hiring
specifically approved by the head of an executive department, as defined
in 5 U.S.C. 101.  OPM may also authorize the head of an independent
establishment, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 104, to use this exception.

(d)  This order does not limit or prohibit the hiring of personnel where
such a limit or prohibition would conflict with applicable law.

(e)  The Director of OPM may grant appropriate exemptions from this
order.  Exemptions previously granted by OPM under the Presidential
Memoranda of January 20, 2025 (Hiring Freeze), and July 7, 2025
(Ensuring Accountability and Prioritizing Public Safety in Federal
Hiring), shall remain in effect unless withdrawn by OPM.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Report</span>.  Within 180
days of the date of this order, the Director of OMB and the Director of
OPM shall submit a joint report to the President, through the Assistant
to the President for Domestic Policy, regarding implementation of this
order, including a recommendation as to whether any of its provisions
should be modified or terminated.

affect:

agency, or the head thereof; or

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary,
administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law

services; and protect national security, homeland security, and public
safety.

(e)  This order shall not adversely impact the provision of Social
Security, Medicare, or veterans’ benefits.    

(f)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(g)  If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision
to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of
this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or
circumstances shall not be affected thereby.
