MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF WAR

              THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET

SUBJECT:       Use of Available Department of War Funds for Military Pay
and Allowances during the Lapse in Annual Appropriations

The current appropriations lapse, which includes a lapse in the annual
appropriations that the Congress provides for the pay and allowances of
military personnel, is now in its fifteenth day.  Further, congressional
leaders have indicated that political negotiations have stalemated and
that the passage of the necessary bipartisan legislation to end the
lapse is unlikely to occur before our active duty military personnel are
scheduled to receive their next paychecks on October 15th.  This
potential outcome presents a serious and unacceptable threat to military
readiness and the ability of our Armed Forces to protect and defend our
Nation. 

Accordingly, as the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United
States under Article 2 of the United States Constitution, I direct the
Secretary of War, in coordination with the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget, to use for the purpose of pay and allowances any
funds appropriated by the Congress that remain available for expenditure
in Fiscal Year 2026 to accomplish the scheduled disbursement of military
pay and allowances for active duty military personnel, as well as for
Reserve component military personnel who have performed active service
during the relevant pay period.  Funds used for military pay and
allowances during the current lapse should be those that the Secretary
of War determines are provided for purposes that have a reasonable,
logical relationship to the pay and allowances of military personnel,
consistent with applicable law, including 31 U.S.C. 1301(a). 

At the conclusion of the current lapse in appropriations, every effort
should be made, as authorized by law, to adjust applicable funding
accounts within the Department of War to ensure the continuation of
Department of War operations and activities consistent with planned
expenditures prior to the lapse. 

                             DONALD J. TRUMP
