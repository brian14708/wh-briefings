title: Decision of the President and Statement of Reasons on 2025 Ambler Road Appeal
---
 
I approve the appeal made by the applicant Alaska Industrial Development
and Export Authority (AIDEA) on June 6, 2025, under section 1106(a) of
the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) and approve
AIDEA’s 2016 revised consolidated application for a transportation
system known as the Ambler Road Project for the reasons explained in the
following Statement of Reasons.  In making my decision, I have
considered all relevant information as necessary and appropriate in
accordance with section 1106(a)(2) of the ANILCA.

Accordingly, I direct each Federal agency concerned to promptly issue
such authorizations as are necessary with respect to the establishment
of the Ambler Road Project.  The details of the manner in which these
authorizations must be issued are addressed in the Statement of Reasons.

                                                DONALD J. TRUMP

Dated: October 6, 2025
