title: Additional Recissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>. 
In Executive Order 14148 of January 20, 2025 (Initial Rescissions of
Harmful Executive Orders and Actions), I rescinded 78 Presidential
orders and memoranda issued by then-President Biden.  I also directed
the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, the Assistant to the
President for Economic Policy, and the Assistant to the President for
National Security Affairs to compile lists of additional orders,
memoranda, and proclamations issued by the prior administration that
should be rescinded.  I have determined that the following additional
rescissions are necessary to advance the policy of the United States to
restore common sense to the Federal Government and unleash the potential
of American citizens.
