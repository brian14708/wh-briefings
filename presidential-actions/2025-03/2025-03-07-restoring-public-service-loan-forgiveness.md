title: Restoring Public Service Loan Forgiveness
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  In 2007, the
Congress established the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program
to encourage Americans to enter the public service sector by promising
to forgive their remaining student loans after they completed 10 years
of service in those jobs while making 10 years of minimum payments.  

The prior administration abused the PSLF Program through a waiver
process, using taxpayer funds to pay off loans for employees still years
away from the statutorily required number of payments.  Moreover,
instead of alleviating worker shortages in necessary occupations, the
PSLF Program has misdirected tax dollars into activist organizations
that not only fail to serve the public interest, but actually harm our
national security and American values, sometimes through criminal
means.  The PSLF Program also creates perverse incentives that can
increase the cost of tuition, can load students in low-need majors with
unsustainable debt, and may push students into organizations that hide
under the umbrella of a non-profit designation and degrade our national
interest, thus requiring additional Federal funding to correct the
negative societal effects caused by these organizations’ federally
subsidized wrongdoing.  

As President of the United States, I have a duty to protect, preserve,
and defend the Constitution and our national security, which includes
ending the subsidization of illegal activities, including illegal
immigration, human smuggling, child trafficking, pervasive damage to
public property, and disruption of the public order, which threaten the
security and stability of the United States.  Accordingly, it is the
policy of my Administration that individuals employed by organizations
whose activities have a substantial illegal purpose shall not be
eligible for public service loan forgiveness.       
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Restoring Public Service Loan
Forgiveness</span>.  The Secretary of Education shall propose revisions
to 34 C.F.R. 685.219, Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, in
coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury as appropriate, that
ensure the definition of “public service” excludes organizations that
engage in activities that have a substantial illegal purpose,
including:  

(a)  aiding or abetting violations of 8 U.S.C. 1325 or other Federal
immigration laws;  

(b)  supporting terrorism, including by facilitating funding to, or the
operations of, cartels designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations
consistent with 8 U.S.C. 1189, or by engaging in violence for the
purpose of obstructing or influencing Federal Government policy;  

\(c\)  child abuse, including the chemical and surgical castration or
mutilation of children or the trafficking of children to so-called
transgender sanctuary States for purposes of emancipation from their
lawful parents, in violation of applicable law;  

\(d\)  engaging in a pattern of aiding and abetting illegal
discrimination; or  

\(e\)  engaging in a pattern of violating State tort laws, including
laws against trespassing, disorderly conduct, public nuisance,
vandalism, and obstruction of highways.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.  (a)
 Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:  
          (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department
or agency, or the head thereof; or  
          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.  

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.  

\(c\)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
