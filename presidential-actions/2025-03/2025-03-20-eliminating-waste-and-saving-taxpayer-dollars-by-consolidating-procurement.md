title: Eliminating Waste and Saving Taxpayer Dollars by Consolidating Procurement
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  The Federal
Government spends approximately $490 billion per year on Federal
contracts for common goods and services — the types of goods and
services purchased by nearly every executive department and agency
(agencies) — making it the largest buyer of goods and services in the
world.  As a matter of sound management, these standardized procurement
functions should be carried out in the most efficient and effective
manner possible for the American taxpayer.The General Services
Administration was established in 1949 through the Federal Property and
Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 101 *et seq.*, to provide “an
economical and efficient system” for the core procurement services for
agencies (40 U.S.C. 101).  It is time to return the General Services
Administration to its original purpose, rather than continuing to have
multiple agencies and agency subcomponents separately carry out these
same functions in an uncoordinated and less economical fashion.  
Consolidating domestic Federal procurement in the General Services
Administration — the agency designed to conduct procurement — will
eliminate waste and duplication, while enabling agencies to focus on
their core mission of delivering the best possible services for the
American people.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Definitions</span>.  For the
purposes of this order:  
(a)  “Administrator” means the Administrator of General Services.  
(b)  “Agency” has the meaning given to it in section 3502 of title 44,
United States Code, except that such term does not include the Executive
Office of the President or any components thereof.  
(c)  “Agency head” means the highest-ranking official of an agency, such
as the Secretary, Administrator, Chairman, or Director.  
(d)  “Common goods and services” means the common Government-wide
categories defined by the Category Management Leadership Council led by
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  
(e)  “Indefinite delivery contract vehicle” means an agreement through
which an agency can order goods and services over a defined period
without setting forth quantities or a delivery schedule up front.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Procurement
Consolidation</span>.  (a)  Within 60 days of the date of this order,
agency heads shall, in consultation with the agency’s senior procurement
officials, submit to the Administrator proposals, pursuant to 40 U.S.C.
101, 40 U.S.C. 501, or other relevant authorities, to have the General
Services Administration conduct domestic procurement with respect to
common goods and services for the agency, where permitted by law.

(b)  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Administrator shall
submit a comprehensive plan to the Director of OMB for the General
Services Administration to procure common goods and services across the
domestic components of the Government, where permitted by law.

(c)  Within 30 days of the date of this order, pursuant to the authority
in 40 U.S.C. 11302(e), the Director of OMB shall designate the
Administrator as the executive agent for all Government-wide acquisition
contracts for information technology.  The Administrator, in
consultation with the Director of OMB, shall defer or decline the
executive agent designation for Government-wide acquisition contracts
for information technology when necessary to ensure continuity
of service or as otherwise appropriate.  The Administrator
shall further, on an ongoing basis and consistent with applicable law,
rationalize Government-wide indefinite delivery contract vehicles for
information technology for agencies across the Government, including as
part of identifying and eliminating contract duplication, redundancy,
and other inefficiencies. 

(d)  Within 14 days of the date of this order, the Director of OMB shall
issue a memorandum to agencies implementing subsection (c) of this
section.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. 
(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:  
 (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency,
or the head thereof; or  
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.  
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
