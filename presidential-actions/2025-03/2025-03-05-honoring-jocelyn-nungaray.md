title: Honoring Jocelyn Nungaray
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  
  
        <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1.</span> 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose and Policy</span>.  The
prior administration’s immigration policies inexcusably endangered and
caused enormous suffering within our Nation, including by causing the
southern border to be overrun by cartels, criminal gangs, known
terrorists, human traffickers, smugglers, unvetted military-age males
from foreign adversaries, and illicit narcotics.  These open-border
policies are responsible for the horrific and inexcusable murders of
many innocent American citizens at the hands of illegal aliens.  
  
        One of those innocent victims was Jocelyn Nungaray, whose life
was tragically cut short on June 17, 2024, when she was brutally
murdered in Houston, Texas.  Two Venezuelan illegal aliens who were
allegedly Tren de Aragua gang members and were apprehended near the
border in early 2024 — and then released into the United States by the
prior administration — have been charged with her murder.  Jocelyn was a
precious 12 year old girl beloved by her family and friends for her
kindness and infectious zeal for life.  She loved animals and had a
passion for ensuring that they had homes.  It is fitting and in the
national interest, therefore, that the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge,
a scenic area for coastal wildlife and recreation along the Gulf of
America near Jocelyn’s home in Texas, will forever honor and preserve
the memory of a beautiful American, Jocelyn Nungaray.  
  
        <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Renaming the Anahuac National
Wildlife Refuge to Honor Jocelyn Nungaray</span>.  Within 30 days of the
date of this order, pursuant to authority under the National Wildlife
Refuge System Administration Act (16 U.S.C. 668dd-668ee) and other
applicable law, the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) shall update
procedures as necessary and take all other appropriate actions to rename
the area known as the “Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge” as the “Jocelyn
Nungaray National Wildlife Refuge” and ensure that her life is
permanently commemorated therein.  The Secretary shall subsequently
provide guidance to ensure all Federal references to the Jocelyn
Nungaray National Wildlife Refuge, including on agency maps, contracts,
and other documents and communications, reflect its renaming.  
  
       <span style="text-decoration: underline"> Sec.</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3.</span> 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.
 (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:  
             (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive
department or agency, or the head thereof; or  
             (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.  
        (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable
law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

\(c\)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
