MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

               THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE

               THE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

SUBJECT:       Immediate Declassification of Materials Related to the
Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:

Except as provided below, I have determined that all of the materials
referenced in the Presidential Memorandum of January 19, 2021
(Declassification of Certain Materials Related to the FBI’s Crossfire
Hurricane Investigation), are no longer classified.

I have further determined that the material proposed for redaction by
the Federal Bureau of Investigation in a cover letter dated January 17,
2021, remains classified.

My decision to declassify the materials described above does not extend
to materials that must be protected from disclosure pursuant to orders
of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and does not require the
disclosure of certain personally identifiable information or any other
materials that must be protected from disclosure under applicable law.

Subject to the exceptions identified above, the Attorney General shall
make declassified materials described in this memorandum available to
the public immediately.  

                              DONALD J. TRUMP
