title: Establishing the United States Investment Accelerator
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  The United
States is the most powerful economy in the world, but slow, complex, and
burdensome American regulatory processes at every stage of a company’s
development and operation make significant domestic and foreign
investment harder than necessary.  Regulations hamper investment,
permitting, and site selection, and numerous overlapping Federal, State,
and local legal regimes with complex and often duplicative requirements
significantly delay construction.  It is in the interest of the American
people that the Federal Government dramatically expand its assistance to
companies seeking to invest and build in the United States.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of the United States to modernize its processes to attract
substantial domestic and foreign investment in the United States and to
actively assist those building here for the benefit of our Nation’s
economic prosperity to unleash investment from our small businesses to
the largest companies.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">The United States Investment
Accelerator</span>.  (a)  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the
Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with the Secretary of the
Treasury and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, shall
establish within the Department of Commerce an office named the United
States Investment Accelerator (Investment Accelerator).  The Investment
Accelerator shall facilitate and accelerate investments above $1 billion
in the United States by assisting investors as they navigate
United States Government regulatory processes efficiently, reduce
regulatory burdens where consistent with applicable law, increase access
to and use of our national resources where appropriate and consistent
with applicable law, facilitate research collaborations with our
national labs, and work with State governments in all 50 States to
reduce regulatory barriers to, and increase, domestic and foreign
investment in the United States.   
(b)  The Investment Accelerator shall be headed by an Executive Director
and staffed with legal, transactional, operational, and support staff as
directed by the Secretary of Commerce.  The Investment Accelerator shall
be responsible for the CHIPS Program Office within the Department of
Commerce, which shall focus on delivering the benefit of the bargain for
taxpayers by negotiating much better deals than those of the previous
administration.  
(c)  The Investment Accelerator shall identify any existing mechanisms,
exceptions, and opportunities in Federal law that can be used to assist
foreign and domestic investors, consistent with the protection of
national security. 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. 
(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:  
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or  
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.  
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
