title: Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>. 
The production of timber, lumber, paper, bioenergy, and other wood
products (timber production) is critical to our Nation’s well-being. 
Timber production is essential for crucial human activities like
construction and energy production.  Furthermore, as recent disasters
demonstrate, forest management and wildfire risk reduction projects can
save American lives and communities.

The United States has an abundance of timber resources that are more
than adequate to meet our domestic timber production needs, but
heavy-handed Federal policies have prevented full utilization of these
resources and made us reliant on foreign producers.  Our inability to
fully exploit our domestic timber supply has impeded the creation of
jobs and prosperity, contributed to wildfire disasters, degraded fish
and wildlife habitats, increased the cost of construction and energy,
and threatened our economic security.  These onerous Federal policies
have forced our Nation to rely upon imported lumber, thus exporting jobs
and prosperity and compromising our self-reliance.  It is vital that we
reverse these policies and increase domestic timber production to
protect our national and economic security.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Directives
to the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of
Agriculture</span>. 

(a)  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the
Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture, through the Director of the
Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Chief of the United States
Forest Service (USFS), respectively, shall each issue new or updated
guidance regarding tools to facilitate increased timber production and
sound forest management, reduce time to deliver timber, and decrease
timber supply uncertainty, such as the Good Neighbor Authority described
in 16 U.S.C. 2113a, stewardship contracting pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 6591c,
and agreements or contracts with Indian tribes under the Tribal Forest
Protection Act as contemplated by 25 U.S.C. 3115a.  The Secretary of the
Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall also each submit to the
Director of the Office of Management and Budget any legislative
proposals that would expand authorities to improve timber production and
sound forest management.  
     

(b)  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the
Interior, through the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife
Service (FWS), and the Secretary of Commerce, through the Assistant
Administrator for Fisheries, shall complete a strategy on USFS and BLM
forest management projects under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act
(ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1536) to improve the speed of approving forestry
projects.  The Secretary of the Interior, through the Director of the
FWS, shall also examine any applicable existing authorities that would
permit executive departments and agencies (agencies) to delegate
consultation requirements under section 7 of the ESA to other agencies
and, if necessary, provide a legislative proposal to ensure consultation
is streamlined.  
     

(c)  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the
Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall together submit to the
President, through the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, a
plan that sets a target for the annual amount of timber per year to be
offered for sale over the next 4 years from Federal lands managed by the
BLM and the USFS, measured in millions of board feet.  
     

(d)  Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the
Interior, through the Directors of the FWS and the BLM, and the
Secretary of Agriculture, through the Chief of the USFS, shall complete
the Whitebark Pine Rangewide Programmatic Consultation under section 7
of the ESA.  
     

\(e\)  Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the
Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall consider and, if
appropriate and consistent with applicable law, adopt categorical
exclusions administratively established by other agencies to comply with
the National Environmental Policy Act and reduce unnecessarily lengthy
processes and associated costs related to administrative approvals for
timber production, forest management, and wildfire risk reduction
treatments.  
     

\(f\)  Within 280 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the
Interior shall consider and, if appropriate and consistent with
applicable law, establish a new categorical exclusion for timber
thinning and re-establish a categorical exclusion for timber salvage
activities.  

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Streamlined
Permitting</span>.  All relevant agencies shall eliminate, to the
maximum extent permissible by law, all undue delays within their
respective permitting processes related to timber production. 
Additionally, all relevant agencies shall take all necessary and
appropriate steps consistent with applicable law to suspend, revise, or
rescind all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies,
settlements, consent orders, and other agency actions that impose an
undue burden on timber production.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Endangered
Species Committee</span>.  (a)  Agencies are directed to use, to the
maximum extent permissible under applicable law, the ESA regulations on
consultations in emergencies to facilitate the Nation’s timber
production.  The Secretary of the Interior, as Chairman of the
Endangered Species Committee, shall ensure a prompt and efficient review
of all submissions to such committee, to include identification of any
legal deficiencies, in order to ensure the timely consideration of
exemption applications and, where possible, to resolve such applications
before the deadlines set by the ESA.    

\(b\)  Federal members of the Endangered Species Committee, or their
designees, shall coordinate to develop and submit a report to the
President, through the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy,
that identifies obstacles to domestic timber production infrastructure
specifically deriving from implementation of the ESA and recommends
procedural, regulatory, and interagency improvements.  

\(c\)  The Secretary of the Interior shall ensure that the Director of
the FWS, or the Director’s authorized representative, is available to
consult promptly with agencies and to take other appropriate action
concerning the applicability of the ESA’s emergency regulations.  The
Secretary of Commerce shall ensure that the Assistant Administrator for
Fisheries, or the Assistant Administrator’s authorized representative,
is available for such consultation and to take such other action as may
assist in applying the ESA’s emergency regulations.

Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
