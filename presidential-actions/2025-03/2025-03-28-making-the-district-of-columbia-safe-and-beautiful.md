title: Making the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>. 
As the Federal capital city, Washington, D.C., is the only city that
belongs to all Americans and that all Americans can claim as theirs.  As
the capital city of the greatest Nation in the history of the world, it
should showcase beautiful, clean, and safe public spaces.   
America’s capital must be a place in which residents, commuters, and
tourists feel safe at all hours, including on public transit.  Its
highways, boulevards, and parks should be clean, well-kept, and
pleasant.  Its monuments, museums, and buildings should reflect and
inspire awe and appreciation for our Nation’s strength, greatness, and
heritage.  Our citizens deserve nothing less.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>. 
It is the policy of the United States to make the District of Columbia
safe, beautiful, and prosperous by preventing crime, punishing
criminals, preserving order, protecting our revered American monuments,
and promoting beautification and the preservation of our history and
heritage.
