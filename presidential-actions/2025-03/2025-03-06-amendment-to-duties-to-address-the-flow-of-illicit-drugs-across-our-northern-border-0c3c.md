title: Amendment to Duties to Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Northern
  Border
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq*.), the National
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq*.), section 604 of the Trade Act
of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, United
States Code, I hereby determine and order:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.  Automotive
production is a major source of Unites States employment and innovation
and is integral to United States economic and national security.  The
American automotive industry as currently structured often trades
substantial volumes of automotive parts and components across our
borders in the interest of bringing supply chains closer to North
America.  In order to minimize disruption to the United States
automotive industry and automotive workers, it is appropriate to adjust
the tariffs imposed on articles of Canada in Executive Order 14193 of
February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties to Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs
Across Our Northern Border). 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Product Coverage</span>.  (a) 
Articles that are entered free of duty as a good of Canada under the
terms of general note 11 to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United
States (HTSUS), including any treatment set forth in subchapter XXIII of
chapter 98 and subchapter XXII of chapter 99 of the HTSUS, as related to
the Agreement between the United States of America, United Mexican
States, and Canada, shall not be subject to the additional ad valorem
rate of duty described in section 2(a) or section 2(b) of Executive
Order 14193.  
(b) The additional rate of duty on potash that is not subject to
subsection (a) of this section shall be reduced to 10 percent in lieu of
25 percent.   
(c)  The modifications set out in this section shall be effective with
respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse
for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on March
7, 2025.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. 
(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:  
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency,
or the head thereof; or  
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative or legislative proposals.  
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.  
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.  
  
                               DONALD J. TRUMP  
  
THE WHITE HOUSE,  
    March 6, 2025.
