title: Designating English as the Official Language of The United States
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose
and Policy</span>.  From the founding of our Republic, English has been
used as our national language.  Our Nation’s historic governing
documents, including the Declaration of Independence and the
Constitution, have all been written in English.  It is therefore long
past time that English is declared as the official language of the
United States.  A nationally designated language is at the core of a
unified and cohesive society, and the United States is strengthened by a
citizenry that can freely exchange ideas in one shared language.

In welcoming new Americans, a policy of encouraging the learning and
adoption of our national language will make the United States a shared
home and empower new citizens to achieve the American dream.  Speaking
English not only opens doors economically, but it helps newcomers engage
in their communities, participate in national traditions, and give back
to our society.  This order recognizes and celebrates the long tradition
of multilingual American citizens who have learned English and passed it
to their children for generations to come.

To promote unity, cultivate a shared American culture for all citizens,
ensure consistency in government operations, and create a pathway to
civic engagement, it is in America’s best interest for the Federal
Government to designate one — and only one — official language.
 Establishing English as the official language will not only streamline
communication but also reinforce shared national values, and create a
more cohesive and efficient society.

Accordingly, this order designates English as the official language of
the United States.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Definitions</span>.  For
purposes of this order:  
(a)  “Agency” has the meaning given to it in section 3502 of title 44,
United States Code, except that such term does not include the Executive
Office of the President or any components thereof.  

\(b\)  “Agency Head” means the highest-ranking official of an agency,
such as the Secretary, Administrator, Chairman, or Director, unless
otherwise specified in this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Designating an Official
Language for the United States</span>.  (a)  English is the official
language of the United States.   

(b)  Executive Order 13166 of August 11, 2000 (Improving Access to
Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency), is hereby
revoked; nothing in this order, however, requires or directs any change
in the services provided by any agency.  Agency heads should make
decisions as they deem necessary to fulfill their respective agencies’
mission and efficiently provide Government services to the American
people.  Agency heads are not required to amend, remove, or otherwise
stop production of documents, products, or other services prepared or
offered in languages other than English.    

(c)  The Attorney General shall rescind any policy guidance documents
issued pursuant to Executive Order 13166 and provide updated guidance,
consistent with applicable law.

or the head thereof; or  

(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.  

\(c\)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
