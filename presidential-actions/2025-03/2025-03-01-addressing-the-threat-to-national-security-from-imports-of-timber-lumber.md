title: Addressing the Threat to National Security from Imports of Timber, Lumber
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade
Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862) (Trade Expansion
Act), it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  The wood
products industry, composed of timber, lumber, and their derivative
products (such as paper products, furniture, and cabinetry) is a
critical manufacturing industry essential to the national security,
economic strength, and industrial resilience of the United States.  This
industry plays a vital role in key downstream civilian industries,
including construction.

The United States faces significant vulnerabilities in the wood supply
chain from imported timber, lumber, and their derivative products being
dumped onto the United States market.

The United States has ample timber resources.  The current United States
softwood lumber industry has the practical production capacity to supply
95 percent of the United States’ 2024 softwood consumption.  Yet, since
2016 the United States has been a net importer of lumber.

Wood products are a key input used by both the civilian construction
industry and the military.  Each year, the United States military spends
over 10 billion dollars on construction.  The military also invests in
innovative building material technology, including processes to create
innovative wood products such as cross-laminated timber.  The
procurement of these building materials depends on a strong domestic
lumber industry and a manufacturing base capable of meeting both
military-specific and wider civilian needs.

It is the policy of the United States to ensure reliable, secure, and
resilient domestic supply chains of timber, lumber, and their derivative
products.  Unfair subsidies and foreign government support for foreign
timber, lumber, and their derivative products necessitate action under
section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to determine whether imports of
these products threaten to impair national security.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Investigation</span>.  (a)
 The Secretary of Commerce shall initiate an investigation under section
232 of the Trade Expansion Act to determine the effects on the national
security of imports of timber, lumber, and their derivative products.  

\(b\)  In conducting the investigation described in subsection (a) of
this section, the Secretary of Commerce shall assess the factors set
forth in 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), labeled “Domestic production for national
defense; impact of foreign competition on economic welfare of domestic
industries,” as well as other relevant factors, including:  

\(i\)    the current and projected demand for timber and lumber in the
United States;  

\(ii\)   the extent to which domestic production of timber and lumber
can meet domestic demand;  

\(iii\)  the role of foreign supply chains, particularly of major
exporters, in meeting United States timber and lumber demand;  

\(iv\)   the impact of foreign government subsidies and predatory trade
practices on United States timber, lumber, and derivative product
industry competitiveness;  

\(v\)    the feasibility of increasing domestic timber and lumber
capacity to reduce imports; and  

\(vi\)   the impact of current trade policies on domestic timber,
lumber, and derivative product production, and whether additional
measures, including tariffs or quotas, are necessary to protect national
security.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Required Actions</span>.  (a)
 The Secretary of Commerce shall consult with the Secretary of Defense
and the heads of other relevant executive departments and agencies as
determined by the Secretary of Commerce to evaluate the national
security risks associated with imports of timber, lumber, and their
derivative products.  

\(b\)  No later than 270 days after the date of this order, the
Secretary of Commerce shall submit a report to the President that
includes:  

\(i\)    findings on whether imports of timber, lumber, and their
derivative products threaten national security;  

\(ii\)   recommendations on actions to mitigate such threats, including
potential tariffs, export controls, or incentives to increase domestic
production; and  

\(iii\)  policy recommendations for strengthening the United States
timber and lumber supply chain through strategic investments and
permitting reforms.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Definitions</span>.  As used
in this order:  

\(a\)  The term “timber” refers to wood that has not been processed.  

\(b\)  The term “lumber” refers to wood that has been processed,
including wood that has been milled and cut into boards or planks.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. 
(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:  

\(i\)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or
agency, or the head thereof; or  

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.  

\(c\)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
