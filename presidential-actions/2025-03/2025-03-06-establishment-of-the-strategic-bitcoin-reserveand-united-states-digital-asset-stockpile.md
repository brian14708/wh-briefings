title: Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset
  Stockpile
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1.</span>
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.  Bitcoin is
the original cryptocurrency.  The Bitcoin protocol permanently caps the
total supply of bitcoin (BTC) at 21 million coins, and has never been
hacked.  As a result of its scarcity and security, Bitcoin is often
referred to as “digital gold”.  Because there is a fixed supply of BTC,
there is a strategic advantage to being among the first nations to
create a strategic bitcoin reserve.  The United States Government
currently holds a significant amount of BTC, but has not implemented a
policy to maximize BTC’s strategic position as a unique store of value
in the global financial system.  Just as it is in our country’s interest
to thoughtfully manage national ownership and control of any other
resource, our Nation must harness, not limit, the power of digital
assets for our prosperity.    
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2.</span>
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy.</span>  It is the
policy of the United States to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.
 It is further the policy of the United States to establish a United
States Digital Asset Stockpile that can serve as a secure account for
orderly and strategic management of the United States’ other digital
asset holdings.  
  
    <span style="text-decoration: underline"> Sec.</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3.</span>
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Creation and Administration of
the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile.
 </span>  
     (a)  The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish an office to
administer and maintain control of custodial accounts collectively known
as the “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” capitalized with all BTC held by the
Department of the Treasury that was finally forfeited as part of
criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings or in satisfaction of any
civil money penalty imposed by any executive department or agency
(agency) and that is not needed to satisfy requirements under 31 U.S.C.
9705 or released pursuant to subsection (d) of this section (Government
BTC).  Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall
review its authorities to transfer any Government BTC held by it to the
Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and shall submit a report reflecting the
result of that review to the Secretary of the Treasury.  Government BTC
deposited into the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve shall not be sold and shall
be maintained as reserve assets of the United States utilized to meet
governmental objectives in accordance with applicable law.    
     (b)  The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish an office to
administer and maintain control of custodial accounts collectively known
as the “United States Digital Asset Stockpile,” capitalized with all
digital assets owned by the Department of the Treasury, other than BTC,
that were finally forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset
forfeiture proceedings and that are not needed to satisfy requirements
under 31 U.S.C. 9705 or released pursuant to subsection (d) of this
section (Stockpile Assets).  Within 30 days of the date of this order,
each agency shall review its authorities to transfer any Stockpile
Assets held by it to the United States Digital Asset Stockpile and shall
submit a report reflecting the result of that review to the Secretary of
the Treasury.  The Secretary of the Treasury shall determine strategies
for responsible stewardship of the United States Digital Asset Stockpile
in accordance with applicable law.  
     (c)  The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Commerce
shall develop strategies for acquiring additional Government BTC
provided that such strategies are budget neutral and do not impose
incremental costs on United States taxpayers.  However, the United
States Government shall not acquire additional Stockpile Assets other
than in connection with criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings
or in satisfaction of any civil money penalty imposed by any agency
without further executive or legislative action.     
     (d)  “Government Digital Assets” means all Government BTC and all
Stockpile Assets.  The head of each agency shall not sell or otherwise
dispose of any Government Digital Assets, except in connection with the
Secretary of the Treasury’s exercise of his lawful authority and
responsible stewardship of the United States Digital Asset Stockpile
pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, or pursuant to an order from
a court of competent jurisdiction, as required by law, or in cases where
the Attorney General or other relevant agency head determines that the
Government Digital Assets (or the proceeds from the sale or disposition
thereof) can and should:   
          (i)    be returned to identifiable and verifiable victims of
crime;   
          (ii)   be used for law enforcement operations;    
          (iii)  be equitably shared with State and local law
enforcement partners; or   
          (iv)   be released to satisfy requirements under 31 U.S.C.
9705, 28 U.S.C. 524(c), 18 U.S.C. 981, or 21 U.S.C. 881.   
     (e)  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the
Treasury shall deliver an evaluation of the legal and investment
considerations for establishing and managing the Strategic Bitcoin
Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile going forward,
including the accounts in which the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United
States Digital Asset Stockpile should be located and the need for any
legislation to operationalize any aspect of this order or the proper
management and administration of such accounts.  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4.</span>
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Accounting.</span>  Within 30
days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall provide
the Secretary of the Treasury and the President’s Working Group on
Digital Asset Markets with a full accounting of all Government Digital
Assets in such agency’s possession, including any information regarding
the custodial accounts in which such Government Digital Assets are
currently held that would be necessary to facilitate a transfer of the
Government Digital Assets to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve or the United
States Digital Asset Stockpile.  If such agency holds no Government
Digital Assets, such agency shall confirm such fact to the Secretary of
the Treasury and the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets
within 30 days of the date of this order.    
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 5.</span>
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions.</span>
 (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:  
          (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department
or agency, or the head thereof; or  
          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.  
     (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
