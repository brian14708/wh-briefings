title: "Modernizing Payments To and From America\u2019s Bank Account"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  The continued
use of paper-based payments by the Federal Government, including checks
and money orders, flowing into and out of the United States General
Fund, which might be thought of as America’s bank account, imposes
unnecessary costs; delays; and risks of fraud, lost payments, theft, and
inefficiencies.  Mail theft complaints have increased substantially
since the COVID-19 pandemic.  Historically, Department of the Treasury
checks are 16 times more likely to be reported lost or stolen, returned
undeliverable, or altered than an electronic funds transfer (EFT).
 Maintaining the physical infrastructure and specialized technology for
digitizing paper records cost the American taxpayer over $657 million in
Fiscal Year 2024 alone.  
  
This order promotes operational efficiency by mandating the transition
to electronic payments for all Federal disbursements and receipts by
digitizing payments to the extent permissible under applicable law (but
not, for avoidance of doubt, to establish a Central Bank Digital
Currency).    
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of the United States to defend against financial fraud and
improper payments, increase efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the
security of Federal payments.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Phase Out of Paper Check
Disbursements and Receipts</span>.  (a)  Effective September 30, 2025,
and to the extent permitted by law, the Secretary of the Treasury shall
cease issuing paper checks for all Federal disbursements inclusive of
intragovernmental payments, benefits payments, vendor payments, and tax
refunds, except as specified in section 4 of this order.

\(b\)  All executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall comply
with this directive by transitioning to EFT methods, including direct
deposit, prepaid card accounts, and other digital payment options, and
take all steps necessary to enroll recipients in EFT payments, except as
specified in section 4 of this order.

\(c\)  As soon as practicable, and to the extent permitted by law, all
payments made to the Federal Government shall be processed
electronically, except as specified in section 4 of this order.

\(d\)  The Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the
Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Education, the
Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the Secretary of Homeland Security
shall take appropriate action to eliminate the need for the Department
of the Treasury’s physical lockbox services and expedite requirements to
receive the payment of Federal receipts, including fees, fines, loans,
and taxes, through electronic means except as specified in section 4 of
this order.

\(e\)  The Secretary of the Treasury shall support agencies’ transition
to digital payment methods, including by providing access through the
Department of the Treasury’s centralized payment systems to:

\(i\)    direct deposits;

\(ii\)   debit and credit card payments;

\(iii\)  digital wallets and real-time payment systems; and

\(iv\)   other modern electronic payment options.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Exceptions and Accommodations
for the Phase Out of Paper Check Disbursements and Receipts</span>.  (a)
 The Secretary of the Treasury, shall review and, as appropriate, revise
procedures for granting limited exceptions where electronic payment and
collection methods are not feasible, including exceptions for:

\(i\)    individuals who do not have access to banking services or
electronic payment systems;

\(ii\)   certain emergency payments where electronic disbursement would
cause undue hardship, as contemplated in 31 C.F.R. Part 208;

\(iii\)  national security- or law enforcement-related activities where
non-EFT transactions are necessary or desirable; and

\(iv\)   other circumstances as determined by the Secretary of the
Treasury, as reflected in regulations or other guidance.

\(b\)  Individuals or entities qualifying for an exception under this
section or other applicable law shall be provided alternative payment
options.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Implementation and Compliance
of Electronic Transactions</span>.  (a)  The Secretary of the Treasury,
in coordination with the heads of agencies, shall develop and implement
a comprehensive public awareness campaign to inform Federal payment
recipients of the transition to electronic payments, including guidance
on accessing and setting up digital payment options.

\(b\)  Agencies shall coordinate with the Department of the Treasury to
facilitate a smooth transition to digital payments, ensuring that
affected individuals and entities receive adequate support.

\(c\)  The Secretary of the Treasury shall work with financial
institutions, consumer groups, and other stakeholders to address
financial access for unbanked and underbanked populations.

\(d\)  The Secretary of the Treasury and the heads of agencies shall
take all necessary steps to protect classified information and systems,
as well as personally identifiable information and tax return
information, through the implementation of this order.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Reporting Requirements</span>.
 (a)  The heads of agencies shall submit a compliance plan to the
Director of the Office of Management and Budget within 90 days of the
date of this order detailing their strategy for eliminating paper-based
transactions.

\(b\)  The Secretary of the Treasury shall submit an implementation
report to the President through the Assistant to the President for
Economic Policy within 180 days of the date of this order detailing
progress on the matters set forth in this order.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">7</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.
 (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

\(i\)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or
agency, or the head thereof; or

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

\(c\)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
