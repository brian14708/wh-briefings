title: Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>. The dishonest
and dangerous activity of the law firm Perkins Coie LLP (“Perkins Coie”)
has affected this country for decades. Notably, in 2016 while
representing failed Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Perkins Coie
hired Fusion GPS, which then manufactured a false “dossier” designed to
steal an election. This egregious activity is part of a pattern. Perkins
Coie has worked with activist donors including George Soros to
judicially overturn popular, necessary, and democratically enacted
election laws, including those requiring voter identification. In one
such case, a court was forced to sanction Perkins Coie attorneys for an
unethical lack of candor before the court.

  
In addition to undermining democratic elections, the integrity of our
courts, and honest law enforcement, Perkins Coie racially discriminates
against its own attorneys and staff, and against applicants. Perkins
Coie publicly announced percentage quotas in 2019 for hiring and
promotion on the basis of race and other categories prohibited by civil
rights laws. It proudly excluded applicants on the basis of race for its
fellowships, and it maintained these discriminatory practices until
applicants harmed by them finally sued to enforce change.

  
My Administration is committed to ending discrimination under
“diversity, equity, and inclusion” policies and ensuring that Federal
benefits support the laws and policies of the United States, including
those laws and policies promoting our national security and respecting
the democratic process. Those who engage in blatant race-based and
sex-based discrimination, including quotas, but purposefully hide the
nature of such discrimination through deceiving language, have engaged
in a serious violation of the public trust. Their disrespect for the
bedrock principle of equality represents good cause to conclude that
they neither have access to our Nation’s secrets nor be deemed
responsible stewards of any Federal funds.

  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Security Clearance
Review</span>. (a) The Attorney General, the Director of National
Intelligence, and all other relevant heads of executive departments and
agencies (agencies) shall immediately take steps consistent with
applicable law to suspend any active security clearances held by
individuals at Perkins Coie, pending a review of whether such clearances
are consistent with the national interest.

  
(b) The Office of Management and Budget shall identify all Government
goods, property, material, and services, including Sensitive
Compartmented Information Facilities, provided for the benefit of
Perkins Coie. The heads of all agencies providing such material or
services shall, to the extent permitted by law, expeditiously cease such
provision.

  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Contracting</span>. (a) To
prevent the transfer of taxpayer dollars to Federal contractors whose
earnings subsidize, among other things, racial discrimination, falsified
documents designed to weaponize the Government against candidates for
office, and anti-democratic election changes that invite fraud and
distrust, Government contracting agencies shall, to the extent
permissible by law, require Government contractors to disclose any
business they do with Perkins Coie and whether that business is related
to the subject of the Government contract.

  
(b) The heads of all agencies shall review all contracts with Perkins
Coie or with entities that disclose doing business with Perkins Coie
under subsection (a) of this section. To the extent permitted by law,
the heads of agencies shall:

  
(i) take appropriate steps to terminate any contract, to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable law, including the Federal Acquisition
Regulation, for which Perkins Coie has been hired to perform any
service;

  
(ii) otherwise align their agency funding decisions with the interests
of the citizens of the United States; with the goals and priorities of
my Administration as expressed in executive actions, especially
Executive Order 14147 of January 20, 2025 (Ending the Weaponization of
the Federal Government); and as heads of agencies deem appropriate.
Within 30 days of the date of this order, all agencies shall submit to
the Director of the Office of Management and Budget an assessment of
contracts with Perkins Coie or with entities that do business with
Perkins Coie effective as of the date of this order and any actions
taken with respect to those contracts in accordance with this order.

  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Racial Discrimination</span>.
(a) The Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission shall
review the practices of representative large, influential, or industry
leading law firms for consistency with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964, including whether large law firms: reserve certain positions,
such as summer associate spots, for individuals of preferred races;
promote individuals on a discriminatory basis; permit client access on a
discriminatory basis; or provide access to events, trainings, or travel
on a discriminatory basis.

  
(b) The Attorney General, in coordination with the Chair of the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission and in consultation with State
Attorneys General as appropriate, shall investigate the practices of
large law firms as described in subsection (a) of this section who do
business with Federal entities for compliance with race-based and
sex-based non-discrimination laws and take any additional actions the
Attorney General deems appropriate in light of the evidence uncovered.  

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Personnel</span>. (a) The heads
of all agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide guidance
limiting official access from Federal Government buildings to employees
of Perkins Coie when such access would threaten the national security of
or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States. In
addition, the heads of all agencies shall provide guidance limiting
Government employees acting in their official capacity from engaging
with Perkins Coie employees to ensure consistency with the national
security and other interests of the United States.

  
(b) Agency officials shall, to the extent permitted by law, refrain from
hiring employees of Perkins Coie, absent a waiver from the head of the
agency, made in consultation with the Director of the Office of
Personnel Management, that such hire will not threaten the national
security of the United States.

  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. (a)
Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:

  
(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

  
(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

  
(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.

  
(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
