MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE  
THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE  
THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE  
THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE UNITED STATES AGENCY  
FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT  
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE  
UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR GLOBAL MEDIA

SUBJECT: Removing Discrimination and Discriminatory Equity  
Ideology From the Foreign Service

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy and Purpose</span>. Over
the last 4 years, divisive and discriminatory policies were
systematically embedded into every part of the Federal Government,
including hiring processes and employee performance evaluations in the
Foreign Service. It is the policy of the Federal Government that hiring
in foreign policy positions, like hiring in all other parts of the
Government, shall be based solely on merit.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Definitions</span>. For the
purposes of this memorandum:

\(a\) “discriminatory equity ideology” shall have the meaning given that
phrase in section 2 of Executive Order 14190 of January 29, 2025 (Ending
Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling);

\(b\) “Department,” “Foreign Service,” and “Secretary” shall have the
meanings given those terms in 22 U.S.C. 3902; and  
(c) “Foreign Service Member” means an individual described by 22 U.S.C.
3903.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Equality and Non-Discrimination
in the Foreign Service</span>. (a) The Secretary of State shall,
consistent with applicable law, promptly revise the 2022-2025 Decision
Criteria for Tenure and Promotion in the Foreign Service, issued under
section 2326.2 of title 3 of the Foreign Affairs Manual, to remove any
reference to the Core Precept entitled “Diversity, Equity, Inclusion,
and Accessibility.” The Secretaries shall promptly direct all employees
of their Departments not to give this Core Precept any force or effect.

\(b\) The Secretaries shall direct all officers and employees of their
Departments not to:

\(i\) base Foreign Service recruitment, hiring, promotion, or retention
decisions upon an individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national
origin; or

\(ii\) while acting in an official capacity, promote, advocate for, or
otherwise inculcate support for discriminatory equity ideology.

\(c\) The Secretaries shall determine if any current Foreign Service
Members have knowingly and willfully engaged in unconstitutional or
otherwise illegal discrimination based upon race or other protected
characteristics, including actions motivated by discriminatory equity
ideology. Consistent with Executive Order 14211 of February 12, 2025
(One Voice for America’s Foreign Relations) the Secretaries shall:

\(i\) with respect to Foreign Service Members appointed by a Secretary
whom that Secretary finds to have engaged in such discrimination, take
appropriate action; and

\(ii\) with respect to Foreign Service Members appointed by the
President, determine whether to refer any findings of discrimination for
the President’s consideration or take appropriate action under the
Secretary’s own authority.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. (a)
Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

\(i\) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

\(ii\) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

\(c\) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
