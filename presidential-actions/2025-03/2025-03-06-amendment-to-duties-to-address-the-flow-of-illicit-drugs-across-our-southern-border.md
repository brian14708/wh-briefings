title: Amendment to Duties to Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Southern
  Border
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq*.), the National
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq*.), section 604 of the Trade Act
of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, United
States Code, I hereby determine and order:  
  
        Section 1.  Background.  Automotive production is a major source
of United States employment and innovation and is integral to United
States economic and national security.  The American automotive industry
as currently structured often trades substantial volumes of automotive
parts and components across our borders in the interest of bringing
supply chains closer to North America.  In order to minimize disruption
to the United States automotive industry and automotive workers, it is
appropriate to adjust the tariffs imposed on articles of Mexico in
Executive Order 14194 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties to Address
the Situation at Our Southern Border).  
  
        Sec. 2.  Product Coverage.  (a)  Articles that are entered free
of duty as a good of Mexico under the terms of general note 11 to the
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), including any
treatment set forth in subchapter XXIII of chapter 98 and subchapter
XXII of chapter 99 of the HTSUS, as related to the Agreement between the
United States of America, United Mexican States, and Canada, shall not
be subject to the additional ad valorem rate of duty described in
section 2(a) of Executive Order 14194.  
        (b)  The additional rate of duty on potash that is not subject
to subsection (a) of this section shall be reduced to 10 percent in lieu
of 25 percent.  
        (c)  The modifications set out in this section shall be
effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn
from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard
time on March 7, 2025.  
  
        Sec. 3.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall
be construed to impair or otherwise affect:  
             (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive
department, agency, or the head thereof; or  
             (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative or
legislative proposals.  
        (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable
law and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
        (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in
equity by any party against the United States, its departments,
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other
person.    
    DONALD J. TRUMP  
  THE WHITE HOUSE,  
    March 6, 2025.
