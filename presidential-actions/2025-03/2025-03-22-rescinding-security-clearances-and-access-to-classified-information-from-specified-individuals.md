  Individuals

MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES 

SUBJECT:    Rescinding Security Clearances and Access to Classified
Information from Specified Individuals 

  
I have determined that it is no longer in the national interest for the
following individuals to access classified information:  Antony Blinken,
Jacob Sullivan, Lisa Monaco, Mark Zaid, Norman Eisen, Letitia James,
Alvin Bragg, Andrew Weissmann, Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Cheney, Kamala
Harris, Adam Kinzinger, Fiona Hill, Alexander Vindman, Joseph R. Biden
Jr., and any other member of Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s family.  Therefore, I
hereby direct every executive department and agency head to take all
additional action as necessary and consistent with existing law to
revoke any active security clearances held by the aforementioned
individuals and to immediately rescind their access to classified
information.  I also direct all executive department and agency heads to
revoke unescorted access to secure United States Government facilities
from these individuals.  
  
This action includes, but is not limited to, receipt of classified
briefings, such as the President’s Daily Brief, and access to classified
information held by any member of the Intelligence Community by virtue
of the named individuals’ previous tenure in the Congress.  
  
In the event that any of the named individuals received a security
clearance by virtue of their employment with a private entity, the
United States Government entity that granted the security clearance
should inform the private entity that these individuals’ ability to
access classified information has been revoked.   
  
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
