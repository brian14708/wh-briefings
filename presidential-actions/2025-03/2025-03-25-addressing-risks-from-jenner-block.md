title: Addressing Risks from Jenner & Block
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.  My
Administration is committed to addressing the significant risks
associated with law firms, particularly so-called “Big Law” firms, that
engage in conduct detrimental to critical American interests.  Many
firms take actions that threaten public safety and national security,
limit constitutional freedoms, degrade the quality of American
elections, or undermine bedrock American principles.  Moreover, law
firms regularly conduct this harmful activity through their powerful pro
bono practices, earmarking hundreds of millions of their clients’
dollars for destructive causes, that often directly or indirectly harm
their own clients.  Lawyers and law firms that engage in such egregious
conduct should not have access to our Nation’s secrets, nor should such
conduct be subsidized by Federal taxpayer funds or contracts.

Jenner & Block LLP (Jenner) is yet another law firm that has abandoned
the profession’s highest ideals, condoned partisan “lawfare,” and abused
its pro bono practice to engage in activities that undermine justice and
the interests of the United States.  For example, Jenner engages in
obvious partisan representations to achieve political ends, supports
attacks against women and children based on a refusal to accept the
biological reality of sex, and backs the obstruction of efforts to
prevent illegal aliens from committing horrific crimes and trafficking
deadly drugs within our borders.  Moreover, Jenner discriminates against
its employees based on race and other categories prohibited by civil
rights laws, including through the use of race-based “targets.”

In addition, Jenner was “thrilled” to re-hire the unethical Andrew
Weissmann after his time engaging in partisan prosecution as part of
Robert Mueller’s entirely unjustified investigation.  Andrew Weissmann’s
career has been rooted in weaponized government and abuse of power,
including devastating tens of thousands of American families who worked
for the now defunct Arthur Andersen LLP, only to have his unlawfully
aggressive prosecution overturned by the Supreme Court.  The numerous
reports of Weissmann’s dishonesty, including pursuit of nonexistent
crimes, bribery to foreign nationals, and overt demand that the Federal
Government pursue a political agenda against me, is a concerning
indictment of Jenner’s values and priorities.

2</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Security Clearance
Review</span>.  (a)  The Attorney General, the Director of National
Intelligence, and all other relevant heads of executive departments and
agencies (agencies) shall immediately take steps consistent with
applicable law to suspend any active security clearances held by
individuals at Jenner pending a review of whether such clearances are
consistent with the national interest.

(b)  The Office of Management and Budget shall identify all Government
goods, property, material, and services, including Sensitive
Compartmented Information Facilities, provided for the benefit of
Jenner.  The heads of agencies providing such material or services
shall, to the extent permitted by law, expeditiously cease such
provision.

<u>Sec</u>. 3.  Contracting.  (a)  To prevent the transfer of taxpayer
dollars to Federal contractors whose earnings subsidize, among other
things, activities that are not aligned with American interests,
including racial discrimination, Government contracting agencies shall,
to the extent permissible by law, require Government contractors to
disclose any business they do with Jenner and whether that business is
related to the subject of the Government contract.

(b)  The heads of agencies shall review all contracts with Jenner or
with entities that disclose doing business with Jenner under subsection
(a) of this section.  To the extent permitted by law, the heads of
agencies shall:

\(i\) take appropriate steps to terminate any contract, to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable law, including the Federal Acquisition
Regulation, for which Jenner has been hired to perform any service; and

\(ii\)  otherwise align their agency funding decisions with the
interests of the citizens of the United States; with the goals and
priorities of my Administration as expressed in executive actions,
especially Executive Order 14147 of January 20, 2025 (Ending the
Weaponization of the Federal Government); and as heads of agencies deem
appropriate.  Within 30 days of the date of this order, agencies shall
submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget an
assessment of contracts with Jenner or with entities that do business
with Jenner effective as of the date of this order and any actions taken
with respect to those contracts in accordance with this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Racial Discrimination</span>.
 Nothing in this order shall be construed to limit the action authorized
by section 4 of Executive Order 14230 of March 6, 2025 (Addressing Risks
from Perkins Coie LLP).  

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Personnel</span>.  (a)  The
heads of agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide
guidance limiting official access from Federal Government buildings to
employees of Jenner when such access would threaten the national
security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the
United States.  In addition, the heads of agencies shall provide
guidance limiting Government employees acting in their official capacity
from engaging with Jenner employees, including but not limited to Andrew
Weissmann, to ensure consistency with the national security and other
interests of the United States.

     (b)  Agency officials shall, to the extent permitted by law,
refrain from hiring employees of Jenner, including but not limited to
Andrew Weissmann, absent a waiver from the head of the agency, made in
consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management,
that such hire will not threaten the national security of the United
States.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.
 (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

\(c\)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
