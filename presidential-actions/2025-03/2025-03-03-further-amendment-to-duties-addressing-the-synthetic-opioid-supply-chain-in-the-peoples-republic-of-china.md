title: "Further Amendment to Duties Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in\
  \ the People\u2019s Republic of China"
---
 
        By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution
and the laws of the United States of America, including the
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq*.)
(IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq*.),
section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and
section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby determine and
order:

  
        <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.  With
Executive Order 14195 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties to Address
the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People’s Republic of China), I
determined that the failure of the Government of the People’s Republic
of China (PRC) to act to blunt the sustained influx of synthetic
opioids, including fentanyl, flowing from the PRC to the United States
constituted an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in
substantial part outside the United States, to the national security,
foreign policy, and economy of the United States.  To address that
threat, I invoked my authority under section 1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA to
impose ad valorem tariffs on articles that are products of the PRC, as
defined by the *Federal Register* notice described in section 2(d) of
Executive Order 14195, as amended by Executive Order 14200 of February
5, 2025 (Amendment to Duties Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply
Chain in the People’s Republic of China).

  
        Pursuant to section 3 of Executive Order 14195, I have
determined that the PRC has not taken adequate steps to alleviate the
illicit drug crisis through cooperative enforcement actions, and that
the crisis described in Executive Order 14195 has not abated.

  
       <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Amendment</span>.  In
recognition of the fact that the PRC has not taken adequate steps to
alleviate the illicit drug crisis, section 2(a) of Executive Order 14195
is hereby amended by striking the words “10 percent” and inserting in
lieu thereof the words “20 percent”.

  
       <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. 
(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:  
             (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive
department, agency, or the head thereof; or  
             (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.  
        (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable
law and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
        (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in
equity by any party against the United States, its departments,
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other
person.
