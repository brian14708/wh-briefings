  Democracy, 2025'

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  
A PROCLAMATION

On March 25, 1821, fueled by the rallying cry, “Freedom or Death,” Greek
revolutionaries began a war for independence against the Ottoman
Empire.  The hard-fought victory established a sovereign Greek state and
a national homeland for Greece.  On the 204th anniversary of Greek
Independence Day, we honor this heroic fight for freedom, and the
enduring democratic ideals that continue to inspire the world.

 America is inextricably tied to both ancient and modern Greece.  We are
tethered by history and tradition, the struggle for self-governance,
emancipation, and rebirth.  Our Founding Fathers drew inspiration from
Greek philosophers and statesmen to form the tenets of our new Republic,
now enshrined in our Constitution.  Our national character has been
shaped, in part, by the indelible impact of Greek influence in the arts
and architecture, language and literature, and academia and military
tradition.  Today, across the United States, generations of Greek
Americans infuse our neighborhoods and communities with a rich legacy of
cultural traditions, and a heritage of family, faith, hospitality, and
civic responsibility.

Greece is one of our Nation’s oldest friends, strategic partners, and a
valued NATO ally.  We appreciate the support of Prime Minister Kyriakos
Mitsotakis in our economic and diplomatic partnership as we forge
opportunities for collaboration in key sectors including energy,
science, technology, shipping, logistics, and defense.  The permanent
presence of naval forces in Souda Bay and bilateral training events
enhance warfighting capabilities and reflect our mutual commitment to
joint military cooperation as a cornerstone of security and stability in
Europe.

On this day, we pause to celebrate Hellenic independence, people of
Greek heritage worldwide, and the abiding kinship of likeminded nations
who cherish democracy, patriotism, prosperity, and peace.  
  
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 25, 2025, as
Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and
American Democracy.  I call upon the people of the United States to
observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day
of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-ninth.

                              DONALD J. TRUMP
