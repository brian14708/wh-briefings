title: Combating Unfair Practices in the Live Entertainment Market
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  (a) 
America’s live concert and entertainment industry is the envy of the
world.  But it has become blighted by unscrupulous middlemen who sit at
the intersection between artists and fans and impose egregious fees
while providing minimal value.  Ticket scalpers use bots and other
unfair means to acquire large quantities of face-value tickets and then
re-sell them at an enormous markup on the secondary market,
price-gouging consumers and depriving fans of the opportunity to see
their favorite artists without incurring extraordinary expenses.  By
some reports, fans have paid as much as 70 times face value to obtain a
ticket.  When this occurs, the artists do not receive any profit.  All
profits go solely to the scalper and the ticketing agency.   
(b)  My Administration is committed to making as accessible as possible
the arts and entertainment that enrich Americans’ lives.  The
rent-seeking behaviors surrounding the ticketing industry are contrary
to this goal.  They are detrimental to consumers and capitalize on
market distortions that must not be allowed to persist.  
  
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Implementation</span>.  My
Administration shall use all lawful authority to address the conduct
described in section 1 of this order.  Accordingly, I direct that:  
(a)  the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ensure
that competition laws are appropriately enforced in the concert and
entertainment industry, including where venues, ticketing agents, or
combinations thereof operate to the detriment of artists and fans;  
(b)  the FTC rigorously enforce the Better Online Tickets Sales Act, 15
U.S.C. 45c, and collaborate with State Attorneys General or other State
consumer protection officers on enforcement of the Better Online Ticket
Sales Act, including by providing such State officials with information
or evidence obtained by the FTC when consistent with applicable law;  
(c)  the FTC take appropriate action, including proposing regulations if
necessary, to ensure price transparency at all stages of the
ticket-purchase process, including the secondary ticketing market;  
(d)  the FTC evaluate and, if appropriate, take enforcement action to
prevent unfair, deceptive, and anti-competitive conduct in the secondary
ticketing market; and  
(e)  the Secretary of the Treasury and Attorney General ensure, as
appropriate, that ticket scalpers are operating in full compliance with
the Internal Revenue Code and other applicable law.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Report</span>.  Within 180
days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury, Attorney
General, and Chairman of the FTC shall jointly submit a report to the
Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and the Director of the
Office and Management and Budget describing the actions they have taken
to implement this order.  The report shall also identify any
recommendations for regulations or legislation necessary to protect
consumers with respect to the live concert and entertainment industry.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.
 (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:  
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or  
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.  
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
    March 31, 2025.
