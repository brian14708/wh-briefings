title: Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose and Policy</span>*.* 
Over the past decade, Americans have witnessed a concerted and
widespread effort to rewrite our Nation’s history, replacing objective
facts with a distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth. 
This revisionist movement seeks to undermine the remarkable achievements
of the United States by casting its founding principles and historical
milestones in a negative light.  Under this historical revision, our
Nation’s unparalleled legacy of advancing liberty, individual rights,
and human happiness is reconstructed as inherently racist, sexist,
oppressive, or otherwise irredeemably flawed.  Rather than fostering
unity and a deeper understanding of our shared past, the widespread
effort to rewrite history deepens societal divides and fosters a sense
of national shame, disregarding the progress America has made and the
ideals that continue to inspire millions around the globe.

The prior administration advanced this corrosive ideology.  At
Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania —
where our Nation declared that all men are created equal — the prior
administration sponsored training by an organization that advocates
dismantling “Western foundations” and “interrogating institutional
racism” and pressured National Historical Park rangers that their racial
identity should dictate how they convey history to visiting Americans
because America is purportedly racist. 

Once widely respected as a symbol of American excellence and a global
icon of cultural achievement, the Smithsonian Institution has, in recent
years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology.
 This shift has promoted narratives that portray American and Western
values as inherently harmful and oppressive.  For example, the
Smithsonian American Art Museum today features “The Shape of Power:
 Stories of Race and American Sculpture,” an exhibit representing that
“\[s\]ocieties including the United States have used race to establish
and maintain systems of power, privilege, and disenfranchisement.”  The
exhibit further claims that “sculpture has been a powerful tool in
promoting scientific racism” and promotes the view that race is not a
biological reality but a social construct, stating “Race is a human
invention.”

The National Museum of African American History and Culture has
proclaimed that “hard work,” “individualism,” and “the nuclear family”
are aspects of “White culture.”  The forthcoming Smithsonian American
Women’s History Museum plans on celebrating the exploits of male
athletes participating in women’s sports.  These are just a few
examples.

It is the policy of my Administration to restore Federal sites dedicated
to history, including parks and museums, to solemn and uplifting public
monuments that remind Americans of our extraordinary heritage,
consistent progress toward becoming a more perfect Union, and unmatched
record of advancing liberty, prosperity, and human flourishing.  Museums
in our Nation’s capital should be places where individuals go to learn —
not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives
that distort our shared history.

To advance this policy, we will restore the Smithsonian Institution to
its rightful place as a symbol of inspiration and American greatness –-
igniting the imagination of young minds, honoring the richness of
American history and innovation, and instilling pride in the hearts of
all Americans.
