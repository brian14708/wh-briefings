title: Imposing Tariffs on Countries Importing Venezuelan Oil
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) (IEEPA), the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq*.), and section 301 of
title 3, United States Code, and in view of the national emergency
declared with respect to Venezuela in Executive Order 13692 of March 8,
2015 (Blocking Property and Suspending Entry of Certain Persons
Contributing to the Situation in Venezuela), as continued most recently
in the notice of February 27, 2025 (Continuation of the National
Emergency with Respect to Venezuela), I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of
the United States of America, find that the actions and policies of the
regime of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela continue to pose an unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the
United States.  The activities of the Tren de Aragua gang, a
transnational criminal organization originating in Venezuela and
designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and a Specially
Designated Global Terrorist organization, have intensified this threat,
as highlighted in Proclamation 10903 of March 14, 2025 (Invocation of
the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by
Tren De Aragua).  Furthermore, Venezuela’s ongoing destabilizing
actions, including its support for illicit activities, necessitate
further economic measures to protect United States interests.

In light of these circumstances, and to address the continued national
emergency with respect to Venezuela that forms the basis for Executive
Order 13692 and subsequent orders, I hereby order:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Findings</span>.  (a)  The
Tren de Aragua gang, a transnational criminal organization with origins
in Venezuela, has been designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by
the United States due to its extensive involvement in terrorist
activities such as kidnapping and violent attacks, including the
assassination of a Venezuelan opposition figure, that destabilize
communities across the Western Hemisphere.  The prior administration’s
open-borders policies facilitated the infiltration of the United States
by members of Tren de Aragua, allowing these dangerous criminals to
establish a foothold within United States cities and prey upon American
citizens. The Maduro regime aided and facilitated the influx of Tren de
Aragua members into the United States during the prior administration by
failing to control its borders, permitting the gang’s operations to
flourish within Venezuela, and refusing to take action against its
members, thereby exacerbating the illegal immigration crisis.

\(b\)  Existing sanctions on Venezuela, including those imposed in
Executive Order 13692, Executive Order 13808 of August 24, 2017
(Imposing Additional Sanctions with Respect to the Situation in
Venezuela), Executive Order 13850 of November 1, 2018 (Blocking Property
of Additional Persons Contributing to the Situation in Venezuela), and
Executive Order 13884 of August 5, 2019 (Blocking Property of the
Government of Venezuela), remain in effect.  The actions and policies of
the Maduro regime that were the basis for those orders continue to pose
an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign
policy of the United States.  These actions include:

\(i\)    The systematic undermining of democratic institutions through
the suppression of free and fair elections and the illegitimate
consolidation of power by the regime of Nicolás Maduro;

\(ii\)   Endemic economic mismanagement and public corruption at the
expense of the Venezuelan people and their prosperity;

\(iii\)  The regime’s responsibility for the deepening humanitarian and
public health crisis in Venezuela; and

\(iv\)   The destabilization of the Western Hemisphere through the
forced migration of millions of Venezuelans, imposing significant
burdens on neighboring countries.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Imposition of Tariffs</span>. 
(a)  On or after April 2, 2025, a tariff of 25 percent may be imposed on
all goods imported into the United States from any country that imports
Venezuelan oil, whether directly from Venezuela or indirectly through
third parties.  Duties imposed by this order will be supplemental to
duties on imports already imposed pursuant to IEEPA, section 232 of the
Trade Expansion of 1962, section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, or any
other authority.

\(b\)  The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the
Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security,
and the United States Trade Representative, is hereby authorized to
determine in his discretion whether the tariff of 25 percent will be
imposed on goods from any country that imports Venezuelan oil, directly
or indirectly, on or after April 2, 2025.

\(c\)  Once imposed on a country at the Secretary of State’s discretion,
the tariff of 25 percent shall expire 1 year after the last date on
which the country imported Venezuelan oil, or at an earlier date if the
Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the
Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the
United States Trade Representative, so determines at his discretion.  

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.

the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary
of Homeland Security, and the United States Trade Representative, is
hereby authorized to impose the tariffs established by this order.

\(b\)  The Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with the Secretary of
State and the Attorney General, is hereby authorized to:

\(i\)    Determine whether a country has imported Venezuelan oil,
directly or indirectly;

\(ii\)   Issue regulations, guidance, and determinations as necessary to
implement this order;

\(iii\)  Coordinate with the heads of other executive departments and
agencies to ensure compliance; and

\(iv\)   Take any additional actions consistent with applicable law to
carry out the purposes of this order.

\(c\)  Any prior Presidential Proclamation, Executive Order, or other
Presidential directive or guidance that is inconsistent with the
direction in this order is hereby terminated, suspended, or modified to
the extent necessary to give full effect to this order.

(d)  Any other Presidential Proclamation, Executive Order, or other
Presidential directive or guidance that applies to Venezuela or a
country subject to a tariff under section 2 of this order remains in
full effect, except to the extent specified in subsection (c) of this
section.

(e)  If the Secretary of State, at his discretion, decides to impose a
tariff under section 2 of this order on China, that tariff shall also
apply to both the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Macau
Special Administrative Region, as a measure to reduce the risk of
transshipment and evasion.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Reporting and Review</span>. 
The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Commerce shall submit
periodic reports to the President, within 180 days of the date of this
order and no less than every 180 days thereafter, assessing the
effectiveness of the tariffs described in this order and the ongoing
conduct of the Maduro regime.

benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
