title: Addressing Risks From WilmerHale
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>. 
My Administration is committed to addressing the significant risks
associated with law firms, particularly so-called “Big Law” firms, that
engage in conduct detrimental to critical American interests.  Many
firms take actions that threaten public safety and national security,
limit constitutional freedoms, degrade the quality of American
elections, or undermine bedrock American principles.  Moreover, law
firms regularly conduct this harmful activity through their powerful pro
bono practices, earmarking hundreds of millions of their clients’
dollars for destructive causes, that often directly or indirectly harm
their own clients.  Lawyers and law firms that engage in such egregious
conduct should not have access to our Nation’s secrets, nor should such
conduct be subsidized by Federal taxpayer funds or contracts.  
Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP (WilmerHale) is yet another
law firm that has abandoned the profession’s highest ideals and abused
its pro bono practice to engage in activities that undermine justice and
the interests of the United States.  For example, WilmerHale engages in
obvious partisan representations to achieve political ends, supports
efforts to discriminate on the basis of race, backs the obstruction of
efforts to prevent illegal aliens from committing horrific crimes and
trafficking deadly drugs within our borders, and furthers the
degradation of the quality of American elections, including by
supporting efforts designed to enable noncitizens to vote.  Moreover,
WilmerHale itself discriminates against its employees based on race and
other categories prohibited by civil rights laws, including through the
use of race-based “targets.”  
WilmerHale is also bent on employing lawyers who weaponize the
prosecutorial power to upend the democratic process and distort
justice.  For example, WilmerHale rewarded Robert Mueller and his
colleagues — Aaron Zebley, Mueller’s “top aide” and “closest associate,”
and James Quarles — by welcoming them to the firm after they wielded the
power of the Federal Government to lead one of the most partisan
investigations in American history.  Mueller’s investigation epitomizes
the weaponization of government, yet WilmerHale claimed he “embodies the
highest value of our firm and profession.”  Mueller’s “investigation”
upended the lives of public servants in my Administration who were
summoned before “prosecutors” with the effect of interfering in their
ability to fulfill the mandates of my first term agenda.  This
weaponization of the justice system must not be rewarded, let alone
condoned.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Security
Clearance Review</span>.  (a)  The Attorney General, the Director of
National Intelligence, and all other relevant heads of executive
departments and agencies (agencies) shall immediately take steps
consistent with applicable law to suspend any active security clearances
held by individuals at WilmerHale, pending a review of whether such
clearances are consistent with the national interest.  
(b)  The Office of Management and Budget shall identify all Government
goods, property, material, and services, including Sensitive
Compartmented Information Facilities, provided for the benefit of
WilmerHale.  The heads of agencies providing such material or services
shall, to the extent permitted by law, expeditiously cease such
provision.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Contracting</span>.  (a)  To
prevent the transfer of taxpayer dollars to Federal contractors whose
earnings subsidize, among other things, activities that are not aligned
with American interests, including racial discrimination, Government
contracting agencies shall, to the extent permissible by law, require
Government contractors to disclose any business they do with WilmerHale
and whether that business is related to the subject of the Government
contract.  
(b)  The heads of agencies shall review all contracts with WilmerHale or
with entities that disclose doing business with WilmerHale under
subsection (a) of this section.  To the extent permitted by law, the
heads of agencies shall:  
(i)   take appropriate steps to terminate any contract, to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable law, including the Federal Acquisition
Regulation, for which WilmerHale has been hired to perform any service;
and  
(ii)  otherwise align their agency funding decisions with the interests
of the citizens of the United States; with the goals and priorities of
my Administration as expressed in executive actions, especially
Executive Order 14147 of January 20, 2025 (Ending the Weaponization of
the Federal Government); and as heads of agencies deem appropriate. 
Within 30 days of the date of this order, agencies shall submit to the
Director of the Office of Management and Budget an assessment of
contracts with WilmerHale or with entities that do business with
WilmerHale effective as of the date of this order and any actions taken
with respect to those contracts in accordance with this order.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Racial
Discrimination</span>.  Nothing in this order shall be construed to
limit the action authorized by section 4 of Executive Order 14230 of
March 6, 2025 (Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP).    
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Personnel</span>. 
(a)  The heads of agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law,
provide guidance limiting official access from Federal Government
buildings to employees of WilmerHale when such access would threaten the
national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of
the United States.  In addition, the heads of agencies shall provide
guidance limiting Government employees acting in their official capacity
from engaging with WilmerHale employees to ensure consistency with the
national security and other interests of the United States.  
(b)  Agency officials shall, to the extent permitted by law, refrain
from hiring employees of WilmerHale, absent a waiver from the head of
the agency, made in consultation with the Director of the Office of
Personnel Management, that such hire will not threaten the national
security of the United States.  
  
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.
 (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:  
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or  
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.  
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
