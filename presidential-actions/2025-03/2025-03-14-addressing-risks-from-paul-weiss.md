title: Addressing Risks from Paul Weiss
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>. 
Global law firms have for years played an outsized role in undermining
the judicial process and in the destruction of bedrock American
principles.  Many have engaged in activities that make our communities
less safe, increase burdens on local businesses, limit constitutional
freedoms, and degrade the quality of American elections.  Additionally,
they have sometimes done so on behalf of clients, pro bono*,* or
ostensibly “for the public good” — potentially depriving those who
cannot otherwise afford the benefit of top legal talent the access to
justice deserved by all.  My Administration will no longer support
taxpayer funds sponsoring such harm.    
My Administration has already taken action to address some of the
significant risks and egregious conduct associated with law firms, and I
have determined that similar action is necessary to end Government
sponsorship of harmful activity by an additional law firm:  Paul, Weiss,
Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP (Paul Weiss).  In 2021, a Paul Weiss
partner and former leading prosecutor in the office of Special Counsel
Robert Mueller brought a pro bono suit against individuals alleged to
have participated in the events that occurred at or near the United
States Capitol on January 6, 2021, on behalf of the District of Columbia
Attorney General.  
In 2022, Paul Weiss hired unethical attorney Mark Pomerantz, who had
previously left Paul Weiss to join the Manhattan District Attorney’s
office solely to manufacture a prosecution against me and who, according
to his co-workers, unethically led witnesses in ways designed to
implicate me.  After being unable to convince even Manhattan District
Attorney Alvin Bragg that a fraud case was feasible, Pomerantz engaged
in a media campaign to gin up support for this unwarranted
prosecution.  
Additionally, Paul Weiss discriminates against its own employees on the
basis of race and other categories prohibited by civil rights laws.
 Paul Weiss, along with nearly every other large, influential, or
industry leading law firm, makes decisions around “targets” based on
race and sex.  My Administration is committed to ending such unlawful
discrimination perpetrated in the name of “diversity, equity, and
inclusion” policies and ensuring that Federal benefits support the laws
and policies of the United States, including those laws and policies
promoting our national security and respecting the democratic process. 
Those who engage in blatant discrimination and other activities
inconsistent with the interests of the United States should not have
access to our Nation’s secrets nor be deemed responsible stewards of any
Federal funds.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Security
Clearance Review</span>.  (a)  The Attorney General, the Director of
National Intelligence, and all other relevant heads of executive
departments and agencies (agencies) shall immediately take steps
consistent with applicable law to suspend any active security clearances
held by individuals at Paul Weiss and Mark Pomerantz, pending a review
of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest.  
(b)  The Office of Management and Budget shall identify all Government
goods, property, material, and services, including Sensitive
Compartmented Information Facilities, provided for the benefit of Paul
Weiss.  The heads of all agencies providing such material or services
shall, to the extent permitted by law, expeditiously cease such
provision.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Contracting</span>.  (a)  To
prevent the transfer of taxpayer dollars to Federal contractors whose
earnings subsidize, among other things, activities that are not aligned
with American interests, including racial discrimination, Government
contracting agencies shall, to the extent permissible by law, require
Government contractors to disclose any business they do with Paul Weiss
and whether that business is related to the subject of the Government
contract.  
(b)  The heads of all agencies shall review all contracts with Paul
Weiss or with entities that disclose doing business with Paul Weiss
under subsection (a) of this section.  To the extent permitted by law,
the heads of agencies shall:  
(i)   take appropriate steps to terminate any contract, to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable law, including the Federal Acquisition
Regulation, for which Paul Weiss has been hired to perform any
service;  
(ii)  otherwise align their agency funding decisions with the interests
of the citizens of the United States; with the goals and priorities of
my Administration as expressed in executive actions, especially
Executive Order 14147 of January 20, 2025 (Ending the Weaponization of
the Federal Government); and as heads of agencies deem appropriate. 
Within 30 days of the date of this order, all agencies shall submit to
the Director of the Office of Management and Budget an assessment of
contracts with Paul Weiss or with entities that do business with Paul
Weiss effective as of the date of this order and any actions taken with
respect to those contracts in accordance with this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Racial
Discrimination</span>.  Nothing in this order shall be construed to
limit the action authorized by section 4 of Executive Order 14230 of
March 6, 2025 (Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP).  

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Personnel</span>. 
(a)  The heads of all agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law,
provide guidance limiting official access from Federal Government
buildings to employees of Paul Weiss when such access would threaten the
national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of
the United States.  In addition, the heads of all agencies shall provide
guidance limiting Government employees acting in their official capacity
from engaging with Paul Weiss employees to ensure consistency with the
national security and other interests of the United States.  
     (b)  Agency officials shall, to the extent permitted by law,
refrain from hiring employees of Paul Weiss, absent a waiver from the
head of the agency, made in consultation with the Director of the Office
of Personnel Management, that such hire will not threaten the national
security of the United States.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.
 (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:  
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or  
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.  
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
