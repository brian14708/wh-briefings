title: Improving Education Outcomes by Empowering Parents, States, and Communities
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, and to enable parents, teachers,
and communities to best ensure student success, it is hereby ordered:  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose and Policy</span>*.* 
Our Nation’s bright future relies on empowered families, engaged
communities, and excellent educational opportunities for every child. 
Unfortunately, the experiment of controlling American education through
Federal programs and dollars — and the unaccountable bureaucracy those
programs and dollars support — has plainly failed our children, our
teachers, and our families.  
  
Taxpayers spent around $200 billion at the Federal level on schools
during the COVID-19 pandemic, on top of the more than $60 billion they
spend annually on Federal school funding.  This money is largely
distributed by one of the newest Cabinet agencies, the Department of
Education, which has existed for less than one fifth of our Nation’s
history.  The Congress created the Department of Education in 1979 at
the urging of President Jimmy Carter, who received a first-ever
Presidential endorsement from the country’s largest teachers’ union
shortly after pledging to the union his support for a separate
Department of Education.  Since then, the Department of Education has
entrenched the education bureaucracy and sought to convince America that
Federal control over education is beneficial.  While the Department of
Education does not educate anyone, it maintains a public relations
office that includes over 80 staffers at a cost of more than $10 million
per year.  
  
Closing the Department of Education would provide children and their
families the opportunity to escape a system that is failing them. 
Today, American reading and math scores are near historical lows.  This
year’s National Assessment of Educational Progress showed that 70
percent of 8th graders were below proficient in reading, and 72 percent
were below proficient in math.  The Federal education bureaucracy is not
working.    
  
Closure of the Department of Education would drastically improve program
implementation in higher education.  The Department of Education
currently manages a student loan debt portfolio of more than $1.6
trillion.  This means the Federal student aid program is roughly the
size of one of the Nation’s largest banks, Wells Fargo.  But although
Wells Fargo has more than 200,000 employees, the Department of Education
has fewer than 1,500 in its Office of Federal Student Aid.  The
Department of Education is not a bank, and it must return bank functions
to an entity equipped to serve America’s students.  
  
Ultimately, the Department of Education’s main functions can, and
should, be returned to the States.   
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Closing the Department of
Education and Returning Authority to the States</span>.  (a)  The
Secretary of Education shall, to the maximum extent appropriate and
permitted by law, take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of
the Department of Education and return authority over education to the
States and local communities while ensuring the effective and
uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which
Americans rely.

(b)  Consistent with the Department of Education’s authorities, the
Secretary of Education shall ensure that the allocation of any Federal
Department of Education funds is subject to rigorous compliance with
Federal law and Administration policy, including the requirement that
any program or activity receiving Federal assistance terminate illegal
discrimination obscured under the label “diversity, equity, and
inclusion” or similar terms and programs promoting gender ideology.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>*.* 
(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
