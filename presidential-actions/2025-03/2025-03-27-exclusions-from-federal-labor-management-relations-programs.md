<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Delegation of Authority to the
Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs</span>.  (a)  Subject to the
requirements of subsection (b) of this section, the Secretaries of
Defense and Veterans Affairs are delegated authority under 5 U.S.C.
7103(b)(1) to issue orders suspending the application of section 1-402
or 1-404 of Executive Order 12171, as amended, to any subdivisions of
the departments they supervise, thereby bringing such subdivisions under
the coverage of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute.

\(b\)  An order described in subsection (a) of this section shall only
be effective if:

(i)   the applicable Secretary certifies to the President that the
provisions of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute can
be applied to such subdivision in a manner consistent with national
security requirements and considerations; and

\(ii\)  such certification is submitted for publication in the *Federal
Register* within 15 days of the date of this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Delegation of Authority to the
Secretary of Transportation</span>*.  *(a)  The national security
interests of the United States in ensuring the safety and integrity of
the national transportation system require that the Secretary of
Transportation have maximum flexibility to cultivate an efficient
workforce at the Department of Transportation that is adaptive to new
technologies and innovation.  Where collective bargaining is
incompatible with that mission, the Department of Transportation should
not be forced to seek relief through grievances, arbitrations, or
administrative proceedings.

\(b\)  The Secretary of Transportation is therefore delegated authority
under section 7103(b) of title 5, United States Code, to issue orders
excluding any subdivision of the Department of Transportation, including
the Federal Aviation Administration, from Federal Service
Labor-Management Relations Statute coverage or suspending any provision
of that law with respect to any Department of Transportation
installation or activity located outside the 50 States and the District
of Columbia.  This authority may not be further delegated.  When making
the determination required by 5 U.S.C. 7103(b)(1) or 7103(b)(2), the
Secretary of Transportation shall publish his determination in
the *Federal Register.*

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Implementation</span>.  With
respect to employees in agencies or subdivisions thereof that were
previously part of a bargaining unit but have been excepted under this
order, each applicable agency head shall, upon termination of the
applicable collective bargaining agreement:

(a)  reassign any such employees who performed non-agency business
pursuant to section 7131 of title 5 or section 4116 of title 22, United
States Code, to performing solely agency business; and

\(b\)  terminate agency participation in any pending grievance
proceedings under section 7121 of title 5, United States Code,
exceptions to arbitral awards under section 7122 of title 5, United
States Code, or unfair labor practice proceedings under section 7118 of
title 5 or section 4116 of title 22, United States Code, that involve
such employees.

Sec. 7.  Additional Review.  Within 30 days of the date of this order,
the head of each agency with employees covered by Chapter 71 of title 5,
United States Code, shall submit a report to the President that
identifies any agency subdivisions not covered by Executive Order 12171,
as amended:

\(a\) that have as a primary function intelligence, counterintelligence,
investigative, or national security work, applying the definition of
“national security” set forth by the Federal Labor Relations Authority
in *Department of Energy, Oak Ridge Operations, and National Association
of Government Employees Local R5-181*, 4 FLRA 644 (1980); and

\(b\)  for which the agency head believes the provisions of Chapter 71
of title 5, United States Code, cannot be applied to such subdivision in
a manner consistent with national security requirements and
considerations, and the reasons therefore.

Sec. 8.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be
construed to impair or otherwise affect:

\(i\)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or
agency, or the head thereof; or

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

\(c\)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
