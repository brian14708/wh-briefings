title: ADDRESSING REMEDIAL ACTION BY PAUL WEISS
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.  On March
14, 2025, I signed Executive Order 14237 (Addressing Risks from Paul
Weiss) to address certain issues related to Paul, Weiss, Rifkind,
Wharton & Garrison LLP (Paul Weiss).  I noted that “\[g\]lobal law firms
have for years played an outsized role in undermining the judicial
process and in the destruction of bedrock American principles.”  Paul
Weiss is one of many law firms that have participated in this harmful
activity.   
  
 Earlier this week, though, Paul Weiss indicated that it will engage in
a remarkable change of course.  Specifically, Paul Weiss has
acknowledged the wrongdoing of its former partner Mark Pomerantz, and it
has agreed to a number of policy changes to promote equality, justice,
and the principles that keep our Nation strong, including:  adopting a
policy of political neutrality with respect to client selection and
attorney hiring; taking on a wide range of pro bono matters representing
the full political spectrum; committing to merit-based hiring,
promotion, and retention, instead of “diversity, equity, and inclusion”
policies; dedicating the equivalent of $40 million in pro bono legal
services during my term in office to support causes including assisting
our Nation’s veterans, fairness in the justice system, and combating
anti-Semitism; and other similar initiatives.  
  
This development should give Americans hope.  If the legal profession
dedicates a fraction of its energy to bringing justice to local
communities, unleashing hard-working businesses, strengthening the
American family, and unifying our Nation, all Americans will benefit.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Revocation</span>.  I hereby
revoke Executive Order 14237 of March 14, 2025 (Addressing Risks from
Paul Weiss).  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.
 (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:  
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or  
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.  
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.  
  
THE WHITE HOUSE,
