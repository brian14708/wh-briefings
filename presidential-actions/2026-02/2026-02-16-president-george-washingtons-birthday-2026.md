By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Today, our Nation honors President George Washington, our foremost
American hero, the face of the American Revolution, and a champion of
American liberty.  On President Washington’s Birthday, particularly as
we celebrate 250 glorious years of American independence, we pay tribute
to the father of our country, and with immeasurable pride and gratitude,
we salute his unwavering fidelity to law, liberty, and the common good. 
As we chart the course toward the next 250 years of our great American
story, we commit to forging a future that emulates his grace, imitates
his courage, and mirrors his unshakable devotion to the promise of
freedom.

Born in the Virginia Colony in 1732, George Washington was first
commissioned as a Lieutenant Colonel in 1754, fighting in the early
stages of the French and Indian War before serving in the Virginia House
of Burgesses, where he grew increasingly outspoken against the British
Crown’s reign of taxation and tyranny.  He assembled a band of farmers,
frontiersmen, blacksmiths, and merchants to create the Continental Army,
eventually leading them to victory at Yorktown over the British Army and
their Hessian allies. 

Through every triumph and tribulation, he carried himself with unfailing
dignity and resolve.  When defeat seemed all but certain during
Christmas of 1776, he rallied his men to cross the Delaware River and
wrested victory at Trenton.  When faced with insurmountable odds and
threats of mutiny during the brutal winter at Valley Forge, he
persevered and prevailed.  When decades of war and public service left
him weary and longing for solitude, he continued selflessly answering
duty’s call.  When Europe descended into warfare, he courageously put
our national interests and the cause of peace first.  And when
confronted with a violent uprising from rogue actors during the Whiskey
Rebellion, he defended the rule of law and our Constitution with
confidence and strength.  Time and again, when any other man would have
surrendered to despair, Washington pressed forward with unmatched
determination. 

Despite his desire to exit public life and enjoy the fruits of
retirement, Washington presided over the Constitutional Convention at
Independence Hall and was later unanimously elected as our first
President in 1789 — serving two terms before voluntarily relinquishing
power and returning home to his beloved Mount Vernon, setting the
precedent for the new Republic.  Upon his retirement, King George III,
once Washington’s political foe, hailed him as “the greatest man of the
age.”  By the time of his death, he commanded the respect of the entire
world.

Among President Washington’s greatest legacies is his timeless
insistence that, in order to be a great Nation, America must be a Nation
that prays and gives thanks to our Creator.  As he famously declared in
his Farewell Address, “virtue or morality is a necessary spring of
popular government,” and our faith in God is indispensable to our
prosperity and strength. 

Driven by his relentless tenacity until his very last breath, Washington
was a champion of American sovereignty, a brilliant unifier and
tactician, and a man of devout faith and incorruptible conscience — and
his visionary leadership remains forever imprinted on the soul of our
Nation.

Following President Washington’s death in December of 1799, the great
Henry Lee declared that Washington was “first in war, first in peace,
and first in the hearts of his countrymen.”  To this very day, he
remains the first in our hearts and souls — and his courage and resolve
remain the birthright of every American citizen.  As we pay tribute to
our first Commander in Chief and set our eyes toward our next 250 years
of liberty, we pledge to build a future that honors his legacy,
cherishes his wisdom, and restores America as one glorious Nation under
God.

It is therefore fitting that as we celebrate what would have been his
294th birthday — and as we commemorate 250 years of American freedom and
independence — we pause to offer our gratitude for President
Washington’s gallant life of public service.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 16, 2026, as
a reserved holiday commemorating President George Washington’s Birthday.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of
February, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-six, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
fiftieth.

                              DONALD J. TRUMP
