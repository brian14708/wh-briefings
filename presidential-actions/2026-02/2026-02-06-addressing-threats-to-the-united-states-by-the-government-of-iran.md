title: Addressing Threats to the United States by the Government of Iran
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) (IEEPA), the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq*.), section 604 of the
Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title
3, United States Code, I hereby determine and order:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.  Executive
Order 12957 of March 15, 1995 (Prohibiting Certain Transactions With
Respect to the Development of Iranian Petroleum Resources), found that
the actions and policies of the Government of Iran constitute an unusual
and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and
economy of the United States and declared a national emergency to deal
with that threat.  Numerous subsequent Executive Orders — including
Executive Order 13059 of August 19, 1997 (Prohibiting Certain
Transactions With Respect to Iran); Executive Order 13590 of November
20, 2011 (Authorizing the Imposition of Certain Sanctions With Respect
to the Provision of Goods, Services, Technology, or Support for Iran’s
Energy and Petrochemical Sectors); Executive Order 13622 of July 30,
2012 (Authorizing Additional Sanctions With Respect to Iran); Executive
Order 13902 of January 10, 2020 (Imposing Sanctions With Respect to
Additional Sectors of Iran); and others — have further described the
threat posed by the Government of Iran and taken additional action to
deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12957.  For
example, Executive Order 13553 of September 28, 2010 (Blocking Property
of Certain Persons With Respect to Serious Human Rights Abuses by the
Government of Iran and Taking Certain Other Actions), took additional
steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order
12957, including authorizing the blocking of property to address serious
human rights abuses against persons in Iran.  Executive Order 13846 of
August 6, 2018 (Reimposing Certain Sanctions With Respect to Iran), also
took additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in
Executive Order 12957, including imposing sanctions to advance the goal
of applying financial pressure on the Iranian regime in pursuit of a
comprehensive and lasting solution to the full range of the threats
posed by the Government of Iran.

I have received additional information from various senior officials on,
among other things, the actions and policies of the Government of Iran,
including the circumstances related to the national emergency declared
in Executive Order 12957 and expanded on in subsequent orders.  After
considering this additional information, among other things, I find that
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12957 and further
described in subsequent orders continues and that the actions and
policies of the Government of Iran continue to pose an unusual and
extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part
outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, and
economy of the United States.

To deal with the national emergency described in Executive Order 12957
and subsequent orders, I determine that it is necessary and appropriate
to impose an additional *ad valorem* duty on imports of articles that
are products of foreign countries that directly or indirectly purchase,
import, or otherwise acquire any goods or services from Iran.  In my
judgment, the tariff regime, as described below, in addition to
maintaining the other measures taken to address the national emergency
described in Executive Order 12957 and subsequent orders, will more
effectively deal with the national emergency described in those orders.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Imposition of Tariffs</span>.
 (a)  Beginning on the effective date of this order, an additional *ad
valorem* rate of duty — for example, 25 percent — may be imposed on
goods imported into the United States that are products of any country
that directly or indirectly purchases, imports, or otherwise acquires
any goods or services from Iran, in accordance with subsections (b) and
(c) of this section.  

(b)(i)  The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of
State and any senior official the Secretary of Commerce deems
appropriate, shall determine whether, after the effective date of this
order, a foreign country directly or indirectly purchases, imports, or
otherwise acquires any goods or services from Iran.  After the Secretary
of Commerce finds that a foreign country directly or indirectly
purchases, imports, or otherwise acquires any goods or services from
Iran, the Secretary of Commerce shall inform the Secretary of State of
his finding, including any information relevant to that finding. 

(ii)  The Secretary of Commerce may issue rules, regulations, and
guidance necessary or appropriate to implement this order.  The
Secretary of Commerce may also make any other determinations or take any
other actions necessary or appropriate to implement this order.

(c)(i)  After the Secretary of Commerce makes an affirmative finding
pursuant to subsection (b)(i) of this section and informs the Secretary
of State of his finding, the Secretary of State, in consultation with
the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary
of Homeland Security, and the United States Trade Representative, shall
determine whether and to what extent an additional *ad valorem* rate of
duty should be imposed on goods that are products of the foreign country
found to directly or indirectly purchase, import, or otherwise acquire
goods or services from Iran.  

\(ii\)   If the Secretary of State determines that an additional *ad
valorem* rate of duty should be imposed on goods that are products of
the country found to directly or indirectly purchase, import, or
otherwise acquire goods or services from Iran, the Secretary of State
shall inform me of his recommendation, and the Secretary of Commerce
shall inform me of his finding related to that recommendation.  I will
then consider the recommendation and finding, among other relevant
things, in determining whether and to what extent to impose an
additional *ad valorem* rate of duty on goods that are products of the
country in question. 

(iii)  The Secretary of State may issue rules, regulations, and guidance
necessary or appropriate to implement this order.  The Secretary of
State may also make any other determinations or take any other actions
necessary or appropriate to implement this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Modification Authority</span>.
 (a)  To ensure that the national emergency described in section 1 of
this order is dealt with, I may modify this order, including in light of
additional information, recommendations from senior officials, or
changed circumstances.

\(b\)  Should a foreign country retaliate against the United States in
response to this order or any action taken pursuant to this order, I may
modify this order or actions taken pursuant to this order to ensure the
efficacy of this order and the actions taken pursuant to this order to
deal with the national emergency described in section 1 of this order. 

\(c\)  Should the Government of Iran or a foreign country affected by
this order take significant steps to address the national emergency
described in section 1 of this order and align sufficiently with the
United States on national security, foreign policy, and economic
matters, I may modify this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Monitoring and
Recommendations</span>.  (a)  The Secretary of State, in consultation
with any senior official the Secretary of State deems appropriate, shall
monitor the circumstances involving the national emergency described in
section 1 of this order.  The Secretary of State shall inform me of any
circumstance that, in his opinion, might indicate the need for further
Presidential action.

\(b\)  The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the
Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security,
the United States Trade Representative, and any other senior official
the Secretary of State deems appropriate, shall recommend to me
additional action, if necessary, if the actions in this order or taken
pursuant to this order are not effective in dealing with the national
emergency described in section 1 of this order.

(c)  The Secretary of Commerce shall monitor whether a foreign country
directly or indirectly purchases, imports, or otherwise acquires any
goods or services from Iran.  The Secretary of Commerce shall continue
such monitoring after a foreign country has been found to do so.
