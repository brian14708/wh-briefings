title: Imposing a Temporary Import Surcharge to Address Fundamental International
  Payments Problems
---
 
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

1.  The United States plays a pivotal role in shaping the global
    economy. At the same time, the United States faces various threats
    to its own economy and national interests. Sometimes, the United
    States faces fundamental international payments problems, such as
    large and serious balance-of-payments deficits, an imminent and
    significant depreciation of its currency in foreign exchange
    markets, or an international balance-of-payments disequilibrium.
    These problems can, among other things, endanger the ability of the
    United States to finance its spending, erode investor confidence in
    the economy, and distress the financial markets.
2.  Special import measures to restrict imports, such as surcharges and
    quotas, are key tools to protect the economy and national security
    of the United States, and, in certain circumstances, they are
    required to deal with fundamental international payments problems.
3.  Given the gravity of fundamental international payments problems and
    the importance of import restrictions as economic, national
    security, and foreign policy tools, Federal law, including section
    122 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2132) (section 122),
    empowers the President to take action through surcharges and other
    special import restrictions to address fundamental international
    payments problems.
4.  I have received certain requested information and opinions from
    senior officials on whether any fundamental international payments
    problems exist and the extent to which such problems could impair
    United States national interests, including economic and national
    security interests. The information and opinions discuss, among
    other things, the state of the balance of payments of the United
    States, the standing of the United States dollar in foreign exchange
    markets, and the state of international balances of payments. I have
    also received opinions and recommendations from senior officials on
    whether special import measures to restrict imports are required to
    address any fundamental international payments problems. These
    opinions address, among other things, whether a surcharge in the
    form of ad valorem duties is required to restrict imports to deal
    with large and serious United States balance-of-payments deficits,
    to prevent an imminent and significant depreciation of the United
    States dollar in foreign exchange markets, or to cooperate with
    other countries in correcting an international balance-of-payments
    disequilibrium.
5.  These senior officials have informed me that fundamental
    international payments problems within the meaning of section 122
    exist and that special import measures to restrict imports are
    required to address these problems. Specifically, my advisors have
    determined that an import surcharge in the form of ad valorem duties
    is required to deal with large and serious United States
    balance-of-payments deficits. My advisors have also opined that
    certain products should not be subject to the surcharge because of
    the needs of the United States economy and that the recommended
    exceptions are consistent with the limitations of section 122, the
    purposes of section 122, and the national interest of the United
    States.
6.  Among other things, I have been informed by my advisors that the
    United States balance-of-payments position, under any reasonable
    understanding of the term in the context of section 122, is
    currently a large and serious deficit. My advisors have studied
    different methods of evaluating balance-of-payments deficits,
    including calculations based on current-account statistics. In my
    advisors’ opinions, under any of these methods, the United States
    balance-of-payments position is a large and serious deficit.
7.  For instance, my advisors have informed me that the United States
    runs a deficit in selling goods and services overseas, as reported
    by the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) in the
    “balance on goods and services”; has recently reflected quarterly
    deficits in its return on investment or labor, as reported by the
    BEA in the “balance on primary income”; and runs a deficit in
    voluntary transfers, such as remittances, as reported by the BEA in
    the “balance on secondary income.” In other words, the United States
    runs a trade deficit, does not currently make a net income from the
    capital and labor that it deploys abroad, and experiences more
    transfer payments, on net, flowing out of the country than into the
    country.
8.  As my advisors have informed me, the United States runs a
    substantial trade deficit. The large, persistent, and serious annual
    United States goods trade deficit has grown by over 40 percent in
    the past 5 years alone, reaching $1.2 trillion in 2024. In 2025, the
    United States goods trade deficit remained at approximately $1.2
    trillion. The effects of this deficit are serious, and this deficit
    contributes to the fundamental international payments problems
    facing the United States.
9.  As my advisors have also informed me, the annual balance on the
    United States primary income turned negative for the first time
    since at least 1960 in 2024. From 1960 to 2023, the United States
    ran a surplus in its annual balance on primary income. That positive
    balance on primary income served as a stabilizing force for the
    United States balance-of-payments position even in the face of large
    and persistent trade deficits. In 2024, however, the balance on
    primary income turned negative and thus ceased to serve as a
    counterweight to the trade deficit in the United States current
    account. Indeed, in 2024, the United States maintained a current
    account deficit of 4.0 percent of gross domestic product (GDP),
    almost double the current account deficit of approximately 2.0
    percent that prevailed between 2013 and 2019, and larger than that
    which prevailed from 2019 to 2023. As a share of GDP, the staggering
    deficit of 4.0 percent represented the biggest annual current
    account deficit since 2008.
10. As my advisors have also informed me, the net
    international-investment position of the United States is in an
    ongoing decline. According to the BEA, at the end of 2024, the net
    international-investment position of the United States, as a share
    of GDP, was negative 90 percent, a sharp deterioration from the
    average of negative 41 percent in the decade between 2010 and 2020.
    In my advisors’ view, this is a highly atypical position for a
    country, particularly the United States. Indeed, both in terms of
    United States dollars and as a share of GDP, this represents one of
    the most negative net international-investment positions of any
    developed country. Because the current account is one of the primary
    drivers of changes in the net international-investment position, the
    atypically large negative net international-investment position of
    the United States shows that the United States balance-of-payments
    deficit is large and serious.
11. Further, as my advisors have informed me, the balance on secondary
    income of the United States has been persistently in a deficit since
    the 1960s.
12. According to my advisors, an import surcharge in the form of ad
    valorem duties is required to address these fundamental
    international payments problems. In my advisors’ opinions, imposing
    an import surcharge would deal with the large and serious United
    States balance-of-payments deficit. My advisors have further
    recommended that certain products should not be subject to the
    surcharge because of the needs of the United States economy and have
    opined that a surcharge with certain exceptions would more
    effectively deal with the balance-of-payments deficit than would a
    surcharge without the exceptions.
13. After considering the information, opinions, and recommendations
    that have been provided to me by senior officials, among other
    relevant information and considerations, I find that fundamental
    international payments problems within the meaning of section 122
    exist; that those problems significantly harm United States national
    interests, including economic and national security interests; and
    that special measures to restrict imports are required to address
    those problems, as authorized by section 122. Specifically, I find
    that a surcharge in the form of ad valorem duties on certain imports
    is required to deal with the United States’ large and serious
    balance-of-payments deficit. Accordingly, I impose, for a period of
    150 days, a temporary import surcharge of 10 percent ad valorem, as
    described below, on articles imported into the United States,
    effective February 24, 2026.
14. Because of the needs of the United States economy, I determine that
    the surcharge imposed in this proclamation shall not apply to the
    following products, as further detailed in Annexes I and II to this
    proclamation:  
    (a) certain critical minerals;  
    (b) metals used in currency and bullion;  
    (c) energy and energy products;  
    (d) natural resources and fertilizers that cannot be grown, mined,
    or otherwise produced in the United States or grown, mined, or
    otherwise produced in sufficient quantities to meet domestic
    demand;  
    (e) certain agricultural products, including beef, tomatoes, and
    oranges;  
    (f) pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients;  
    (g) certain electronics;  
    (h) passenger vehicles, certain light trucks, certain medium- and
    heavy-duty vehicles, buses, and certain parts of passenger vehicles,
    light trucks, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, and buses;  
    (i) certain aerospace products;  
    (j) information materials, donations, and accompanied baggage;  
    (k) all articles and parts of articles currently or that later
    become subject to additional import restrictions imposed pursuant to
    section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19
    U.S.C. 1862) (section 232);  
    (l) articles that are entered free of duty as a good of Canada or
    Mexico under the terms of general note 11 to the Harmonized Tariff
    Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), including any treatment set
    forth in subchapter XXIII of chapter 98 and subchapter XXII of
    chapter 99 of the HTSUS, as related to the Agreement between the
    United States of America, United Mexican States, and Canada; and  
    (m) textile and apparel articles that are entered free of duty as a
    good of Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala,
    Honduras, or Nicaragua under the Dominican Republic-Central America
    Free Trade Agreement.
15. I find that each exception described in paragraph 14 of this
    proclamation — in whole or in part, separately or in any combination
    — is consistent with the limitations of section 122. These
    exceptions, which are further detailed in Annexes I and II to this
    proclamation, reflect my determination that each product covered by
    each exception should not be subject to a surcharge because of (1)
    the unavailability of domestic supply at reasonable prices, the
    necessary importation of raw materials, the avoidance of serious
    dislocations in the supply of imported goods, or other similar
    factors; or (2) the fact that the surcharge would be unnecessary or
    ineffective in carrying out the purposes of section 122, such as
    with respect to articles already subject to import restrictions or
    goods in transit, which — for purposes of this proclamation — are
    goods that (i) were loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading and
    in transit on the final mode of transit prior to entry into the
    United States, before 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on February
    24, 2026; and (ii) are entered for consumption, or withdrawn from
    warehouse for consumption, before 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time,
    February 28, 2026. I have determined that each exception described
    in paragraph 14 of this proclamation — in whole or in part,
    separately or in any combination — is consistent with the purposes
    of section 122 and will best serve the purposes of section 122. Each
    of my determinations to except an import from the surcharge imposed
    in this proclamation is independent from the other. The
    import-restricting action and the exceptions in this proclamation
    are not made for the purpose of protecting individual domestic
    industries from import competition.
16. In my judgment, the surcharge imposed in this proclamation is
    consistent with the purposes of section 122, the national interest
    of the United States, and the needs of the economy of the United
    States. Restricting imports through the surcharge imposed in this
    proclamation is required to address the fundamental international
    payments problems within the meaning of section 122 that I have
    found to exist. The surcharge imposed in this proclamation will deal
    with the large and serious United States balance-of-payments
    deficit.
17. Section 122 authorizes the President to impose, for a period not
    exceeding 150 days unless extended by an Act of the Congress, a
    temporary import surcharge up to 15 percent ad valorem and other
    temporary limitations on articles imported into the United States in
    situations of fundamental international payments problems.
18. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483)
    (section 604), authorizes the President to embody in the HTSUS the
    substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions
    thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or
    imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws
of the United States, including section 122, section 301 of title 3,
United States Code, and section 604, do hereby proclaim as follows:  
(1) Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, as set forth in
Annexes I and II to this proclamation, all articles imported into the
United States shall be subject to a 10 percent ad valorem duty rate.  
(2) The surcharge imposed in this proclamation shall not apply to
imports of articles listed in paragraph 2 of Annex I to this
proclamation and as enumerated in Annex II to this proclamation.  
(3) Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, the surcharge
imposed in this proclamation is in addition to any other duties, taxes,
fees, exactions, and charges applicable to such products.  
(4) The surcharge imposed in this proclamation shall not apply in
addition to tariffs imposed under section 232. To the extent a tariff
imposed under section 232 applies to part of an import, the surcharge
imposed in this proclamation shall apply to the part of the import to
which section 232 tariffs do not apply but shall not apply to the part
of the import to which section 232 tariffs do apply.  
(5) The surcharge imposed in this proclamation shall be treated as a
regular customs duty.  
(6) Any article subject to the surcharge imposed in this proclamation,
except those articles eligible for admission under “domestic status” as
described in 19 CFR 146.43, that is subject to the surcharge imposed in
this proclamation and that is admitted into a United States foreign
trade zone on or after the effective date of this proclamation must be
admitted as “privileged foreign status,” as described in 19 CFR 146.41,
and will be subject upon entry for consumption to any ad valorem rate of
duty related to the classification under the applicable HTSUS
subheading.  
(7) The HTSUS shall be modified as provided in Annex I to this
proclamation. The modifications shall be effective with respect to goods
entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on
or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on February 24, 2026, and
shall continue in effect through 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on
July 24, 2026, unless the surcharge imposed in this proclamation is
expressly suspended, modified, or terminated on an earlier date, or
unless the effective period of such surcharge is extended by an Act of
the Congress.  
(8) The head of each executive department and agency (agency) is
authorized to and shall take all appropriate measures within the
agency’s authority to implement this proclamation. The head of each
agency may, consistent with applicable law, including section 301 of
title 3, United States Code, redelegate the authority to take such
appropriate measures within the agency.  
(9) The United States Trade Representative (Trade Representative), in
consultation with any senior official he deems appropriate, shall
monitor and review the status of conditions related to the fundamental
international payments problems of the United States, the effect of the
surcharge imposed in this proclamation, and any factors he deems
relevant. The Trade Representative shall also inform the President of
any circumstance that, in the Trade Representative’s opinion, might
indicate the need for further action by the President, including under
section 122. And the Trade Representative shall inform the President of
any circumstance that, in the Trade Representative’s opinion, might
indicate that the surcharge imposed in this proclamation should be
suspended, modified, or terminated.  
(10) The Trade Representative, in consultation with the Chair of the
United States International Trade Commission and the Commissioner of
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), shall determine whether any
additional modifications to the HTSUS are necessary to effectuate this
proclamation and shall make such modifications to the HTSUS through
notice in the Federal Register, including any technical correction to
Annexes I and II to this proclamation.  
(11) The Commissioner of CBP may take any necessary or appropriate
measures to administer the surcharge imposed by this proclamation.  
(12) (a) Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders
that is inconsistent with this proclamation is superseded to the extent
of such inconsistency. If any provision of this proclamation or the
application of any provision to any individual or circumstance is held
to be invalid, the remainder of this proclamation and the application of
its provisions to any other individuals or circumstances shall not be
affected.  
(b) If any exception to the surcharge imposed in this proclamation is
held to be invalid in whole or in part, only that exception or that part
of the exception shall be treated as invalid. The surcharge imposed in
this proclamation shall apply to imports to which the invalidated
exception or the invalidated part of the exception applied before its
invalidation, but to the extent consistent with law, the surcharge shall
be collected only prospectively from the date of the invalidation. No
other exception, part of an exception, or application of an exception
shall be treated as invalid. This severability provision shall operate
even if the surcharge must be applied retroactively to imports to which
the invalidated exception or the invalidated part of the exception
applied before its invalidation. I would adopt each exception in this
proclamation in whole or in part, separately, or in any combination.
Each exception, in whole or in part, in this proclamation is supported
by the needs of the United States economy and one or more of the factors
described in section 122 and is consistent with the national interest of
the United States and the purposes of section 122.  
(c) This severability provision reflects my determination that the
surcharge imposed in this proclamation should remain operative until
July 24, 2026, in a way that is consistent with law, including the
limitations of section 122, to deal with the large and serious United
States balance-of-payments deficits found in this proclamation,
regardless of whether any exception or exceptions, in whole or in part,
are invalidated. The surcharge imposed in this proclamation — with any
combination of the exceptions in paragraph 14 of this proclamation, or
even without any of the exceptions in paragraph 14 of this proclamation
— is required to deal with the large and serious United States
balance-of-payments deficits found in this proclamation.  
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of
February, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-six, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
fiftieth.
