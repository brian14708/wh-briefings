IEEPA or involve steps necessary to implement the imposition of
additional *ad valorem* duties imposed under IEEPA shall not be affected
by this order.  The national emergencies declared or described in

United States are necessary to effectuate this order and may make such
modifications through notice in the *Federal Register*.

of Duty-Free De Minimis Treatment for All Countries), and the
Proclamation of February 20, 2026 (Imposing a Temporary Import Surcharge
to Address Fundamental International Payments Problems), are unaffected
by this order.

(d)  This order affects only the additional *ad valorem* duties imposed
under IEEPA pursuant to the Executive Orders described in section 1 of
