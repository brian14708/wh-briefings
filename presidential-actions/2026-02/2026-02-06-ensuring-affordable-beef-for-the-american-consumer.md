title: Ensuring Affordable Beef for the American Consumer

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1.  Cattle ranchers have played an integral role in United States
history, helping to forge an American identity and an American diet with
beef as a key staple food.  Today, beef remains vital in the American
diet, evidenced by the fact that the United States is the largest
consumer of beef by volume, followed closely by China and Brazil.  And
the United States ranks second in per capita beef consumption globally.

2.  But in 2022, the United States faced a widespread and severe
drought, affecting beef-producing States, such as Texas, Oklahoma,
Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Kansas.  Texas and Kansas, for
example, continue to face persistent drought conditions.  The effects of
drought are particularly pronounced for livestock producers as many of
their operations rely on precipitation to grow forage crops to feed
their herds. 

3.  In addition to droughts, wildfires have affected the grasslands of
the western United States, including America’s cattle-producing States. 
Apart from the direct threat of burns and burn-associated deaths to
cattle, cattle ranchers have had to adapt to indirect effects of
wildfires, including changes in grazing patterns, loss of feed supplies,
and suboptimal animal health for those cattle surviving the wildfires.

4.  Given the demand for beef, certain United States cattle farmers and
ranchers supplement their herds, specifically their feedlot stocks, with
cattle (calves) imported from Mexican ranchers.  But following new
detections of the New World screwworm in Mexico in May 2025, the
Department of Agriculture Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service, in
conjunction with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), restricted
the importation of live animal commodities from or transiting through
Mexico, further limiting domestic feedlot stock supplies.

5.  These factors have combined to result in the United States cattle
herd contracting to record lows.  As of July 2025, the United States
cattle inventory totaled 94.2 million head, including 28.7 million beef
cows.  This is one percent lower than the United States cattle inventory
surveyed in July 2023, continuing the downward trend of cattle inventory
in the United States.

6.  The abovementioned factors have also cumulatively resulted in higher
beef prices for United States consumers, including for ground beef. 
Since January 2021, ground beef prices have continued to rise, reaching
an average of $6.69 per pound in December 2025, according to the Bureau
of Labor Statistics — the highest since the Department of Labor started
tracking beef prices in the 1980s.

7.  Despite the increased prices and the availability of more affordable
protein alternatives, United States consumers’ demand for beef remains
strong.  The United States imported a record high amount of beef in
2024, reaching 4.64 billion pounds, a more than 24 percent increase in
beef imports since 2023.  Among the beef products the United States
imports are lean trimmings, which are blended with fattier domestic
trimmings to produce ground beef products, such as hamburgers.

8.  The Secretary of Agriculture has monitored the domestic supply of
beef products subject to a tariff-rate quota (TRQ), including lean beef
trimmings falling under Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States
(HTSUS) statistical reporting numbers 0201.30.5085 and 0202.30.5085, and
noted the domestic supply of such products and substitutable products
combined with the estimated imports of such products under the United
States beef import TRQ.  The Secretary of Agriculture also advised on
related domestic demand and pricing.

9.  As President of the United States, I have a responsibility to ensure
that hard-working Americans can afford to feed themselves and their
families.  After considering the information provided to me by the
Secretary of Agriculture, among other relevant information, I am taking
action to temporarily increase the quantity of in-quota imports of lean
beef trimmings under the United States beef TRQ to increase the supply
of ground beef for United States consumers.

10.  Section 404 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) (Public Law
103-465, 108 Stat. 4809, 4959-61 (19 U.S.C. 3601)) authorizes the
President, in certain circumstances, to modify TRQs on certain
agricultural products.  In particular, section 404(b) of the URAA (19
U.S.C. 3601(b)) provides that where imports of an agricultural product
are subject to a TRQ, and where the President determines and proclaims
that the supply of the same or directly competitive or substitutable
agricultural product will be inadequate, because of a natural disaster,
disease, or major national market disruption, to meet domestic demand at
reasonable prices, the President may temporarily increase the quantity
of imports of the agricultural product that is subject to the in-quota
rate of duty established under the TRQ.  And section 404(d)(3) of the
URAA (19 U.S.C. 3601(d)(3)) provides that the President may allocate the
in-quota quantity of a TRQ for any agricultural product among supplying
countries or customs areas and may modify any allocation as determined
appropriate by the President.

11.  After considering the information provided to me by the Secretary
of Agriculture, among other relevant information, I find that imports of
lean beef trimmings into the United States are currently subject to the
United States TRQ for beef and determine that the supply of lean beef
trimmings or directly competitive or substitutable agricultural products
will be inadequate to meet domestic demand at reasonable prices because
of a natural disaster and major national market disruption. 
Accordingly, I determine that it is necessary and appropriate to
temporarily increase the quantity of imports of lean beef trimmings
subject to the in-quota rate of duty established under the beef TRQ.  In
addition, I determine that it is appropriate to allocate all of the
increased in-quota quantity of beef, as established by this
proclamation, to Argentina.

12.  Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483),
authorizes the President to embody in the HTSUS the substance of
statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including
the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of
duty or other import restriction.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws
of the United States, including section 404 of the URAA, section 604 of
the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, and section 301 of title 3, United
States Code, do hereby proclaim as follows:

\(1\)  For calendar year 2026, the aggregate in-quota quantity for
certain products described in Additional U.S. Note 3 of Chapter 2 of the
HTSUS will be increased by 80,000 metric tons (mt).  

\(2\)  The additional 80,000 mt described in clause (1) of this
proclamation will apply only to lean beef trimmings classifiable under
HTSUS statistical reporting numbers 0201.30.5085 and 0202.30.5085. 

\(3\)  The additional 80,000 mt described in clauses (1) and (2) of this
proclamation will be administered on a first-come, first-served basis in
four quarterly tranches.  The first tranche of 20,000 mt will open on
February 13, 2026, and close on March 31, 2026.  The second tranche of
20,000 mt will open on April 1, 2026, and close on June 30, 2026.  The
third tranche of 20,000 mt will open on July 1, 2026, and close on
September 30, 2026.  The fourth tranche of 20,000 mt will open on
October 1, 2026, and close on December 31, 2026.

\(4\)  The additional 80,000 mt described in clauses (1) and (2) of this
proclamation is allocated in its entirety to Argentina.

(5)(a)  To establish the TRQ amendments described in this proclamation,
the HTSUS is modified as set forth in the Annex to this proclamation.

(b)  The United States Trade Representative (Trade Representative), in
consultation with CBP, shall determine whether any additional
modifications to the HTSUS are necessary to effectuate this proclamation
and shall make such modifications to the HTSUS through notice in the
*Federal Register*, including any technical correction to the Annex to
this proclamation.

\(6\)  The Secretary of Agriculture shall continue to monitor the
domestic supply of lean beef trimmings, as the Secretary considers
appropriate, and shall advise me on the domestic supply of lean beef
trimmings or directly competitive or substitutable products, combined
with the estimated imports of such products under the TRQ as adjusted by
this proclamation, and how such availability relates to domestic demand
at reasonable prices.  The Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation
with the Trade Representative, shall inform me of any circumstances
that, in the Secretary’s opinion, might indicate the need for further
action and shall recommend to me any additional action I should take, if
necessary.

(7)  Each executive department and agency (agency) is authorized to and
shall take all appropriate measures within its authority to implement
this proclamation.  The head of each agency may, consistent with
applicable law, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code,
redelegate any of these functions within their respective agency.

(8)  Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that
is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.  If any provision of
this proclamation or the application of any provision to any individual
or circumstance is held to be invalid, the remainder of this
proclamation and the application of its provisions to any other
individuals or circumstances shall not be affected.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this

sixth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-six,
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred
and fiftieth.

                               DONALD J. TRUMP
