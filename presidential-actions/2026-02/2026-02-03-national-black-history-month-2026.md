A Proclamation

This year, we celebrate the most significant milestone in our Nation’s
history:  250 glorious years of American independence.  From the very
beginning, our country has been blessed with countless black American
heroes.  For more than two and a half centuries, these legends have made
timeless contributions to our government, laws, military, economy,
workforce, and culture.  With their tremendous legacy in mind, as
President, I proclaim that “black history” is not distinct from American
history — rather, the history of black Americans is an indispensable
chapter in our grand American story.

America’s founding was rooted in the belief that every man, woman, and
child is created equal, “endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable Rights,” and free to live lives in “pursuit of Happiness.” 
For 250 years, these principles have inspired and informed the
independent, bold, and pioneering American spirit.  It is our bedrock
belief in equality that drove black American icons to help fulfill the
promise of these principles.  And it is our unwavering commitment to
liberty that continues to sustain our Nation’s greatness.

This month, we are also reminded that the source of our strength is
rooted not in our differences, but in our shared commitment to freedom
under one beautiful American flag.  For decades, the progressive
movement and far-left politicians have sought to needlessly divide our
citizens on the basis of race, painting a toxic and distorted and
disfigured vision of our history, heritage, and heroes.  This month,
however, we do not celebrate our differences.  Instead, we celebrate the
contributions of black Americans to our national greatness and their
enduring commitment to the American principles of liberty, justice, and
equality — the principles that wrested the Western Hemisphere from
monarchies and empires, ended slavery, saved Europe, put a man on the
moon, and built the freest, most just, and most prosperous society ever
known to mankind.

Since the great Prince Estabrook became the first black man to shed his
blood for our emerging Nation at the Battle of Lexington more than 250
years ago, heroic black Americans have valiantly fought for our liberty
on the fields of battle, in the pews of our churches, and in our shops,
restaurants, and businesses.  Across every generation, legendary black
Americans have fiercely defended the values set forth in our Declaration
of Independence and helped to make our Republic the greatest country in
the history of the world.  From the unflinching faith of Lemuel Haynes,
the soaring prose of Phillis Wheatley, and the unmatched resolve of
Harriet Tubman to the towering intellect of Frederick Douglass, the
fearlessness of Jesse Owens, and the brilliance of Katherine Johnson and
Thomas Sowell, countless black patriots have stood as the vanguards of
our freedom — and are among some of the most heroic Americans to have
ever lived. 

As President, I am fighting to restore the Nation that these titans
helped build, and to make America greater than ever before.  In their
honor, and to commemorate 250 years of American liberty, I have
authorized the construction of the National Garden of American Heroes, a
new statuary park honoring our greatest Americans, including black icons
like Booker T. Washington, Jackie Robinson, Aretha Franklin, Coretta
Scott King, Muhammad Ali, and many others.  Last spring, I also signed
an Executive Order to promote excellence and innovation at Historically
Black Colleges and Universities so the next generation of leaders in the
black community will learn from these great American examples.  And I am
fighting every day to make our neighborhoods safer, groceries more
affordable, and the American Dream more attainable for all Americans.

My Administration will never stop working to ensure that our country and
every future generation of American citizens remain guided by the same
truth:  We are one Nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and
justice for all.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 2026 as
National Black History Month.  I call upon public officials, educators,
librarians, and all the people of the United States to observe this
month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of
February, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-six, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
fiftieth.

                              DONALD J. TRUMP
