title: Continuing the Suspension of Duty-Free De Minimis Treatment for All Countries
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) (IEEPA), the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq.*), section 604 of the
Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title
3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.  In several
Executive Orders, including Executive Order 14193 of February 1, 2025
(Imposing Duties To Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our
Northern Border), as amended; Executive Order 14194 of February 1, 2025
(Imposing Duties To Address the Situation at Our Southern Border), as
amended; Executive Order 14195 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties To
Address the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People’s Republic of
China), as amended; Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating
Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That
Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade
Deficits), as amended; and Executive Order 14324 of July 30, 2025
(Suspending Duty-Free De Minimis Treatment for All Countries), I
declared or described national emergencies with respect to unusual and
extraordinary threats to the national security, foreign policy, or
economy of the United States and took action to deal with those threats,
including suspending duty-free *de minimis* treatment under 19 U.S.C.
1321(a)(2)(C) for certain imports.

As relevant here, in section 3 of Executive Order 14324, I set forth the
duty rates applicable to shipments sent to the United States through the
international postal network that would otherwise qualify for the *de
minimis* exemption under 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C).  These duty rates were
based on the additional duty rates imposed by Executive Orders issued
under IEEPA, including Executive Order 14193, as amended; Executive
Order 14194, as amended; Executive Order 14195, as amended; and
Executive Order 14257, as amended.

In section 6 of Executive Order 14324, I made clear that the suspension
of, or continued suspension of, duty-free *de minimis* treatment, as
detailed in Executive Order 14324, shall not be affected if the
additional duties imposed under Executive Order 14193, as amended;
Executive Order 14194, as amended; Executive Order 14195, as amended; or
Executive Order 14257, as amended, were held to be invalid.  I also
provided that — should such invalidation occur — duty-free *de minimis*
treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C) would be available for shipments
sent through the international postal network only until I received a
notification from the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) that adequate
systems were in place to fully and expeditiously process and collect
duties applicable to such shipments. 

Since the issuance of Executive Order 14324, the conditions outlined in
section 6 of Executive Order 14324 have occurred.  Also since the
issuance of Executive Order 14324, the Secretary has notified me that
adequate systems are now in place to collect certain duties applicable
to shipments sent through the international postal network that would
otherwise be eligible for duty-free *de minimis* treatment.  I also have
received additional information and recommendations from various senior
officials regarding the suspension of duty-free *de minimis* treatment.

After considering the information and recommendations these officials
have provided to me, among other things, I have determined that it is
still necessary and appropriate to suspend duty-free *de minimis*
treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C), including for shipments sent
through the international postal network.  U.S. Customs and Border
Protection (CBP) shall collect duties on shipments sent through the
international postal network in accordance with Executive Order 14324,
as amended below.  CBP shall also continue to take all appropriate
action to collect all applicable duties, taxes, fees, exactions, and
charges for shipments not sent through the international postal
network.  In my judgment, these actions are necessary and appropriate to
deal with the national emergencies declared in Executive Order 14193,
Executive Order 14194, Executive Order 14195, and Executive Order
14257.  Each determination is independent of the other and is made only
for the purpose of dealing with the respective emergency and not for the
purpose of dealing with another emergency.

 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Continuing the Suspension of
Duty-Free *De Minimis* Treatment</span>.  Section 2 of Executive Order
14324 is revised to read as follows:

“(a)  The duty-free *de minimis* exemption provided under 19 U.S.C.
1321(a)(2)(C) shall not apply to any shipment of articles not covered by
50 U.S.C. 1702(b), regardless of value, country of origin, mode of
transportation, or method of entry.  Accordingly, all such shipments,
except those sent through the international postal network, shall be
subject to all applicable duties, taxes, fees, exactions, and charges.
 International postal shipments not covered by 50 U.S.C. 1702(b) shall
be subject to the duty rates described in section 3 of this order. Entry
for all shipments that, prior to the effective date of this order,
qualified for the *de minimis* exemption, shall be filed using an
appropriate entry type in the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) by
a party qualified to make such entry — except for shipments sent through
the international postal network, which shall be dutiable in accordance
with section 3 of this order.

\(b\)  Shipments sent through the international postal network that
would otherwise qualify for the *de minimis* exemption under 19 U.S.C.
1321(a)(2)(C) shall pass free of any duties except those specified in
section 3 of this order, and without the preparation of an entry by CBP,
until the effective date for the new entry process for postal shipments
established by CBP and published in the *Federal Register*.“

 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Duty Rates for International
Postal Shipments</span>.  Section 3 of Executive Order 14324 is revised
to read as follows:

“(a)  Transportation carriers delivering shipments sent to the United
States through the international postal network, or other parties if
qualified in lieu of such transportation carriers, as approved by CBP,
must collect and remit duties to CBP using the methodology described in
subsection (b) of this section.  Each transportation carrier or other
qualified party shall remit duty payment to CBP in accordance with CBP
guidance on the requirements and process for remittance.

\(b\)  A duty equal to the rate provided in the Proclamation of February
20, 2026 (Imposing a Temporary Import Surcharge to Address Fundamental
International Payments Problems), shall be assessed on the value of each
dutiable postal item containing goods entered for consumption.  This
duty rate shall be assessed until the expiration date of the temporary
import surcharge established by the Proclamation of February 20, 2026,
or until the effective date of the new entry process for postal
shipments established by CBP, whichever date occurs first.

\(c\)  For all international postal shipments subject to the duty rate
in the Proclamation of February 20, 2026, in accordance with subsection
(b) of this section, the country of origin of the article and its value
must be declared to CBP.

\(d\)  Shipments sent through the international postal network that are
subject to antidumping and countervailing duties or a quota must
continue to be entered under an appropriate entry type in ACE to the
extent required by all applicable regulations.”
