<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  The United
States must ensure that our electric grid –- upon which military
installations, operations, and defense-industrial production depend —
remains resilient and reliable, and not reliant on intermittent energy
sources.  The grid is the foundation of our national defense as well as
our economic stability.  Any prolonged disruption caused by energy
shortages, foreign supply dependencies, or intermittent generation
threatens the operational readiness of our Armed Forces and the safety
of the American people.

Given our Nation’s vast coal resources and the proven reliability of our
coal-fired generation fleet in providing continuous, on-demand baseload
power, it is imperative that the Department of War (DOW) prioritize the
preservation and strategic utilization of coal-based energy assets.
 Coal generation ensures that military installations, command centers,
and defense-industrial bases remain fully powered under all conditions —
including natural disasters, or wartime contingencies.  Maintaining this
capability is a matter of national security, strategic deterrence, and
American energy dominance. 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>*.*  Pursuant to
Executive Order 14261 of April 8, 2025 (Reinvigorating America’s
Beautiful Clean Coal Industry and Amending Executive Order 14241), and
Executive Order 14262 of April 8, 2025 (Strengthening the Reliability
and Security of the United States Electric Grid), it is the policy of
the United States that coal is essential to our national and economic
security, and that our electric grid must use power generation resources
that have abundant fuel supplies capable of extended operations to
address the national emergency declared pursuant to Executive Order
14156 of January 20, 2025 (Declaring a National Energy Emergency).

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Power Purchase Agreements with
Federal Installations</span>.  The Secretary of War, in coordination
with the Secretary of Energy, shall seek to procure power from the
United States coal generation fleet by approving long-term Power
Purchase Agreements, or entering into any similar contractual
agreements, with coal-fired energy production facilities to serve DOW
installations or other mission-critical facilities, with priority given
to projects that enhance:

\(a\)  grid reliability and blackout prevention;

\(b\)  on-site fuel security; and

\(c\)  mission assurance for defense and intelligence capabilities.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>*.* 
(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

\(i\)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or
agency, or the head thereof; or

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

\(c\)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

\(d\)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
DOW.
