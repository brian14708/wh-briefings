title: Modifying Duties to Address Threats to the United States by the Government
  of the Russian Federation

2.  Current

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq*.) (IEEPA), the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq*.), section 604 of the
Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title
3, United States Code, I hereby determine and order:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.  Executive
Order 14066 of March 8, 2022 (Prohibiting Certain Imports and New
Investments With Respect to Continued Russian Federation Efforts To
Undermine the Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity of Ukraine),
expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order
14024 of April 15, 2021 (Blocking Property With Respect To Specified
Harmful Foreign Activities of the Government of the Russian Federation),
to include the actions taken against Ukraine by the Government of the
Russian Federation.  To address that unusual and extraordinary threat to
the national security and foreign policy of the United States, Executive
Order 14066 prohibited, among other things, the importation into the
United States of certain products of Russian Federation origin,
including crude oil; petroleum; and petroleum fuels, oils, and products
of their distillation.

In Executive Order 14329 of August 6, 2025 (Addressing Threats to the
United States by the Government of the Russian Federation), I found that
the national emergency described in Executive Order 14066 has continued
and that the actions and policies of the Government of the Russian
Federation continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the
national security and foreign policy of the United States.  To deal with
that threat, I determined that it was necessary and appropriate to
impose an additional *ad valorem* rate of duty of 25 percent on imports
of articles of India, which, at that time, was directly or indirectly
importing Russian Federation oil. 

I have received additional information and recommendations from senior
officials regarding India’s efforts to address the national emergency
described in Executive Order 14066.  Specifically, India has committed
to stop directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil, has
represented that it will purchase United States energy products from the
United States, and has recently committed to a framework with the United
States to expand defense cooperation over the next 10 years.

After considering the information and recommendations these officials
have provided to me, among other things, I have determined that India
has taken significant steps to address the national emergency described
in Executive Order 14066 and to align sufficiently with the United
States on national security, foreign policy, and economic matters. 
Accordingly, I have determined to eliminate the additional *ad valorem*
rate of duty imposed on imports of articles of India pursuant to
Executive Order 14329.  In my judgment, this modification is necessary
and appropriate to deal with the national emergency declared in
Executive Order 14066.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Tariff Modifications</span>. 
Effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn
from the warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern
standard time on February 7, 2026, products of India imported into the
United States shall no longer be subject to the additional *ad valorem*
rate of duty of 25 percent imposed pursuant to Executive Order 14329. 
Accordingly, effective 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on February 7,
2026, headings 9903.01.84 through 9903.01.89 and subdivision (z) of U.S.
Note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule
of the United States are hereby terminated.  To the extent that
implementation of this order requires a refund of duties collected,
refunds shall be processed pursuant to applicable law and the standard
procedures of U.S. Customs and Border Protection for such refunds.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Implementation</span>.  (a) 
The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the
Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security,
the United States Trade Representative, the Assistant to the President
for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for
Economic Policy, and the Assistant to the President and Senior Counselor
for Trade and Manufacturing, is hereby authorized to take such actions,
including adopting rules and regulations, and to employ all powers
granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to implement this
order.  The Secretary of State may, consistent with applicable law,
redelegate any of these functions within the Department of State.  Each
executive department and agency shall take all appropriate measures
within its authority to carry out this order.

(b)  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the United
States International Trade Commission, shall determine whether
modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States are
necessary to effectuate this order and may make such modifications
through notice in the *Federal Register*.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Monitoring and
Recommendations</span>.  The Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with
the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, and any other
senior official the Secretary of Commerce deems appropriate, shall
monitor whether India resumes directly or indirectly importing Russian
Federation oil, as defined in section 7 of Executive Order 14329.  If
the Secretary of Commerce finds that India has resumed directly or
indirectly importing Russian Federation oil, the Secretary of State, in
consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of
Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the United States Trade
Representative, the Assistant to the President for National Security
Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the
Assistant to the President and Senior Counselor for Trade
and Manufacturing, shall recommend whether and to what extent I should
take additional action as to India, including whether I should reimpose
the additional *ad valorem* rate of duty of 25 percent on imports of
articles of India.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.
 (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

\(i\)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or
agency, or the head thereof; or

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.
