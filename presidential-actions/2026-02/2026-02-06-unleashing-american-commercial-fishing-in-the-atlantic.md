A Proclamation

On September 15, 2016, pursuant to the Antiquities Act (54 U.S.C.
320301), President Obama issued Proclamation 9496 (Northeast Canyons and
Seamounts Marine National Monument), which designated approximately
4,913 square miles of waters and submerged lands where the Atlantic
Ocean meets the continental shelf as the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts
Marine National Monument.

On June 5, 2020, I issued Proclamation 10049 (Modifying the Northeast
Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument), to remove the
restrictions on commercial fishing within the Northeast Canyons and
Seamounts Marine National Monument.  In that proclamation, I noted that
many of the fish species that Proclamation 9496 identifies are highly
migratory and not unique to the monument.  I further noted that a host
of other laws enacted after the Antiquities Act provide specific
protection for other plant and animal resources both within and outside
the monument.

Subsequently, on October 8, 2021, President Biden issued Proclamation
10287 (Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument),
finding that commercial fishing activity has the potential to
significantly degrade the monument’s objects of historic and scientific
interest and reinstating the prohibitions on commercial fishing within
the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument.

As explained herein, following further consideration of the nature of
the objects identified in Proclamation 9496 and the protection of those
objects already provided by Federal law, I find that appropriately
managed commercial fishing would not put the objects of historic and
scientific interest that the monument protects at risk.

All of the fish species described in Proclamation 9496 are subject to
Federal protections under existing laws and executive department and
agency management designations.  For example, the Magnuson-Stevens
Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 *et seq.*)
(Magnuson-Stevens), regulates commercial fishing to ensure long-term
biological and economic sustainability for our Nation’s marine
fisheries, taking into account the protection of associated marine
ecosystems.  Magnuson-Stevens establishes regional fishery management
councils, supervised by the Secretary of Commerce in coordination with
the States and affected stakeholders, that develop fishery management
plans to regulate our Nation’s fisheries, using the best available
science and observing strict conservation and management requirements.
 Magnuson-Stevens requires a similar process of scientific fisheries
management for highly migratory species, including the tunas referenced
in Proclamation 9496.  In addition, Magnuson-Stevens provides that
fishery management plans may include, among other measures, management
measures to conserve target and non-target species and habitats,
including measures to protect deep-sea corals.  Moreover, many of the
fish species that Proclamation 9496 identifies are highly migratory and
not unique to the monument. 

A host of other laws enacted after the Antiquities Act provide specific
protection for other plant and animal resources (including coral
species) both within and outside the monument.  These laws include the
Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 *et seq.*), the Migratory Bird
Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703–712), the National Wildlife Refuge System
Administration Act (16 U.S.C. 668dd–668ee), the Refuge Recreation Act
(16 U.S.C. 460k *et seq.*), the Marine Mammal Protection Act (16 U.S.C.
1361 *et seq.*), the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 *et seq.*), the Oil
Pollution Act (33 U.S.C. 2701 *et seq.*), the National Marine
Sanctuaries Act (16 U.S.C. 1431 *et seq.*), and Title I of the Marine
Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act (33 U.S.C. 1401 *et seq.*)
(Ocean Dumping Act). For example, the Endangered Species Act generally
prohibits the taking of fish and wildlife species listed as endangered,
and also generally ensures that Federal actions, including fisheries
management, are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any
such species.  The Marine Mammal Protection Act provides protections for
marine mammals, and prohibits their taking, subject to some exceptions.
 Numerous other statutes, including the Clean Water Act, the Oil
Pollution Act, and the Ocean Dumping Act, address both land-based and
ocean-based sources of pollution and help ensure that water quality
continues to support plankton and other pelagic organisms.

After further consideration of the nature of the objects identified in
Proclamation 9496 and the protection of those objects already provided
by Magnuson-Stevens and other applicable legal authorities, I find, for
all the reasons previously stated in Proclamation 10049 and provided
herein, that a prohibition on commercial fishing is not, at this time,
necessary for the proper care and management of the Northeast Canyons
and Seamounts Marine National Monument or the objects of historic or
scientific interest therein.

WHEREAS, Proclamation 9496 designated the Northeast Canyons and
Seamounts Marine National Monument in the Atlantic Ocean and reserved
approximately 4,913 square miles of water and submerged lands in and
around certain deep-sea canyons and seamounts situated upon lands and
interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government as the
smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of objects
of historic and scientific interest;

WHEREAS, Proclamation 10049 modified the conditions of the Northeast
Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument to allow commercial
fishing activities;

WHEREAS, Proclamation 10287 modified the conditions of the Northeast
Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument to prohibit commercial
fishing activities;

WHEREAS, for the reasons set forth in Proclamation 10049 and provided
herein, I find that removing the restrictions on commercial fishing set
forth in Proclamation 9496 and Proclamation 10287 to allow for
well-regulated commercial fishing use, in accordance with and pursuant
to existing statutory authorities, is in the public interest and that
the objects in the monument can be, and are currently, protected
pursuant to carefully tailored regulation and management under existing
Federal law;

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws
of the United States, including section 320301 of title 54,
United States Code, hereby proclaim that Proclamation 10287 is revoked
and the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument shall
be managed in accordance with Proclamation 10049, which allows for
commercial fishing within the monument.

To the extent any provision of Proclamation 10049 is inconsistent with
Proclamation 9496, the terms of this proclamation and Proclamation 10049
shall govern.

If any provision of this proclamation, including its application to a
particular parcel of land, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this
proclamation and its application to other parcels of land shall not be
affected thereby.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this

sixth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-six,
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred
and fiftieth.

                               DONALD J. TRUMP
