title: Promoting the National Defense by Ensuring an Adequate Supply of Elemental
  Phosphorus and Glyphosate-Based Herbicides

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the Defense Production
Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. 4501 *et seq.*) (the “Act”), and
section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1.</span> 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy and Findings</span>. 
Elemental phosphorus is pervasive in defense supply chains and is
therefore crucial to military readiness and national defense.  It is a
key input in smoke, illumination, and incendiary devices and is a
critical component for manufacturing the semiconductors that are central
to numerous defense technologies, such as radar, solar cells, sensors,
and optoelectronics.  It is also increasingly important in modern
lithium-ion battery chemistries used in a multitude of weapon-system
supply chains.  For these and other reasons, on November 7, 2025, the
Department of the Interior, acting pursuant to the Energy Act of 2020,
designated phosphate as a critical mineral.

Elemental phosphorus is also a critical precursor element for the
production of glyphosate-based herbicides, which play a critical role in
maintaining America’s agricultural advantage by enabling farmers to
efficiently and cost-effectively produce food and livestock feed.  As
the most widely used crop protection tools in United States agriculture,
glyphosate-based herbicides are a cornerstone of this Nation’s
agricultural productivity and rural economy, allowing United States
farmers and ranchers to maintain high yields and low production costs
while ensuring that healthy, affordable food options remain within reach
for all American families.   

There is no direct one-for-one chemical alternative to glyphosate-based
herbicides.  Lack of access to glyphosate-based herbicides would
critically jeopardize agricultural productivity, adding pressure to the
domestic food system, and may result in a transition of cropland to
other uses due to low productivity.  Given the profit margins growers
currently face, any major restrictions in access to glyphosate-based
herbicides would result in economic losses for growers and make it
untenable for them to meet growing food and feed demands.

Ensuring an adequate supply of elemental phosphorus and glyphosate-based
herbicides is thus crucial to the national security and defense,
including food-supply security, which is essential to protecting the
health and safety of Americans.  Nonetheless, the United States’ ability
to domestically produce those critical inputs is extremely limited. 
Indeed, there is only a single domestic producer of elemental phosphorus
and glyphosate-based herbicides, and this producer does not meet our
annual needs for those inputs.  For that reason, more than 6,000,000
kilograms of elemental phosphorus are imported from other countries
annually.  Future reduction or the cessation of domestic production of
elemental phosphorus and glyphosate-based herbicides would gravely
threaten American national security by disrupting, and requiring the
further offshoring of, this Nation’s defense supply chain including by
having a debilitating impact on domestic agricultural capabilities.

I accordingly find that, consistent with the Department of the
Interior’s designation, elemental phosphorus is a scarce material that
is critical to national defense and security.  Our Nation’s inadequate
elemental phosphorus production, which must sustain both defense
manufacturing and our significant agricultural needs, and the threat of
increased domestic scarcity leave us vulnerable to hostile foreign
actors and pose an imminent threat to military readiness. 

Consistent with these findings, I find that ensuring robust domestic
elemental phosphorus mining and United States-based production of
glyphosate-based herbicides is central to American economic and national
security.  Without immediate Federal action, the United States remains
inadequately equipped and vulnerable.  Accordingly, I hereby find,
pursuant to section 101 of the Act, that domestic elemental phosphorus
and glyphosate-based herbicides meet the criteria specified in section
101(b) of the Act (50 U.S.C. 4511(b)).

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Ensuring an Adequate Supply of
Elemental Phosphorus and Glyphosate-Based Herbicides</span>.  (a) 
Notwithstanding Executive Order 13603 of March 16, 2012 (National
Defense Resources Preparedness), the authority of the President
conferred by section 101 of the Act to require performance of contracts
or orders (other than contracts of employment) to promote the national
defense over performance of any other contracts or orders, to allocate
materials, services, and facilities as deemed necessary or appropriate
to promote the national defense, and to implement the Act in subchapter
III of chapter 55 of title 50, United States Code (50 U.S.C. 4554, 4555,
4556, 4559, 4560), is delegated to the Secretary of Agriculture
(Secretary) with respect to ensuring a continued and adequate supply of
elemental phosphorus and glyphosate-based herbicides.

(b)  The Secretary shall use the authority under section 101 of the Act
(50 U.S.C. 4511), in consultation with the Secretary of War, to
determine the proper nationwide priorities and allocation of all the
materials, services, and facilities necessary to ensure a continued and
adequate supply of elemental phosphorus and glyphosate-based
herbicides. 

(c)  The Secretary shall issue such orders and adopt and revise
appropriate rules and regulations as may be necessary to implement this
order.

(d)  In exercising the authority delegated in this section, the
Secretary shall take into account the President’s judgment that domestic
production of elemental phosphorus and glyphosate-based herbicides is
critical to the national defense.  Accordingly, the Secretary shall
ensure that any order, rule, or regulation issued under this section
does not place the corporate viability of any domestic producer of
elemental phosphorus or glyphosate-based herbicides at risk. 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Immunity</span>.  This order
confers all immunity provided for in section 707 of the Act (50 U.S.C.
4557).  Additionally, domestic producers of elemental phosphorus and
glyphosate-based herbicides are required to comply with this order, in
accordance with the provisions of 7 C.F.R. part 789.

(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

\(i\)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or
agency, or the head thereof; or

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(d)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Department of Agriculture.
