BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

On National Angel Family Day, we remember and honor the thousands of
American lives stolen from us by criminal illegal aliens and the deadly
drugs they bring across our borders.  We stand with the Angel Families,
many of whom continue to be left without justice.  And we recommit to
carrying out the largest mass-deportation effort in our Nation’s
history, getting the worst of the worst out of our country, and putting
a stop to the violence targeting the brave men and women of law
enforcement.

Every year, thousands of American citizens are victimized by dangerous
and criminal illegal aliens, often sent here by their home countries to
get them out of their prisons or off their own streets.  After returning
to office, I received a letter from a New York City police officer that
filled the First Lady and me with tremendous sadness and anger.  He
wrote to the White House about one of the most unconscionable of these
derelictions in recent memory — the murder of Laken Riley.

In 2022, a Venezuelan man named Jose Ibarra was caught crossing the
Southern Border illegally and released into our country by the Biden
Administration.  A year later, this NYPD officer personally witnessed
Ibarra endanger a child on the streets of New York and arrested him. 
The officer was shocked to learn that, shortly thereafter, New York City
— a so-called “sanctuary” jurisdiction — released Ibarra back into the
community before Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) could issue a
detainer for his removal.  Ibarra then fled to Georgia and, just a few
months later, brutally murdered a beautiful young American named Laken
Riley.

Stories like this officer’s, whose diligence should have prevented
Laken’s murder, and heartbreaking losses suffered by countless other
Angel Families, strengthen my resolve to fix the illegal immigration
crisis with ferocious energy. 

The human cost of the migrant crime crisis is written in the lives of
Americans like Laken Riley, Jocelyn Nungaray, and Rachel Morin, who were
brutally attacked and murdered by savage illegal aliens, and in the
lives of Matthew Denice, Sarah Root, and Ivory Smith, killed by
drunk-driving illegal aliens.  Each of these lives and countless others
were stolen by criminal illegal aliens who should have never been in our
country.  Each of them was loved, full of promise, and taken far too
soon.  These losses also include the thousands of Americans who die each
year by fentanyl trafficked across the border by cartels and criminal
illegal aliens.  That is the most tragic part of this crisis — every
life taken, every child trafficked, every vehicular homicide, every
drug-related death, and every crime committed in this country by an
illegal alien is 100 percent preventable.

On the second anniversary of Laken Riley’s murder, we remember her
kindness and the promise of her young life.  While nothing can undo the
pain her family has suffered, I recommit to removing dangerous illegal
alien criminals from our Nation to prevent such senseless tragedies from
happening again.  As President, the first bill I signed into law was the
Laken Riley Act.  In Laken’s memory, this commonsense law mandates the
detention and deportation of illegal alien criminals and allows States
to sue the Federal Government when politicians fail to enforce
immigration laws.  In just the first 6 months of my term, I declared a
National Emergency at the Southern Border, reinstated the Remain in
Mexico policy, and deployed troops to the Southern Border to stop the
invasion of our country.  I also designated cartels as foreign terrorist
organizations, and by taking targeted strikes against these
narco-terrorists, we are halting the flow of deadly drugs that have
plagued our communities, stolen countless American lives, and shattered
families across our Nation.

Following the passage of the historic One Big Beautiful Bill in July, we
are now executing the strongest immigration overhaul in modern American
history.  This landmark legislation unleashes a massive surge in
Homeland Security, ICE, and Border Patrol personnel, authorizes the
construction of hundreds of miles of new border wall, and equips law
enforcement with the tools and resources they need to arrest and remove
dangerous illegal aliens from our streets and dismantle trafficking
networks.

The results are undeniable.  The first quarter of fiscal year 2026
recorded the lowest numbers of southwest border apprehensions ever. 
Nationwide encounters are down 92 percent from the monthly average under
the previous administration, and for the ninth consecutive month, there
have been zero releases along the southwest border — zero.  We have
achieved the safest and most secure border in American history.  But
there is still much work to do. 

We must end the violence against the brave men and women of ICE and
Border Patrol.  The demonization of these heroes by radical politicians
must stop, and the reckless sanctuary policies that shield criminal
aliens must end once and for all. 

I am also calling on the Congress to pass Kate’s Law — legislation that
imposes stronger penalties on individuals who illegally re-enter the
United States after being deported, especially those previously
convicted of crimes.  These actions are how we will stop these tragic
killings from happening time and time again.

A Nation without strong borders is not truly a Nation, and a people
without justice can never be fully free.  We renew our duty to uphold
the rule of law, secure our borders, and deliver accountability for
every American killed by illegal aliens and for every Angel Family
forced to carry the unimaginable loss.  We will never forget the
victims, we stand with the families who endure this permanent hole in
their lives, and we will never stop fighting to protect our people and
our homeland.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 22, 2026, as
National Angel Family Day.  I call on the American people to assemble in
their respective places of worship to pay homage to the victims killed
by illegal aliens and to those taken by the fentanyl epidemic, and lift
up the Angel Families and families devastated by drug overdoses. 
I further call upon public officials, community leaders, and all
citizens to end the violence and lawlessness that have claimed so many
innocent lives.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of
February, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-six, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
fiftieth.

                             DONALD J. TRUMP
