title: Establishing an America First Arms Transfer Strategy
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.
 American-manufactured military equipment is the best in the world,
resulting in American dominance across international defense exports.
 It is critical that the United States fully use this comparative
advantage in arms transfers as both a tool of foreign policy and a tool
to expand domestic production and transfer.

To maintain our military dominance and technological superiority, the
time has come to establish, implement, and execute an America First Arms
Transfer Strategy.  As the first strategy of its kind, it will ensure
that future arms sales prioritize American interests by using foreign
purchases and capital to build American production and capacity.  This
strategy will advance a technologically superior, ready, and resilient
national security industrial enterprise.  It will strengthen the United
States defense industrial base to ensure it has the capacity to support
our military and our allies and partners, especially as we increase
burden-sharing.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of the United States to intentionally use arms transfers as a
tool of American foreign policy and to expand strategically relevant
industrial production capacity in the United States by:

\(a\)  establishing an America First Arms Transfer Strategy that
provides clear direction and implementation guidance to arms transfer
stakeholders; and

\(b\)  streamlining processes across executive departments and agencies
(agencies) to strengthen effectiveness and create efficiencies in our
defense sales enterprise.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">An America First Arms Transfer
Strategy</span>.  (a)  An America First Arms Transfer Strategy shall
accomplish the following objectives:

(i)    The United States will use arms sales and transfers to increase
production and build production capacity for weapons and platforms the
Secretary of War determines to be the most operationally relevant for
executing the National Security Strategy (NSS);

\(ii\)   The United States will use foreign purchases and capital to
support domestic reindustrialization, expand production capacity, and
improve the resilience of the United States defense industrial base.
 Arms sales and transfers will support Department of War (DoW) efforts
to promote innovation and competition by incentivizing new entrants and
nontraditional defense companies to contribute to the defense industrial
base;

\(iii\)  The United States will use arms sales and transfers to
reinforce DoW acquisition and sustainment activities, including by
building critical supply chain resilience and avoiding adding to
backlogs on priority components and end-items that impact United States
or ally and partner readiness;

\(iv\)   Consistent with Executive Order 14268 of April 9, 2025
(Reforming Foreign Defense Sales to Improve Speed and Accountability)*,*
the United States will prioritize arms sales and transfers to partners
that have invested in their own self-defense and capabilities, have a
critical role or geography in United States plans and operations, or
contribute to our economic security.

\(b\)  Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of War,
in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of
Commerce, shall submit to the President, through the Assistant to the
President for National Security Affairs, a sales catalog of prioritized
platforms and systems that the United States shall encourage our allies
and partners to acquire.  The sales catalog shall be based on criteria
identified in the America First Arms Transfer Strategy.

\(c\)  Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of
Commerce, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Secretary
of War, shall provide recommendations to enhance advocacy efforts
encouraging foreign procurement of defense articles produced in America
for the purpose of supporting an America First Arms Transfer Strategy.

\(d\)  Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State
and the Secretary of War, in coordination with the Secretary of
Commerce, shall identify Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Direct
Commercial Sales opportunities that will support the strategic
objectives of the America First Arms Transfer Strategy and the growth of
the United States defense industrial base.

\(e\)  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State
and the Secretary of War, in coordination with the Secretary of
Commerce, shall develop an industry engagement plan and submit it to the
President, through the Assistant to the President for National Security
Affairs, to enable the United States Government to fully coordinate with
American stakeholders while executing the America First Arms Transfer
Strategy.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Eliminating Inefficiencies in
American Arms Transfers</span>.  In order to fully implement an America
First Arms Transfer Strategy and streamline our defense sales process,
the United States Government shall undertake the following actions:

\(i\)    Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of War,
in coordination with the Secretary of State, shall develop clear
criteria for determining which weapons, platforms, or capabilities
require Enhanced End Use Monitoring.  Additionally, the Secretary of
State, the Secretary of War, and the Secretary of Commerce shall
establish an End Use Monitoring coordination group, consisting of
designees from each respective department, which will meet to improve
the effectiveness and coordination of their respective department’s
end-use monitoring activities.  These actions will improve information
sharing and efficiencies to ensure allies and partners are complying
with United States requirements and to reduce risk of diversion.

\(ii\)   Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of
State, in coordination with the Secretary of War, shall review
Third-Party Transfer (TPT) processes and submit a plan to the President
through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs to
reduce and potentially realign the onerous TPT process, with due
consideration to technology security risks.

(iii)  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of War,
in coordination with the Secretary of State, shall develop a process to
provide advanced notice, as appropriate, to allies and partners of
upcoming contracting actions and associated deadlines for FMS Letter of
Offer and Acceptance implementation.

\(iv\)   The Secretary of State, the Secretary of War, and the Secretary
of Commerce shall ensure effective coordination when assessing the
impacts of Direct Commercial Sales to the defense industrial base.

\(v\)    To streamline Congressional notifications, Executive Order
13637 of March 8, 2013 (Administration of Reformed Export Controls) is
hereby amended by revising section 1(j) and (k) to read as follows:

“(j)  Those under sections 36(a) Act (22 U.S.C. 2776(a)) to the
Secretary of War.  The Secretary of War, in the implementation of the
delegated functions under sections 36(a), shall consult with the
Secretary of State.  With respect to those functions under sections
36(a)(5) and (6) (22 U.S.C. 2776(a)(5) and (6)), the Secretary of War
shall also consult with the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget.

\(k\)  Those under section 36(b)(1), (c) and (d) of the Act (22 U.S.C.
2776(b)(1), (c), and (d)) to the Secretary of State.  To ensure
coordination, the Secretary of State shall notify the Secretary of War
of the intent to formally notify the Congress of proposed arms
transfers.”

Secretary of State, the Secretary of War, and the Secretary of Commerce
shall establish the Promoting American Military Sales Task Force (Task
Force) to coordinate efforts to implement the America First Arms
Transfer Strategy and enhance accountability and transparency throughout
the arms transfer enterprise.  The Task Force shall:

\(i\)    be chaired by the Assistant to the President for National

for Arms Control and International Security, the Under Secretary of
Commerce for International Trade;

\(ii\)   develop a charter to clearly define the specific objectives and
structure of the Task Force;

(iii)  include as ex officio members the Service Acquisition Executives
of the military departments and representatives of other non-military

military departments and other implementing agencies to accelerate the
contracting of priority FMS cases and ensure exportability of identified
priority systems; and

\(iv\)   convene quarterly, or as required, to review progress
implementing the America First Arms Transfer Strategy, including whether
targeted defense sales align with the Strategy’s objectives.

\(b\)  Within 120 days of the date of this order, and to further the
reforms directed in Executive Order 14268, and to improve transparency
for United States industry and partners and allies, the Secretary of
State, the Secretary of War, and the Secretary of Commerce shall begin
to publish aggregate quarterly performance metrics on FMS case
development and execution, and on the adjudication of Commerce and State
export licenses.
