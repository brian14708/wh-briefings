title: Protecting the National Security and Welfare of the United States and its Citizens
  from Criminal Actors and Other Public Safety Threats
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including 6 U.S.C. 122(a)(2), it
is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of the United States to protect its welfare and security, and the
welfare and security of its citizens, from criminal actors.  Such
criminal actors may include foreign nationals with criminal histories
who have entered or remained in the United States in violation of the
immigration laws of the United States or who otherwise seek to violate
the criminal laws of the United States.  It is also the policy of the
United States to cooperate with trusted foreign governments by sharing
information concerning convicted felons on a reciprocal basis for border
security and immigration purposes.  The Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) is responsible for safeguarding the borders of the United States
by interdicting persons and goods illegally entering the United States;
protecting against the entry of dangerous goods, narcotics, and
firearms; and detecting, responding to, and interdicting terrorists,
drug smugglers, human smugglers, and other persons who seek to harm the
United States.  To fulfill these responsibilities, and consistent with
the policy described above, DHS immigration authorities must access
criminal history record information (CHRI) in the custody of Federal
criminal justice agencies to the maximum extent permitted by law.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Providing CHRI to DHS</span>. 
The Attorney General shall provide DHS with access, for purposes related
to DHS’s screening and vetting missions and to the maximum extent
permitted by law, to CHRI available to or maintained by the Department
of Justice. 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Exchanging Felony Conviction
Records with Visa Waiver Program and Other Countries for Border Security
and Immigration Purposes</span>.  (a)  The Secretary of Homeland
Security may exchange, to the maximum extent permitted by law, CHRI with
the border security and immigration authorities of Visa Waiver Program
(VWP) countries, countries that have entered into a Preventing and
Combating Serious Crime or similar agreement with the United States, and
other trusted allies, under an agreement or arrangement described in
subsection (b) of this section.  The Secretary of Homeland Security may
provide this information to these countries for the sole purpose of
screening travelers and immigrants seeking to enter or stay in the VWP
or other country.

\(b\)  Any exchange of CHRI by the Secretary of Homeland Security with
foreign countries shall be on the basis of reciprocity and under a
bilateral or multilateral agreement or arrangement entered into by DHS
that contains appropriate safeguards to protect the privacy of United
States persons and other individuals consistent with applicable law.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.
 (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

\(i\)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or
agency, or the head thereof; or

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

\(c\)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

\(d\)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Department of Homeland Security.
