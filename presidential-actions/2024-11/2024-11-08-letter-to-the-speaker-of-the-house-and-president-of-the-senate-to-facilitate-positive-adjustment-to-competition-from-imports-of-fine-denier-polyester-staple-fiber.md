Dear Mr. Speaker:   (Dear Madam President:)

In accordance with section 203(b) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended

the safeguard action that I have proclaimed on imports of fine denier
polyester staple fiber, pursuant to the authority vested in me by the
Constitution and the laws of the United States, including sections 201
and 203(a)(1) of the Act, and the reasons for taking these actions.

                              Sincerely,                              
JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
