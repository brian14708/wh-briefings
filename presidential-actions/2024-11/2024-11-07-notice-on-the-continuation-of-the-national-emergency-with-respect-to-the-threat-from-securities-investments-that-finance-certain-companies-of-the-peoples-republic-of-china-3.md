title: "Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Threat\
  \ From Securities Investments That Finance Certain Companies of the People\u2019\
  s Republic of\_China"

On November 12, 2020, by Executive Order 13959, the President declared a
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) to deal with the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and
economy of the United States constituted by the threat from securities
investments that finance certain companies of the People’s Republic of
China (PRC).

     The President found that the PRC is exploiting United States
capital to resource and enable the development and modernization of its
military, intelligence, and other security apparatuses, which continues
to allow the PRC to directly threaten the United States homeland and
United States forces overseas.  Through the national strategy of
Military‑Civil Fusion, the PRC increases the size of the country’s
military-industrial complex by compelling civilian Chinese companies to
support its military and intelligence activities.  Those companies,
though remaining ostensibly private and civilian, directly support the
PRC’s military, intelligence, and security apparatuses and aid in their
development and modernization.  At the same time, those companies raise
capital by selling securities to United States investors that trade on
public exchanges both here and abroad, lobbying United States index
providers and funds to include these securities in market offerings, and
engaging in other acts to ensure access to United States capital. 

     The President further found that the PRC’s military-industrial
complex, by directly supporting the efforts of the PRC’s military,
intelligence, and other security apparatuses, constituted an unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and
economy of the United States.

     On January 13, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 13974
amending Executive Order 13959.

     On June 3, 2021, I signed Executive Order 14032, which expanded the
scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13959. 
I found that additional steps are necessary to address that national
emergency, including the threat posed by the military-industrial complex
of the PRC and its involvement in military, intelligence, and security
research and development programs, and weapons and related equipment
production under the PRC’s Military-Civil Fusion strategy.  In addition,
I found that the use of Chinese surveillance technology outside the PRC
and the development or use of Chinese surveillance technology to
facilitate repression or serious human rights abuse constituted unusual
and extraordinary threats to the national security, foreign policy, and
economy of the United States, and I expanded the national emergency to
address these threats.  Executive Order 14032 amended Executive Order
13959 and revoked Executive Order 13974 in its entirety.

     The threat from securities investments that finance certain
companies of the PRC and certain uses and development of Chinese
surveillance technology continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary
threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the
United States.

     For this reason, the national emergency declared in Executive Order
13959 of November 12, 2020, expanded in scope by Executive Order 14032
of June 3, 2021, must continue in effect beyond November 12, 2024. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national
emergency declared in Executive Order 13959 with respect to the threat
from securities investments that finance certain companies of the PRC
and expanded in Executive Order 14032.

     This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and
transmitted to the Congress.  
  
                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.  

THE WHITE HOUSE,

    November 7, 2024.
