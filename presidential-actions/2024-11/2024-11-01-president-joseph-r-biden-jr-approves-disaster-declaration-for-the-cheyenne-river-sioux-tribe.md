title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Approves Disaster Declaration for the Cheyenne\
  \ River Sioux\_Tribe"
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists for the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and ordered federal aid to
supplement the Tribal Nation’s efforts in the areas affected by a severe
storm, straight-line winds, and flooding from July 13 to July 14, 2024.

The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe.

Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.

Federal funding is also available to the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and
certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for
emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by
the severe storm, straight-line winds, and flooding.

Lastly, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures for the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe.

Mr. Edwin J. Martin of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas. 

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
Tribal Nation and warranted by the results of further damage
assessments.

Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance at
