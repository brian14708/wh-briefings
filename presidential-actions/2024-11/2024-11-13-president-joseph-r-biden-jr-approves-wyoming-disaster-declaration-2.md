Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Wyoming and ordered Federal assistance to
supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas
affected by wildfires from August 21 to August 31, 2024.

Federal funding is available to state, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the wildfires in the counties of Campbell and
Johnson.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Mr. Dolph A. Diemont of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas. 

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
