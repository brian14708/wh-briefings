title: "A Proclamation on National Impaired Driving Prevention Month,\_2024"
---
 
     Too many families know the pain of losing a loved one to a drunk or
drug-impaired driving accident.  Each year, more than 10,000 Americans
lose their lives in these preventable tragedies.  During National
Impaired Driving Prevention Month, we remind everyone that they can save
lives by driving only when sober, calling for a ride, planning ahead,
and making sure friends and loved ones do the same.  
     In 2022, over 13,000 people were killed in drunk-driving accidents.
 Still, millions of people drive under the influence each year, not only
putting themselves in harm’s way but also endangering passengers,
pedestrians, and first responders. Even just one drink or one pill can
ruin lives.  
      My Administration is committed to preventing accidents and
impaired driving.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
has raised awareness about its risks and consequences through media
campaigns, including “If You Feel Different, You Drive Different”;
“Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over”; and “Buzzed Driving is Drunk Driving.”
 Furthermore, since the beginning of my Administration, we have
dedicated over $100 billion to disrupt the flow of illicit drugs and
expand access to the prevention and treatment of substance use
disorder.   
     Reducing fatalities and injuries in impaired driving accidents also
means improving the safety of our Nation’s vehicles.  That is why my
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests in technologies that can detect
and prevent impaired driving and requiring new passenger cars to include
collision warnings and automatic braking to prevent accidents.  The
Department of Transportation also released a National Roadway Safety
Strategy to eliminate traffic deaths and make crashes less destructive.
   
     This holiday season, let us recommit to doing right by our
neighbors, friends, and families by driving sober.  For those planning
on drinking, arrange a sober ride home beforehand — ride-sharing apps
are a convenient way to get home safely.  If you have had alcohol or
used substances, do not get behind the wheel — one accident can cost
someone their life.  If you are responsible for driving yourself or
others, stay sober, buckle up, put the phone away, and drive the speed
limit.  And if you witness a friend, loved one, colleague, or anyone
putting themselves or others in danger, lend a hand to keep them safe.
You could save a life.  
     NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United
States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the
Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim
December 2024 as National Impaired Driving Prevention Month.  I urge all
Americans to make responsible decisions and take appropriate measures to
prevent impaired driving.  
    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth
day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-ninth.

                        JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
