     This Thanksgiving, as families, friends, and loved ones gather in
gratitude, may we all celebrate the many blessings of our great
Nation.  
     Thanksgiving is at the heart of America’s spirit of gratitude — of
finding light in times of both joy and strife.  The Pilgrims celebrated
the first Thanksgiving to honor a successful harvest, made possible by
the generosity and kindness of the Wampanoag people.  On the way to
Valley Forge, as General George Washington and his troops continued the
fierce struggle for our Nation’s independence, they found a moment for
Thanksgiving.  And amid the fight to preserve our Union during the Civil
War, President Abraham Lincoln established Thanksgiving as a national
holiday, finding gratitude in the courage of the American people who
sacrifice so much for our country.  
     We are a good Nation because we are a good people.  The First Lady
and I remain inspired by the everyday Americans who lift this country up
and push us forward.  Today, so many are among their family and friends,
celebrating the love that binds them and creating new traditions that
will carry on for generations.  To anyone with an empty seat at the
dinner table, grieving the loss of a loved one, the First Lady and I
hold you in our hearts and prayers.  
     America is a Nation of promise and possibilities — and that is
because, every day, ordinary Americans are doing extraordinary things.
 Our service members and veterans have given all, risked all, and dared
all to keep our Nation free.  Our first responders, firefighters, and
police officers risk their lives every day to keep the rest of us safe.
 I can see the best of America in them and in our workers and union
leaders, public servants and teachers, doctors and scientists, and all
who give their heart and soul to ensuring people are treated with
dignity and respect.  And I find hope in our Nation’s families, who
sacrifice so much to achieve the American Dream and build a future
worthy of our highest aspirations.  
     This Thanksgiving — the last one I will declare as President — I
express my gratitude to the American people.  Serving as President has
been the honor of a lifetime.  America is the greatest country on Earth,
and there is so much to be grateful for.  May we celebrate all that
unites us — because there is nothing beyond our capacity if we do it
together.  
     NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United
States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the
Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim
Thursday, November 28, 2024, as a National Day of Thanksgiving.  I
encourage the people of the United States of America to join together
and give thanks for the friends, neighbors, family members, and
communities who have supported each other over the past year in a
reflection of goodwill and unity.  
    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh
day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-ninth.

                        JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
