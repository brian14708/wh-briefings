title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Approves Disaster Declaration for the Crow\
  \ Tribe of\_Montana"
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists for the Crow Tribe of Montana and ordered federal aid to
supplement the Tribal Nation’s efforts in the areas affected by a severe
storm and straight-line winds on August 6, 2024. 

The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals on the Crow Tribe of Montana.

Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures for the Crow Tribe of Montana.

Mr. James R. Stephenson of the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in
the affected areas. 

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
Tribal Nation and warranted by the results of further damage
assessments.

Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance at
[www.DisasterAssistance.gov](/SHARE/FORMATS/DHS%200303/Expedited%20Requests%2003.02.21/www.DisasterAssistance.gov),
by calling 800-621-FEMA (3362), or by using the [FEMA
App](https://www.ready.gov/fema-app). Anyone using a relay service, such
as video relay service (VRS), captioned telephone service or others, can
give FEMA the number for that service.
