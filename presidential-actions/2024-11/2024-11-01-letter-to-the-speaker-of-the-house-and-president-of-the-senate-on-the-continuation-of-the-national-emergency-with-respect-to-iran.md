Dear Mr. Speaker:   (Dear Madam President:)

Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to Iran that was
declared in Executive Order 12170 of November 14, 1979, is to continue
in effect beyond November 14, 2024.

Our relations with Iran have not yet normalized, and the process of
implementing the agreements with Iran, dated January 19, 1981, is
ongoing.  Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12170 with respect to
Iran.

                               Sincerely,

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
