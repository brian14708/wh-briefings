MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE

THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY

THE SECRETARY OF ENERGY

SUBJECT:       Presidential Determination Pursuant to Section
1245(d)(4)(B) and (C) of the National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2012

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States, after carefully considering the reports
submitted to the Congress by the Energy Information Administration,
including the report submitted in October 2024, and other relevant
factors, including global economic conditions, the level of spare
capacity, and the availability of strategic reserves, I determine,
pursuant to section 1245(d)(4)(B) and (C) of the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, Public Law 112-81, and
consistent with prior determinations, that there is a sufficient supply
of petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran to
permit a significant reduction in the volume of petroleum and petroleum
products purchased from Iran by or through foreign financial
institutions.

I will continue to monitor this situation closely.

The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this
determination in the *Federal Register*.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
