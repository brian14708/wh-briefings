title: "A Proclamation on America Recycles Day,\_2024"
---
 
       On America Recycles Day, we recognize the important role
recycling plays in helping secure a more sustainable and prosperous
future for generations to come.  We show our gratitude for all the
people who work hard to make sure we limit our waste and responsibly
steward our national resources.  And we recommit to building a Nation
where we address the existential risk of climate change and where
everyone can enjoy the benefits of a greener world.  
     Producing and processing the materials we use every day cause more
than a third of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to
the threat of climate change.  The health and well-being of too many
people suffer due to the damaging effects of pollution and the toxins
released when waste is landfilled, dumped, or incinerated.  That is why
it is so important to reduce waste and recycle.  When we reduce waste,
we conserve the energy and natural resources needed to make these
materials.  And when we recycle, we give these materials another life —
reducing the need for more production.  But recycling is still too
difficult.  Too many Americans are unsure of where and which materials
can be recycled.  And when materials do end up in recycling,
municipalities struggle to find markets for them.    
     To make recycling easier and more efficient, my Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law made the largest investment in recycling in nearly
three decades.  It has launched hundreds of new projects that are
helping to support manufacturing, improve waste management, advance
environmental justice, and educate people about recycling.  My
Administration also released the first comprehensive, Government-wide
strategy to limit the harms of plastic pollution at production,
processing, use, and disposal, and we announced a goal to end the use of
single-use plastics in the Federal Government by 2035.  We also crafted
the first-ever National Strategy for Reducing Food Loss and Waste and
Recycling Organics to coordinate agencies in recycling organic materials
like food waste while cutting costs for families.  At the same time, we
have been pursuing the initiatives outlined in our National Recycling
Strategy to improve our recycling and waste management systems, working
to find ways to better collect recyclable products, reach markets for
these materials, and develop new technologies that will protect public
health and the environment.  All this contributes to my Administration’s
ambitious work to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 — to
that end, my Inflation Reduction Act made the largest investment in
climate action in history.  
     We have made important progress toward building an economy that
values recycling, but there is still more to do.  Each of us can play a
role in protecting our natural environment and addressing the
existential risk of climate change by recycling — remember to dispose of
waste in the proper bins whenever possible, reuse containers, compost
food, and use products made with recycled materials.  I call on
manufacturers and corporations to ensure their products and materials
are reusable and recyclable when possible and limit the use of
non-recyclable packaging.  On America Recycles Day, may we recommit to
building a better, healthier future through recycling.  
     NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United
States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the
Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim
November 15, 2024, as America Recycles Day.  I call upon the people of
the United States of America to observe this day with appropriate
programs and activities, and I encourage all Americans to continue their
environmental efforts by recycling throughout the year.  
    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day
of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-ninth.

                        JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
