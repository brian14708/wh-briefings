Presidential Determination

No.        2024-10         

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE  
THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

SUBJECT:       Continuation of U.S. Drug Interdiction Assistance to the
Government of Colombia

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States, and pursuant to the authority vested in me by
section 1012 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
1995, as amended (22 U.S.C. 2291-4), I hereby certify, with respect to
Colombia, that:  (1) interdiction of aircraft reasonably suspected to be
primarily engaged in illicit drug trafficking in that country’s airspace
is necessary, because of the extraordinary threat posed by illicit drug
trafficking to the national security of that country; and (2) Colombia
has appropriate procedures in place to protect against innocent loss of
life in the air and on the ground in connection with such interdiction,
which includes effective means to identify and warn an aircraft before
the use of force is directed against the aircraft.

The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this
determination in the *Federal Register* and to notify the Congress of
this determination.

                              JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
