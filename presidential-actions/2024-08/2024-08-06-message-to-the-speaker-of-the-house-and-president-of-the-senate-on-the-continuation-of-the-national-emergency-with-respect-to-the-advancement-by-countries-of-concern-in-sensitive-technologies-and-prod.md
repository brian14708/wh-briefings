Dear Mr. Speaker:   (Dear Madam President:)

Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to the threat posed by
the advancement by countries of concern in sensitive technologies and
products critical for the military, intelligence, surveillance, or
cyber-enabled capabilities of such countries declared in Executive Order
14105 of August 9, 2023, is to continue in effect beyond August 9, 2024.

Certain ongoing activities, such as the comprehensive, long-term
strategies of countries of concern that direct, facilitate, or otherwise
support advancements in sensitive technologies and products that are
critical to such countries’ military, intelligence, surveillance, or
cyber-enabled capabilities, significantly enhance such countries’
ability to conduct activities that threaten the national security of the
United States.  As part of this ongoing strategy of advancing the
development of these sensitive technologies and products, countries of
concern are exploiting or have the ability to exploit certain United
States outbound investments, including certain intangible benefits that
often accompany United States investments and that help companies
succeed.  Such investments risk exacerbating this threat to United
States national security.

Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 14105 with respect to the
threat posed by the advancement by countries of concern in sensitive
technologies and products critical for the military, intelligence,
surveillance, or cyber-enabled capabilities of such countries.

                             Sincerely,

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
