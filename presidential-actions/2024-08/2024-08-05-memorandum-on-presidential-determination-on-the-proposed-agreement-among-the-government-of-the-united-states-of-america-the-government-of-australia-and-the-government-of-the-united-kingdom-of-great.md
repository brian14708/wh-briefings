Presidential Determination  
No.        2024-09        

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE  
              THE SECRETARY OF ENERGY  
  
SUBJECT:       Presidential Determination on the Proposed  
              Agreement Among the Government of the  
              United States of America, the Government of  
              Australia, and the Government of the United  
              Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland  
              for Cooperation Related to Naval Nuclear  
              Propulsion

I have reviewed and concur with the positions taken in your joint
memorandum of June 28, 2024, recommending approval of a proposed
Agreement Among the Government of the United States of America, the
Government of Australia, and the Government of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation Related to Naval
Nuclear Propulsion (the “proposed Agreement”).  I note your joint
recommendation and concur with your assessment that Australia and the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, by participating
with the United States pursuant to international arrangements, are
making substantial and material contributions to our mutual defense and
security.  The proposed Agreement will permit cooperation that will
further improve our mutual defense posture and support our interests
under the Australia, New Zealand, and United States Security Treaty and
the North Atlantic Treaty.  The proposed Agreement is essential to
enabling our cooperation under the enhanced trilateral security
partnership among the three Parties, known as “AUKUS.”  I hereby:

-   approve the proposed Agreement;  
-   determine that the performance of the proposed Agreement will
    promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common
    defense and security;  
-   approve the program outlined in the proposed Agreement and determine
    that such program will promote, and will not constitute an
    unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security; and  
-   authorize the execution of the proposed Agreement by the Government
    of the United States of America in a manner specified by the
    Secretary of State.

                          JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
