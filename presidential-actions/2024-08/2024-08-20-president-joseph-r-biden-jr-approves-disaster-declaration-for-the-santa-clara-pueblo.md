Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists for the Santa Clara Pueblo and ordered federal aid to supplement
the Tribal Nation’s efforts in the areas affected by severe storms and
flooding from June 20 to June 21, 2024.

Federal funding is available to the Santa Clara Pueblo and certain
private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency
work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe
storms and flooding.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures for the Santa Clara Pueblo.

Mr. James B. McPherson of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas. 

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
Tribal Nation and warranted by the results of further damage
assessments.
