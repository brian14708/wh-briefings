title: "A Proclamation on the Establishment of the Springfield 1908 Race Riot National\_\
  Monument"
---
 
        In August 1908, mere blocks from the former home of President
Abraham Lincoln, a white mob attacked the Black community in
Springfield, Illinois, lynching two Black Americans and burning homes
down to their foundations.  By the time the National Guard quelled the
violence, the mob had looted and destroyed businesses, razed city
blocks, and displaced hundreds of people from their homes.  Labeled by
the media as a race riot, the event was emblematic of the racism,
intimidation, violence, and lynchings that Black Americans experienced
in communities across the country in the late 19th and early 20th
Centuries.  The horror that became known as the Springfield 1908 Race
Riot drew the attention of national newspapers and Black and white
activists interested in social change.  In the wake of the devastation
and ensuing outcry, a group of visionary civic leaders launched the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which went
on to achieve momentous civil rights victories and continues to work
toward racial justice and equity.    
     Today, the foundations of destroyed homes and the objects they
contain are tangible markers of these historic events and reminders of
the impact that the Springfield 1908 Race Riot had on our Nation.  The
area located between North 9th and 11th Streets, and between East Mason
and East Madison Streets, constitutes the Springfield 1908 Race Riot
Site.  This site weaves together two important threads in our Nation’s
story:  the hateful violence targeted against Black Americans, and the
power of dedicated individuals to come together across racial lines to
transform shock and grief into hope and action.   
At the turn of the 20th Century, the United States was still struggling
to fulfill the promises of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth
Amendments to the Constitution — amendments that abolished slavery;
guaranteed due process and equal protection under the law; and
prohibited abridgement of the right to vote on account of race, color,
or previous condition of servitude.  Numerous States and municipalities,
primarily in the South, passed anti-Black legislation, including Jim
Crow laws, to enforce racial segregation and to maintain white
structural power by restricting Black people’s daily lives.  As millions
of Black people migrated to towns and cities in the North seeking a
better life, they were often confronted with racial bias, segregated
schools, discriminatory and restrictive housing practices, and other
forms of discrimination.  Black people were also subjected to a
nationwide wave of racial violence that began after the Civil War.
 Between 1882 and 1910, there were 2,503 recorded lynchings of Black
people in the United States.  Many lynchings during this grim chapter of
American history occurred during riots led by white mobs engaged in a
broader pattern of violence, similar to the one that took place in
Springfield.   
     There, on Friday, August 14, 1908, a crowd of mostly white men
gathered outside the Sangamon County Jail, which was 2 blocks from the
edge of the Badlands neighborhood, a community northeast of the center
of the city that included many low-income Black residents and families.
 The mob was calling for the lynching of two Black men:  Joe James and
George Richardson.  James stood accused of the murder of a white man and
attempted assault on his daughter.  Richardson was accused of sexually
assaulting a white woman.  
     The sheriff, hoping to defuse the situation and avoid the white-mob
lynchings that had occurred in similar circumstances, arranged for the
two men to be quietly transferred to a jail in another town.  Harry
Loper, a local white leader who shared the sheriff’s concerns, agreed to
help with the transfer.  When the crowd learned of the sheriff’s and
Loper’s actions, it erupted in violence.  The mob wreaked havoc and
destruction in the surrounding Badlands and Levee neighborhoods —
attacking and destroying dozens of Black-owned businesses and
residences, as well as some Jewish-owned businesses and other businesses
that served the predominantly Black community.  Loper also paid a price
for helping the men; after he returned, the mob set fire to his car and
vandalized his restaurant.   
     One of the buildings the mob torched was in the Badlands
neighborhood on 12th Street between Madison and Mason Streets where
Scott Burton, a Black barber, was trying to protect his home.  At
approximately 2:30 a.m. on Saturday, August 15, 1908, the mob beat
Burton into unconsciousness before dragging him half a block south to
the corner of Madison and 12th Streets.  There, he was further
brutalized and hanged from a tree, and he died from his injuries.  All
the while, the rioters celebrated his lynching.    
     On Saturday, the second day of the riot, the violence briefly
abated as State militia reinforcements arrived and Governor Charles
Deneen designated the Illinois State Arsenal as a temporary refuge for
Black residents.  Black firefighters of Firehouse No. 5 responded to
fires and fought to quench the flames and save the homes of Black
residents and Black-owned businesses, even after being dismissed by the
Mayor of Springfield.  Despite these actions, by 7:00 p.m. Saturday
evening, crowds again amassed and resumed the mob violence of the
previous night.  
     That same day, the riot reached the home of William K. Donnegan, a
Black 84-year-old retired cobbler who had made shoes for Abraham Lincoln
and served as an Underground Railroad operative.  Donnegan was married
to a white woman and lived with his family in a nearby middle-class
white neighborhood.  On Saturday night, a group of white men gathered
outside of Donnegan’s house, beat him with bricks, and cut his throat
with a razor.  They dragged him across the street and hanged him from a
tree in the neighboring schoolyard, just 2 blocks from the Illinois
State Capitol.  The police and National Guard personnel found Donnegan
still alive, and took him to St. John’s Hospital, where he received
medical care along with other people injured in the riot — Black and
white alike.  Although he survived the night, he died the next day from
his injuries.   
     Soon after the riot, George Richardson’s accuser issued a signed
statement confessing that her assailant had in fact been a white man.
 Joe James’s story took a different turn.  His lawyer tried to remove
James’s case from Sangamon County, arguing he would not be able to get
an impartial jury there, but those efforts failed and James was tried
and convicted in the same community that carried out the race riot.  On
October 23, 1908, James was executed by hanging at the Sangamon County
Jail.  Only one white rioter was convicted of a violent crime in
connection with the destruction wrought on Springfield’s Black
community.  In a poignant postscript, the two men lynched, Scott Burton
and William K. Donnegan, were laid to rest in the same Springfield
cemetery as President Lincoln.      
     The national and local press covered the Springfield 1908 Race Riot
extensively.  The devastation of the Badlands neighborhood and nearby
sites captured the attention of prominent civil rights leaders and
spurred new action.  In response to the Springfield 1908 Race Riot, an
interracial group of dozens of civil rights leaders, including W.E.B. Du
Bois, William English Walling, Mary White Ovington, Ida B.
Wells-Barnett, and Mary Church Terrell, issued an open letter in
February 1909 “taking stock of the nation’s progress” on the centennial
of Lincoln’s birth.  Invoking Lincoln’s words from 1858 that “\[a\]
house divided against itself cannot stand,” the group “call\[ed\] upon
all the believers in democracy to join in a national conference for the
discussion of present evils, the voicing of protests, and the renewal of
the struggle for civil and political liberty.”   
     This call led to a meeting in the spring of 1909 of a group
initially called the National Negro Committee to discuss forming a
permanent, national organization that would advocate to combat lynching
and racial prejudice, improve the lives of Black Americans, and secure
the civil and political rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution.
 On May 12, 1910, the National Negro Committee formally named the new
organization the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People (NAACP).   
     For more than a century, the NAACP has been at the forefront of key
legal and political movements to end lynching, remove barriers of racial
discrimination, and advance civil and political rights.  The NAACP and
its legal team devised the transformative, decades-long legal strategy
culminating in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), in which the Supreme
Court declared the “separate but equal” doctrine to be unconstitutional
and gutted the legal underpinnings of segregation and Jim Crow laws.    
     The NAACP, along with partners and allies, turned the Springfield
1908 Race Riot’s legacy from one of tragedy alone into one that led to
enduring progress and change.  Yet those violent and fateful days had
persistent discriminatory effects on Springfield.  Although the rioters
did not succeed in driving Black residents from the city entirely, their
actions led to the displacement of Black people from the Badlands and
other affected neighborhoods and paved the way for so-called “urban
renewal projects” that erased much of the neighborhoods’ physical
imprint.  One of the country’s first public housing projects was
constructed on remnants of the Badlands neighborhood.  The 8-block John
Hay Homes housing complex, built in the 1940s, provided low-income
housing, primarily to white people.  The John Hay Homes and other
projects drastically altered the landscape, demolishing blocks of
structures to develop facilities including high-rise apartments,
low-rent apartments, an expressway, and a civic center.   
     Notwithstanding the changes to the surrounding neighborhoods, the
Springfield 1908 Race Riot Site, a 2-block area stretching northward
from East Madison Street between North 9th and 11th Streets, still
contains archeological remains and scars of the riot.  The site, which
has been identified as the approximate point where the violent assault
on the Badlands neighborhood began in 1908, provides some of the last
physical remains of the race riot and the neighborhood it destroyed,
including the charred foundations of five houses burned by the white mob
in 1908.    
     Archeological excavations of the site have uncovered other historic
objects remaining at the site, including a partial cellar, stone steps,
and a brick walk.  This area and the archeological artifacts it contains
have a singular ability to tell the story of the race riot and its
impacts on Black residents at this pivotal point in Springfield and the
Nation’s history.    
     Archeological studies have concluded that the site likely contains
significant additional resources and artifacts that could help further
illuminate the history of the Badlands neighborhood.  In addition to the
five burned houses, the site encompasses the plots of several other
buildings demolished in the riot.  Spared the architectural erasure of
urban renewal, the Springfield 1908 Race Riot Site can help bring
greater attention to this chapter in American history.  The National
Park Service has recognized the historical significance of this site to
civil rights history by adding it to the African American Civil Rights
Network.  
Preservation of the Springfield 1908 Race Riot Site will protect the
objects of historic interest found therein from removal, development, or
other activities that could erase their presence in the area.  It will
also ensure that the site and its objects remain available for future
generations to learn about the Springfield 1908 Race Riot and how this
brutal event near President Lincoln’s home underscored the pattern of
racially motivated violence perpetrated on Black people throughout the
country and catalyzed the formation of the NAACP.  Ida B. Wells-Barnett,
one of the co-founders of the NAACP and a national hero who led the
campaign against lynching, described the Springfield 1908 Race Riot as
showing that “the hue and cry once started stops at no bounds.”
 Protecting the Springfield 1908 Race Riot Site is essential to preserve
and narrate the history that galvanized civil rights leaders to
establish an institution to work for real and lasting change, creating
hope for our democracy out of the embers of this neighborhood in
Springfield, Illinois.   
     WHEREAS, section 320301 of title 54, United States Code (the
