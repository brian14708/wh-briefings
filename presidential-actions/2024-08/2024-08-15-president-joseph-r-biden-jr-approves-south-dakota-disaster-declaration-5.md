---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of South Dakota and ordered Federal aid to
supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas
affected by severe storms, straight-line winds, and flooding from June
16 to July 8, 2024.

The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in the counties of Davison, Lincoln, Turner, and Union.

Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.

Federal funding is also available to state, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the severe storms, straight-line winds, and
flooding in the counties of Aurora, Bennett, Bon Homme, Brule, Buffalo,
Charles Mix, Clay, Davison, Douglas, Gregory, Hand, Hanson, Hutchinson,
Jackson, Lake, Lincoln, McCook, Miner, Minnehaha, Moody, Sanborn, Tripp,
Turner, Union, and Yankton.

Lastly, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Mr. Edwin J. Martin of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas.

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.

Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance at
