Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Kansas and ordered Federal assistance to
supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas
affected by a severe storm, straight-line winds, tornadoes, and flooding
on May 19, 2024.

Federal funding is available to state, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the severe storm, straight-line winds, tornadoes,
and flooding in the counties of Barton, Ellsworth, Harvey, Hodgeman,
Lincoln, Morris, Ottawa, Pawnee, Reno, Rush, Russell, Stafford,
Wabaunsee, and Wyandotte.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Mr. Andrew P. Meyer of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas. 

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
