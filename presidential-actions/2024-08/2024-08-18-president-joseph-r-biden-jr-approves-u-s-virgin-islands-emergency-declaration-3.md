title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Approves U.S. Virgin Islands Emergency\_Declaration"
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that an emergency exists
in the territory of the U.S. Virgin Islands and ordered Federal
assistance to supplement territory and local response efforts due to the
emergency conditions resulting from Tropical Storm Ernesto beginning on
August 13, 2024, and continuing. 

The President’s action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security,
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate all disaster
relief efforts which have the purpose of alleviating the hardship and
suffering caused by the emergency on the local population, and to
provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures,
authorized under Title V of the Stafford Act, to save lives and to
protect property and public health and safety, and to lessen or avert
the threat of a catastrophe on the islands of St. Croix, St. John, St.
Thomas, and Water Island.

Specifically, FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize, and provide at
its discretion, equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the
impacts of the emergency.  Emergency protective measures (Category B),
limited to direct Federal assistance, will be provided at 75 percent
Federal funding.

Ms. Lai Sun Yee of FEMA has been appointed to coordinate Federal
recovery operations in the affected areas.
