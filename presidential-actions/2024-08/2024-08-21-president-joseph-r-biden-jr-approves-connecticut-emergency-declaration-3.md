suffering caused by the emergency on the local population, and to

protect property and public health and safety, and to lessen or avert
the threat of a catastrophe.  
  
Public Assistance (Category B) emergency protective measures, limited to
direct Federal assistance will be provided at 75 percent Federal funding
