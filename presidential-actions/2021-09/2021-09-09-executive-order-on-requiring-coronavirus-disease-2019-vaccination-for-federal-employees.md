By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including sections 3301, 3302, and
7301 of title 5, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:

Section 1.  Policy.  It is the policy of my Administration to halt the
spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), including the B.1.617.2
(Delta) variant, by relying on the best available data and science-based
public health measures.  The Delta variant, currently the predominant
variant of the virus in the United States, is highly contagious and has
led to a rapid rise in cases and hospitalizations.  The nationwide
public health emergency, first declared by the Secretary of Health and
Human Services on January 31, 2020, remains in effect, as does the
National Emergency Concerning the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
declared pursuant to the National Emergencies Act in Proclamation 9994
of March 13, 2020 (Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel
Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak).  The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) within the Department of Health and Human
Services has determined that the best way to slow the spread of COVID-19
and to prevent infection by the Delta variant or other variants is to be
vaccinated.

COVID-19 vaccines are widely available in the United States.  They
protect people from getting infected and severely ill, and they
significantly reduce the likelihood of hospitalization and death.  As of
the date of this order, one of the COVID-19 vaccines, the
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, also known as Comirnaty, has received
approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and two others,
the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine and the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine, have been
authorized by the FDA for emergency use.  The FDA has determined that
all three vaccines meet its rigorous standards for safety,
effectiveness, and manufacturing quality.

The health and safety of the Federal workforce, and the health and
safety of members of the public with whom they interact, are
foundational to the efficiency of the civil service.  I have determined
that ensuring the health and safety of the Federal workforce and the
efficiency of the civil service requires immediate action to protect the
Federal workforce and individuals interacting with the Federal
workforce.  It is essential that Federal employees take all available
steps to protect themselves and avoid spreading COVID-19 to their
co-workers and members of the public.  The CDC has found that the best
way to do so is to be vaccinated.

The Safer Federal Workforce Task Force (Task Force), established by
Executive Order 13991 of January 20, 2021 (Protecting the Federal
Workforce and Requiring Mask-Wearing), has issued important guidance to
protect the Federal workforce and individuals interacting with the
Federal workforce.  Agencies have also taken important actions,
including in some cases requiring COVID-19 vaccination for members of
their workforce.  

Accordingly, building on these actions, and in light of the public
health guidance regarding the most effective and necessary defenses
against COVID-19, I have determined that to promote the health and
safety of the Federal workforce and the efficiency of the civil service,
it is necessary to require COVID-19 vaccination for all Federal
employees, subject to such exceptions as required by law.

Sec. 2.  Mandatory Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccination for Federal
Employees.  Each agency shall implement, to the extent consistent with
applicable law, a program to require COVID-19 vaccination for all of its
Federal employees, with exceptions only as required by law.  The Task
Force shall issue guidance within 7 days of the date of this order on
agency implementation of this requirement for all agencies covered by
this order.

Sec. 3.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this order:  
     (a)  The term “agency” means an Executive agency as defined in 5
U.S.C. 105 (excluding the Government Accountability Office).   
     (b)  The term “employee” means an employee as defined in 5 U.S.C.
2105 (including an employee paid from nonappropriated funds as
referenced in 5 U.S.C. 2105(c)). 

Sec. 4.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be
construed to impair or otherwise affect:(i)   the authority granted by
law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or  
          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office
of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.  
     (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.  
     (d)  If any provision of this order, or the application of any
provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the
remainder of this order and the application of any of its other
provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected
thereby.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
September 9, 2021.
