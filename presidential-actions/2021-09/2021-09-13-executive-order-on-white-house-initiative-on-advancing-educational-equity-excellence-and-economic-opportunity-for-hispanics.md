title: "Executive Order on White\_House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity,\
  \ Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for\_Hispanics"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as
follows:   
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 1.  Policy.
</span> Nearly 14 million students in our Nation’s public elementary and
secondary school system and nearly 4 million students in post-secondary
education are Hispanic.  Hispanic students constitute more than 27
percent of all pre-kindergarten through 12th grade students and nearly
20 percent of college students.  The Nation’s future prosperity
and global leadership across industries is therefore tied to the success
of Hispanic and Latino students, and their success is a priority of my
Administration.  
  
From advancements in science and civil and labor rights to leadership in
government, advocacy, entrepreneurship, and business, the Hispanic
community has had a profound and positive impact on our schools, our
communities, our economy, and our Nation. Hispanic and Latino
communities encompass many racial and cultural identities that span the
globe. The diversity of Hispanic and Latino students makes our
classrooms across the country rich learning environments. It is
important to ensure that from early childhood to higher education,
Hispanic and Latino students, including Dreamers, can reach their
highest potential. For many Hispanic and Latino students,
Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) provide critical pathways to
opportunity, and hundreds of HSIs across our Nation are advancing
intergenerational mobility, success, and opportunity.  
  
At the same time, Hispanic and Latino students face systemic inequitable
barriers in accessing a high-quality education and a fair shot at the
American dream.  Only 40 percent of Latino children participate in
preschool education programs as compared to 53 percent of their White
peers. Due to systemic and historical inequities faced in the classroom,
the high school graduation rate for Hispanic students is below the
national average.  Hispanic students are underrepresented in advanced
courses in mathematics and science, and they can face language barriers
in the classroom.  Only 19 percent of Latino adults have at least a
bachelor’s degree compared with 1 in 3 overall, and just 6 percent have
completed graduate or professional degree programs, versus 13 percent
nationally.  Further, the lack of availability of adult continuing
education courses makes it difficult for many Hispanic adults to further
their education.  In addition, barriers to equity in education can
compound and intersect for Hispanic and Latino students who are women
and girls, LGBTQ+ individuals, English language learners, and
individuals with disabilities.  
  
The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare and exacerbated many of these
inequities.  Hispanic and Latino students are more likely than their
White peers to experience remote learning arrangements, yet they have
less access to the tools necessary to succeed, such as broadband and
computer access.  Hispanic women have been adversely impacted by job
loss, a lack of access to child care, and the inability to provide care,
in greater numbers than their White counterparts.  These and
pre-existing disparities have led to declines in student achievement for
Hispanic students.  Latino students — once the fastest-growing group
of undergraduates in the United States — have seen a decline
in undergraduate college attendance amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.  It is
a priority of my Administration to ensure an equitable recovery from
COVID-19, and to provide Hispanic and Latino students with a successful
return to the classroom.  
  
These barriers exist not simply in the classroom, but also in the
workplace.  Hispanic workers are overrepresented in industries that have
been hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic, and they have faced
disproportionate losses in employment.  Hispanic and Latino workers
often face discrimination in hiring, pay, and consideration for
promotions among other challenges.  They need greater access to
work-based learning opportunities such as mentorships, internships, and
registered apprenticeships that not only guide employment seekers to a
career, but provide the experience needed to secure well-paying jobs.  
  
To ensure that our Nation reaches the ambitious goals we have set for
our economy to thrive, as well as to ensure equal access to opportunity
for all, we must enable Hispanic and Latino students to reach their
highest potential through our Nation’s schools and institutions of
higher education. The Federal Government must also collaborate with
Hispanic and Latino communities to ensure their long-term success.  
  
It is the policy of my Administration to advance educational equity,
excellence, and economic opportunity for Hispanic communities from early
childhood until their chosen career.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 2.  White House Initiative
on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity
for Hispanics. </span>  
     (a)  To advance equity in our Nation’s schools and to promote the
economic opportunity that follows it, there is established in the
Department of Education (Department), the White House Initiative on
Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for
Hispanics (Initiative), of which the Secretary of Education (Secretary)
shall serve as Chair.  The Secretary shall designate an Executive
Director for the Initiative (Executive Director).  
     (b) The Initiative shall advance educational equity and economic
opportunity for Latino and Hispanic students, families, and communities
by focusing on the following policy goals:  
          (i) increasing general understanding of systemic causes of
educational challenges faced by many Hispanic and Latino students,
whether these students are in urban, suburban, rural, or migrant
learning environments, and working across Federal agencies to address
these challenges;  
          (ii) increasing Hispanic and Latino children’s and families’
access to and participation in high-quality early childhood programs and
services that promote children’s healthy development and learning,
prepare them for success in school, and affirm their cultural
and linguistic identity;  
          (iii) addressing the inequitable treatment of Hispanic and
Latino children, such as eradicating disparities in disciplinary
actions;  
          (iv) supporting and improving data collection related to
Hispanic and Latino students and the implementation of evidence-based
strategies to increase the participation and success of Hispanic and
Latino students in all levels of education and prepare them for careers
and civic engagement;  
          (v) ensuring that all Hispanic and Latino students have access
to excellent teachers, school leaders, and other professionals,
including by supporting efforts to improve the recruitment, preparation,
development, and retention of qualified, diverse teachers and school
leaders and other professionals who understand students’ lived
experiences and can effectively meet their learning, social,
and emotional needs;  
         (vi) enhancing student support services and fostering positive
engagement among schools, families, community leaders, and
community-based organizations to increase the high school graduation and
post-secondary attendance rates and decrease the high school dropout
rate for Hispanic and Latino students;  
         (vii) promoting a positive school climate that supports
equitable access to and participation in college-readiness, advanced
placement courses, and internship opportunities, as well as innovative
dropout prevention and recovery strategies that better engage Hispanic
and Latino youth in their learning, help them progress academically as
needed, and provide those who have left the educational system with
pathways to reentry;  
          (viii) policies that lead to racial and socioeconomic
segregation among and within schools;(ix) ensuring equitable access to
educational resources, professionals, and technology, including by
addressing racial disparities in school funding and expenditures;  
          (x) breaking down barriers that impede the access of higher
education institutions that serve Hispanic and Latino students, such as
HSIs, to Federal funding, and strengthening the capacity of those
institutions to participate in Federal programs and partnerships;  
          (xi) advancing racial equity and economic opportunity by
connecting education to labor market needs through programs such as dual
enrollment, career and technical education, registered apprenticeships,
work-based learning, and career advancement, particularly in the fields
of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; and  
          (xii) ensuring that Hispanic and Latino communities have
access to resources for economic success, such as in the areas of
financial education, small business development, entrepreneurship, arts,
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.  
     (c) In working to fulfill its mission and objectives, the
Initiative shall, consistent with applicable law:    
          (i)    identify and promote evidence-based best practices that
can provide Hispanic and Latino students with a rigorous and
well-rounded education in safe and healthy environments, as well as
access to support services, that will improve their educational,
professional, economic, and civic opportunities;  
          (ii) advance and coordinate efforts to ensure equitable
opportunities for Hispanic and Latino students in the re-opening process
for schools across the country, and take steps to ensure that Hispanic
and Latino students, from early childhood to post-secondary education,
can equitably recover from learning losses and other challenges faced
during the COVID-19 pandemic;  
         (iii) encourage and develop partnerships with a national
network of early childhood and early intervention providers, schools,
institutions of higher education, and other public, private,
philanthropic, and nonprofit stakeholders to improve access to
educational equity and economic opportunities for Hispanics and
Latinos;  
         (iv) monitor and support the development, implementation, and
coordination of Federal Government educational, workforce, research,
and business development policies, programs, and technical assistance
designed to improve outcomes for historically underserved communities,
including Hispanics and Latinos;  
          (v)    work closely with the Executive Office of the President
on key Administration priorities related to education, equity, and
economic opportunity for Hispanics and Latinos; and  
          (vi)   advise the Secretary on issues of importance and
policies relating to educational equity, excellence, and economic
opportunity for Hispanics and Latinos.  
     (d)  The Initiative shall establish a Federal Interagency Working
