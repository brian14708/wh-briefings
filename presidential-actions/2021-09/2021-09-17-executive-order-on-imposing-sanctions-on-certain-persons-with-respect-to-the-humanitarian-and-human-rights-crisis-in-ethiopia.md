title: "Executive Order on Imposing Sanctions on Certain Persons With Respect to the\
  \ Humanitarian and Human Rights Crisis in\_Ethiopia"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq*.) (IEEPA), the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq*.) (NEA), sections
212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8
U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a)), and section 301 of title 3, United States
Code,

I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, find
that the situation in and in relation to northern Ethiopia, which has
been marked by activities that threaten the peace, security, and
stability of Ethiopia and the greater Horn of Africa region — in
particular, widespread violence, atrocities, and serious human rights
abuse, including those involving ethnic-based violence, rape and other
forms of gender-based violence, and obstruction of humanitarian
operations — constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the
national security and foreign policy of the United States.  I hereby
declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.

The widespread humanitarian crisis precipitated by the violent conflict
in northern Ethiopia has left millions of people in need of humanitarian
assistance and has placed an entire region on the brink of famine. 
While maintaining pressure on those persons responsible for the crisis,
the United States will seek to ensure that appropriate personal
remittances to non-blocked persons and humanitarian assistance to
at-risk populations can flow to Ethiopia and the greater Horn of Africa
region through legitimate and transparent channels, including
governments, international organizations, and non-profit organizations. 
The United States supports ongoing international efforts to promote a
negotiated ceasefire and political resolution of this crisis, to ensure
the withdrawal of Eritrean forces from Ethiopia, and to promote the
unity, territorial integrity, and stability of Ethiopia.  
  
Accordingly, I hereby order:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">1.</span>  The Secretary of the
Treasury is authorized to impose any of the sanctions described in
section 2(a) of this order on any foreign person determined by the
Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of
State:  
     (a)  to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have directly or
indirectly engaged or attempted to engage in, any of the following:  
          (i)   actions or policies that threaten the peace, security,
or stability of Ethiopia, or that have the purpose or effect of
expanding or extending the crisis in northern Ethiopia or obstructing a
ceasefire or a peace process;  
          (ii)   corruption or serious human rights abuse in or with
respect to northern Ethiopia;  
          (iii)  the obstruction of the delivery or distribution of, or
access to, humanitarian assistance in or with respect to northern
Ethiopia, including attacks on humanitarian aid personnel or
humanitarian projects;  
          (iv)   the targeting of civilians through the commission of
acts of violence in or with respect to northern Ethiopia, including
involving abduction, forced displacement, or attacks on schools,
hospitals, religious sites, or locations where civilians are seeking
refuge, or any conduct that would constitute a violation of
international humanitarian law;  
          (v)    planning, directing, or committing attacks in or with
respect to northern Ethiopia against United Nations or associated
personnel or African Union or associated personnel;  
          (vi)   actions or policies that undermine democratic processes

operated in northern Ethiopia on or after November 1, 2020;  
     (c)  to be an entity, including any government entity or a

     (d)  to be a political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality of
the Government of Ethiopia, the Government of Eritrea or its ruling
People’s Front for Democracy and Justice, the Tigray People’s Liberation
Front, the Amhara regional government, or the Amhara regional or
irregular forces;   
     (e)  to be a spouse or adult child of any sanctioned person;  
     (f)  to be or have been a leader, official, senior executive
officer, or member of the board of directors of any of the following,
where the leader, official, senior executive officer, or director is
responsible for or complicit in, or who has directly or indirectly
engaged or attempted to engage in, any activity contributing to the
crisis in northern Ethiopia:   
          (i)    an entity, including a government entity or a military
or security force, operating in northern Ethiopia during the tenure of
the leader, official, senior executive officer, or director;  
          (ii)   an entity that has, or whose members have, engaged in
any activity contributing to the crisis in northern Ethiopia or
obstructing a ceasefire or a peace process to resolve such crisis during
the tenure of the leader, official, senior executive officer, or
director; or  
          (iii)  the Government of Ethiopia, the Government of Eritrea
or its ruling People’s Front for Democracy and Justice, the Tigray

     (g)  to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial,
material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in
support of, any sanctioned person; or   
     (h)  to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to
act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any sanctioned person.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">2.</span>  (a)  When the Secretary of
the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, has
determined that a foreign person meets any of the criteria described in
section 1(a)-(h) of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury is
authorized to select, in consultation with the Secretary of State, one
or more of the sanctions set forth in subsections (a)(i)(A)-(E) or
(a)(ii)(A)-(B) of this section to impose on that foreign person:  
          (i)   the Secretary of the Treasury shall take the following
actions as necessary to implement the selected sanctions:  
               (A)  block all property and interests in property of the
sanctioned person that are in the United States, that hereafter come
within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the
possession or control of any United States person, and provide that such
property and interests in property may not be transferred, paid,
exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in;  
               (B)  prohibit any United States person from investing in
or purchasing significant amounts of equity or debt instruments of the
sanctioned person;  
               (C)  prohibit any United States financial institution
from making loans or providing credit to the sanctioned person;  
               (D)  prohibit any transactions in foreign exchange that
are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and in which the
sanctioned person has any interest; or  
               (E)  impose on the leader, official, senior executive
officer, or director of the sanctioned person, or on persons performing
similar functions and with similar authorities as such leader, official,
senior executive officer, or director, any of the sanctions described in
subsections (a)(i)(A)-(D) of this section that are applicable.  
          (ii)  the heads of the relevant executive departments and
agencies, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, shall take
the following actions as necessary and appropriate to implement the
sanctions selected by the Secretary of the Treasury:   
               (A)  actions required to deny any specific license,
grant, or any other specific permission or authority under any statute
or regulation that requires the prior review and approval of the United
States Government as a condition for the export or reexport of goods or
technology to the sanctioned person; or  
               (B)  actions required to deny a visa to and exclude from
the United States any noncitizen whom the Secretary of the Treasury, in
consultation with the Secretary of State, determines is a leader,
official, senior executive officer, or director, or a shareholder with a
controlling interest in, the sanctioned person.  
     (b)  The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply
except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders,
directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and
notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit
granted before the date of this order.  No entity shall be blocked
pursuant to this order solely because it is owned in whole or in part,
directly or indirectly, by one or more sanctioned persons, unless the
entity is itself a sanctioned person and the sanctions in section
2(a)(i)(A) of this order are imposed on the entity.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">3.</span>  The prohibitions in
section 2(a) of this order include:  
     (a)  the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods,
or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and
interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and  
     (b)  the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods,
or services from any such person.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">4.</span>  (a)  The unrestricted
immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of noncitizens
determined to meet one or more of the criteria in section l of this
order, and for whom the sanctions described in section 2(a)(i)(A) or
section 2(a)(ii)(B) of this order have been selected, would be
detrimental to the interests of the United States, and the entry of such
persons into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, is
hereby suspended, except when the Secretary of State or the Secretary of
Homeland Security, as appropriate, determines that the person’s entry
would not be contrary to the interests of the United States, including
when the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security, as
appropriate, so determines, based on a recommendation of the Attorney
General, that the person’s entry would further important United States
law enforcement objectives.  
     (b)  The Secretary of State shall implement this order as it
applies to visas pursuant to such procedures as the Secretary of State,
in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, may establish.
   
     (c)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall implement this order
as it applies to the entry of noncitizens pursuant to such procedures as
the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary
of State, may establish.  
     (d)  Such persons shall be treated by this section in the same
manner as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24,
2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security
Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act
Sanctions). 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">5.</span>  (a)  Any transaction that
evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a
violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth
in this order is prohibited.   
     (b)  Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set
forth in this order is prohibited.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">6.</span>  I hereby determine that
the making of donations of the types of articles specified in section
203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of
any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant
to this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the
national emergency declared in this order, and I hereby prohibit such
donations as provided by section 2 of this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">7.</span>  For the purposes of this
order:  
     (a)  the term “entity” means a partnership, association, trust,
joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;  
     (b)  the term “Government of Ethiopia” means the Government of
Ethiopia, any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof,
including the National Bank of Ethiopia, and any person owned,
controlled, or directed by, or acting for or on behalf of, the
Government of Ethiopia;  
     (c)  the term “Government of Eritrea” means the Government of
Eritrea, any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof,
including the Bank of Eritrea, and any person owned, controlled, or
directed by, or acting for or on behalf of, the Government of Eritrea;  
     (d)  the term “noncitizen” means any person who is not a citizen or
noncitizen national of the United States;  
     (e)  the term “person” means an individual or entity;   
     (f)  the term “sanctioned person” means a foreign person that the
Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State,
has determined meets any of the criteria described in section 1 of this
order and has selected, in consultation with the Secretary of State, one
or more of the sanctions set forth in section 2(a) of this order to
impose on that foreign person; and  
     (g)  the term “United States person” means any United States
citizen, lawful permanent resident, entity organized under the laws of
the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States
(including foreign branches), or any person in the United States.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">8.</span>  For those persons whose
property and interests in property are blocked or affected by this order
who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find
that because of the ability to transfer funds and other assets
instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken
pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual.  I
therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in
addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be
no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1
of this order. 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">9.</span>  The Secretary of the
Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is authorized to
take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations,
and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be
necessary to carry out the purposes of this order.  The Secretary of the
Treasury may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these
functions within the Department of the Treasury.  All executive
departments and agencies of the United States shall take all appropriate
measures within their authority to implement this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">10.</span>  Nothing in this order
shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official business of
the Federal Government by employees, grantees, and contractors thereof.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">11.</span>  The Secretary of the
Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is authorized to
submit recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national
emergency declared in this order, consistent with section 401(c) of the
NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">12.</span>  (a)  Nothing in this
order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:  
          (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department
or agency, or the head thereof; or  
          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.  
     (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
