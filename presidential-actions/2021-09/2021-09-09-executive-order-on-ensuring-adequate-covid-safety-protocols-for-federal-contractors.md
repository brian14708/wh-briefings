title: "Executive Order on Ensuring Adequate COVID Safety Protocols for Federal\_\
  Contractors"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and
Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 101 *et seq*., and section 301 of
title 3, United States Code, and in order to promote economy and
efficiency in procurement by contracting with sources that provide
adequate COVID-19 safeguards for their workforce, it is hereby ordered
as follows:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">1.</span>  <span
style="text-decoration: underline">Policy.</span>  This order promotes
economy and efficiency in Federal procurement by ensuring that the
parties that contract with the Federal Government provide adequate
COVID-19 safeguards to their workers performing on or in connection with
a Federal Government contract or contract-like instrument as described
in section 5(a) of this order.  These safeguards will decrease the
spread of COVID-19, which will decrease worker absence, reduce labor
costs, and improve the efficiency of contractors and subcontractors at
sites where they are performing work for the Federal Government.
 Accordingly, ensuring that Federal contractors and subcontractors are
adequately protected from COVID-19 will bolster economy and efficiency
in Federal procurement.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">2.</span>  <span
style="text-decoration: underline">Providing for Adequate COVID-19
Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors and Subcontractors*.*</span>
 (a)  Executive departments and agencies, including independent
establishments subject to the Federal Property and Administrative
Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 102(4)(A) (agencies), shall, to the extent
permitted by law, ensure that contracts and contract-like instruments
(as described in section 5(a) of this order) include a clause that the
contractor and any subcontractors (at any tier) shall incorporate into
lower-tier subcontracts.  This clause shall specify that the contractor
or subcontractor shall, for the duration of the contract, comply with
all guidance for contractor or subcontractor workplace locations
published by the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force (Task Force Guidance
or Guidance), provided that the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget (Director) approves the Task Force Guidance and determines that
the Guidance, if adhered to by contractors or subcontractors, will
promote economy and efficiency in Federal contracting.  This clause
shall apply to any workplace locations (as specified by the Task Force
Guidance) in which an individual is working on or in connection with a
Federal Government contract or contract-like instrument (as described in
section 5(a) of this order).  
     (b)  By September 24, 2021, the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force
(Task Force) shall, as part of its issuance of Task Force Guidance,
provide definitions of relevant terms for contractors and
subcontractors, explanations of protocols required of contractors and
subcontractors to comply with workplace safety guidance, and any
exceptions to Task Force Guidance that apply to contractor and
subcontractor workplace locations and individuals in those locations
working on or in connection with a Federal Government contract or
contract-like instrument (as described in section 5(a) of this order).  
     (c)  Prior to the Task Force publishing new Guidance related to
COVID-19 for contractor or subcontractor workplace locations, including
the Guidance developed pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the
Director shall, as an exercise of the delegation of my authority under
the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, *see* 3 U.S.C.
301, determine whether such Guidance will promote economy and efficiency
in Federal contracting if adhered to by Government contractors and
subcontractors.  Upon an affirmative determination by the Director, the
Director’s approval of the Guidance, and subsequent issuance of such
Guidance by the Task Force, contractors and subcontractors working on or
in connection with a Federal Government contract or contract-like
instrument (as described in section 5(a) of this order), shall adhere to
the requirements of the newly published Guidance, in accordance with the
clause described in subsection (a) of this section.  The Director shall
publish such determination in the *Federal Register*.       
     (d)  Nothing in this order shall excuse noncompliance with any
applicable State law or municipal ordinance establishing more protective
safety protocols than those established under this order or with any
more protective Federal law, regulation, or agency instructions for
contractor or subcontractor employees working at a Federal building or a
federally controlled workplace.  
     (e)  For purposes of this order, the term “contract or
contract-like instrument” shall have the meaning set forth in the
Department of Labor’s proposed rule, “Increasing the Minimum Wage for
Federal Contractors, ” 86 Fed. Reg. 38816, 38887 (July 22, 2021).  If
the Department of Labor issues a final rule relating to that proposed
rule, that term shall have the meaning set forth in that final rule.

Regulation to provide for inclusion in Federal procurement solicitations
and contracts subject to this order the clause described in section 2(a)
of this order, and shall, by October 8, 2021, take initial steps to
implement appropriate policy direction to acquisition offices for use of
the clause by recommending that agencies exercise their authority under
subpart 1.4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  
     (b)  By October 8, 2021, agencies shall take steps, to the extent

and that are entered into on or after October 15, 2021, consistent with
