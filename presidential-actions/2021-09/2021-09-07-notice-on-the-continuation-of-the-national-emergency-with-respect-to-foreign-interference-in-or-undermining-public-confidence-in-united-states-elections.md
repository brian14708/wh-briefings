title: "Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to Foreign\
  \ Interference in or Undermining Public Confidence in United\_States\_Elections"
---
 
On September 12, 2018, by Executive Order 13848, the President declared
a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *etseq*.) to deal with the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the
United States constituted by the threat of foreign interference in or
undermining public confidence in United States elections.

Although there has been no evidence of a foreign power altering the
outcomes or vote tabulation in any United States election, foreign
powers have historically sought to exploit America’s free and open
political system.  In recent years, the proliferation of digital devices
and internet-based communications has created significant
vulnerabilities and magnified the scope and intensity of the threat of
foreign interference.  The ability of persons located, in whole or in
substantial part, outside the United States to interfere in or undermine
public confidence in United States elections, including through the
unauthorized accessing of election and campaign infrastructure or the
covert distribution of propaganda and disinformation, continues to pose
an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign
policy of the United States.  For this reason, the national emergency
declared on September 12, 2018, must continue in effect beyond September
12, 2021.  Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13848 with respect to the
threat of foreign interference in or undermining public confidence in
United States elections.

This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register *and transmitted
to the Congress.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
September 7, 2021.
