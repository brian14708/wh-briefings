title: Addressing Threats to The United States by the Government of Brazil
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) (IEEPA), the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq.*) (NEA), section 604
of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301
of title 3, United States Code, I hereby order:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">National Emergency</span>.  As
President of the United States, my highest duty is protecting the
national security, foreign policy, and economy of this country.  Recent
policies, practices, and actions of the Government of Brazil threaten
the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United
States.  Members of the Government of Brazil have taken actions that
interfere with the economy of the United States, infringe the free
expression rights of United States persons, violate human rights, and
undermine the interest the United States has in protecting its citizens
and companies.  Members of the Government of Brazil are also politically
persecuting a former President of Brazil, which is contributing to the
deliberate breakdown in the rule of law in Brazil, to politically
motivated intimidation in that country, and to human rights abuses.

Recently, members of the Government of Brazil have taken unprecedented
actions that harm and are a threat to the economy of the United States,
conflict with and threaten the policy of the United States to promote
free speech and free and fair elections at home and abroad, and violate
fundamental human rights.  Indeed, certain Brazilian officials have
issued orders to compel United States online platforms to censor the
accounts or content of United States persons, where such accounts or
content are protected by the First Amendment to the United States
Constitution within the United States; block the ability of United
States persons to raise money on their platforms; change their content
moderation policies, enforcement practices, or algorithms in ways that
may result in the censorship of the content and accounts of United
States persons; and provide the user data of accounts belonging to
United States persons, facilitating the targeting of political critics
in the United States. 

For example, Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes has
abused his judicial authority to target political opponents, shield
corrupt allies, and suppress dissent, often in coordination with other
Brazilian officials.  Justice de Moraes has authorized politically
motivated police raids, arrests, and bank account freezes.  He has also
authorized the confiscation of passports, jailed individuals without
trial for social media posts, opened unprecedented criminal
investigations, including into United States citizens for their
constitutionally protected speech in the United States, and issued
secret orders to United States social media companies to censor
thousands of posts and de-platform dozens of political critics,
including United States persons, for lawful speech on United States
soil.  When United States and United States-headquartered companies have
refused to comply with his unlawful censorship demands, Justice de
Moraes has imposed substantial fines on United States and United
States-headquartered companies, ordered the suspension of United States
and United States-headquartered companies in Brazil, and threatened
United States and United States-headquartered company executives with
criminal prosecution.  In fact, Justice de Moraes is currently
overseeing the Government of Brazil’s criminal prosecution of a United
States resident for speech he made on United States soil.

These judicial actions, taken under the pretext of combatting
“disinformation,” “fake news,” or “anti-democratic” or “hateful”
content, endanger the economy of the United States by tyrannically and
arbitrarily coercing United States companies to censor political speech,
turn over sensitive United States user data, or change their content
moderation policies on pain of extraordinary fines, criminal
prosecution, asset freezes, or complete exclusion from the Brazilian
market.  These actions also chill and limit expression in the United
States, violate human rights, and undermine the interest that the
United States has in protecting its citizens and companies at home and
abroad. 

Brazilian officials are also persecuting former President of Brazil Jair
Bolsonaro.  The Government of Brazil has unjustly charged Bolsonaro with
multiple crimes related to Bolsonaro’s 2022 runoff election, and the
Supreme Court of Brazil has misguidedly ruled that Bolsonaro must stand
trial for these unjustified criminal charges.  Political persecution,
through drummed up prosecutions, threatens the orderly development of
Brazil’s political, administrative, and economic institutions, including
undermining the ability of Brazil to hold a free and fair election of
the presidency in 2026.  The Government of Brazil’s treatment of former
President Bolsonaro also contributes to the deliberate breakdown in the
rule of law in Brazil, to politically motivated intimidation in that
country, and to human rights abuses.

I find that the unprecedented actions taken by the Government of Brazil
have violated the free expression rights of United States persons,
interfered with the economy of the United States by coercing United
States and United States-headquartered companies to censor United States
persons for speech protected by the First Amendment to the United States
Constitution on pain of extraordinary fines, criminal prosecution, asset
freezes, or complete exclusion from the Brazilian market, subverted the
interest of the United States in protecting its citizens and companies,
undermined the rule of law in Brazil, and jeopardized the orderly
development of Brazil’s political, administrative, and economic
institutions.  The policies, practices, and actions of the Government of
Brazil are repugnant to the moral and political values of democratic and
free societies and conflict with the policy of the United States to
promote democratic governments throughout the world, the principle of
free expression and free and fair elections, the rule of law, and
respect for human rights.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, find that the scope and gravity of the recent policies,
practices, and actions of the Government of Brazil constitute an unusual
and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial
part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign
policy, and economy of the United States and hereby declare a national
emergency with respect to that threat.

To deal with the national emergency declared in this order, I determine
that it is necessary and appropriate to impose an additional *ad
valorem* duty rate of 40 percent on certain products of Brazil, as
detailed below.  In my judgment, this action is necessary and
appropriate to deal with the national emergency declared in this order. 
I am taking the action in this order only for the purpose of addressing
the national emergency declared in this order and not for any other
purpose.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Tariff Modifications</span>. 
(a)  Articles of Brazil imported into the customs territory of the
United States shall be, consistent with law, subject to an additional
*ad valorem* rate of duty of 40 percent.  This rate of duty shall be
effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn
from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight
time 7 days after the date of this order, except those goods encompassed
by 50 U.S.C. 1702(b) or set forth in Annex I to this order, and except
for goods that (1) were loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading and
in transit on the final mode of transit prior to entry into the United
States, before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 7 days after the date of
this order; and (2) are entered for consumption, or withdrawn from
warehouse for consumption before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on
October 5, 2025.  The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States 
shall be modified as provided in Annex II to this order.

(b)  U.S. Customs and Border Protection may take any necessary or
appropriate measure to administer the duty imposed by this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Scope of Duties and
Stacking</span>.  (a)  The *ad valorem* duty imposed in this order is in
addition to any other duties, fees, taxes, exactions, and charges
applicable to such imports, unless subject to existing or future actions
under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, in which case the
*ad valorem* duty imposed in this order shall not apply.

(b)  The *ad valorem* duty imposed in this order shall not apply to
articles that are excepted by 50 U.S.C. 1702(b) or set forth in Annex I
to this order, including certain silicon metal, pig iron, civil aircraft
and parts and components thereof, metallurgical grade alumina, tin ore,
wood pulp, precious metals, energy and energy products, and fertilizers.

(c)  The *ad valorem* duty imposed in Executive Order 14257 of April 2,
2025 (Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade
Practices That Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States
Goods Trade Deficits), as amended, shall apply in addition to the *ad
valorem* duty imposed in this order, when applicable pursuant to the
terms of Executive Order 14257.

\(d\)  Subject articles, except those eligible for admission under
“domestic status” as defined in 19 CFR 146.43, which are subject to the
duty specified in section 2 of this order and are admitted into a
foreign trade zone on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 7 days
after the date of this order, must be admitted as “privileged foreign
status” as defined in 19 CFR 146.41.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. 4.  Modification
Authority.  (a)  To ensure that the emergency declared in this order is
dealt with, I may modify this order, including in light of additional
information, recommendations from senior officials, or changed
circumstances.

(b)  Should the Government of Brazil retaliate against the United States
in response to this action, I will modify this order to ensure the
efficacy of the actions herein ordered.  For example, if the Government
of Brazil retaliates by raising tariff rates on United States exports, I
will increase the *ad valorem* duty rate set forth in this order by a
corresponding amount.

\(c\)  Should the Government of Brazil take significant steps to address
the national emergency declared in this order and align sufficiently
with the United States on national security, economic, and foreign
policy matters described in this order, I may further modify this order.

Sec. 5.  Monitoring and Recommendations.  (a)  The Secretary of State
shall monitor, and regularly consult with any senior official the
Secretary of State deems appropriate on, the situation involving the
Government of Brazil.

(b)  The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the
Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security,
the United States Trade Representative, the Assistant to the President
for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for
Economic Policy, and the Assistant to the President and Senior Counselor
for Trade and Manufacturing shall recommend to me additional action, if
necessary, if this action is not effective in resolving the emergency
declared in this order or should the Government of Brazil retaliate
against the United States in response to the actions taken in this order
or any subsequent order issued to address this emergency.

Sec. 6.  Delegation.  The Secretary of State, in consultation with the
Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of
Homeland Security, the United States Trade Representative, the Assistant
to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the
President for Economic Policy, the Assistant to the President and Senior
Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing, and the Chair of the United
States International Trade Commission, is hereby authorized to employ
all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to
carry out the purposes of this order.  The Secretary of State may,
consistent with law, redelegate the authority set forth in this order
within the Department of State.  Each executive department and agency
shall take all appropriate measures within its authority to carry out
this order.

Sec. 7.  Reporting Directives.  The Secretary of State, in consultation
with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the
Secretary of Homeland Security, the United States Trade Representative,
the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the
Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Assistant to the
President and Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing, is hereby
authorized and directed to submit recurring and final reports to the

exercised by, this order, consistent with section 401 of the NEA (50
U.S.C. 1641) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).

Sec. 8.  Severability.  If any provision of this order, or the
application of any provision to any individual or circumstance, is held
to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its
other provisions to any other individuals or circumstances shall not be
affected thereby. 

Sec. 9.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be
construed to impair or otherwise affect:

or the head thereof; or

(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(d)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Department of State.

2\. Effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or
withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern
daylight time 7 days after the date of the executive order, excluding
the day the executive order is signed, subchapter III of chapter 99 of
the HTSUS is modified by inserting the following new subdivision (x) to
U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS in numerical
sequence:

“(x) (i) Except as provided in headings 9903.01.78-9903.01.83, and in
subdivisions (x)(ii) through (x)(xi) of this note, and other than
products for personal use included in accompanied baggage of persons
arriving in the United States, heading 9903.01.77 imposes an additional
*ad valorem* rate of duty on imports of all products of Brazil.
Notwithstanding U.S. note 1 to this subchapter, all products that are
subject to the additional *ad valorem* rate of duty imposed by this
heading shall also be subject to the general rates of duty imposed under
subheadings in chapters 1 to 97 of the tariff schedule. Except as
provided in subdivisions (x)(ii) through (x)(xi) of this note, all
products that are subject to the additional *ad valorem* rate of duty
imposed by this heading shall also be subject to any additional duty
provided for in this subchapter or subchapter IV of chapter 99. Products
that are eligible for special tariff treatment under general note
3(c)(i) to the tariff schedule, with the exception of products covered
by the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft, or
that are eligible for temporary duty exemptions or reductions under
subchapter II to chapter 99, shall be subject to the additional *ad
valorem* rate of duty imposed by this heading.

The additional duty imposed by this heading shall not apply to goods for
which entry is properly claimed under a provision of chapter 98 of the
tariff schedule pursuant to applicable regulations of U.S. Customs and
Border Protection (“CBP”), and whenever CBP agrees that entry under such
a provision is appropriate, except for goods entered under heading
9802.00.80; and subheadings 9802.00.40, 9802.00.50, and 9802.00.60.  For
subheadings 9802.00.40, 9802.00.50, and 9802.00.60, the additional
duties apply to the value of repairs, alterations, or processing
performed, as described in the applicable subheading.  For heading
9802.00.80, the additional duties apply to the value of the article
assembled abroad, less the cost or value of such products of the United
States, as described. 

Products that are provided for in heading 9903.01.77 shall continue to
be subject to antidumping, countervailing, or other duties, taxes, fees,
exactions and charges that apply to such products, as well as to the
additional *ad valorem* rate of duty imposed by this heading.

\(ii\) Heading 9903.01.79 covers only products that are donations, by
persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, of articles,
such as food, clothing, and medicine, intended to be used to relieve
human suffering, except to the extent that the President determines that
such donations (A) would seriously impair his ability to deal with any
national emergency declared under section 1701 of title 19 of the U.S.
Code, (B) are in response to coercion against the proposed recipient or
donor, or (C) would endanger Armed Forces of the United States which are
engaged in hostilities or are in a situation where imminent involvement
in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances.

\(iii\) As provided in heading 9903.01.81, the additional duties imposed
by heading 9903.01.77 shall not apply to products classified in the
following provisions of the HTSUS:
