title: "Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable, Foreign\u2011Controlled\
  \ Energy Sources"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  For too long,
the Federal Government has forced American taxpayers to subsidize
expensive and unreliable energy sources like wind and solar.  The
proliferation of these projects displaces affordable, reliable,
dispatchable domestic energy sources, compromises our electric grid, and
denigrates the beauty of our Nation’s natural landscape.  Moreover,
reliance on so-called “green” subsidies threatens national security by
making the United States dependent on supply chains controlled by
foreign adversaries.  Ending the massive cost of taxpayer handouts to
unreliable energy sources is vital to energy dominance, national
security, economic growth, and the fiscal health of the Nation.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of the United States to:

\(a\)  rapidly eliminate the market distortions and costs imposed on
taxpayers by so-called “green” energy subsidies;

\(b\)  build upon and strengthen the repeal of, and modifications to,
wind, solar, and other “green” energy tax credits in the One Big
Beautiful Bill Act; and

\(c\)  end taxpayer support for unaffordable and unreliable “green”
energy sources and supply chains built in, and controlled by, foreign
adversaries.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Tax Credits and One Big
Beautiful Bill Act Implementation by the Department of the
Treasury</span>.  (a)  Within 45 days following enactment of the One Big
Beautiful Bill Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take all action
as the Secretary of the Treasury deems necessary and appropriate to
strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and
investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal
Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities.  This includes issuing new
and revised guidance as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate
and consistent with applicable law to ensure that policies concerning
the “beginning of construction” are not circumvented, including by
preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility
and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial
portion of a subject facility has been built.

\(b\)  Within 45 days following enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill
Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take prompt action as the
Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with
applicable law to implement the enhanced Foreign Entity of Concern
restrictions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">One Big Beautiful Bill Act
Implementation by the Department of the Interior</span>.  (a)  Within 45
days following enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the
Secretary of the Interior shall conduct a review of regulations,
guidance, policies, and practices under the Department of the Interior’s
jurisdiction to determine whether any provide preferential treatment to
wind and solar facilities in comparison to dispatchable energy sources. 
The Secretary of the Interior shall then revise any identified
regulations, guidance, policies, and practices as appropriate and
consistent with applicable law to eliminate any such preferences for
wind and solar facilities.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Reports</span>.  Within 45 days
of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury and the
Secretary of the Interior shall submit a report to the President,
through the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, the findings
made under, and actions taken and planned to be taken to implement, this
order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. 
(a)   Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

\(i\)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or
agency, or the head thereof; or

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

\(c\)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

\(d\)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Department of the Treasury.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

    July 7, 2025.
