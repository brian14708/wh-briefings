title: Amendment to Duties to Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Northern
  Border
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) (IEEPA), the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq.*), section 604 of the
Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title
3, United States Code, I hereby determine and order:  
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.  In
Executive Order 14193 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties To Address
the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Northern Border), I declared a
national emergency arising from certain conditions, including the public
health crisis caused by fentanyl and other illicit drugs, and the
failure of Canada to do more to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise
intercept drug trafficking organizations, other drug or human
traffickers, criminals at large, and illicit drugs.  In that order, I
found that those conditions constitute an unusual and extraordinary
threat, which has its source in substantial part outside the United
States, to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the
United States.  
To deal with the emergency declared in Executive Order 14193, I imposed
an additional* ad valorem* rate of duty of 25 percent on certain
articles that are products of Canada and an additional* ad valorem* rate
of duty of 10 percent on certain energy or energy resources that are
products of Canada.  In Executive Order 14231 of March 6, 2025
(Amendment to Duties To Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our
Northern Border), I provided that the additional* ad valorem* rates of
duties under Executive Order 14193 do not apply to articles that are
products of Canada that qualify for duty-free entry under the Agreement
between the United States of America, United Mexican States, and Canada
(USMCA), and I reduced the additional *ad valorem* rate of duty on
potash from 25 percent to 10 percent.  
Section 2(d) of Executive Order 14193 provides that “\[s\]hould Canada
retaliate against the United States . . . through import duties on
United States exports to Canada or similar measures,” I “may increase or
expand in scope the duties imposed . . . to ensure the efficacy of
th\[e\] action” taken in Executive Order 14193.  Section 3(b) of
Executive Order 14193 provides that the Secretary of Homeland Security,
in coordination with other senior officials, “shall recommend additional
action, if necessary, should the Government of Canada fail to take
adequate steps to alleviate the illegal migration and illicit drug
crises through cooperative enforcement actions.”  
I have received additional information and recommendations from various
senior officials regarding, among other things, Canada’s lack of
cooperation in stemming the flood of fentanyl and other illicit drugs
across our northern border — including its failure to devote
satisfactory resources to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise intercept
drug trafficking organizations, other drug or human traffickers,
criminals at large, and illicit drugs — and Canada’s efforts to
retaliate against the United States in response to Executive Order
14193, as amended.  After considering the additional information and
recommendations that I have received, among other things, I have
determined that, for the products of Canada that are subject to the
additional *ad valorem* rate of duty of 25 percent, the additional *ad
valorem* rate of duty shall increase from 25 percent to 35 percent.  In
my judgment, this action is necessary and appropriate to deal with the
emergency declared in Executive Order 14193.  
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Implementation</span>.  (a)
 All articles that are subject to the additional *ad valorem *rate of
duty of 25 percent under Executive Order 14193, as amended, shall
instead be subject to an additional *ad valorem *rate of duty of 35
percent.  Accordingly, the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United
States (HTSUS) shall be modified as provided in the Annex to this
order.  
(b)  The changes set forth herein shall be effective with respect to
goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for
consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 1,
2025.  
(c)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to alter or otherwise
affect section 2(b) of Executive Order 14193 or section 2(a) or section
2(b) of Executive Order 14231.  
(d)  The stacking rules set out in Executive Order 14289 of April 29,
2025 (Addressing Certain Tariffs on Imported Articles), and any
subsequent order or proclamation addressing stacking of tariffs imposed
under IEEPA, shall continue to apply to goods that are subject to
subsection (a) of this section.  
(e)  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the United
States International Trade Commission, shall determine whether any
additional modifications to the HTSUS are necessary to effectuate this
order and may make such modifications through notice in the *Federal
Register*.  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Transshipment</span>. 
(a) all articles of Canada that do not qualify as originating under
USMCA and are determined by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to
have been transshipped to evade applicable duties under section 2 of
this order shall be subject to (i) an additional *ad valorem* rate of
duty of 40 percent, in lieu of the additional *ad valorem* rate of duty
applicable under section 2 of this order to goods of the country of
origin; (ii) any other applicable or appropriate fine or penalty,
including those assessed under 19 U.S.C. 1592; and (iii) any other
United States duties, fees, taxes, exactions, or charges applicable to
goods of the country of origin.  CBP shall not allow, consistent with
applicable law, for mitigation or remission of the penalties assessed on
imports found to be transshipped to evade applicable duties.  
(b)  The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Homeland Security,
acting through the Commissioner of CBP, in consultation with the United
States Trade Representative, shall publish every 6 months a list of
countries and specific facilities used in circumvention schemes, to
inform public procurement, national security reviews, and commercial due
diligence.  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Monitoring
and Recommendations</span>.  (a)  The Secretary of Homeland Security
shall continue to monitor, and regularly consult with the Secretary of
State, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for National
Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland
Security, on the situation at our northern border.  The Secretary of
Homeland Security shall inform the President of any circumstances that,
in her opinion, might indicate the need for further action by the
President.  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall also inform the
President of any circumstance that, in her opinion, might indicate that
the Government of Canada has taken adequate steps to alleviate the
emergency declared in Executive Order 14193.  
(b)  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the
Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President
for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for
Homeland Security, shall recommend additional action, if necessary,
should the Government of Canada fail to take adequate steps to alleviate
the illicit drug crisis or should the Government of Canada retaliate
against the United States in response to the actions taken in Executive
Order 14193 or any subsequent order issued to address the emergency
declared in Executive Order 14193.  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Delegation</span>.  The
Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of
the Treasury, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Commerce, is
hereby authorized to take such actions, including adopting rules and
regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA
as may be necessary to implement this order.  The Secretary of Homeland
Security may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these
functions within the Department of Homeland Security.  All executive
departments and agencies shall take all appropriate measures within
their authority to implement this order.  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Severability</span>.  If any
provision of this order, or the application of any provision of this

remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any
other individuals or circumstances shall not be affected.

 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.

**Annex**

Effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn
from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight
time on August 1, 2025, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the Harmonized
Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) is modified as follows:

(a)   Heading 9903.01.10 of the HTSUS is amended by deleting “25%” each
place that it appears and by inserting “35%” in lieu thereof; and

(b)  Subdivision (j) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of
the HTSUS is amended by:

\(i\) deleting “25%” and inserting “35%” in lieu thereof, and  
(ii) deleting “described in headings 9903.01.11, 9903.01.12, 9903.01.13,
9903.01.14, and 9903.01.15” and inserting “described in headings
9903.01.11, 9903.01.12, 9903.01.13, 9903.01.14, 9903.01.15 and
9903.01.16” in lieu thereof.

\(c\) Note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is modified by
inserting new subdivision (m) in alphabetical order:  
“(m) For the purposes of heading 9903.01.16, products of Canada that do
not qualify as originating under the United States-Canada-Mexico Free
Trade Agreement (USMCA) and are determined by U.S. Customs and Border
Protection (“CBP”) to have been transshipped to evade applicable duties
provided for by headings 9903.01.10, 9903.01.13, or 9903.01.15 shall be
subject to an additional 40% ad valorem rate of duty in lieu of the
additional rate of duty provided for in headings 9903.01.10, 9903.01.13,
or 9903.01.15. Heading 9903.01.16 does not apply to products described
in headings 9903.01.11, 9903.01.12, and 9903.01.14, or products for
personal use included in accompanied baggage of persons arriving in the
United States. Notwithstanding U.S. note 1 to this subchapter, all
products of Canada that are subject to the additional ad valorem rate of
duty imposed by heading 9903.01.16 shall also be subject to the general
rates of duty imposed on products of Canada entered under subheadings in
chapters 1 to 97 of the tariff schedule.

The additional duties imposed by heading 9903.01.16 apply to products of
Canada including both goods of Canada under the rules set forth in part
102, title 19 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as applicable, as well
as goods for which Canada was the last country of substantial
transformation prior to importation into the United States.  
  
Products of Canada that are eligible for temporary duty exemptions or
reductions under subchapter II to chapter 99, shall be subject to the
additional ad valorem rate of duty imposed by heading 9903.01.16.

The additional duties imposed by heading 9903.01.16 shall not apply to
goods for which entry is properly claimed under a provision of chapter
98 of the tariff schedule pursuant to applicable regulations of CBP, and
whenever CBP agrees that entry under such a provision is appropriate,
except for goods entered under heading 9802.00.80; and subheadings
9802.00.40, 9802.00.50, and 9802.00.60. For subheadings 9802.00.40,
9802.00.50, and 9802.00.60, the additional duties apply to the value of
repairs, alterations, or processing performed (in Canada), as described
in the applicable subheading. For heading 9802.00.80, the additional
duties apply to the value of the article assembled abroad (in Canada),
less the cost or value of such products of the United States, as
described.

Products of Canada that are provided for in heading 9903.01.16 shall
continue to be subject to antidumping, countervailing, or other duties,
taxes, fees, exactions and charges that apply to such products.

Products of Canada that are provided for in heading 9903.01.16 that are
otherwise eligible for the administrative exemption from duty and
certain taxes at 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C) — known as the “de minimis”
exemption – may continue to qualify for the exemption, but the de
minimis exemption shall cease to be available for such articles upon
notification by the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the
Secretary of the Treasury, to the President that adequate systems are in
place to fully and expediently process and collect tariff revenue
applicable for covered articles otherwise eligible for the de minimis
exemption.  
(d) The HTSUS is modified as follows, to implement this provision: (i)
by inserting the following new heading 9903.01.16  in numerical
sequence, with the material in the new heading inserted in the columns
of the HTSUS labeled “Heading/Subheading”, “Article Description”, “Rates
of Duty 1—General”, “Rates of Duty 1—Special” and “Rates of Duty 2”,
respectively:
