title: Accelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section </span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy and Purpose</span>.  My
Administration has inaugurated a golden age for American manufacturing
and technological dominance.  We will pursue bold, large-scale
industrial plans to vault the United States further into the lead on
critical manufacturing processes and technologies that are essential to
national security, economic prosperity, and scientific leadership. 
These plans include artificial intelligence (AI) data centers and
infrastructure that powers them, including high‑voltage transmission
lines and other equipment.  It will be a priority of my Administration
to facilitate the rapid and efficient buildout of this infrastructure by
easing Federal regulatory burdens. 

In addition, my Administration will utilize federally owned land and
resources for the expeditious and orderly development of data centers. 
This usage will be done in a manner consistent with the land’s intended
purpose — to be used in service of the prosperity and security of the
American people.

100 megawatts (MW) of new load dedicated to AI inference, training,
simulation, or synthetic data generation.

\(b\)  “Covered Components” means materials, products, and
infrastructure that are required to build Data Center Projects or
otherwise upon which Data Center Projects depend, including:

\(i\)    energy infrastructure, such as transmission lines, natural gas
pipelines or laterals, substations, switchyards, transformers,
switchgear, and system protective facilities;

\(ii\)   natural gas turbines, coal power equipment, nuclear power
equipment, geothermal power equipment, and any other dispatchable
baseload energy sources, including electrical infrastructure (including
backup power supply) constructed or otherwise used principally to serve
a Data Center Project;

\(iii\)  semiconductors and semiconductor materials, such as wafers,
dies, and packaged integrated circuits;

\(iv\)   networking equipment, such as switches and routers; and

\(v\)    data storage, such as hardware storage systems, software for
data management and protection, and integrated services that work with
public cloud providers.

\(c\)  “Covered Component Project” means infrastructure comprising
Covered Components, or a facility with the primary purposes of
manufacturing or otherwise producing Covered Components.

\(d\)  “Qualifying Project” means:

\(i\)    a Data Center Project or Covered Component Project for which
the Project Sponsor has committed at least $500 million in capital
expenditures as determined by the Secretary of Commerce;

\(ii\)   a Data Center Project or Covered Component Project involving an
incremental electric load addition of greater than 100 MW;

\(iii\)  a Data Center Project or Covered Component Project that
protects national security; or

\(iv\)   a Data Center Project or Covered Component Project that has
otherwise been designated by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of
the Interior, the Secretary of Commerce, or the Secretary of Energy as a
“Qualifying Project”.

\(e\)  “Project Sponsor” means the lead sponsor providing financial and
other support for a Data Center Project or Covered Component Project, as
determined by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior,
the Secretary of Commerce, or the Secretary of Energy, as appropriate.

\(f\)  “Superfund Site” means any site where action is being taken
pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 9604, 9606, or 9620.

 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Encouraging Qualifying
Projects</span>.  The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the
Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and other
relevant executive departments and agencies (agencies), shall launch an
initiative to provide financial support for Qualifying Projects, which
could include loans and loan guarantees, grants, tax incentives, and
offtake agreements.  All relevant agencies shall identify and submit to
the Director of OSTP any such relevant existing financial support that
can be used to assist Qualifying Projects, consistent with the
protection of national security.

 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Revocation of Executive Order
14141</span>.  Executive Order 14141 of January 14, 2025 (Advancing
United States Leadership in Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure), is
hereby revoked.

Reviews</span>.  (a)  Within 10 days of the date of this order, each
relevant agency shall identify to the Council on Environmental Quality
any categorical exclusions already established or adopted by such agency
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), reliance on
and adoption of which by agencies (pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 4336 and 4336c)
could facilitate the construction of Qualifying Projects.

\(b\)  The Council on Environmental Quality shall coordinate with
relevant agencies on the establishment of new categorical exclusions to
cover actions related to Qualifying Projects that normally do not have a
significant effect on the human environment.  Agencies shall, for
purposes of establishing these categorical exclusions, rely on any
sufficient basis to do so as each such agency determines.

\(c\)  Consistent with 42 U.S.C. 4336e(10)(B)(iii), loans, loan
guarantees, grants, tax incentives, or other forms of Federal financial
assistance for which an agency lacks substantial project-specific
control and responsibility over the subsequent use of such financial
assistance shall not be considered a “major Federal action” under NEPA.
 For purposes of this order, Federal financial assistance representing
less than 50 percent of total project costs shall be presumed not to
constitute substantial Federal control and responsibility.

 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Efficiency and Transparency
Through FAST‑41</span>.  (a)  The Executive Director (Executive
Director) of the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (FPISC)
may, within 30  days of the date that a project is identified to FPISC
by a relevant agency, designate a Qualifying Project as a transparency
project pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 4370m-2(b)(2)(A)(iii) and section 41003 of
the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (Public Law 114-94, 129

notification, the Executive Director may publish Qualifying Projects on
the Permitting Dashboard established under section 41003(b) of FAST-41,
including schedules for expedited review. 

\(b\)  In consultation with Project Sponsors, the Executive Director
shall expedite the transition of eligible Qualifying Projects from
transparency projects to FAST-41 “covered projects” as defined by 42
U.S.C. 4370m(6)(A).  To the extent that a Qualifying Project does not
meet the criteria set forth in 42 U.S.C. 4370m(6)(A)(i) or (iii), FPISC
may consider all other available options to designate the project a
covered project under 42 U.S.C. 4370m(6)(A)(iv).

Protection Agency shall develop guidance to help expedite environmental
reviews for qualified reuse and assist State governments and private
parties to return such Brownfield Sites and Superfund Sites to
productive use as expeditiously as possible.

process described in the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531-1544)
(ESA), shall initiate consultation under section 7 of the ESA with the
Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Commerce, or both with
respect to common construction activities for Qualifying Projects that
will occur over the next 10 years at a programmatic level.  The

in consultation with the Department of Commerce as to the Project
Sponsors to which relevant authorizations shall be granted, offer
appropriate authorizations for sites identified by the Secretary of the
Interior or the Secretary of Energy, as applicable and appropriate for
the relevant uses, consistent with 42 U.S.C. 2201, 42 U.S.C. 7256, 43
