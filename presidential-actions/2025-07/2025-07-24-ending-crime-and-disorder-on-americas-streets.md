title: "Ending Crime and Disorder on America\u2019s Streets"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose and Policy</span>. 
Endemic vagrancy, disorderly behavior, sudden confrontations, and
violent attacks have made our cities unsafe.  The number of individuals
living on the streets in the United States on a single night during the
last year of the previous administration — 274,224 — was the highest
ever recorded.  The overwhelming majority of these individuals are
addicted to drugs, have a mental health condition, or both.  Nearly
two-thirds of homeless individuals report having regularly used hard
drugs like methamphetamines, cocaine, or opioids in their lifetimes.  An
equally large share of homeless individuals reported suffering from
mental health conditions.  The Federal Government and the States have
spent tens of billions of dollars on failed programs that address
homelessness but not its root causes, leaving other citizens vulnerable
to public safety threats.

Shifting homeless individuals into long-term institutional settings for
humane treatment through the appropriate use of civil commitment will
restore public order.  Surrendering our cities and citizens to disorder
and fear is neither compassionate to the homeless nor other citizens. 
My Administration will take a new approach focused on protecting public
safety.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Restoring Civil
Commitment</span>.  (a)  The Attorney General, in consultation with the
Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall take appropriate action
to:

\(i\)   seek, in appropriate cases, the reversal of Federal or State
judicial precedents and the termination of consent decrees that impede
the United States’ policy of encouraging civil commitment of individuals
with mental illness who pose risks to themselves or the public or are
living on the streets and cannot care for themselves in appropriate
facilities for appropriate periods of time; and

\(ii\)  provide assistance to State and local governments, through
technical guidance, grants, or other legally available means, for the
identification, adoption, and implementation of maximally flexible civil
commitment, institutional treatment, and “step-down” treatment standards
that allow for the appropriate commitment and treatment of individuals
with mental illness who pose a danger to others or are living on the
streets and cannot care for themselves.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Fighting Vagrancy on America’s
Streets</span>.  (a)  The Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and
Human Services, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and the
Secretary of Transportation shall take immediate steps to assess their
discretionary grant programs and determine whether priority for those
grants may be given to grantees in States and municipalities that
actively meet the below criteria, to the maximum extent permitted by
law:

\(i\)    enforce prohibitions on open illicit drug use;

\(ii\)   enforce prohibitions on urban camping and loitering;

\(iii\)  enforce prohibitions on urban squatting;

\(iv\)   enforce, and where necessary, adopt, standards that address
individuals who are a danger to themselves or others and suffer from
serious mental illness or substance use disorder, or who are living on
the streets and cannot care for themselves, through assisted outpatient
treatment or by moving them into treatment centers or other appropriate
facilities via civil commitment or other available means, to the maximum
extent permitted by law; or

(v)    substantially implement and comply with, to the extent required,
the registration and notification obligations of the Sex Offender
Registry and Notification Act, particularly in the case of registered
sex offenders with no fixed address, including by adequately mapping and
checking the location of homeless sex offenders.

\(b\)  The Attorney General shall:

\(i\)    ensure that homeless individuals arrested for Federal crimes
are evaluated, consistent with 18 U.S.C. 4248, to determine whether they
are sexually dangerous persons and certified accordingly for civil
commitment;

(ii)   take all necessary steps to ensure the availability of funds
under the Emergency Federal Law Enforcement Assistance program to
support, as consistent with 34 U.S.C. 50101 *et seq*., encampment
removal efforts in areas for which public safety is at risk and State
and local resources are inadequate;

\(iii\)  assess Federal resources to determine whether they may be
directed toward ensuring, to the extent permitted by law, that detainees
with serious mental illness are not released into the public because of
a lack of forensic bed capacity at appropriate local, State, and Federal
jails or hospitals; and

\(iv\)   enhance requirements that prisons and residential reentry
centers that are under the authority of the Attorney General or receive
funding from the Attorney General require in-custody housing release
plans and, to the maximum extent practicable, require individuals to
comply.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Redirecting Federal Resources
Toward Effective Methods of Addressing Homelessness</span>.  (a)  The
Secretary of Health and Human Services shall take appropriate action to:

(i)    ensure that discretionary grants issued by the Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration for substance use disorder
prevention, treatment, and recovery fund evidence-based programs and do
not fund programs that fail to achieve adequate outcomes, including
so-called “harm reduction” or “safe consumption” efforts that only
facilitate illegal drug use and its attendant harm;

\(ii\)   provide technical assistance to assisted outpatient treatment
programs for individuals with serious mental illness or addiction during
and after the civil commitment process focused on shifting such
individuals off of the streets and public programs and into private
housing and support networks; and

\(iii\)  ensure that Federal funds for Federally Qualified Health
Centers and Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics reduce rather
than promote homelessness by supporting, to the maximum extent permitted
by law, comprehensive services for individuals with serious mental
illness and substance use disorder, including crisis intervention
services.

\(b\)  The Attorney General shall prioritize available funding to
support the expansion of drug courts and mental health courts for
individuals for which such diversion serves public safety.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Increasing Accountability and
Safety in America’s Homelessness Programs</span>.  (a)  The Secretary of
Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development shall take appropriate actions to increase accountability in
their provision of, and grants awarded for, homelessness assistance and
transitional living programs.  These actions shall include, to the
extent permitted by law, ending support for “housing first” policies
that deprioritize accountability and fail to promote treatment,
recovery, and self-sufficiency; increasing competition among grantees
through broadening the applicant pool; and holding grantees to higher
standards of effectiveness in reducing homelessness and increasing
public safety.  

(b)  The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall, as
appropriate, take steps to require recipients of Federal housing and
homelessness assistance to increase requirements that persons
participating in the recipients’ programs who suffer from substance use
disorder or serious mental illness use substance abuse treatment or
mental health services as a condition of participation.

\(c\)  With respect to recipients of Federal housing and homelessness
assistance that operate drug injection sites or “safe consumption
sites,” knowingly distribute drug paraphernalia, or permit the use or
distribution of illicit drugs on property under their control:

(i)   the Attorney General shall review whether such recipients are in
violation of Federal law, including 21 U.S.C. 856, and bring civil or
criminal actions in appropriate cases; and

(ii)  the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in coordination
with the Attorney General, shall review whether such recipients are in
violation of the terms of the programs pursuant to which they receive
Federal housing and homelessness assistance and freeze their assistance
as appropriate.

\(d\)  The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall take
appropriate measures and revise regulations as necessary to allow, where
permissible under applicable law, federally funded programs to
exclusively house women and children and to stop sex offenders who
receive homelessness assistance through such programs from being housed
with unrelated children. 

\(e\)  The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in consultation
with the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human
Services, shall, as appropriate and to the extent permitted by law:

\(i\)   allow or require the recipients of Federal funding for
homelessness assistance to collect health-related information that the
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development identifies as necessary to
the effective and efficient operation of the funding program from all
persons to whom such assistance is provided; and

\(ii\)  require those funding recipients to share such data with law
enforcement authorities in circumstances permitted by law and to use the
collected health data to provide appropriate medical care to individuals
with mental health diagnoses or to connect individuals to public health
resources.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. 
(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

\(i\)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or
agency, or the head thereof; or

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

\(d\)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
