title: Creating Schedule G in the Excepted Service
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including sections 3301, 3302, and
7511 of title 5, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  The Congress
has recognized that effective Government administration requires
excepting some positions from the competitive service based on their
confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating
character.  Existing excepted service schedules make partial use of this
authority.  Schedule C of the excepted service authorizes appointments
to noncareer excepted service positions of a confidential or
policy-determining character.  Schedule Policy/Career of the excepted
service authorizes appointments to career positions of a confidential,
policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character.  

There is, however, no excepted service schedule for noncareer positions
of a policy-making or policy-advocating character.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C.
3302(1), conditions of good administration, including eliminating this
gap in excepted service schedules and improving the operations of the
Department of Veterans Affairs, make necessary creating a new Schedule G
in the excepted service for noncareer positions of a policy-making or
policy-advocating character.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Definition</span>.  The phrase
“normally subject to change as a result of a Presidential transition”
refers to positions whose occupants are, as a matter of practice,
expected to resign upon a Presidential transition and includes all
positions whose appointment requires the assent of the White House
Office of Presidential Personnel.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Excepted Service</span>.
 Appointments of individuals to positions of a policy-making or
policy-advocating character normally subject to change as a result of a
Presidential transition shall be made under Schedule G of the excepted
service, as established by section 4 of this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Schedule G</span>.  Civil
Service Rule VI is amended as follows:

\(a\)  5 CFR 6.2 is amended to read:

“OPM shall list positions that it excepts from the competitive service
in Schedules A, B, C, D, E, Policy/Career, and G, which schedules shall
constitute parts of this rule, as follows:

Schedule A.  Positions other than those of a confidential or
policy-determining character for which it is not practicable to examine
shall be listed in Schedule A.

Schedule B.  Positions other than those of a confidential or
policy-determining character for which it is not practicable to hold a
competitive examination shall be listed in Schedule B.  Appointments to
these positions shall be subject to such noncompetitive examination as
may be prescribed by OPM.

Schedule C.  Positions of a confidential or policy-determining character
normally subject to change as a result of a Presidential transition
shall be listed in Schedule C.

Schedule D.  Positions other than those of a confidential or
policy-determining character for which the competitive service
requirements make impracticable the adequate recruitment of sufficient
numbers of students attending qualifying educational institutions or
individuals who have recently completed qualifying educational programs.
 These positions, which are temporarily placed in the excepted service
to enable more effective recruitment from all segments of society by
using means of recruiting and assessing candidates that diverge from the
rules generally applicable to the competitive service, shall be listed
in Schedule D.

Schedule E.  Positions of administrative law judge appointed under 5
U.S.C. 3105 shall be listed in Schedule E.  Conditions of good
administration warrant that the position of administrative law judge be
placed in the excepted service and that appointment to this position not
be subject to the requirements of 5 CFR, part 302, including examination
and rating requirements, though each agency shall follow the principle
of veteran preference as far as administratively feasible.

Schedule Policy/Career.  Career positions of a confidential,
policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character not
normally subject to change as a result of a Presidential transition
shall be listed in Schedule Policy/Career.  In appointing an individual
to a position in Schedule Policy/Career, each agency shall follow the
principle of veteran preference as far as administratively feasible.

Schedule G.  Positions of a policy-making or policy-advocating character
normally subject to change as a result of a Presidential transition
shall be listed in Schedule G.”

\(b\)  5 CFR 6.4 is amended to read:

“Except as required by statute, the Civil Service Rules and Regulations
shall not apply to removals from positions listed in Schedules A, C, D,
E, Policy/Career, or G, or from positions excepted from the competitive
service by statute.  The Civil Service Rules and Regulations shall apply
to removals from positions listed in Schedule B of persons who have
competitive status.”

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Implementation</span>.  (a)
 The Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall adopt such
regulations as the Director determines may be necessary to implement
this order, giving particular attention to appropriate amendments to 5
CFR, part 213.

\(b\)  In making appointments to positions in Schedule G of the excepted
service, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs:

\(i\)   shall consider whether prospective appointees would be suitable
exponents of the President’s policies; and

\(ii\)  shall not take into account prospective appointees’ political
affiliation or political activity.

Sec. 6.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be
construed to impair or otherwise affect:

\(i\)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or
agency, or the head thereof; or

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

\(c\)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

     (d)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Office of Personnel Management.

DONALD J. TRUMP

THE WHITE HOUSE,

    July 17, 2025.
