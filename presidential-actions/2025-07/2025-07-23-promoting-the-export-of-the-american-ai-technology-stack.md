title: Promoting The Export of the American AI Technology Stack
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3,
United States Code, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  Artificial
intelligence (AI) is a foundational technology that will define the
future of economic growth, national security, and global competitiveness
for decades to come.  The United States must not only lead in developing
general-purpose and frontier AI capabilities, but also ensure that
American AI technologies, standards, and governance models are adopted
worldwide to strengthen relationships with our allies and secure our
continued technological dominance.  This order establishes a coordinated
national effort to support the American AI industry by promoting the
export of full-stack American AI technology packages.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of the United States to preserve and extend American leadership
in AI and decrease international dependence on AI technologies developed
by our adversaries by supporting the global deployment of United
States-origin AI technologies.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Establishment of the American
AI Exports Program</span>.  (a)  Within 90 days of the date of this
order, the Secretary of Commerce shall, in consultation with the
Secretary of State and the Director of the Office of Science and
Technology Policy (OSTP), establish and implement the American AI
Exports Program (Program) to support the development and deployment of
United States full-stack AI export packages.

\(b\)  The Secretary of Commerce shall issue a public call for proposals
from industry-led consortia for inclusion in the Program.  The public
call shall require that each proposal must:

(i)    include a full-stack AI technology package, which encompasses:

\(A\)  AI-optimized computer hardware (e.g., chips, servers, and
accelerators), data center storage, cloud services, and networking, as
well as a description of whether and to what extent such items are
manufactured in the United States;

\(B\)  data pipelines and labeling systems;

\(C\)  AI models and systems;

\(D\)  measures to ensure the security and cybersecurity of AI models
and systems; and

\(E\)  AI applications for specific use cases (e.g., software
engineering, education, healthcare, agriculture, or transportation);

(ii)   identify specific target countries or regional blocs for export
engagement;

\(iii\)  describe a business and operational model to explain, at a high
level, which entities will build, own, and operate data centers and
associated infrastructure;

(iv)   detail requested Federal incentives and support mechanisms; and

\(v\)    comply with all relevant United States export control regimes,
outbound investment regulations, and end-user policies, including
chapter 58 of title 50, United States Code, and relevant guidance from
the Bureau of Industry and Security within the Department of Commerce.

\(c\)  The Department of Commerce shall require proposals to be
submitted no later than 90 days after the public call for proposals is
issued, and shall consider proposals on a rolling basis for inclusion in
the Program.

\(d\)  The Secretary of Commerce shall, in consultation with the
Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Energy,
and the Director of OSTP, evaluate submitted proposals for inclusion
under the Program.  Proposals selected by the Secretary of Commerce, in
consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the
Secretary of Energy, and the Director of OSTP, will be designated as
priority AI export packages and will be supported through priority
access to the tools identified in section 4 of this order, as consistent
with applicable law.

Commerce and the United States Trade Representative, and as described in
section 708 of the Championing American Business Through Diplomacy Act
of 2019 (Title VII of Division J of Public Law 116-94) (CABDA), shall

regulatory, data, and infrastructure environments conducive to the

and regulatory measures that may impede the competitiveness of United
States offerings; and

\(vi\)   coordinating with the Small Business Administration’s Office of
Investment and Innovation to facilitate, to the extent permitted under
applicable law, investment in United States small businesses to the
development of American AI technologies and the manufacture of AI

by law, available Federal tools to support the priority export packages
selected for participation in the Program, including direct loans and
loan guarantees (12  U.S.C. 635); equity investments, co-financing,
