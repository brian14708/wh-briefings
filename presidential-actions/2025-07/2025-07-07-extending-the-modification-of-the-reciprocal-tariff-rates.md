title: Extending the Modification of the Reciprocal Tariff Rates
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) (IEEPA), the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq.*), section 604 of the
Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title
3, United States Code, I hereby determine and order:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>. 
In Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a
Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large
and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), I found that
conditions reflected in large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade
deficits constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national
security and economy of the United States that has its source in whole
or substantial part outside the United States.  I declared a national
emergency with respect to that threat, and to deal with that threat I
imposed additional* ad valorem* duties that I deemed necessary and
appropriate.  
Section 4(c) of Executive Order 14257 provides that, “\[s\]hould any
trading partner take significant steps to remedy non-reciprocal trade
arrangements and align sufficiently with the United States on economic
and national security matters, I may further modify the \[Harmonized
Tariff Schedule of the United States\] to decrease or limit in scope the
duties imposed under this order.”   
In Executive Order 14266 of April 9, 2025 (Modifying Reciprocal Tariff
Rates To Reflect Trading Partner Retaliation and Alignment), I
determined that it was necessary and appropriate to temporarily suspend,
for a period of 90 days, application of the additional *ad valorem* rate
of duties for products of the foreign trading partners listed in Annex I
to Executive Order 14257, except with respect to the People’s Republic
of China (PRC), and to instead impose on articles of all such trading
partners an additional *ad valorem* rate of duty of 10 percent, subject
to the terms of Executive Order 14257, as amended.  I made this
determination in light of the “sincere intentions” and willingness of
these trading partners to address the national and economic security
concerns of the United States.  This 90-day suspension expires at 12:01
a.m. eastern daylight time on July 9, 2025.    
I have determined, based on additional information and recommendations
from various senior officials, including information on the status of
discussions with trading partners, that it is necessary and appropriate
to extend the suspension effectuated by Executive Order 14266 until
12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 1, 2025.  With respect to the
PRC, the separate tariff suspension effectuated by Executive Order 14298
of May 12, 2025 (Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates To Reflect
Discussions With the People’s Republic of China), remains in effect and
is unaltered by this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Tariff Modifications</span>. 
The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) shall be
modified, effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or
withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern
daylight time on July 9, 2025, by suspending headings 9903.01.43 through
9903.01.62 and 9903.01.64 through 9903.01.76, and subdivisions
(v)(xiii)(1)-(9) and (11)-(57) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of
chapter 99 of the HTSUS, until 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on
August 1, 2025.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Implementation</span>.  The
Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the
United States Trade Representative, as applicable, in consultation with
the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Assistant to
the President for Economic Policy, the Senior Counselor for Trade and
Manufacturing, the Assistant to the President for National Security
Affairs, and the Chair of the International Trade Commission, are
directed and authorized to take all necessary actions to implement and
effectuate this order, consistent with applicable law, including through
temporary suspension or amendment of regulations or notices in
the *Federal Register* and by adopting rules, regulations, or guidance,
and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be
necessary to implement this order.  Each executive department and agency
shall take all appropriate measures within its authority to implement
this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">General
Provisions</span>.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to
impair or otherwise affect:  
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency,
or the head thereof; or  
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.  
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.  
(d)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Office of the United States Trade Representative.
