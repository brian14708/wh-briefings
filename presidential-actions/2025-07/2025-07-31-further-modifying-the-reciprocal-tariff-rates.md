title: Further Modifying the Reciprocal Tariff Rates
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) (IEEPA), the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq.*), section 604 of the
Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title
3, United States Code, I hereby determine and order:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.  In
Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a
Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large
and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), I found that
conditions reflected in large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade
deficits constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national
security and economy of the United States that has its source in whole
or substantial part outside the United States.  I declared a national
emergency with respect to that threat, and to deal with that threat, I
imposed additional* ad valorem* duties that I deemed necessary and
appropriate.  

I have received additional information and recommendations from various
senior officials on, among other things, the continued lack of
reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships and the impact of
foreign trading partners’ disparate tariff rates and non-tariff barriers
on U.S. exports, the domestic manufacturing base, critical supply
chains, and the defense industrial base.  I also have received
additional information and recommendations on foreign relations,
economic, and national security matters, including the status of trade
negotiations, efforts to retaliate against the United States for its
actions to address the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, and
efforts to align with the United States on economic and national
security matters.

For example, some trading partners have agreed to, or are on the verge
of agreeing to, meaningful trade and security commitments with the
United States, thus signaling their sincere intentions to permanently
remedy the trade barriers that have contributed to the national
emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, and to align with the
United States on economic and national security matters.  Other trading
partners, despite having engaged in negotiations, have offered terms
that, in my judgment, do not sufficiently address imbalances in our
trading relationship or have failed to align sufficiently with the
United States on economic and national-security matters.  There are also
some trading partners that have failed to engage in negotiations with
the United States or to take adequate steps to align sufficiently with
the United States on economic and national security matters.

After considering the information and recommendations that I have
recently received, among other things, I have determined that it is
necessary and appropriate to deal with the national emergency declared
in Executive Order 14257 by imposing additional *ad valorem* duties on
goods of certain trading partners at the rates set forth in Annex I to
this order, subject to all applicable exceptions set forth in Executive
Order 14257, as amended, in lieu of the additional *ad valorem* duties
previously imposed on goods of such trading partners in Executive Order
14257, as amended.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Tariff Modifications</span>.
 (a)  The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) shall
be modified as provided in Annex II to this order.  These modifications
shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or
withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern
daylight time 7 days after the date of this order, except that goods
loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading and in transit on the final
mode of transit before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 7 days after the
date of this order, and entered for consumption, or withdrawn from
warehouse for consumption, before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on
October 5, 2025, shall not be subject to such additional duty and shall
instead remain subject to the additional *ad valorem* duties previously
imposed in Executive Order 14257, as amended.

(b)  Certain foreign trading partners identified in Annex I to this
order have agreed to, or are on the verge of concluding, meaningful
trade and security agreements with the United States.  Goods of those
trading partners will remain subject to the additional *ad valorem*
duties provided in Annex I to this order until such time as those
agreements are concluded, and I issue subsequent orders memorializing
the terms of those agreements.

(c)  As provided in Annex I to this order, the additional *ad valorem*
rate of duty applicable to any good of the European Union is determined
by the good’s current *ad valorem* (or *ad valorem* equivalent) rate of
duty under column 1 (General) of the HTSUS (“Column 1 Duty Rate”).  For
a good of the European Union with a Column 1 Duty Rate that is less than
15 percent, the sum of its Column 1 Duty Rate and the additional *ad
valorem* rate of duty pursuant to this order shall be 15 percent.  For a
good of the European Union with a Column 1 Duty Rate that is at least
15 percent, the additional *ad valorem* rate of duty pursuant to this
order shall be zero.

\(d\)  Goods of any foreign trading partner that is not listed in Annex
I to this order will be subject to an additional *ad valorem* rate of
duty of 10 percent pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 14257, as
amended, unless otherwise expressly provided.  This rate shall be
effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn
from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight
time 7 days after the date of this order.

(e)  The HTSUS shall also be modified by continuing to suspend headings
9903.01.43 through 9903.01.62 and 9903.01.64 through 9903.01.76, and
subdivisions (v)(xiii)(1)–(9) and (11)‑(57) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter
III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS, until the effective date of the
modifications provided in Annex II to this order.  Upon the effective
date of the modifications provided in Annex II to this order, to
facilitate implementation of the rates of duty provided in Annex I to
this order, headings 9903.01.43 through 9903.01.62 and 9903.01.64
through 9903.01.76, which are organized by rate of duty, and
subdivisions (v)(xiii) (1)-(9) and (11)-(57) of U.S. note 2 to
subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS shall be terminated as to
future entries and replaced by the new trading partner-specific headings
provided in Annex II to this order.

(f)  Excluding the changes set forth in subsections (a) through (d) of
this section, the terms of Executive Order 14257, as amended, shall
continue to apply.

(g)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to alter or otherwise
affect Executive Order 14298 of May 12, 2025 (Modifying Reciprocal
Tariff Rates To Reflect Discussions With the People’s Republic of
China).

(h)  The Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade
Representative, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security,
acting through the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection
(CBP), and the Chair of the United States International Trade
Commission, shall determine whether any additional modifications to the
HTSUS are necessary to effectuate this order and may make such
modifications through notice in the *Federal Register*.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Transshipment</span>.  (a)  An
article determined by CBP to have been transshipped to evade applicable
duties under section 2 of this order shall be subject to (i) an
additional *ad valorem* rate of duty of 40 percent, in lieu of the
additional *ad valorem* rate of duty applicable under section 2 of this
order to goods of the country of origin, (ii) any other applicable or
appropriate fine or penalty, including those assessed under 19 U.S.C.
1592, and (iii) any other United States duties, fees, taxes, exactions,
or charges applicable to goods of the country of origin.  CBP shall not
allow, consistent with applicable law, for mitigation or remission of
the penalties assessed on imports found to be transshipped to evade
applicable duties.

\(b\)  The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Homeland Security,
acting through the Commissioner of CBP, in consultation with the United
States Trade Representative, shall publish every 6 months a list of
countries and specific facilities used in circumvention schemes, to
inform public procurement, national security reviews, and commercial due
diligence.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Implementation</span>.  The
Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the
United States Trade Representative, as applicable, in consultation with
the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Assistant to
the President for Economic Policy, the Assistant to the President and
Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing, the Assistant to the
President for National Security Affairs, and the Chair of the
International Trade Commission, are directed and authorized to take all
necessary actions to implement and effectuate this order, consistent
with applicable law, including through temporary suspension or amendment
of regulations or notices in the *Federal Register* and by adopting
rules, regulations, or guidance, and to employ all powers granted to the
President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to implement this order.  Each
executive department and agency shall take all appropriate measures
within its authority to implement this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Monitoring and
Recommendations</span>.  (a)  The Secretary of Commerce and the United
States Trade Representative shall monitor the circumstances involving
the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 and shall regularly
consult on such circumstances with any senior official they deem
appropriate.  The Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade
Representative shall inform me of any circumstance that, in their
opinion, might indicate the need for further action by the President. 
The Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative
shall also inform me of any circumstance that, in their opinion, might
indicate that a foreign trading partner has taken adequate steps to
address the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257.

(b)  The Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade
Representative, in consultation with any senior official they deem
appropriate, shall recommend to me any necessary additional action if
this action is not effective in resolving the emergency declared in
Executive Order 14257.

(c)  The Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade
Representative, in coordination with the appropriate senior officials,
shall recommend additional action, if necessary, should a foreign
trading partner fail to take adequate steps to address the emergency
declared in Executive Order 14257 or should a foreign trading partner
retaliate against the United States in response to the actions taken to
address the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 or any
subsequent order issued to address that emergency.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Severability</span>.  If any
provision of this order, or the application of any provision of this
order to any individual or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the
remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any
other individuals or circumstances shall not be affected.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">7</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.  (a)
 Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:

\(i\)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or
agency, or the head thereof; or

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

\(c\)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(d)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Office of the United States Trade Representative.
