title: Regulatory Relief for Certain Stationary Sources to Promote American Security
  with Respect to Sterile Medical Equipment
---
 
By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1.  The use of ethylene oxide is critical for the sterilization of
medical equipment, which protects patients against infection and the
transmission of disease.  The continued utilization of ethylene oxide by
commercial sterilization facilities is essential to ensuring that our
Nation provides its sick and injured with the best outcomes possible —
an objective that is at the forefront of the Federal Government’s
responsibility to the American people.    
2.  On April 5, 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency published a
final rule, pursuant to section 112 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C.
7412, titled *National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants:
 Ethylene Oxide Emissions Standards for Sterilization Facilities
Residual Risk and Technology Review*, 89 FR 24090 (EtO Rule).  The EtO
Rule imposes new emissions-control requirements on commercial
sterilization facilities.   
3.  The EtO Rule places severe burdens on commercial sterilization
facilities.  About 50 percent of all sterile medical devices in the
United States are sterilized with ethylene oxide, and sterilization with
ethylene oxide may be the only method of sterilizing many medical
devices without damaging them.  By requiring compliance with standards
premised on the application of emissions-control technologies that do
not exist in a commercially viable form, the EtO Rule risks making
critical sterile medical devices unavailable to care for patients in our
civilian and military medical systems.  The current compliance timeline
as set forth at 89 FR 24101-24103 of the EtO Rule will likely force
existing sterilization facilities to close down, seriously disrupting
the supply of medical equipment.  Our Nation would be unable to
adequately supply the sterilized medical equipment that medical
personnel need to safely treat their patients in hospitals, operating
rooms, and other medical facilities.  In short, the current compliance
timeline would undermine our national security.  
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws
of the United States, including section 112(i)(4) of the Clean Air Act,
42 U.S.C. 7412(i)(4), do hereby proclaim that certain stationary sources
subject to the EtO Rule, as identified in Annex I of this proclamation,
are exempt from compliance with the EtO Rule for a period of 2 years
beyond the EtO Rule’s relevant compliance dates (Exemption).  This
Exemption applies to all compliance deadlines established under the EtO
Rule applicable to the stationary sources listed in Annex I, with each
such deadline extended by 2 years from the date originally required for
such deadline.  The effect of this Exemption is that, during each such
2-year period, these stationary sources will remain subject to the
emissions and compliance obligations in effect prior to the issuance of
the EtO Rule.  In support of this Exemption, I hereby make the following
determinations:

The technology to implement the EtO Rule is not available.  Such
technology does not exist in a commercially viable form sufficient to
allow implementation of and compliance with the EtO Rule
by the compliance dates set forth in the EtO Rule.

It is in the national security interests of the United States to issue
this Exemption for the reasons stated in paragraphs 1 and 3 of this
proclamation.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
seventeenth day of July, in the year of our Lord
two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States
of America the two hundred and fiftieth.  
  
  
  
                               DONALD J. TRUMP
