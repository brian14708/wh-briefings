title: "Establishing the President\u2019s Make America Beautiful Again Commission"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>*.*  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.
 The United States is blessed with vast beautiful landscapes, abundant
natural resources, and a rich heritage of discovery by travelers and
outdoorsmen.  America’s national parks, forests, waterways, and public
lands have inspired generations and kindled our Nation’s spirit of
exploration.  To ensure that the next generation of Americans inherits
this same sense of duty and adventure, my Administration will prioritize
conserving our great American national parks and outdoor recreation
areas.

Years of mismanagement, regulatory overreach, and neglect of routine
maintenance require action.  Land-use restrictions have stripped
hunters, fishers, hikers, and outdoorsmen of access to public lands that
belong to them.  These bureaucratic restrictions have undermined outdoor
traditions and threatened conservation funding.  The National Park
Service and the United States Forest Service face more than $23 billion
and $10.8 billion in deferred maintenance, respectively, leaving roads,
trails, and historic landmarks in disrepair.  Despite these challenges,
our Nation has proven that conservation and economic growth go hand in
hand.  Since the signing of the Great American Outdoors Act (Public Law
116-152), the outdoor recreation economy has grown to $1.2 trillion in
economic output, and, in 2023, comprised 3.1 percent of employees in the
United States and supported 5 million jobs.

Through both innovation and commonsense policies, America can preserve
its natural beauty and expand outdoor recreation opportunities for
future generations.  It is the policy of my Administration to prioritize
responsible conservation, restore our lands and waters, and protect our
Nation’s outdoor heritage for the enjoyment of the American people.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Policies</span>. All
Federal land management agencies, as defined by 16 U.S.C. 6801(3),

driving economic growth;

\(b\)  expand access to public lands and waters for recreation, hunting,
and fishing;

\(c\)  encourage responsible, voluntary conservation efforts;

\(d\)  cut bureaucratic delays that hinder effective environmental
management; and

\(e\)  recover America’s fish and wildlife populations through
proactive, voluntary, on-the-ground collaborative conservation efforts.
