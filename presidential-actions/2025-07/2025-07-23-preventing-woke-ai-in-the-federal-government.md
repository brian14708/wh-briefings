title: Preventing Woke AI in the Federal Government
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  Artificial
intelligence (AI) will play a critical role in how Americans of all ages
learn new skills, consume information, and navigate their daily lives. 
Americans will require reliable outputs from AI, but when ideological
biases or social agendas are built into AI models, they can distort the
quality and accuracy of the output. 

One of the most pervasive and destructive of these ideologies is
so-called “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI).  In the AI context,
DEI includes the suppression or distortion of factual information about
race or sex; manipulation of racial or sexual representation in model
outputs; incorporation of concepts like critical race theory,
transgenderism, unconscious bias, intersectionality, and systemic
racism; and discrimination on the basis of race or sex.  DEI displaces
the commitment to truth in favor of preferred outcomes and, as recent
history illustrates, poses an existential threat to reliable AI.

For example, one major AI model changed the race or sex of historical
figures — including the Pope, the Founding Fathers, and Vikings — when
prompted for images because it was trained to prioritize DEI
requirements at the cost of accuracy.  Another AI model refused to
produce images celebrating the achievements of white people, even while
complying with the same request for people of other races.  In yet
another case, an AI model asserted that a user should not “misgender”
another person even if necessary to stop a nuclear apocalypse. 

While the Federal Government should be hesitant to regulate the
functionality of AI models in the private marketplace, in the context of
Federal procurement, it has the obligation not to procure models that
sacrifice truthfulness and accuracy to ideological agendas.  Building on
Executive Order 13960 of December 3, 2020 (Promoting the Use of
Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in the Federal Government), this
order helps fulfill that obligation in the context of large language
models.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Definitions</span>.  For
purposes of this order:

(a)  The term “agency” means an executive department, a military
department, or any independent establishment within the meaning of 5
U.S.C. 101, 102, and 104(1), respectively, and any wholly owned
Government corporation within the meaning of 31 U.S.C. 9101.

\(b\)  The term “agency head” means the highest-ranking

official or officials of an agency, such as the Secretary,
Administrator, Chairman, Director, Commissioners, or Board of Directors.

\(c\)  The term “LLM” means a large language model, which is a
generative AI model trained on vast, diverse datasets that enable the
model to generate natural-language responses to user prompts.

\(d\)  The term “national security system” has the same meaning as in 44
U.S.C. 3552(b)(6).

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Unbiased AI
Principles</span>.  It is the policy of the United States to promote the
innovation and use of trustworthy AI.  To advance that policy, agency
heads shall, consistent with applicable law and in consideration of
guidance issued pursuant to section 4 of this order, procure only those
LLMs developed in accordance with the following two principles (Unbiased
AI Principles): 

(a)  Truth-seeking.  LLMs shall be truthful in responding to user
prompts seeking factual information or analysis.  LLMs shall prioritize
historical accuracy, scientific inquiry, and objectivity, and shall
acknowledge uncertainty where reliable information is incomplete or
contradictory. 

(b)  Ideological Neutrality.  LLMs shall be neutral, nonpartisan tools
that do not manipulate responses in favor of ideological dogmas such as
DEI.  Developers shall not intentionally encode partisan or ideological
judgments into an LLM’s outputs unless those judgments are prompted by
or otherwise readily accessible to the end user. 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Implementation</span>.  (a)
 Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Director of the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB), in consultation with the Administrator
for Federal Procurement Policy, the Administrator of General Services,
and the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, shall
issue guidance to agencies to implement section 3 of this order.  That
guidance shall:

\(i\)    account for technical limitations in complying with this order;

\(ii\)   permit vendors to comply with the requirement in the second
Unbiased AI Principle to be transparent about ideological judgments
through disclosure of the LLM’s system prompt, specifications,
evaluations, or other relevant documentation, and avoid requiring
disclosure of specific model weights or other sensitive technical data
where practicable;

\(iii\)  avoid over-prescription and afford latitude for vendors to
comply with the Unbiased AI Principles and take different approaches to
innovation;

\(iv\)   specify factors for agency heads to consider in determining
whether to apply the Unbiased AI Principles to LLMs developed by the
agencies and to AI models other than LLMs; and

\(v\)    make exceptions as appropriate for the use of LLMs in national
security systems.

(b)  Each agency head shall, to the maximum extent consistent with
applicable law:

\(i\)    include in each Federal contract for an LLM entered into
following the date of the OMB guidance issued under subsection (a) of
this section terms requiring that the procured LLM comply with the
Unbiased AI Principles and providing that decommissioning costs shall be
charged to the vendor in the event of termination by the agency for the
vendor’s noncompliance with the contract following a reasonable period
to cure;

\(ii\)   to the extent practicable and consistent with contract terms,
revise existing contracts for LLMs to include the terms specified in
subsection (b)(i) of this section; and

\(iii\)  within 90 days of the OMB guidance issued under subsection (a)
of this section, adopt procedures to ensure that LLMs procured by the
agency comply with the Unbiased AI Principles.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.  (a)
 Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:

(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

\(c\)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

\(d\)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
General Services Administration.

THE WHITE HOUSE,
