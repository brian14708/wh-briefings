title: Regulatory Relief for Certain Stationary Sources to Promote American Iron Ore
  Processing Security
---
 
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

     1.  Taconite iron ore processing is fundamental to the United
States’ steel production and manufacturing sectors.  The facilities
involved in the process supply essential raw materials used to make
steel, which is used in national defense systems, critical
infrastructure, and a broad range of industrial applications.
 Preserving and enhancing domestic taconite processing capabilities is
vital to reducing reliance on foreign sources and ensuring resilience of
American industrial supply chains.  
     2.  On March 6, 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency published
a final rule, pursuant to section 112 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C.
7412, titled *National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants:
Taconite Iron Ore Processing*, 89 FR 16408 (Taconite Rule).  The
Taconite Rule imposes new emissions-control requirements on taconite
iron ore processing facilities.  
     3.  The Taconite Rule places significant burdens on a sector
critical to the Nation’s industrial foundation.  The Taconite Rule
mandates compliance with standards that rely on emissions-control
technologies that have not been demonstrated to work in the taconite
industry, are untested at commercial scale, or are not reasonably
achievable under current operational conditions.  If enforced under the
current timeline as set forth at 89 FR 16408, the Taconite Rule risks
forcing shutdowns, reducing domestic production, and undermining the
Nation’s ability to supply steel for defense, energy, and critical
manufacturing.  The United States must not allow inflexible regulatory
deadlines to jeopardize a material critical to our industrial base.
 Maintaining this capacity is essential to our national security and
economic resilience.  
     NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States
of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States, including section 112(i)(4) of the Clean Air
Act, 42 U.S.C. 7412(i)(4), do hereby proclaim that certain stationary
sources subject to the Taconite Rule, as identified in Annex I of this
proclamation, are exempt from compliance with the Taconite Rule for a
period of 2 years beyond the Taconite Rule’s relevant compliance dates
(Exemption).The technology to implement the Taconite Rule is not
currently available, and it is necessary to issue this Exemption now
because long design, permitting, and construction lead times mean that
regulated entities will not be able to meet the relevant compliance
deadlines absent compliance relief.This Exemption applies to all
compliance deadlines established under the Taconite Rule, with each such
deadline extended by 2 years from the date originally required for such
deadline.The effect of this Exemption is that, during each such 2-year
period, these stationary sources are subject to the emissions and
compliance obligations that they are currently subject to under the
applicable standard as that standard existed prior to the Taconite
Rule.In support of this Exemption, I hereby make the following
determinations:  
     a.  The technology to implement the Taconite Rule is not available.
 Such technology does not exist in a commercially viable form sufficient
to allow implementation of and compliance with the Taconite Rule by the
compliance dates in the Taconite Rule.  
     b.  It is in the national security interests of the United States
to issue this Exemption for the reasons stated in paragraphs 1 and 3 of
this proclamation.  
    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
seventeenth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand
twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the
two hundred and fiftieth.  
  
  
                        DONALD J. TRUMP
