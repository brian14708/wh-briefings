By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the

 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Revocation</span>.  Executive
Order 13824 of February 26, 2018 (President’s Council on Sports,
Fitness, and Nutrition), is hereby revoked.  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Amendment</span>.  Executive
Order 13265 of June 6, 2002 (President’s Council on Physical Fitness and
Sports), is hereby amended as follows:  
(a) The title is revised to read as follows:  “President’s Council on
Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition, and the Reestablishment of the
Presidential Fitness Test”.  
(b) The preamble is revised to read as follows:  “By the authority
vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United
States of America, and to establish the President’s Council on Sports,
Fitness, and Nutrition, and to reestablish the Presidential Fitness
Test, it is hereby ordered:”.  
(c) Sections 1 through 5 are revised to read as follows:    
“<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  As the United
States prepares to celebrate its semiquincentennial anniversary in 2026,
we must address the threat to the vitality and longevity of our country
that is posed by America’s declining health and physical fitness.  For
far too long, the physical and mental health of the American people has
been neglected.  Rates of obesity, chronic disease, inactivity, and poor
nutrition are at crisis levels, particularly among our children.  These
trends weaken our economy, military readiness, academic performance, and
national morale.  President Eisenhower recognized this issue when he
created the President’s Council on Youth Fitness in response to reports
on the poor state of youth fitness in America.  As President-elect, John
F. Kennedy famously published an essay titled “The Soft American,” which
outlined the imperative for improved health in order to maintain a
strong and vital America.  During my first term, I renamed the council
the “President’s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition” and directed
the development of a National Youth Sports Strategy, among other
activities.       
My Administration has taken decisive action to reverse this health
crisis.  In the first month of my second term, I created the President’s
Make America Healthy Again Commission to restore the urgency of
improving the health of Americans.  Now, we build further.  To advance
this commitment, I hereby reestablish the Presidential Fitness Test,
which shall be administered by the Secretary of Health and Human
Services with the support of the Secretary of Education.  
With this order, I revitalize the President’s Council on Sports,
Fitness, and Nutrition as a cornerstone of our national health renewal.
 In 2026, we will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our great Nation,
honor the 70th anniversary of the original President’s Council on Youth
Fitness, and showcase America’s continued global dominance in sports.
 Over the next 3 years, America will host the Ryder Cup, the President’s
Cup, the FIFA World Cup, and the Olympic Games — the world’s premiere
sporting competitions.  These events will provide inspiration for all
generations of Americans.  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.**  **<span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.
 It is the policy of my Administration to:  
(a) prioritize and expand children’s participation in youth sports and
active play;  
(b) promote the physical, mental, and civic benefits of daily movement,
exercise, and good nutrition; and       
(c)  engage every sector — public and private, civilian and military —
in creating a national culture of strength, vitality, and excellence.
