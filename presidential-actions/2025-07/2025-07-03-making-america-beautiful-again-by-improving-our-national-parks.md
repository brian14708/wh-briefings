title: Making America Beautiful Again by Improving Our National Parks
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  From the
awe-inspiring Grand Canyon to the tranquility of the Great Smoky
Mountains, America’s national parks have provided generations of
American families with unforgettable memories.  It is the policy of my
Administration to preserve these opportunities for American families in
future generations by increasing entry fees for foreign tourists,
improving affordability for United States residents, and expanding
opportunities to enjoy America’s splendid national treasures.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Making America Beautiful Again
by Improving Our National Parks</span>.  (a)  The Secretary of the
Interior shall develop a strategy to increase revenue and improve the
recreational experience at national parks by appropriately increasing
entrance fees and recreation pass fees for nonresidents in areas of the
National Park System that charge entrance fees or recreation pass fees
as defined in 16 U.S.C. 6801.  Additionally, to the extent consistent
with applicable law, the Secretary of the Interior, working with the
Secretary of Agriculture as appropriate, shall take steps to increase
the prices at which the America the Beautiful Pass — the National Parks
and Federal Recreational Lands Pass — and any site-specific agency or
regional multi-entity passes are sold to nonresidents.

(b)  The Secretary of the Interior shall use any increased fee revenue
generated pursuant to subsection (a) of this section to improve the
infrastructure of, or otherwise enhance enjoyment of or access to,
America’s Federal recreational areas, consistent with 16 U.S.C. 6807.

\(c\)  The Secretary of the Interior, working with the Secretary of
Agriculture as appropriate, shall take steps to improve services and
affordability for United States residents visiting national parks, as
consistent with applicable law.

(d)  The Secretary of the Interior, working with the Secretary of State,
shall work to encourage international tourism to America’s national
parks and outdoor recreation areas, and especially wider utilization of
America’s many such areas that may be underutilized.

\(e\)  The Secretary of the Interior shall review the maintenance
backlog within the National Park Service and take all appropriate action
to fully implement the National Parks and Public Land Legacy Restoration
Fund established in the Great American Outdoors Act (Public Law
116-152), invest in the infrastructure of national parks, and increase
visitor capacity to allow more Americans to visit national parks.

\(f\)  The Secretary of the Interior shall review all of the Department
of the Interior‘s rules and policies related to public use of national
parks and take actions consistent with applicable law to ensure that the
National Park Service manages national parks consistent with the policy
of this order.  The Secretary of the Interior shall review all of the
Department’s recreational access rules and take steps to rescind any
that unnecessarily restrict recreation in national parks.  In conducting
this review, the Secretary of the Interior shall especially scrutinize
all recreational access rules or other restrictions promulgated or
enacted during the prior administration.  The Secretary of the Interior
shall take appropriate actions to grant American residents preferential
treatment with respect to any remaining recreational access rules,
including permitting or lottery rules, consistent with applicable law.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Revocation</span>.  The
Presidential Memorandum of January 12, 2017 (Promoting Diversity and
Inclusion in Our National Parks, National Forests, and Other Public
Lands and Waters), is hereby revoked.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. 
(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:  

\(i\)   the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency,
or the head thereof; or 

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.  

\(c\)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.  

(d)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Department of the Interior.
