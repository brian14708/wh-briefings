title: Regulatory Relief for Certain Stationary Sources to Promote American Chemical
  Manufacturing Security
---
 
By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1\. The United States relies on a strong chemical manufacturing sector
to support industries like energy, national defense, agriculture, and
health care. These facilities produce essential inputs for critical
infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, medical sterilization,
semiconductors, and national defense systems. Maintaining a robust
domestic chemical industry is vital to safeguarding the supply chains
that underpin our economy and to reducing the Nation’s dependence on
foreign control over materials critical to national resilience. As
adversaries expand influence over key inputs, continued domestic
production is essential not only to economic resilience but also to
military readiness, public health, and national preparedness.

2\. On May 16, 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency published a
final rule titled *New Source Performance Standards for the Synthetic
Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and National Emission Standards
for Hazardous Air Pollutants for the Synthetic Organic Chemical
Manufacturing Industry and Group I & II Polymers and Resins Industry, 89
FR 42932* (HON Rule). The HON Rule imposes new emissions-control
requirements on certain chemical manufacturing facilities, some of which
were promulgated pursuant to section 112 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C.
7412.

3\. The HON Rule imposes substantial burdens on chemical manufacturers
already operating under stringent regulations. Many of the testing and
monitoring requirements outlined in the HON Rule rely on technologies
that are not practically available, not demonstrated at the necessary
scale, or cannot be implemented safely or consistently under real-world
conditions. For many facilities, the timeline for compliance as set
forth at 89 FR 42953-42955 would require shutdowns or massive capital
investments before any proven pathway to compliance exists. The HON Rule
imposes requirements that assume uniform technological availability
across facilities, despite significant variation in site conditions,
permitting realities, and equipment configurations. A disruption of this
capacity would weaken key supply chains, increase dependence on foreign
producers, and impair our ability to respond effectively in a time of
crisis. These consequences would ripple across sectors vital to
America’s growing industrial strength and emergency readiness.  

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws
of the United States, including section 112(i)(4) of the Clean Air Act,
42 U.S.C. 7412(i)(4), do hereby proclaim that certain stationary sources
subject to the HON Rule, as identified in Annex I of this proclamation,
are exempt from compliance with those aspects of the HON Rule that were
promulgated under section 112 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7412 for a
period of 2 years beyond the HON Rule’s relevant compliance dates
(Exemption). This Exemption applies to all compliance deadlines
established under the HON Rule applicable to the stationary sources
listed in Annex I, with each such deadline extended by 2 years from the
date originally required for such deadline. The effect of this Exemption
is that, during each such 2-year period, these stationary sources will
be subject to the emissions and compliance obligations that they are
currently subject to under the applicable standard as that standard
existed prior to the HON Rule. In support of this Exemption, I hereby
make the following determinations:  

a\. The technology to implement the HON Rule is not available. Such
technology does not exist in a commercially viable form sufficient to
allow implementation of and compliance with the HON Rule by the
compliance dates in the HON Rule.  

b\. It is in the national security interests of the United States to
issue this Exemption for the reasons stated in paragraphs 1 and 3 of
this proclamation.  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of
July, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
fiftieth.

`DONALD J. TRUMP`
