title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Approves California Disaster\_Declaration"
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of California and ordered Federal assistance to
supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas
affected by a severe storm and flooding from January 21 to January 23,
2024.  
   
The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in San Diego County.  
   
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.  
   
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.  
   
Ms. N. Allison Pfaendler of the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in
the affected areas.   
   
Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.  
   
Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance at www.DisasterAssistance.gov,
by calling 800-621-FEMA (3362), or by using the [FEMA
App](https://www.ready.gov/fema-app). Anyone using a relay service, such
as video relay service (VRS), captioned telephone service or others, can
give FEMA the number for that service.
