MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE

THE SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY

SUBJECT:       Deferred Enforced Departure for Certain Palestinians

Following the horrific October 7, 2023, terrorist attack by Hamas
against Israel, and Israel’s ensuing military response, humanitarian
conditions in the Palestinian territories, and primarily Gaza, have
significantly deteriorated.  While I remain focused on improving the
humanitarian situation, many civilians remain in danger; therefore, I am
directing the deferral of removal of certain Palestinians who are
present in the United States.

Pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct the foreign relations
of the United States, I have determined that it is in the foreign policy
interest of the United States to defer for 18 months the removal of any
Palestinian subject to the conditions and exceptions provided below.

Accordingly, I hereby direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to take
appropriate measures to defer for 18 months the removal of any
Palestinian who is present in the United States on the date of this
memorandum, except for those:

(1)  who have voluntarily returned to the Palestinian territories after
the date of this memorandum;

(2)  who have not continuously resided in the United States since the
date of this memorandum;

(3)  who are inadmissible under section 212(a)(3) of the Immigration and
Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)) or deportable under section
237(a)(4) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(4));

(4)  who have been convicted of any felony or two or more misdemeanors
committed in the United States, or who meet any of the criteria set
forth in section 208(b)(2)(A) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1158(b)(2)(A));

(5)  who are subject to extradition;

(6)  whose presence in the United States the Secretary of Homeland
Security has determined is not in the interest of the United States or
presents a danger to public safety; or

(7)  whose presence in the United States the Secretary of State has
reasonable grounds to believe would have potentially serious adverse
foreign policy consequences for the United States.

I further direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to take appropriate
measures to authorize employment for noncitizens whose removal has been
deferred, as provided by this memorandum, for the duration of such
deferral, and to consider suspending regulatory requirements with
respect to F-1 nonimmigrant students who are Palestinians as the
Secretary of Homeland Security determines to be appropriate.

The Secretary of Homeland Security is authorized and directed to publish
this memorandum in the *Federal Register*.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
