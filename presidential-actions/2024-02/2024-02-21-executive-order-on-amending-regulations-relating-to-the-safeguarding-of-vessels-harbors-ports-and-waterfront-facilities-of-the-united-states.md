title: "Executive Order on Amending Regulations Relating to the Safeguarding of Vessels,\
  \ Harbors, Ports, and Waterfront Facilities of the United\_States"
---
 
  By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including section 1 of title II of
the Act of June 15, 1917, as amended (46 U.S.C. 70051) (the “Act”), and
in addition to the finding in Executive Order 10173 of October 18, 1950,
and any other declaration or finding in force under section 1 of
the Act, I find that the security of the United States is endangered by
reason of disturbances in the international relations of the United
States that exist as a result of persistent and increasingly
sophisticated malicious cyber campaigns against the United States, and
that such disturbances continue to endanger such relations, and hereby
order that:

or injury, including damage to any data, information, network, program,

not issue a Coast Guard Port Security Card unless the Commandant is
satisfied that the character and habits of life of the applicant
therefor are such as to authorize the belief that the presence of such
individual on board a vessel or within a waterfront facility would not
be inimical to the security of the United States.  The Commandant shall

lighting, fire hazards, inadequate fire protection, unsafe machinery,
internal disturbance, damage to any data, information, network, program,

waterfront structure until the unsatisfactory condition or conditions so
found are corrected, and the Captain of the Port may, for the same
reasons, after any vessel has been moored, compel the shifting of such
vessel from any such wharf, dock, pier, or other waterfront structure.”;

for the protection and security of such vessels or waterfront
facilities, including any data, information, network, program, system,
or other digital infrastructure thereon or therein.”.

     Sec. 2.  Coordination.  In enforcing regulations amended by this
order, the Commandant shall coordinate with the Department of Justice
and other relevant executive departments and agencies, as appropriate
under applicable law or policy.

     Sec. 3.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be
