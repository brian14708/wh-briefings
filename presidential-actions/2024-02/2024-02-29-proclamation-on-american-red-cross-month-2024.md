title: "Proclamation on American Red Cross Month,\_2024"
---
 
  This month, we honor the American Red Cross for its humanitarian
commitment to serve communities across the United States and around the
world.  We celebrate each and every selfless employee and volunteer as
an ambassador of American generosity, who upholds a sacred mandate to
leave no person behind.     
  
     Founded more than 140 years ago by Clara Barton, the American Red
Cross has led with compassion and care, assisting neighbors and fellow
Americans when they find themselves in some of the most agonizing
circumstances they have ever faced.  Throughout the biggest cities and
the smallest towns, American Red Cross workers perform heroic acts of
service across the United States and abroad.  When wildfires devour
neighborhoods, tornadoes uproot towns, earthquakes devastate homes and
businesses, hurricanes whip beachfronts, and rivers rise and ruin
neighborhoods and city streets, Red Cross volunteers are there to
provide food, create temporary shelters, and help people recover and
rebuild.  While climate change has led to the increasing intensity and
frequency of the world’s natural disasters, Red Cross volunteers
continue to serve as beacons of light, bringing hope to those facing
some of the darkest hours and offering life-saving support at home and
overseas.  
  
     During American Red Cross Month, I encourage everyone who is able
to give blood and volunteer to help local communities in need.  You can
learn more about the process of donating blood online at redcross.org.
 Let us all use the dedication of the American Red Cross as an example
this month and recommit in our own lives to lead with compassion and
care.  When we see others who are struggling, let us embody the
generosity of the American spirit and resolve to lend them a helping
hand.

     NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United
States of America and Honorary Chair of the American Red Cross, by
virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of
the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2024 as American Red Cross
Month.  I encourage all Americans to observe this month with relevant
programs, ceremonies, and activities and to support the work of service
and relief organizations.  
  
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
twenty-ninth day of February, in the year of our Lord
two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States
of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.

                          JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
