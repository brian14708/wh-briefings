Dear Mr. Speaker:   (Dear Madam President:)  
   
As I reported previously, since at least November 2023, Yemen‑based
Houthi militants have engaged in a series of attacks against United
States military forces, including ships and aircraft, and against
maritime commercial shipping operating in the Red Sea, the Bab al-Mandeb
Strait, and the Gulf of Aden.  These attacks pose a threat to the safety
of United States forces and commercial ships and their crews, regional
political and economic stability, and navigational rights and freedoms.
 The Houthi militants continue to pose a threat of future attacks
against United States forces and military vessels and against other
maritime traffic in the region.  
   
On February 24, 2024, at my direction, United States forces, as part of
a multinational operation alongside the United Kingdom, with support
from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, and New
Zealand, conducted discrete strikes against Houthi underground storage
sites and locations associated with the Houthis’ missile and air
surveillance capabilities, attack capabilities, unmanned aerial vehicle
capabilities, and command and control facilities in Yemen that support
and facilitate Houthi militants’ attacks in the Red Sea region.  I
directed the strikes in order to protect and defend our personnel and
assets, to degrade and disrupt the ability of the Houthi militants to
carry out future attacks against the United States and against vessels
operating in the Red Sea region that could further destabilize the
region and threaten United States strategic interests.  The strikes were
taken to degrade Houthi capacity to conduct future attacks and were
conducted in a manner designed to limit the risk of escalation and avoid
civilian casualties.  
   
I directed this military action consistent with my responsibility to
protect United States citizens both at home and abroad and in
furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy
interests, pursuant to my constitutional authority as Commander in Chief
and Chief Executive and to conduct United States foreign relations.  The
United States took this necessary and proportionate action consistent
with international law and in the exercise of the United States’
inherent right of self-defense as reflected in Article 51 of the United
Nations Charter.  The United States stands ready to take further action,
as necessary and appropriate, to address further threats or attacks.  
   
I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress
fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law
93-148).  I appreciate the support of the Congress in this action.  
   
                              Sincerely,  
   
   
   
                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
