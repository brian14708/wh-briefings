Dear Mr. Speaker:   (Dear Madam President:)  
  
As I reported previously, since at least November 2023, Yemen-based
Houthi militants have engaged in a series of attacks against United
States military forces, including ships and aircraft, and against
maritime commercial shipping, operating in the Red Sea, the Bab
al-Mandeb Strait, and the Gulf of Aden.  These attacks pose a threat to
the safety of United States forces and commercial ships and their crews,
regional political and economic stability, and navigational rights and
freedoms.  The Houthi militants continue to pose a threat of future
attacks against United States forces and military vessels and against
other maritime traffic in the region.  
  
I previously reported that on January 11, 2024 and January 22, 2024, in
response to these attacks and the threat of future attacks, at my
direction, United States forces as part of a multinational operation
alongside the United Kingdom, with support from Australia, Bahrain,
Canada, and the Netherlands, conducted discrete strikes against
facilities in Yemen that facilitate Houthi militants’ attacks in the Red
Sea region.  
  
On February 3, 2024, at my direction, United States forces as part of a
multinational operation alongside the United Kingdom, with support from
Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, and New Zealand,
conducted discrete strikes in Yemen against facilities, locations, and
equipment associated with the Houthis’ missile and air surveillance
capabilities, unmanned aerial vehicle capabilities, and command and
control capabilities.  I directed the strikes against targets used by
Houthi militants to support attacks in the Red Sea region in order to
protect and defend our personnel and assets, and to disrupt the Houthi
capabilities used to conduct or support further attacks that could
further destabilize the region and threaten United States strategic
interests.  The strikes were taken to degrade Houthi capacity to conduct
future attacks and were conducted in a manner designed to limit the risk
of escalation and avoid civilian casualties.  
  
I directed this military action consistent with my responsibility to
protect United States citizens both at home and abroad and in
furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy
interests, pursuant to my constitutional authority as Commander in Chief
and Chief Executive and to conduct United States foreign relations.  The
United States took this necessary and proportionate action consistent
with international law and in the exercise of the United States’
inherent right of self-defense as reflected in Article 51 of the United
Nations Charter.  The United States stands ready to take further action,
as necessary and appropriate, to address further threats or attacks.  
  
I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress
fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law
93-148).  I appreciate the support of the Congress in this action.

                                Sincerely,

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
