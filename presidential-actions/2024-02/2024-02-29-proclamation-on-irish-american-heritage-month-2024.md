During Irish-American Heritage Month, we honor our Irish ancestors, all
those who carry on their legacies, and the values that have always bound
Ireland and the United States together.

These values — including determination, decency, and dignity — have been
passed down from generation to generation in families like my own and
have been grafted into the American character.  Last year, I had the
honor of visiting the home of some of my Irish ancestors, including the
Blewitts of County Mayo and the Finnegans of County Louth.  As I
traveled across Ireland, I learned the true meaning of the Gaelic
expression, “a hundred thousand welcomes.”  I was reminded that
everything between Ireland and America runs deep — from our history and
sorrow to our future and joy.  But more than anything, hope is what
beats in the hearts of all of our people.

For centuries — even during times of darkness and despair — hope has
kept us marching forward toward a better future.  It is what led so many
of our Irish ancestors to leave the only place they had ever called home
and seek a new beginning in the United States.  It is what drove
generations of Irish immigrants to help build the foundations of America
with grit and persistence, even as they endured discrimination and were
denied opportunity.  It is what continues to drive tens of millions of
Irish Americans across our country to stand up for greater dignity,
liberty, and possibilities for all.  As we celebrate the 100th
anniversary of United States-Irish diplomatic relations this year, hope
remains the bedrock of our partnership, as evidenced by our work
together to stand with the brave people of Ukraine in the face of
Russian aggression, combat the climate crisis, and advance workers’
rights across both of our nations.

In the years ahead, I look forward to strengthening the partnership and
friendship between the people of Ireland and America even further.
 United by history, heritage, and hope, nothing is beyond our reach.  
  
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States
of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2024 as
Irish-American Heritage Month.  I call upon all Americans to celebrate
the achievements and contributions of Irish Americans to our Nation with
appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.  
  
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
twenty-ninth day of February, in the year of our Lord
two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States
of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.

                              JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
