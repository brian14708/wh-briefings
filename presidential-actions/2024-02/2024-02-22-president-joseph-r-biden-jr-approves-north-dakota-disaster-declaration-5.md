On February 15, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major
disaster exists in the State of North Dakota and ordered Federal
assistance to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in
the areas affected by a severe winter storm and straight-line winds from
December 25 to December 27, 2023.  
   
Federal funding is available to state, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the severe winter storm and straight-line winds in
the counties of Barnes, Cass, Dickey, Grant, LaMoure, Logan, McIntosh,
Ransom, Richland, Sargent, Steele, Stutsman, and Traill.  
   
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.  
   
Mr. James R. Stephenson of the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in
the affected areas.   
   
Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
