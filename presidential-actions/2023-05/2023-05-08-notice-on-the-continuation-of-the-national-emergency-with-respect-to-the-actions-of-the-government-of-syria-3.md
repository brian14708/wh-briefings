title: "Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Actions\
  \ of the Government of\_Syria"

On May 11, 2004, pursuant to his authority under the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq*.) and the Syria
Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003 (Public
Law 108-175), the President issued Executive Order 13338, in which he
declared a national emergency with respect to the actions of the
Government of Syria.  The national emergency was modified in scope and
relied upon for additional steps taken in Executive Order 13399 of April
25, 2006, Executive Order 13460 of February 13, 2008, Executive Order
13572 of April 29, 2011, Executive Order 13573 of May 18, 2011,
Executive Order 13582 of August 17, 2011, Executive Order 13606 of April
22, 2012, and Executive Order 13608 of May 1, 2012.  
  
     The President took these actions to deal with the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and
economy of the United States constituted by the actions of the
Government of Syria in supporting terrorism, maintaining its
then-existing occupation of Lebanon, pursuing weapons of mass
destruction and missile programs, and undermining United States and
international efforts with respect to the stabilization and
reconstruction of Iraq.     
  
     The regime’s brutality and repression of the Syrian people, who
have called for freedom and a representative government, not only
endangers the Syrian people themselves, but also generates instability
throughout the region.  The Syrian regime’s actions and policies,
including with respect to chemical weapons and supporting terrorist
organizations, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to
the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United
States.  As a result, the national emergency declared in Executive Order
13338, which was expanded in scope in Executive Order 13572, and with
respect to which additional steps were taken in Executive Order 13399,
Executive Order 13460, Executive Order 13573, Executive Order 13582,
Executive Order 13606, and Executive Order 13608, must continue in
effect beyond May 11, 2023.  Therefore, in accordance with section
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am
continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared with respect to
the actions of the Government of Syria.  
  
     In addition, the United States condemns the brutal violence and
human rights violations and abuses of the Assad regime and its Russian
and Iranian enablers.  The United States calls on the Assad regime, and
its backers, to stop its violent war against its own people, enact a
nationwide ceasefire, facilitate the unhindered delivery of humanitarian
assistance to all Syrians in need, and negotiate a political settlement
in Syria in line with United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254. 
The United States will consider changes in policies and actions of the
Government of Syria in determining whether to continue or terminate this
national emergency in the future.  
  
     This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and
transmitted to the Congress.  
   
   
 

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.  
 

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
    May 8, 2023.
