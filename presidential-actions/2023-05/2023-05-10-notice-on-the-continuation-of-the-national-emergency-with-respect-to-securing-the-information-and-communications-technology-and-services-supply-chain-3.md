title: "Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Securing\
  \ the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply\_Chain"
---
 
     On May 15, 2019, by Executive Order 13873, the President declared a
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) to deal with the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and
economy of the United States constituted by the unrestricted acquisition
and use of certain information and communications technology and
services transactions.

     The unrestricted acquisition or use in the United States of
information and communications technology or services designed,
developed, manufactured, or supplied by persons owned by, controlled by,
or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of foreign adversaries
augments the ability of these foreign adversaries to create and exploit
vulnerabilities in information and communications technology or
services, with potentially catastrophic effects.  This threat continues
to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security,
foreign policy, and economy of the United States.  For this reason, the
national emergency declared on May 15, 2019, must continue in effect
beyond May 15, 2023.  Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of
the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1
year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13873 with
respect to securing the information and communications technology and
services supply chain. 

     This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and
transmitted to the Congress.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR. 

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
 May 10, 2023.
