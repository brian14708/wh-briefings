TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:  
  
     Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to the stabilization of
Iraq declared in Executive Order 13303 of May 22, 2003 — as modified in
scope and relied upon for additional steps taken in Executive Order
13290 of March 20, 2003, Executive Order 13315 of August 28, 2003,
Executive Order 13350 of July 29, 2004, Executive Order 13364 of
November 29, 2004, Executive Order 13438 of July 17, 2007, and Executive
Order 13668 of May 27, 2014 — is to continue in effect beyond May 22,
2023.

     Obstacles to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration
and maintenance of peace and security in the country, and the
development of political, administrative, and economic institutions in
Iraq continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the
national security and foreign policy of the United States.  Therefore, I
have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 13303 with respect to the stabilization of
Iraq.

THE WHITE HOUSE,
