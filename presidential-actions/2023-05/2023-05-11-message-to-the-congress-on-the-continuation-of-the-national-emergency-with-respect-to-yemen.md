  \ Respect to\_Yemen"

TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:  
  
     Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to Yemen declared in
Executive Order 13611 of May 16, 2012, is to continue in effect beyond
May 16, 2023.

     The actions and policies of certain former members of the
Government of Yemen and others in threatening Yemen’s peace, security,
and stability continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to
the national security and foreign policy of the United States. 
Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13611 with respect to
Yemen.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
      May 11, 2023.
