  \ Islands Emergency\_Declaration"
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that an emergency exists
in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and ordered Federal
assistance to supplement Commonwealth and local response efforts due to
the emergency conditions resulting from Typhoon Mawar beginning on May
22, 2023, and continuing.   
  
The President’s action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security,
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate all disaster
relief efforts which have the purpose of alleviating the hardship and
suffering caused by the emergency on the local population, and to
provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures,
authorized under Title V of the Stafford Act, to save lives and to
protect property and public health and safety, and to lessen or avert
the threat of a catastrophe in the islands of Agrihan, Alamagan, Pagan,
Rota, Saipan, and Tinian.  
  
Specifically, FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize, and provide at
its discretion, equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the
impacts of the emergency.  Emergency protective measures (Category B),
limited to direct Federal assistance, under the Public Assistance
program will be provided at 75 percent Federal funding.   
  
Mr. Benigno B. Ruiz of FEMA has been appointed to coordinate Federal
recovery operations in the affected areas.
