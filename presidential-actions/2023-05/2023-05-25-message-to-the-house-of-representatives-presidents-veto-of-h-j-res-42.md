  \ Res.\_42"

TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:

I am returning herewith without my approval H.J. Res. 42, a resolution
that would disapprove the action of the District of Columbia Council in
approving the Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of
2022.

     I believe we have an obligation to make sure that all our people
are safe and that public safety depends on public trust.  It is a
core policy of my Administration to provide law enforcement with the
resources they need for effective, accountable community policing.

     While I do not support every provision of the Comprehensive
Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022, this resolution from
congressional Republicans would overturn commonsense police reforms such
as:  banning chokeholds; setting important restrictions on use of force
and deadly force; improving access to body-worn camera recordings; and
requiring officer training on de-escalation and use of force.

     The Congress should respect the District of Columbia’s right to
pass measures that improve public safety and public trust.  I continue
to call on the Congress to pass commonsense police reform legislation.  
  
    Therefore, I am vetoing this resolution.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
    May 25, 2023.
