Late last evening, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major
disaster exists for the Soboba Band of Luiseño Indians and ordered
federal aid to supplement the Tribal Nation’s efforts in the areas
affected by a severe winter storm and flooding from February 23 to
February 26, 2023.  
  
Federal funding is available to the Soboba Band of Luiseño Indians and
certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for
emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by
the severe winter storm and flooding.  
  
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures for the Soboba Band of Luiseño Indians.  
  
Mr. Benigno Bern Ruiz of the Federal Emergency Management Agency has
been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the affected
areas.   
  
Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
Tribal Nation and warranted by the results of further damage
assessments.
