title: "Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Significant\
  \ Narcotics Traffickers Centered in\_Colombia"
---
 
     On October 21, 1995, by Executive Order 12978, the President
declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency
Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) to deal with the unusual
and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and
economy of the United States constituted by the actions of significant
narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia and the extreme level of
violence, corruption, and harm such actions cause in the United States
and abroad. 

     The actions of significant narcotics traffickers centered in
Colombia continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States and
cause an extreme level of violence, corruption, and harm in the United
States and abroad.  For this reason, the national emergency declared in
Executive Order 12978 of October 21, 1995, must continue in effect
beyond October 21, 2024.  Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d)
of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for
1 year the national emergency with respect to significant narcotics
traffickers centered in Colombia declared in Executive Order 12978. 

     This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and
transmitted to the Congress.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

    October 11, 2024.
