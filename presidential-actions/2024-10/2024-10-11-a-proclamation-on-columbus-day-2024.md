     Today, we celebrate the proud heritage of Italian Americans in our
Nation, whose contributions and character have shaped our country’s
soul.

     I believe we are the only Nation in the world with a heart and soul
that draws from old and new.  For some Italian-American families, the
stories they share about their ancestors’ lives in this country stretch
back generations.  They are stories about immigrants who left everything
behind to sail across an ocean and chase the American Dream for the hope
of a brighter future.  They are stories about ancestors who helped build
this country and found America’s middle class — and their traditions and
recipes still bring joy to their families today.  They are stories of
Italian-American artists, laborers, lawmakers, and leaders who never
gave up on the idea of America.  And for many Italian Americans, the
story of Christopher Columbus’ voyage crossing the Atlantic from the
Spanish port of Palos de la Frontera on behalf of Queen Isabella I and
King Ferdinand II remains a source of pride.  But no matter if their
families arrived here centuries ago or only recently, Italian Americans’
courage, strength, and character are woven into the rich tapestry of our
country.

     For many Italian Americans, the lives of their ancestors in this
country were not always easy.  In addition to the challenges of starting
life in a new land, they also faced discrimination.  Columbus Day was
founded by President Benjamin Harrison in 1892 in response to the
horrific, xenophobic attack that took the lives of 11 Italian Americans
the year before.  In the face of hate, Italian Americans persisted —
advancing our Nation and challenging us to live up to our highest
values. 

     My Administration also recognizes that Italian Americans are a
source of strength in our country’s unshakeable alliance, strategic
partnership, and deep friendship with Italy.  The ties between our
countries are founded on our shared values and principles:  democracy,
freedom, and respect for human rights.  Both of our nations take pride
in standing with the brave people of Ukraine as they defend themselves
against Russia’s illegal aggression.

     Today, may we honor the history and heritage of Italian Americans
and all that they have done to help realize the full promise of America
for generations.

     In commemoration of Christopher Columbus’ historic voyage 532 years
ago, the Congress, by joint resolution of April 30, 1934, and modified
in 1968 (36 U.S.C. 107), as amended, has requested the President
proclaim the second Monday of October of each year as “Columbus Day.”

     NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United
States of America, do hereby proclaim October 14, 2024, as Columbus
Day.  I direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all
public buildings on the appointed day in honor of our diverse history
and all who have contributed to shaping this Nation.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
eleventh day of October, in the year of our Lord
two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States
of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.  
   
                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
