---
 
Yesterday, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the Commonwealth of Virginia and ordered Federal aid to
supplement Commonwealth and local recovery efforts in the areas affected
by Tropical Storm Helene beginning on September 25, 2024, and
continuing.

The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in the counties of Giles, Grayson, Smyth, Tazewell,
Washington, and Wythe and the independent city of Galax.

Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.

Federal funding also is available to State and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work in the counties of Bedford, Bland,
Buchanan, Carroll, Craig, Dickenson, Giles, Grayson, Montgomery,
Pittsylvania, Pulaski, Russell, Scott, Smyth, Tazewell, Washington,
Wise, and Wythe and the independent cities of Bristol, Covington,
Danville, Galax, Norton, and Radford.

Finally, Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for
hazard mitigation measures for the entire commonwealth.

Mr. Timothy S. Pheil of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas. 

Damage assessments are continuing in other areas, and more areas and
additional forms of assistance may be designated after the assessments
are fully completed.

Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance at
[www.DisasterAssistance.gov](//fema.net/hqss/rrshare/SHARE/AGREES/Florida/2024/4806%20Debby/www.DisasterAssistance.gov),
or by calling 800-621-FEMA (3362), or by using the [FEMA
App](https://www.ready.gov/fema-app). Anyone using a relay service, such
as video relay service (VRS), captioned telephone service or others, can
give FEMA the number for that service.
