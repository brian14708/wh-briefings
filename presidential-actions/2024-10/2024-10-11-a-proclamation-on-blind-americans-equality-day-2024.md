title: "A Proclamation on Blind Americans Equality Day,\_2024"
---
 
     This Blind Americans Equality Day, we honor the immense
contributions of blind and low vision Americans, who help power our
economy and push our Nation forward.  And we recommit to ensuring every
blind and low vision person in this country has a fair shot at the
American Dream.  
  
     Throughout my decades in public service, I have strived to build an
America that works for all Americans.  It is why I was proud to
co-sponsor the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act — a civil rights
law that banned discrimination against people with disabilities in many
areas of public life.  I remain proud of its lasting legacy today. 
However, there is still more to do to ensure that blind and low vision
Americans have the resources and opportunities they need to thrive. 
From transportation to online job applications, public services are too
often designed in ways that are inaccessible for people with
disabilities.  And less than half of blind or low vision Americans are
employed.  
  
     My Administration is committed to ensuring blind and low vision
Americans have equal opportunities.  To that end, I signed an Executive
Order to prioritize diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in
the Federal Government and to identify the barriers faced by job
applicants and employees with disabilities.  We are also requiring
Federal agencies to prioritize website accessibility so the Government
can truly deliver for all Americans.  These are important steps toward
making the Federal Government the gold standard for fair, accessible,
and decent practices in the workplace.  Furthermore, my Administration
is ensuring that blind and low vision Americans hired by the Federal
Government are paid a fair wage.  That is why we ended the use of unfair
sub‑minimum wages in Federal contracts.  At the same time, we are
working to increase hiring for people with disabilities in every sector
by helping governments, businesses, and nonprofits access Federal funds
to hire more disabled Americans.    
  
     I am also working to make public spaces more accessible for blind
and low vision Americans.  Through my Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we
are investing $1.75 billion — the largest amount ever — in making
transit and rail stations more accessible.  The General Services
Administration also adopted the United States Access Board’s new
guidelines to ensure people with disabilities have access to the over
300,000 Federal Government buildings.  And the National Institutes of
Health designated people with disabilities as a population with health
disparities, opening up new research opportunities that will focus on
health issues and unmet needs for blind and low vision Americans.  
  
     This Blind Americans Equality Day, may we recommit to advancing
accessibility and opportunities for blind and low vision Americans, who
do so much for our Nation and deserve every opportunity to thrive.   
  
     By joint resolution approved on October 6, 1964 (Public Law 88-628,
as amended), the Congress authorized October 15 of each year as “White
Cane Safety Day,” which is recognized today as “Blind Americans Equality
Day,” to honor the contributions of blind and low vision Americans.  
  
     NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United
States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the
Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim
October 15, 2024, as Blind Americans Equality Day.  I call upon all the
people of the United States — including all government officials,
educators, and volunteers — to mark this day with appropriate programs,
ceremonies, and activities.  
  
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
eleventh day of October, in the year of our Lord
two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States
of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.  
   
   
                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
