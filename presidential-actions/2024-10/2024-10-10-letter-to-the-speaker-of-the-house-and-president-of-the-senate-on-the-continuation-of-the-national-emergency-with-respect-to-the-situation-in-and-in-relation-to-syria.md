Dear Mr. Speaker:   (Dear Madam President:)

Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13894 of
October 14, 2019, with respect to the situation in and in relation to
Syria, is to continue in effect beyond October 14, 2024.

The situation in and in relation to Syria undermines the campaign to
defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, endangers
civilians, and further threatens to undermine the peace, security, and
stability in the region, and continues to pose an unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the
United States.

Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13894 with respect to the
situation in and in relation to Syria.

                              Sincerely,

                              JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
