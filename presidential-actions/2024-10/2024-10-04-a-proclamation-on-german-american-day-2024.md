     In 1683, 13 families left the only home they had ever known to flee
religious persecution and start new lives in America, establishing the
first German settlement just outside Philadelphia.  On German-American
Day, we celebrate the history, culture, and countless contributions of
our Nation’s 40 million German Americans.

     The hard work, achievements, and sacrifices of German Americans
have shaped the very idea of America.  German-American immigrants
established some of our Nation’s earliest and most extensive newspapers,
advancing the role of the free press in America.  German-American
scholars and writers, scientists and musicians, and leaders in every
sector are the source of some of America’s best ideas and most exciting
possibilities.  And today, German Americans are not only a proud part of
our country’s character, but they also tie us closer to Germany and its
people.

     My Administration is committed to growing the friendship, allyship,
and partnership between Germany and the United States.  This month, I
will be traveling to Germany to meet with their leaders and coordinate
on shared priorities like securing democracy around the world,
countering antisemitism and other forms of hatred, and advancing
cooperation on economics, trade, and technology.  We will also continue
to stand together to support the brave people of Ukraine in their
defense against Russian aggression.

     Today, may we celebrate the culture and bonds German Americans have
built over the hundreds of years they have called this country home. 
Together, may we recommit to fighting for a better future, full of new
possibilities for our Nation.

     NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United
States of America, do hereby proclaim October 6, 2024, as
German-American Day.  I urge all Americans to celebrate the rich and
varied history of German Americans and remember the many contributions
they have made to our Nation.  
  
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
fourth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four,
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred
and forty-ninth.  
  
  
                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
