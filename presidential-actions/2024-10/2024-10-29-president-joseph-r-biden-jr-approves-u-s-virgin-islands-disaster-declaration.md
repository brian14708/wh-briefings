title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Approves U.S. Virgin Islands Disaster\_Declaration"
---
 
On October 25, 2024, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a
major disaster exists in the territory of the U.S. Virgin Islands and
ordered Federal assistance to supplement territory and local recovery
efforts in the areas affected by Tropical Storm Ernesto from August 13
to August 16, 2024.

Federal funding is available to territory and eligible local governments
and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for
emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by
Tropical Storm Ernesto in the islands of St. Croix, St. John, St.
Thomas, and Water Island.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures for the entire territory.

Lai Sun Yee of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has been
appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the affected
areas. 

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
territory and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.

Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance at
[www.DisasterAssistance.gov](/SHARE/FORMATS/DHS%200303/Expedited%20Requests%2003.02.21/www.DisasterAssistance.gov),
by calling 800-621-FEMA (3362), or by using the [FEMA
App](https://www.ready.gov/fema-app). Anyone using a relay service, such
as video relay service (VRS), captioned telephone service or others, can
give FEMA the number for that service.
