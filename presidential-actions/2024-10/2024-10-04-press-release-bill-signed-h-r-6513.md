On Friday, October 4, 2024, the President signed into law:

H.R. 6513, the “Confirmation Of Congressional Observer Access Act of
2024” or the “COCOA Act of 2024,” which requires States to provide
designated congressional election observers with full access to observe
all elements of the administration of congressional elections.

Thank you to Representatives Carey, Morelle, and Steil for their
leadership.
