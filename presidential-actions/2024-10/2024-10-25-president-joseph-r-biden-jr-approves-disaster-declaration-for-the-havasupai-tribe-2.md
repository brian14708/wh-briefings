title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Approves Disaster Declaration for the Havasupai\_\
  Tribe"
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists for the Havasupai Tribe and ordered federal aid to supplement the
Tribal Nation’s efforts in the areas affected by flooding from August 22
to August 23, 2024.

The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals for the Havasupai Tribe.

Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.

Federal funding also is available to the Havasupai Tribe and certain
private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency
work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the
flooding.

Lastly, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures for the Havasupai Tribe.

Mr. Benigno Bern Ruiz of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas. 

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
Tribal Nation and warranted by the results of further damage
assessments.

Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance at
[www.DisasterAssistance.gov](/SHARE/FORMATS/DHS%200303/Expedited%20Requests%2003.02.21/www.DisasterAssistance.gov),
