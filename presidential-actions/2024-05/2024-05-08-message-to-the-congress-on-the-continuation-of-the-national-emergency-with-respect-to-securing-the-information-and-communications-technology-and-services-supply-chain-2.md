TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:

     Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13873
of May 15, 2019, with respect to securing the information and
communications technology and services supply chain, is to continue in
effect beyond May 15, 2024.

     The unrestricted acquisition or use in the United States of
information and communications technology or services designed,
developed, manufactured, or supplied by persons owned by, controlled by,
or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of foreign adversaries
augments the ability of these foreign adversaries to create and exploit
vulnerabilities in information and communications technology or
services, with potentially catastrophic effects.  This threat continues
to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security,
foreign policy, and economy of the United States.  Therefore, I have
determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 13873 with respect to securing the
information and communications technology and services supply chain.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

    May 8, 2024.
