title: "Order Regarding the Acquisition of Certain Real Property of Cheyenne Leads\
  \ by MineOne Cloud Computing Investment I\_L.P."
---
 
     By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States of America, including section 721 of the
Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (section 721), 50 U.S.C.
4565, it is hereby ordered as follows:  
     Section 1.  Findings.  I hereby make the following findings:  
     (a)  There is credible evidence that leads me to believe that (1)
MineOne Partners Limited, a British Virgin Islands company ultimately
majority owned by Chinese nationals (“MineOne Partners”); (2) MineOne
Cloud Computing Investment I L.P., a British Virgin Islands limited
partnership (“MineOne Cloud”); (3) MineOne Data Center LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (“MineOne Data”); and (4) MineOne Wyoming Data
Center LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“MineOne Wyoming” and
together with MineOne Partners, MineOne Cloud, MineOne Data, and MineOne
Wyoming, the “Purchasers”), through the acquisition of certain real
estate that is located within 1 mile of Francis E. Warren Air Force Base
(“Warren AFB”) (specifically, the 12.06 acres described as Lot 1, Block
10 North Range Business Park 3rd Filing, located at 635 Logistics Drive,
Cheyenne, Wyoming, 82009) (the “Real Estate” and such acquisition the
“Transaction”), might take action that threatens to impair the national
security of the United States;  
     (b)  MineOne acquired the Real Estate in June 2022 and then made
improvements to allow for use of the Real Estate for specialized
cryptocurrency mining operations in close proximity to Warren AFB, a
strategic missile base and home to Minuteman III intercontinental
ballistic missiles;  
     (c)  The Transaction was not filed with the Committee on Foreign
Investment in the United States (CFIUS) until after CFIUS’s non-notified
transaction team investigated the Transaction as a result of a public
tip;  
     (d)  CFIUS identified national security risks arising from the
Transaction relating to the proximity of the Real Estate to Warren AFB,
as well as related risk associated with the presence of specialized
equipment on the Real Estate used to conduct cryptocurrency mining
operations, some of which is foreign-sourced and presents national
security concerns;  
     (e)  The proximity of the foreign-owned Real Estate to a strategic
missile base and key element of America’s nuclear triad, and the
presence of specialized and foreign-sourced equipment potentially
capable of facilitating surveillance and espionage activities, presents
a national security risk to the United States;  
 (f)  Section 721 authorizes CFIUS to negotiate and enter into an
agreement or take certain other actions to mitigate the national
security risk arising from a covered transaction.  Section 721 also
requires that such an agreement be effective and verifiable and enable
effective monitoring and enforcement to resolve the national security
concerns posed by a transaction.  After consideration, CFIUS determined
it would not be possible to enter into a negotiated agreement that would
satisfy those requirements; and    
     (g)  Provisions of law, other than section 721 and the
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq*.),
do not, in my judgment, provide adequate and appropriate authority for
me to protect the national security in this matter.  
     Sec. 2.  Actions Ordered and Authorized.  On the basis of the
findings set forth in section 1 of this order, considering the factors
described in subsection (f) of section 721, as appropriate, and pursuant
to my authority under applicable law, including section 721, I hereby
order that:  
     (a)  The Transaction is hereby prohibited, and ownership by the
Purchasers of any interest in or part of the Real Estate, or maintenance
of any property rights in the Real Estate (including but not limited to
the rights referred to in 31 C.F.R. 802.233), whether effected directly
or indirectly through the Purchasers, through the Purchasers’ foreign
person shareholders, partners, or beneficial owners, or through the
Purchasers’ subsidiaries or affiliates, including but not limited to
Terra Crypto, Inc., a Wyoming corporation; Terra Global Asset Management
Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation; Terra Global Capital, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company; Global Network of Business
Consultants, Inc., a New York corporation; and International
Intellectual Capital, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (such
subsidiaries and affiliates collectively “Affiliates”), are also
prohibited.  
     (b)  To effectuate this order, not later than 120 calendar days
after the date of this order, unless such date is extended by CFIUS,
subject to such conditions on an extension as CFIUS determines are
necessary and appropriate to protect the national security of the United
States, the Purchasers and their Affiliates shall sell or transfer all
direct and indirect legal and beneficial ownership interests or other
rights in the Real Estate, and certify in writing that such Divestment
has been completed (the “Divestment”).  
     (c)  Not later than 90 calendar days after the date of this order,
unless such date is extended by CFIUS, subject to such conditions on an
extension as CFIUS determines are necessary and appropriate to protect
the national security of the United States, the Purchasers, whether
directly or indirectly, shall:  
(i)   remove from the Real Estate all items, structures, or other
physical objects or installations of any kind (the “Equipment”) that the
Purchasers, their Affiliates, or persons acting on their behalf, have
stockpiled, stored, deposited, installed, or affixed (the “Equipment
Removal”), and certify in writing that such Equipment Removal has been
completed; and  
(ii)  remove from the Real Estate all (A) utility and other improvements
on or adjacent and connected to the Real Estate; (B) excavation, repair,
or new construction on the Real Estate underground; and (C) repair,
improvement, or new construction on the Real Estate above ground
(collectively, (A) through (C), the “Improvements”) commenced,
continued, or completed by the Purchasers or their Affiliates after the
closing of the Transaction (the “Improvements Removal”), and certify in
writing that such Improvements Removal has been completed.  
CFIUS is authorized to require inspection of the Real Estate, at no
expense to CFIUS, on terms it deems appropriate to ensure that each of
the Equipment Removal and Improvements Removal is complete and
verified.  
     (d)  Immediately from the date of this order until such time as the
Divestment, Equipment Removal, and Improvements Removal have been
completed and verified to the satisfaction of CFIUS, the Purchasers
shall, and shall ensure that all of their Affiliates, refrain from
physical or logical access to the Real Estate, Equipment, or
Improvements, unless such access is necessary to effectuate the
requirements of subsections (a) through (c) of this section as
determined by CFIUS.  Not later than 7 calendar days after the date of
this order and until such time as the Divestment, Equipment Removal, and
Improvements Removal have been completed and verified to the
satisfaction of CFIUS, the Purchasers shall, and shall ensure that their
Affiliates, put in place and maintain any measures or controls necessary
to ensure that the access prohibited under this subsection does not
occur.  
     (e)  Until the Divestment, Equipment Removal, and Improvements
Removal have been completed and verified to the satisfaction of CFIUS,
the Purchasers shall not, and shall ensure that their Affiliates do not,
dissolve, reorganize, or transfer their ownership of or any other
property rights in the Real Estate, or otherwise change their legal
structure or relocate or sell any physical, intangible, or financial
assets in a manner that would materially impede or prevent the
Purchasers or their Affiliates from complying with this order.  The
Purchasers shall, and shall ensure that their Affiliates, notify CFIUS
in writing within 24 hours of becoming aware of any actual or potential
event of default or other similar occurrence affecting any party’s
rights or obligations under outstanding loans related to the Real
Estate, Equipment, or Improvements that could materially impede or
prevent the Purchasers or their Affiliates from complying with this
order.  
     (f)  Immediately upon completion of the Divestment, Equipment
Removal, and Improvements Removal, the Purchasers shall certify in
writing to CFIUS that all steps necessary to fully and permanently
effectuate the requirements of subsections (a) through (d) of this
section, including any related conditions CFIUS imposes pursuant to this
order, have been completed in accordance with this order.  
     (g)  The Purchasers shall not, and shall ensure that their
Affiliates do not, complete a sale or transfer of the Real Estate to any
third party:  
(i)   until the Purchasers notify CFIUS in writing of the intended buyer
or transferee; and  
(ii)  unless 10 business days have passed from the notification in
subsection (g)(i) of this section and CFIUS has not issued to the
Purchasers an objection to the intended buyer or transferee.  Among the
factors CFIUS may consider in reviewing the proposed sale or transfer
are whether the buyer or transferee is a United States citizen or is
owned by United States citizens and has or has had a direct or indirect
contractual, financial, familial, employment, or other close and
continuous relationship with the Purchasers or their Affiliates, or
officers or employees of the Purchasers or their Affiliates.  In
addition, CFIUS may consider whether the proposed sale or transfer would
threaten to impair the national security of the United States or
undermine the purpose of this order, and whether the sale effectuates,
to CFIUS’s satisfaction and in its discretion, a Divestment consistent
with subsection (b) of this section.   
     (h)  From the date of this order until the Purchasers provide a
certification of the Divestment to CFIUS pursuant to subsection (f) of
this section, each Purchaser shall certify to CFIUS on a weekly basis
that it is in compliance with this order and shall include a description
of efforts to effectuate the Divestment, Equipment Removal, and
Improvements Removal along with a timeline for projected completion of
remaining actions.  
     (i)  Any transaction or other instrument entered into or method
employed for the purpose of, or with the effect of, evading or
circumventing this order is prohibited.  
     (j)  Without limitation on the exercise of authority by any agency
under other provisions of law, and until such time each of the
Divestment, Equipment Removal, and Improvements Removal are completed
and verified to the satisfaction of CFIUS, CFIUS is authorized to
implement measures it deems necessary and appropriate to verify and
enforce compliance with this order.  For purposes of verifying and
enforcing compliance with this order, employees of the United States
Government as designated by CFIUS shall be permitted access, on
reasonable notice to the Purchasers or their Affiliates, as applicable,
to all premises and facilities of the Purchasers or their Affiliates,
including the Real Estate, located in the United States:  
(i)    to inspect and copy any books, ledgers, accounts, correspondence,
memoranda, and other records and documents in the possession or under
the control of the Purchasers that concern any matter relating to this
order;  
(ii)   to inspect or audit any information systems, networks, hardware,
software, data, communications, or property in the possession or under
the control of the Purchasers;  
(iii)  to interview officers, employees, or agents of the Purchasers, or
any of their respective Affiliates, concerning any matter relating to
this order; and  
(iv)   to inspect and verify progress or completion of the requirements
of subsection (c)(i) and subsection (c)(ii) of this section regarding
the Equipment Removal and Improvements Removal.  
CFIUS shall conclude its verification procedures within 90 calendar days
after the certification of the Divestment is provided to CFIUS pursuant
to subsection (e) of this section.   
     (k)  Without limitation on the exercise of authority by any agency
under other provisions of law, and until such time as the Divestment,
Equipment Removal, and Improvements Removal are completed and verified
to the satisfaction of CFIUS, CFIUS is further authorized to implement
measures it deems necessary and appropriate to mitigate risk to the
national security of the United States arising from the Transaction,
including measures available to it under section 721 and its
implementing regulations, which include the remedies available for
violations of any agreement or condition entered into or imposed under
subsection (l) of section 721.  
     (l)  If any provision of this order, or the application of any
provision to any person or circumstances, is held by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the remainder of this order and
the application of its other provisions to any other persons or
circumstances shall not be affected thereby.  If any provision of this
order, or the application of any provision to any person or
circumstances, is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid because of the lack of certain procedural requirements, the
relevant executive branch officials shall implement those procedural
requirements.  
     (m)  The Attorney General is authorized to take any steps necessary
to enforce this order.  
     Sec. 3.  Reservation.  I hereby reserve my authority to issue
further orders with respect to the Transaction or Purchasers as shall in
my judgment be necessary to protect the national security of the United
States.  
     Sec. 4.  Publication and Transmittal.  (a)  This order shall be
published in the *Federal Register*.  
     (b)  I hereby direct the Secretary of the Treasury to transmit a
copy of this order to the appropriate parties named in section 1 of this
order.
