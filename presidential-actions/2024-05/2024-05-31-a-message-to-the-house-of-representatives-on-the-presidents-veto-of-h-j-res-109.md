title: "A Message to the House of Representatives on the President\u2019s Veto of\
  \ H.J.Res.\_109"
---
 
TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:

I am returning herewith without my approval H.J.Res. 109, a resolution
that would disapprove of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC)
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121).

SAB 121 reflects considered technical SEC staff views regarding the
accounting obligations of certain firms that safeguard crypto-assets.
 By virtue of invoking the Congressional Review Act, this Republican-led
resolution would inappropriately constrain the SEC’s ability to set
forth appropriate guardrails and address future issues.  This reversal
of the considered judgment of SEC staff in this way risks undercutting
the SEC’s broader authorities regarding accounting practices.  My
Administration will not support measures that jeopardize the well-being
of consumers and investors.  Appropriate guardrails that protect
consumers and investors are necessary to harness the potential benefits
and opportunities of crypto-asset innovation.  My Administration is
eager to work with the Congress to ensure a comprehensive and balanced
regulatory framework for digital assets, building on existing
authorities, which will promote the responsible development of digital
assets and payment innovation and help reinforce United States
leadership in the global financial system.

Therefore, I am vetoing this resolution.

                              JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

    May 31, 2024.
