  \ Budget\_Amendments"

Dear Mr. Speaker:

I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 Budget
amendments for the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Health and
Human Services, and Homeland Security as well as the Army Corps of
Engineers.  These amendments are necessary to correctly reflect policies
assumed in my FY 2025 Budget.  These amendments would decrease by
$316 million the overall discretionary budget authority in my FY 2025
Budget.

This transmittal also contains one FY 2025 Budget amendment for the
Legislative Branch.  As a matter of comity and tradition, this
appropriations request for the Legislative Branch is transmitted without
change.  This amendment would decrease by $4 million the overall
discretionary budget authority in my FY 2025 Budget.

Taken together, the transmitted amendments would decrease by
$320 million the overall discretionary budget authority in my FY 2025
Budget.

The details of this proposal are set forth in the enclosed letter from
the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.

                             Sincerely,

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
