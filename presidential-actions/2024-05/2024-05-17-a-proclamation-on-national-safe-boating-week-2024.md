title: "A Proclamation on National Safe Boating Week,\_2024"
---
 
  Boating is a beloved American pastime — each year, nearly 100 million
people find peace and freedom on our Nation’s lakes, rivers, bays, and
oceans.  This week, as so many of us look forward to summer, we remind
Americans to be safe and responsible on the water.

     Taking basic steps to protect yourself and your loved ones can save
lives.  Everyone on board should wear a life jacket at all times.  Boat
operators should always check the weather forecast; bring maps and
emergency communication tools; and wear their engine-cut-off switch
lanyard, which will automatically stop the vessel if they slip or are
thrown overboard.  They should always boat sober.  Operating a boat is
like driving a car and demands full attention.

     Americans who own a boat should meanwhile make sure it meets
Federal safety standards.  The civilian Coast Guard Auxiliary can send
volunteers to inspect your boat and its safety equipment for free.  Free
courses on boat safety are available in all 50 States by qualified
volunteer organizations, and many offer in-person and online trainings
on important topics like boat handling, marine navigation, engine
maintenance, weather prediction, and more.

     This week, we thank every member of the United States Coast Guard
and its Federal, State, Tribal, and local partners, who not only work to
prevent boating accidents through education and safety boardings but
also protect and rescue distressed mariners.  They have helped save
thousands of lives, and we can honor their brave service by each doing
our own part in staying safe on the water.  
  
In recognition of the importance of safe boating practices, the
Congress, by joint resolution approved on June 4, 1958 (36 U.S.C. 131),
as amended, has authorized and requested the President to proclaim
annually the 7-day period before Memorial Day weekend as “National Safe
Boating Week.”

     NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United
States of America, do hereby proclaim May 18 through May 24, 2024, as
National Safe Boating Week.  I encourage all Americans who participate
in boating activities to observe this occasion by learning more about
safe boating practices and by taking advantage of boating safety
education opportunities.  I also encourage the Governors of the States
and Territories, and appropriate officials of all units of government,
to join me in encouraging boating safety in every community.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth
day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-eighth.    
  

                              JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
