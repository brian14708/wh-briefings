title: "A Proclamation on Military Spouse Appreciation Day,\_2024"
---
 
Today, we honor the nearly one million military spouses for their
service and sacrifice for our Nation.  They are resilient.  They are
courageous.  Like our service members, they make our country stronger. 

     Through long tours, frequent moves, and constant demands, these men
and women remain unwavering, representing the very best of our American
spirit.  They step up to care for their fellow military families and
friends during deployments, often singlehandedly doing the job of two
parents.  They make incredible contributions to our country and
communities, even as they shoulder the unique demands of military life.
 They exude patience and selflessness during uncertainty and
unpredictability.  In ways big and small, military spouses answer the
call to serve every day — acting as both the backbone of their families
and the steel spine of our Nation.  
   
     We owe them.  As a Nation, we have only one truly sacred
obligation:  to prepare those we send into harm’s way and to care for
them and their families while they are deployed and when they come home.
 That is why, last year, I signed an Executive Order that established
the most comprehensive set of administrative actions in our country’s
history to support the economic security of military and veteran
spouses, caregivers, and survivors.  It directs all Federal agencies to
do more to retain military spouses through flexible policies, enables
spouses to seek advice on overseas employment issues through military
legal assistance offices for the first time, and helps military spouses
maintain their careers — including by improving access to quality,
dependable, and affordable child care.

     My Administration has also expanded the Military Parental Leave
Program, ensuring that service members have the time they need with
their families after a child’s birth, adoption, or placement in
long-term foster care.  Through the First Lady’s Joining Forces
initiative, we are working with employers to create more flexible,
transferable, and remote job opportunities for military spouses so they
can balance the demands of military life while building sustainable,
long-term careers.  We are working to ensure that military spouses and
families have access to health and wellness resources. 

     The English poet John Milton once wrote:  “They also serve who only
stand and wait.”  Today and every day, let us come together to thank our
military spouses.  Let us honor their courage and commitment.  Let us
continue to meet the sacred obligation we bear to them and all those who
wear the uniform.  May God bless our military spouses, and may God
protect our troops. 

     NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United
States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the
Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May
10, 2024, as Military Spouse Appreciation Day.  I call upon the people
of the United States to honor military spouses with appropriate
ceremonies and activities.

    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
ninth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-eighth.

                        JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
