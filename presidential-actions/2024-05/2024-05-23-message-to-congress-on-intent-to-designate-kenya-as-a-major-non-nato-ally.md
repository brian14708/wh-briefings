title: "Message to Congress on Intent to Designate Kenya as a Major Non-NATO\_Ally"
---
 
TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:

     In accordance with section 517 of the Foreign Assistance Act of
1961, as amended (22 U.S.C. 2321k), I am providing notice of my intent
to designate Kenya as a Major Non-NATO Ally.

     I am making this designation in recognition of Kenya’s many years
of contributions to the United States Africa Command area of
responsibility and globally and in recognition of our own national
interest in deepening bilateral defense and security cooperation with
the Government of Kenya.  Kenya is one of the United States Government’s
top counterterrorism and security partners in sub-Saharan Africa, and
the designation will demonstrate that the United States sees African
contributions to global peace and security as equivalent to those of our
Major Non-NATO Allies in other regions.  I appreciate the support of the
Congress in this action.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,      
May 23, 2024.
