title: "Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Central\
  \ African\_Republic"
---
 
On May 12, 2014, by Executive Order 13667, the President declared a
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the
United States constituted by the situation in and in relation to the
Central African Republic, which has been marked by a breakdown of law
and order; intersectarian tension; the pervasive, often forced
recruitment and use of child soldiers; and widespread violence and
atrocities, including those committed by Kremlin-linked and Yevgeniy
Prigozhin-affiliated entities such as the Wagner Group, and which
threatens the peace, security, or stability of the Central African
Republic and neighboring states.

     The situation in and in relation to the Central African Republic
continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national
security and foreign policy of the United States.  For this reason, the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13667 on May 12, 2014, to
deal with that threat must continue in effect beyond May 12, 2024.
 Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the
national emergency declared with respect to the Central African
Republic.

     This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and
transmitted to the Congress.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

    May 8, 2024.
