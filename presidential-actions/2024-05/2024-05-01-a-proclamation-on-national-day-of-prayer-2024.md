title: "A Proclamation on National Day of Prayer,\_2024"
---
 
     On this National Day of Prayer, we recognize the power of prayer to
strengthen our spirits, draw us together, and create hope for a better
tomorrow.

     The right to practice our faiths freely and openly is enshrined in
the Constitution and remains at the core of our American spirit.  For
centuries, Americans of every religion and background have come together
to lift up one another and our Nation in prayer.  Throughout America’s
history, faith and prayer have helped fuel some of the greatest moral
missions of our time — from the abolition of slavery to the fight for
voting rights and the Civil Rights Movement.  Many of our Nation’s
greatest leaders have been motivated by faith to push all of us toward a
more perfect Union and to bend the arc of the moral universe toward
justice.  

     Prayer is also deeply personal:  For the First Lady and me, and so
many across this Nation, prayer has helped us find solace during tough
times and stay grounded in good ones.  Prayer has helped the bravest
among us — including our Nation’s service members and their caregivers,
survivors, and families  – summon the courage to make great sacrifices
for our democracy.  It has guided the hands of medical professionals,
who heal our loved ones, and steeled the nerves of our first responders,
who put everything on the line to keep the rest of us safe.  We will
never know the full impact of prayer on our Nation or the world, but we
remain confident that it makes a profound difference each and every day.

     Scripture tells us to rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation,
and be constant in prayer.  This year, my prayer for our Nation is that
we keep faith that our best days are ahead of us and continue to believe
in honesty, decency, dignity, and respect.  May we see each other not as
enemies but as fellow human beings, each made in the image of God and
each precious in His sight.  May we leave no one behind, give everyone a
fair shot, and give hate no safe harbor.  May we remember that nothing
is beyond our capacity if we act together.

     The Congress, by Public Law 100-307, as amended, has called on the
President to issue each year a proclamation designating the first
Thursday in May as a “National Day of Prayer.”

     NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United
States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the
Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May
2, 2024, as a National Day of Prayer.  I call upon the citizens of our
Nation to give thanks, in accordance with their own faith and
conscience, for our many freedoms and blessings, and I invite all people
of faith to join me in asking for God’s continued guidance, mercy, and
protection.

    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
first day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-eighth.

                        JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
