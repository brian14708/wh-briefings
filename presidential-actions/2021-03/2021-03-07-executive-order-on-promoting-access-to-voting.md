title: "Executive Order on Promoting Access to\_Voting"
---
 
    By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as
follows:  
    <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 1.  Purpose.</span>
 The right to vote is the foundation of American democracy.  Free and
fair elections that reflect the will of the American people must be
protected and defended. But many Americans, especially people of color,
confront significant obstacles to exercising that fundamental right.
These obstacles include difficulties with voter registration, lack of
election information, and barriers to access at polling places.  For
generations, Black voters and other voters of color have
faced discriminatory policies and other obstacles that disproportionally
affect their communities.  These voters remain more likely to face long
lines at the polls and are disproportionately burdened by voter
identification laws and limited opportunities to vote by mail.  Limited
access to language assistance remains a barrier for many voters. People
with disabilities continue to face barriers to voting and are denied
legally required accommodations in exercising their fundamental rights
and the ability to vote privately and independently.  Members of our
military serving overseas, as well as other American citizens living
abroad, also face challenges to exercising their fundamental right to
vote.  
     The Constitution and laws of the United States prohibit racial
discrimination and protect the right to vote.  The Voting Rights Act of
1965 and other Federal statutes implement those protections and assign
the Federal Government a key role in remedying disenfranchisement and
unequal access to the polls.  In passing the National Voter Registration
Act of 1993, the Congress found that it is the duty of Federal, State,
and local governments to promote the exercise of the fundamental right
to vote.  Executive departments and agencies (agencies) should partner
with State, local, Tribal, and territorial election officials to protect
and promote the exercise of the right to vote, eliminate discrimination
and other barriers to voting, and expand access to voter registration
and accurate election information.  It is our duty to ensure that
registering to vote and the act of voting be made simple and easy for
all those eligible to do so.  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 2.  Policy.</span> 
It is the policy of my Administration to promote and defend the right to
vote for all Americans who are legally entitled to participate in
elections.  It is the responsibility of the Federal Government to expand
access to, and education about, voter registration and election
information, and to combat misinformation, in order to enable all
eligible Americans to participate in our democracy.  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 3.  Expanding Access
to Voter Registration and Election Information.</span>  Agencies shall
consider ways to expand citizens’ opportunities to register to vote and
to obtain information about, and participate in, the electoral
process.  
     (a)  The head of each agency shall evaluate ways in which the
agency can, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, promote
voter registration and voter participation.  This effort shall include
consideration of:  
(i)    ways to provide relevant information in the course of activities
or services that directly engage with the public — including through
agency materials, websites, online forms, social media platforms, and
other points of public access — about how to register to vote, how to
request a vote-by-mail ballot, and how to cast a ballot in upcoming
elections;  
(ii)   ways to facilitate seamless transition from agencies’ websites
directly to State online voter registration systems or appropriate
Federal websites, such as Vote.gov;  
(iii)  ways to provide access to voter registration services and
vote-by-mail ballot applications in the course of activities or services
that directly engage with the public, including:  
     (A)  distributing voter registration and vote-by-mail ballot
application forms, and providing access to applicable State online
systems for individuals who can take advantage of those systems;   
     (B)  assisting applicants in completing voter registration and
vote-by-mail ballot application forms in a manner consistent with all
relevant State laws; and  
     (C)  soliciting and facilitating approved, nonpartisan third-party
organizations and State officials to provide voter registration services
on agency premises;  
(iv)   ways to promote and expand access to multilingual voter
registration and election information, and to promote equal
participation in the electoral process for all eligible citizens
of all backgrounds; and  
(v)    whether, consistent with applicable law, any identity documents
issued by the agency to members of the public can be issued in a form
that satisfies State voter identification laws.  
     (b)  Within 200 days of the date of this order, the head of each
agency shall submit to the Assistant to the President for Domestic
Policy a strategic plan outlining the ways identified under this review
that the agency can promote voter registration and voter
participation.  
     (c)  The Administrator of the Office of Electronic Government,
Office of Management and Budget, shall, consistent with applicable law,
coordinate efforts across agencies to improve or modernize Federal
websites and digital services that provide election and voting
information to the American people, including ensuring that Federal
websites are accessible to individuals with disabilities and people with
limited English proficiency.  As appropriate, the Administrator of the
United States Digital Service may support agencies in implementing the
strategic plans directed in subsection (b) of this section.  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 4.  Acceptance of
Designation Under the National Voter Registration Act.</span>  (a)  This
order shall supersede section 3 of Executive Order 12926 of September
12, 1994 (Implementation of the National Voter Registration Act of
1993).  
     (b)  Each agency, if requested by a State to be designated as a
voter registration agency pursuant to section 7(a)(3)(B)(ii) of the
National Voter Registration Act, shall, to the greatest extent
practicable and consistent with applicable law, agree to such
designation.  If an agency declines to consent to such designation, the
head of the agency shall submit to the President a written explanation
for the decision.  
     (c)  The head of each agency shall evaluate where and how the
agency provides services that directly engage with the public and, to
the greatest extent practicable, formally notify the States in which the
agency provides such services that it would agree to designation as a
voter registration agency pursuant to section 7(a)(3)(B)(ii) of the
National Voter Registration Act.  
    <span style="text-decoration: underline"> Sec. 5.  Modernizing
Vote.gov.</span>  The General Services Administration (GSA) shall take
steps to modernize and improve the user experience of Vote.gov.  In
determining how to do so, GSA shall coordinate with the Election
Assistance Commission and other agencies as appropriate, and seek the
input of affected stakeholders, including election administrators, civil
rights and disability rights advocates, Tribal Nations, and nonprofit
groups that study best practices for using technology to promote civic
engagement.    
     (a)  GSA’s efforts to modernize and improve Vote.gov shall
include:  
(i)    ensuring that Vote.gov complies, at minimum, with sections 504
and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973;  
(ii)   ensuring that Vote.gov is translated into languages spoken by any
of the language groups covered under section 203 of the Voting Rights
Act anywhere in the United States; and  
(iii)  implementing relevant provisions of the 21st Century Integrated
Digital Experience Act (Public Law 115-336).  
     (b)  Within 200 days of the date of this order, GSA shall submit to
the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy a strategic plan
outlining the steps to modernize and improve the user experience of
Vote.gov.  
    <span style="text-decoration: underline"> Sec. 6.  Increasing
Opportunities for Employees to Vote.</span>  It is a priority of my
Administration to ensure that the Federal Government, as the Nation’s
largest employer, serves as a model employer by encouraging and
facilitating Federal employees’ civic participation.  Accordingly, the
Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall take the following
actions within 200 days of the date of this order:  
     (a)  coordinate with the heads of executive agencies, as defined in
5 U.S.C. 105, to provide recommendations to the President, through the
Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, on strategies to expand
the Federal Government’s policy of granting employees time off to vote
in Federal, State, local, Tribal, and territorial elections.  Such
recommendations should include efforts to ensure Federal employees have
opportunities to participate in early voting.  
     (b)  Coordinate with the heads of executive agencies, as defined in
5 U.S.C. 105, to provide recommendations to the President, through the
Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, on strategies to better
support Federal employees who wish to volunteer to serve as non-partisan
poll workers or non‑partisan observers, particularly during early or
extended voting periods.  
    <span style="text-decoration: underline"> Sec. 7.  Ensuring Equal
Access for Voters with Disabilities.  </span>Within 270 days of the date
of this order, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
within the Department of Commerce shall evaluate the steps needed to
ensure that the online Federal Voter Registration Form is accessible
to people with disabilities.  During that period, NIST, in consultation
with the Department of Justice, the Election Assistance Commission, and
other agencies, as appropriate, shall also analyze barriers to private
and independent voting for people with disabilities, including access to
voter registration, voting technology, voting by mail, polling
locations, and poll worker training.  By the end of the 270-day period,
NIST shall publish recommendations regarding both the Federal Voter
Registration Form and the other barriers it has identified.  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 8.  Ensuring Access
to Voting for Active Duty Military and Overseas Citizens.</span>  (a) 
Within 200 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense
shall establish procedures, consistent with applicable law, to
affirmatively offer, on an annual basis, each member of the Armed Forces
on active duty the opportunity to register to vote in Federal elections,
update voter registration information, or request an absentee ballot.  
     (b)  Within 200 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of
Defense shall evaluate the feasibility of implementing an online system
to facilitate the services described in subsection (a) of this
section.  
     (c)  The Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Department
of State, the Military Postal Service Agency, and the United States
Postal Service, shall take all practical steps to establish procedures
to enable a comprehensive end-to-end ballot tracking system for all
absentee ballots cast by military and other eligible overseas voters
under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, 52 U.S.C.
20301 *et seq*.  Within 200 days of the date of this order, the
Secretary of Defense shall submit a report to the Assistant to the
President for Domestic Policy with a strategic plan for establishing the
aforementioned tracking system.  
     (d)  The head of each agency with overseas employees shall
designate an employee to be responsible for coordinating with the
Federal Voting Assistance Program, including to promote voter
registration and voting services available to the agency’s overseas
employees.  The Director of the Office of Management and Budget may
issue guidance to assist agencies in making such designations.  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 9.  Ensuring Access
to Voter Registration for Eligible Individuals in Federal
Custody*.*</span>  (a)  The Attorney General shall establish procedures,
consistent with applicable law, to provide educational materials related
to voter registration and voting and, to the extent practicable, to
facilitate voter registration, for all eligible individuals in the
custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.  Such educational materials
shall be incorporated into the reentry planning procedures required
under section 4042(a)(7) of title 18, United States Code.  The
educational materials should also notify individuals leaving Federal
custody of the restrictions, if any, on their ability to vote under the
laws of the State where the individual resides and, if any such
restrictions exist, the point at which the individual’s rights will be
restored under applicable State law.  
     (b)  The Attorney General shall establish procedures, consistent

voting to all eligible individuals under the supervision of the
Probation and Pretrial Services Office, and to facilitate voter
registration and voting by such individuals.  
     (d)  The Attorney General shall take appropriate steps, consistent
with applicable law, to support formerly incarcerated individuals in
