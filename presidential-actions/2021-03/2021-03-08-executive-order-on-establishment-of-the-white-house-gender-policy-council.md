title: "Executive Order on Establishment of the White\_House Gender Policy\_Council"
---
 
     By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as
follows:  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">1.</span>  <span
style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  Advancing gender
equity and equality is a matter of human rights, justice, and fairness.
 It is also a strategic imperative that reduces poverty and promotes
economic growth, increases access to education, improves health
outcomes, advances political stability, and fosters democracy.  The full
participation of all people — including women and girls — across all
aspects of our society is essential to the economic well-being, health,
and security of our Nation and of the world.    
     It is therefore the policy of my Administration to establish and
pursue a comprehensive approach to ensure that the Federal Government is
working to advance equal rights and opportunities, regardless of gender
or gender identity, in advancing domestic and foreign policy — including
by promoting workplace diversity, fairness, and inclusion across the
Federal workforce and military.  This order is intended to advance
gender equity and equality, with sensitivity to the experiences of those
who suffer discrimination based on multiple factors, including
membership in an underserved community.   
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">2.</span>  <span
style="text-decoration: underline">The White House Gender Policy
Council. </span> (a)  There is established a White House Gender Policy
Council (Council) within the Executive Office of the President.   
     (b)  The Council shall coordinate Federal Government efforts to
advance gender equity and equality, including policies and programs
to:  
          (i)     combat systemic biases and discrimination, including
sexual harassment, and to support women’s human rights;  
          (ii)    increase economic security and opportunity
by addressing the structural barriers to women’s participation in the
labor force and by decreasing wage and wealth gaps;  
          (iii)   address the caregiving needs of American families and
support the care-workers they depend upon;  
          (iv)    support gender equity and combat gender stereotypes in
education, including promoting participation in science, technology,
engineering, and math (STEM) fields;  
          (v)     promote gender equity in leadership;  
          (vi)    increase access to comprehensive health care, address
health disparities, and promote sexual and reproductive health and

          (viii)  prevent and respond to all forms of gender‑based
violence;

development, trade, and defense;

<span style="text-decoration: underline"> Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">3.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">Government-Wide Strategy to Advance
Gender Equity and Equality.</span> (a) Within 200 days of the date of
this order, the Council, after coordination by the Co-Chairs, shall
develop and submit to the President a Government-wide strategy for
advancing gender equity and equality in the United States and, when
applicable, around the world (the “Strategy”).  The Strategy should
include recommendations on policies, programs, and initiatives that
should be proposed, passed, or implemented to advance gender equity and
equality in the United States and around the world.    
     (b)  Recognizing the gender and racial disparities that COVID-19
has both magnified and exacerbated, in formulating its recommendations
to address the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic
disruption on women and girls, the Council shall coordinate with the
White House Office of the COVID-19 Response and the COVID-19 Health
Equity Task Force, established by section 2 of Executive Order 13995 of
January 21, 2021 (Ensuring an Equitable Pandemic Response and
Recovery).  
     (c)  In developing the Strategy, the Council shall consider the
unique experiences and needs of women and girls who are also members of
other underserved communities.  In implementing this approach, the
Council shall work closely with the Domestic Policy Council, which
coordinates the interagency, whole-of-government strategy for advancing
equity, as set forth in Executive Order 13985 of January 20, 2021
(Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through
the Federal Government).  
    <span style="text-decoration: underline"> Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">4.</span>  <span
style="text-decoration: underline">Implementation.</span>  (a)  After
the Strategy has been submitted to the President, the heads of agencies,
or their designees, shall, in consultation with the Council and the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB), select certain of their
respective agency’s programs and policies for review for consistency
with the Strategy.  As appropriate and consistent with law, the heads
of agencies shall suspend, revise, or rescind, or publish for notice and
comment proposed rules suspending, revising, or rescinding, any
directives, orders, regulations, policies, or guidance inconsistent with
the Strategy.  As appropriate, the heads of agencies shall consult with
the Attorney General to the extent that any proposed actions require
consultation or review under Executive Order 12250 of November 2, 1980
(Leadership and Coordination of Nondiscrimination Laws).  As part of its
review, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International
Development shall, as appropriate and consistent with law, review the
2020 Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment Policy and revise or
rescind it as appropriate.  
     (b)  The Council shall coordinate a comprehensive, interagency
response to gender-based violence at home and abroad, including
intervention, prevention, and public health strategies to reduce
incidence and impacts.  The Special Assistant to the President and
Senior Advisor on Gender-Based Violence, working with the Executive
Director, shall create a National Action Plan to End Gender-Based
Violence that establishes a Government-wide approach to preventing and
addressing gender-based violence in the United States and shall work, in
conjunction with the Assistant to the President for National Security
Affairs, to lead a comprehensive, interagency review and update of the
2016 United States Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based
Violence Globally, as appropriate and consistent with law.  
     (c)  Following the submission of the Strategy developed pursuant to
section 3 of this order, the heads of agencies shall report to the
Council semi-annually, and the Council shall prepare an annual report
for submission to the President — a version of which shall be made
public — on progress made in implementing the Strategy.  
     (d)  The Council shall coordinate with the Domestic Policy Council,
OMB, and other agencies and offices to advance my Administration’s
efforts to achieve greater equity as set forth in Executive Order
13985.  In particular, among other things, the Council shall coordinate
with the Interagency Working Group on Equitable Data, established in
section 9 of Executive Order 13985.  
     (e)  The Council shall coordinate with the National Security
Council on all issues related to gender equality globally, including
women’s economic participation, health, and involvement in peace and
security efforts.  
     (f)  Consistent with section 6 of Executive Order 13985, the
Director of OMB shall identify opportunities to promote gender equity
and equality in the budget that the President submits to the Congress.  
     (g)  The heads of agencies, interagency working groups, and task
forces shall assist and provide information to the Council, as
appropriate and consistent with applicable law, as may be helpful to
carry out the functions of the Council.

style="text-decoration: underline"> Termination.</span>  The Working
Group created by section 2 of the Presidential Memorandum of February 7,
2019 (Promoting Women’s Global Development and Prosperity) (NSPM-16), is
terminated.  NSPM-16 is amended by substituting, in section 3(e), “the
Council” for “the Working Group”.  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span

style="text-decoration: underline">Definitions.</span>  (a)  The term
“equity” means the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial
treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to
underserved communities that have been denied such treatment, such as
women and girls; Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American
persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and other persons of
color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities;
persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely
affected by persistent poverty or inequality.  
     (b)  The term “underserved communities” refers to populations
sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities,
that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate
in aspects of economic, social, and civic life, as exemplified by the
list in the preceding definition of “equity.”  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">7.</span>  <span
style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions.</span>  (a)
 Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:  
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or  
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
     (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
