CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO SIGNIFICANT
MALICIOUS CYBER-ENABLED ACTIVITIES

On April 1, 2015, by Executive Order 13694, the President declared a
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq*.) to deal with the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and
economy of the United States constituted by the increasing prevalence
and severity of malicious cyber‑enabled activities originating from, or
directed by persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside
the United States.  On December 28, 2016, the President issued Executive
Order 13757 to take additional steps to address the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 13694.

These significant malicious cyber-enabled activities continue to pose an
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign
policy, and economy of the United States.  For this reason, the national
emergency declared on April 1, 2015, must continue in effect beyond
April 1, 2021.  Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13694. 

This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and transmitted
to the Congress.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
March 29, 2021.
