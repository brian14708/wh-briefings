title: A Proclamation on National Equal Pay Day, 2021
---
 
Equal Pay Day is a reminder of the work that still remains to advance
equity and ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to reach their
full potential.  This day is a symbolic representation of how far into
this year women must work to catch up to what men made in the previous
year.  Women working full-time, year-round are typically paid just 82
cents for every dollar paid to men.  It is a day that calls us to action
— to renew our commitment to the principles of equity and equal
opportunity that define who we are as Americans.  
   
Women lose thousands of dollars each year, and hundreds of thousands
over a lifetime, because of the gender and racial wage gap.  In 2019,
the typical woman who worked full time took home just 82 percent of the
typical man’s pay.  The disparities are even greater for Black, Native
American, and Hispanic women, who earned 63 percent, 60 percent, and 55
percent of white men’s wages, respectively.  While Asian American women
make 87 percent of what white men make, the gap for Asian women varies
significantly depending on subpopulation, with some Asian women — for
example, Cambodian and Vietnamese women — earning among the lowest
wages.  Those gaps mean we will not be marking Latinas’ Equal Pay Day
until October — because it takes that long for the average Latina to
earn what the average white man made in the previous year.  Since the
COVID-19 pandemic began, we have seen women, particularly women of
color, disproportionately working on the frontlines, caring for our
loved ones, and working to combat the virus — but they continue to earn
less than their male counterparts.  
   
The Biden-Harris Administration believes that ensuring equal pay is
essential to advancing America’s values of fairness and equity as well
as our economic strength here at home and our competitiveness abroad.
 The burdens and job losses women sustained this year have erased more
than 30 years of progress they have made in the labor force.  Due in
large part to the impact of the pandemic, there are 4.2 million fewer
women working now than there were in February 2020 — and millions more
women have had to reduce their hours, often in response to caregiving
demands that we know fall disproportionately on women.  America’s
economic recovery depends on us addressing the barriers that have
hampered women from fully participating in the labor force, resulting in
gender income and wealth gaps that have been magnified and exacerbated
by COVID-19.  
   
We must begin by passing the Paycheck Fairness Act, which will take
important steps towards the goal of ending pay discrimination.  For
instance, it will ban employers from seeking salary history — removing a
common false justification for under-paying women and people of color —
and it will hold employers accountable who engage in systemic
discrimination.  The bill will also work to ensure transparency and
reporting of disparities in wages, because the problem will never be
fixed if workers are kept in the dark about the fact that they are not
being paid fairly.  Relying on individuals to uncover unfair pay
practices on their own will not get the job done; when pay data is
available, workers can better advocate for fair pay and employers can
fix inequities.  
   
We must also provide paid family and medical leave, make schedules more
predictable and childcare more affordable, and build pipelines for
training that enable women to access higher-paying jobs.  This
commitment also means increasing pay for childcare workers, preschool
teachers, home health aides, and others in the care economy — and taking
additional steps to increase wages for American workers, such as raising
the minimum wage and empowering workers to organize and collectively
bargain, both of which are important to reducing the wage gap for
women.  
   
Vice President Harris and I are committed to building back better:  for
low-wage workers, for working families, and for all women.  There is
still significant work to be done to make sure our daughters receive the
same rights and opportunities as our sons, and that work is critical to
ensuring that every American is given a fair shot to get ahead in this
country.  Today, on Equal Pay Day, we recognize the role that equal pay
plays in building back better for everyone.  
   
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States
of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 24, 2021, as
National Equal Pay Day.  I call upon all Americans to recognize the full
value of women’s skills and their significant contributions to the labor
force, acknowledge the injustice of wage inequality, and join efforts to
achieve equal pay.  
   
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day
of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-fifth.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
