title: "Executive Order on Guaranteeing an Educational Environment Free from Discrimination\
  \ on the Basis of Sex, Including Sexual Orientation or Gender\_Identity"
---
 
    By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as
follows:  
    <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 1.  Policy.</span>
 It is the policy of my Administration that all students should be
guaranteed an educational environment free from discrimination on the
basis of sex, including discrimination in the form of sexual harassment,
which encompasses sexual violence, and including discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.  For students attending
schools and other educational institutions that receive Federal
financial assistance, this guarantee is codified, in part, in Title IX
of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq., which
prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs or
activities receiving Federal financial assistance.  
    <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 2.  Review of Agency
Actions.</span>  (a)  Within 100 days of the date of this order, the
Secretary of Education, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall
review all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies,
and any other similar agency actions (collectively, agency actions) that
are or may be inconsistent with the policy set forth in section 1 of
this order, and provide the findings of this review to the Director of
the Office of Management and Budget.    
        (i)    As part of the review required under subsection (a) of
this section, the Secretary of Education     shall review the rule
entitled “Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or
Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance,” 85 Fed. Reg. 30026
(May 19, 2020), and any other agency actions taken pursuant to that
rule, for consistency with governing law, including Title IX, and with
the policy set forth in section 1 of this order.   
        (ii)   As soon as practicable, and as appropriate and consistent
with applicable law, the Secretary of Education shall review existing
guidance and issue new guidance as needed on the implementation of the
rule described in subsection (a)(i) of this section, for consistency
with governing law, including Title IX, and with the policy set forth in
section 1 of this order.  
        (iii)  The Secretary of Education shall consider suspending,
revising, or rescinding — or publishing for notice and comment proposed
rules suspending, revising, or rescinding — those agency actions that
are inconsistent with the policy set forth in section 1 of this order as
soon as practicable and as appropriate and consistent with applicable
law, and may issue such requests for information as would facilitate
doing so.    
    (b)  The Secretary of Education shall consider taking additional
enforcement actions, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law,
to enforce the policy set forth in section 1 of this order as well as
legal prohibitions on sex discrimination in the form of sexual
harassment, which encompasses sexual violence, to the fullest extent
permissible under law; to account for intersecting forms of prohibited
discrimination that can affect the availability of resources and support
for students who have experienced sex discrimination, including
discrimination on the basis of race, disability, and national origin; to
account for the significant rates at which students who identify as
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) are subject to
sexual harassment, which encompasses sexual violence; to ensure that
educational institutions are providing appropriate support for students
who have experienced sex discrimination; and to ensure that their school
procedures are fair and equitable for all.  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 3.  General
Provisions.</span>  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to
impair or otherwise affect:  
        (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or
agency, or the head thereof; or  
        (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management
and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
    (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.   
    (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
