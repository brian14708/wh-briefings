MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES

SUBJECT:       Establishment of the White House Task Force to  
Address Online Harassment and Abuse

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, and in order to improve efforts to
prevent and address online harassment and abuse, it is hereby ordered as
follows:

Section 1.  Policy.  Technology platforms and social media can be vital
tools for expression, civic participation, and building a sense of
community.  But the scale, reach, and amplification effects of
technology platforms have also exacerbated gender-based violence,
particularly through online harassment and abuse.  Online harassment and
abuse include a broad array of harmful and sometimes illegal behaviors
that are perpetrated through the use of technology.  Women, adolescent
girls, and LGBTQI+ individuals, who may be additionally targeted because
of their race, ethnicity, religion, and other factors, can experience
more severe harms from online harassment and abuse.  Online harassment
and abuse take many forms, including the non-consensual distribution of
intimate digital images; cyberstalking; sextortion; doxing; malicious
deep fakes; gendered disinformation; rape and death threats; the online
recruitment and exploitation of victims of sex trafficking; and various
forms of technology-facilitated intimate partner abuse.  In the United
States, 1 in 3 women under the age of 35 reports having been sexually
harassed online, and over half of LGBTQI+ individuals report having been
the target of severe online abuse, including sustained harassment,
physical threats, and stalking in addition to sexual
harassment.  Globally, half of girls report that they are more likely to
be harassed through social media than on the street.

In the United States and around the world, women and LGBTQI+ political
leaders, public figures, activists, and journalists are especially
targeted by sexualized forms of online harassment and abuse, undermining
their ability to exercise their human rights and participate in
democracy, governance, and civic life.  Online abuse and harassment,
which aim to preclude women from political decision-making about their
own lives and communities, undermine the functioning of
democracy.  Growing evidence also demonstrates that online
radicalization can be linked to gender-based violence, which, along with
other forms of abuse and harassment, spans the digital and physical
realms.  Online harassment and abuse can result in a range of dire
consequences for victims, from psychological distress and
self-censorship to economic losses, disruptions to education, increased
self-harm, suicide, homicide, and other forms of physical and sexual
violence.  Further, digital technologies are often used in concert with
other forms of abuse and harassment, underscoring the urgency of
addressing the interplay of in-person and online harms.  More research
is needed to fully understand the nature, magnitude, and costs of these
harms and ways to address them in the United States and globally.

Therefore, I am directing the Director of the White House Gender Policy
Council and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs
to lead an interagency effort to address online harassment and abuse,
specifically focused on technology-facilitated gender-based violence,
and to develop concrete recommendations to improve prevention, response,
and protection efforts through programs and policies in the United
States and globally.

Sec. 2.  Establishment.  There is established within the Executive
Office of the President the White House Task Force to Address Online
Harassment and Abuse (Task Force).
