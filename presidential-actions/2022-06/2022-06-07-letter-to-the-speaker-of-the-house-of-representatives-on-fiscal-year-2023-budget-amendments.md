Dear Madam Speaker:

I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 Budget
amendments for the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Health and Human
Services, the Interior, Justice, Labor, and Transportation, as well as
the Commission of Fine Arts.  These amendments are necessary to
correctly reflect policies assumed in my FY 2023 Budget.  These
amendments would increase by $85 million the overall discretionary
budget authority in my FY 2023 Budget.

In addition, provided for your consideration is an amendment for the
Department of Energy’s Defense Environmental Cleanup account.  The
amendment would increase funding provided for the account by
$191 million in order to increase amounts for specific cleanup efforts
from the levels secured for the program in the Consolidated
Appropriations Act, 2022.  Also included for your consideration is an
amendment that would increase the authorization of appropriations
provided by the Water Resources Development Act of 2000, as amended, for
the Las Vegas Wash wetlands restoration and Lake Mead improvement
project.

This transmittal also contains eight FY 2023 Budget amendments for the
Legislative Branch.  As a matter of comity and tradition, these
appropriations requests for the Legislative Branch are transmitted
without change.  These amendments would increase by $2 million the
overall discretionary budget authority in my FY 2023 Budget.

Taken together, the transmitted amendments would increase by
$278 million the overall discretionary budget authority in my FY 2023
Budget.

The details of this proposal are set forth in the enclosed letter from
the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.

                               Sincerely,

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
