By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the

Courts-Martial, United States, prescribed by Executive Order 12473 of
April 13, 1984, as amended, it is hereby ordered as follows:  
  
     Section 1.  Parts II and IV of the Manual for Courts-Martial,
United States, are amended as described in the Annex attached to and
made a part of this order.  
  
     Sec. 2.  These amendments shall take effect as of the date of this

or other action begun prior to the date of this order, and any such
nonjudicial punishment, restraint, investigation, referral of charges,
trial, or other action may proceed in the same manner and with the same
effect as if these amendments had not been prescribed.
