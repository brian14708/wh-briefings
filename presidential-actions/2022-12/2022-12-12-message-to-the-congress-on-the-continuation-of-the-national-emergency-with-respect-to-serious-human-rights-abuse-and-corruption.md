title: "Message to the Congress on the Continuation of the National Emergency With\
  \ Respect to Serious Human Rights Abuse and\_Corruption"

TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:  
  
     Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13818
of December 20, 2017, is to continue in effect beyond December 20, 2022.

     The prevalence and severity of human rights abuse and corruption
that have their source, in whole or in substantial part, outside the
United States, continue to threaten the stability of international
political and economic systems.  Human rights abuse and corruption
undermine the values that form an essential foundation of stable,
secure, and functioning societies; have devastating impacts on
individuals; weaken democratic institutions; degrade the rule of law;
perpetuate violent conflicts; facilitate the activities of dangerous
persons; undermine economic markets; and continue to pose an unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and
economy of the United States. 

     Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13818 with respect to
serious human rights abuse and corruption.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
December 12, 2022.
