title: "A Proclamation on Wright Brothers Day,\_2022"
---
 
     On Wright Brothers Day, we celebrate the ingenuity and perseverance
of Orville and Wilbur Wright, whose aircraft expanded the limits of
human discovery and lifted this Nation to new heights.  

     From their home in Dayton, Ohio, the Wright Brothers were
captivated — “afflicted,” in Wilbur’s words — by the belief that humans
could fly.  They researched and experimented, redesigned and repaired,
and braved dangerous early trials.  When their Wright Flyer finally took
to the skies over Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on December 17, 1903, they
launched the future of aviation and helped define the American spirit:
 bold, daring, innovative, and always asking what is next.

     That same spirit has delivered ground-breaking discoveries in
American air and space technology for almost 120 years.  America has
broken the sound barrier, put a man on the moon, collaborated to create
the International Space Station, and achieved powered flight on Mars. 
Just last year, we launched the most powerful deep-space telescope ever
sent into space and gained a new window into the history of our
universe. 

     We are also carrying on the Wright Brothers’ legacy by always
striving for better safety and comfort in air travel.  Our Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law is investing $25 billion to renovate airport
terminals; upgrade air traffic control facilities; and improve runways,
taxiways, and other vital infrastructure that make flying easier and
more secure.  We have pushed airlines to rebook travelers’ tickets for
free when flights are significantly delayed or canceled, and to disclose
fees, like for checked baggage, clearly and up front.  And we are
exploring new technologies that can decrease carbon emissions coming
from airplanes.

     As inheritors of game-changing innovations and torch-bearers of the
spirit of American ingenuity, we have so much to be proud of and so much
to look forward to.  We can lead the world in the technologies of
tomorrow, change the course of human health and disease, tackle the
climate crisis, and continue shaping a fairer, more equitable planet. 
With shared purpose, unyielding faith in our future, and a drive to make
the impossible possible, there is nothing beyond our capacity.  I have
never been more optimistic about our Nation’s future –- especially in
our skies and in space.

     The Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 17, 1963, as
amended (77 Stat. 402; 36 U.S.C. 143), has designated December 17 of
each year as “Wright Brothers Day” and has authorized and requested the
President to issue annually a proclamation inviting the people of the
United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and
activities.

     NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United
States of America, do hereby proclaim December 17, 2022, as Wright
Brothers Day.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
sixteenth day of December, in the year of our Lord
two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States
of America the two hundred and forty-seventh.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
