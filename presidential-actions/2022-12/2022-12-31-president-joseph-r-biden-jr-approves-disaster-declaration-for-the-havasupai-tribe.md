Federal funding is available to the Havasupai Tribe and certain private
nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and
the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the flooding.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures for the Havasupai Tribe.
