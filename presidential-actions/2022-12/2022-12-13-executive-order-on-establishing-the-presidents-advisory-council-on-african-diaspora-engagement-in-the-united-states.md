title: "Executive Order on Establishing the President\u2019s Advisory Council on African\
  \ Diaspora Engagement in the United\_States"
---
 
     By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States of America, and in order to strengthen the
dialogue between United States officials and the African Diaspora by
elevating engagement through collaboration, partnership, and
community-building among the United States, Africa, and other nations
globally, it is hereby ordered as follows:  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 1</span>.  <span
style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  The United States has
a longstanding commitment to engagement with the African Diaspora —
people of native African origin living outside the African continent,
and who have been collectively described as constituting the sixth
region of the African Union.  The African Diaspora in the United States
is a source of strength, and encompasses African Americans — including
descendants of enslaved Africans — and nearly two million African
immigrants who have close familial, social, and economic connections to
the African continent.  African Americans have been foundational to
strengthening United States-Africa relations and in shaping United
States foreign policy toward Africa — including by actively advocating
on the African continent’s behalf, even as they struggled for civil
rights in the United States.  The African immigrant community continues
to make significant contributions to America’s growth and prosperity.
 The United States Government encourages efforts to advance equity and
opportunity for the African Diaspora in the United States, and will
continue to encourage efforts to strengthen cultural, social, political,
and economic ties between African communities, the global African
Diaspora, and the United States.  
  
     In August 2022, my Administration released the U.S. Strategy Toward
Sub-Saharan Africa, which outlines our foreign policy objectives to
bolster relations with African nations, listen to diverse local voices,
and widen the circle of engagement to advance our strategic objectives
for the benefit of both Africans and Americans.    
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span
style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.  <span
style="text-decoration: underline">Establishment of the President’s
Advisory Council on African Diaspora Engagement in the United
States</span>.  Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary
of State shall establish the President’s Advisory Council on African
Diaspora Engagement in the United States (Advisory Council) within the
Department of State.  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span

Council shall consist of not more than 12 members, appointed by the
Secretary of State, who are representatives of and reflect the diversity
of the African Diaspora from African American and African immigrant
communities, including individuals who have distinguished themselves in
government, sports, creative industries, business, academia, social
work, and faith-based activities.  Appointments to the Advisory Council
shall be made without regard to political affiliation.  
     (b)  Members of the Advisory Council shall serve for 2-year terms
without compensation or reimbursement.  
     (c)  The Secretary of State shall designate one of the members of
the Advisory Council to serve as Chair.

style="text-decoration: underline">Functions</span>.  (a)  The Advisory
Council shall advise the President, through the Secretary of State, and
then through the Assistant to the President for National Security
Affairs (APNSA) and the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy
(APDP), on strengthening connections between the United
States Government and the African Diaspora in the United States, as
described in the U.S. Strategy Toward Sub‑Saharan Africa.  
     (b)  In providing the advice described in subsection (a) of this
section, the Advisory Council shall provide information, analysis, and
recommendations that address the following, in addition to other topics
deemed relevant by the Secretary of State, in coordination with the
APNSA and the APDP:  
          (i) strategies to advance equity and opportunity for African
Diaspora communities, including through efforts coordinated by the
Domestic Policy Council under Executive Order 13985 of January 20, 2021
(Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through
the Federal Government);  
          (ii) ways to support the United Nations’ Permanent Forum on
People of African Descent;  
          (iii) programs and initiatives to strengthen cultural, social,
political, and economic ties between African communities, the global
African Diaspora, and the United States, such as the Young African
Leaders Initiative, and address challenges and opportunities to advance
inclusion, belonging, and public awareness of the diversity,
accomplishments, culture, and history of the African Diaspora;  
          (iv) programs and initiatives, such as the International
Visitor Leadership Program, to expand educational exchange programs
between Africa and the United States;  
          (v) programs and initiatives to increase public- and
private-sector collaboration and community involvement in improving the
socioeconomic well‑being of African Diaspora communities; and  
          (vi) programs and initiatives, such as Prosper Africa, to
increase participation of members of the African Diaspora in the United
States with regard to trade, investment, economic growth, and
development programs relating to Africa.

Insofar as the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C.

the President under the Act, except for those in section 6 of the Act,

entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
