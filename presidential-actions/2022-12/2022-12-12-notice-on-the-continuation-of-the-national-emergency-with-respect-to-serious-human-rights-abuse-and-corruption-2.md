title: "Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Serious\
  \ Human Rights Abuse and\_Corruption"
---
 
     On December 20, 2017, by Executive Order 13818, the President
declared a national emergency with respect to serious human rights abuse
and corruption around the world and, pursuant to the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*), took related
steps to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national
security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.

     The prevalence and severity of human rights abuse and corruption
that have their source, in whole or in substantial part, outside the
United States, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to
the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United
States.  For this reason, the national emergency declared on December
20, 2017, must continue in effect beyond December 20, 2022.  Therefore,
in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 13818 with respect to serious human rights
abuse and corruption.

     This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and
transmitted to the Congress.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
   December 12, 2022.
