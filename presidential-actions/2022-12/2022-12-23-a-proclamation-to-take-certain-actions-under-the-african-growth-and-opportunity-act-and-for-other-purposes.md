title: "A Proclamation To Take Certain Actions Under the African Growth and Opportunity\
  \ Act and for Other\_Purposes"
---
 
1.  In Proclamation 7853 of December 10, 2004, the President designated
    Burkina Faso as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for
    purposes of section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended
    (the “Trade Act”), as added by section 111(a) of the African Growth
    and Opportunity Act (the “AGOA”) (title I of Public Law 106-200, 114
    Stat. 251, 257-58 (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(1))).
2.  Section 506A(a)(3) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(3)) provides
    that the President shall terminate the designation of a country as a
    beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of section 506A
    if the President determines that the country is not making continual
    progress in meeting the requirements described in section 506A(a)(1)
    of the Trade Act.
3.  Pursuant to section 506A(a)(3) of the Trade Act, I have determined
    that Burkina Faso does not meet the requirements described in
    section 506A(a)(1) of that Act. Accordingly, I have decided to
    terminate the designation of Burkina Faso as a beneficiary
    sub-Saharan African country for purposes of section 506A of the
    Trade Act, effective January 1, 2023.
4.  On April 22, 1985, the United States and Israel entered into the
    Agreement on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area between the
    Government of the United States of America and the Government of
    Israel (USIFTA), which the Congress approved in section 3 of the
    United States–Israel Free Trade Area Implementation Act of 1985 (the
    “USIFTA Implementation Act”) (Public Law 99-47, 99 Stat. 82 (19
    U.S.C. 2112 note)). Section 4(b) of the USIFTA Implementation Act
    provides that, whenever the President determines that it is
    necessary to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually
    advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the
    USIFTA, the President may proclaim such withdrawal, suspension,
    modification, or continuance of any duty, or such continuance of
    existing duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties,
    as the President determines to be required or appropriate to carry
    out the USIFTA. In order to maintain the general level of reciprocal
    and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to agricultural
    trade with Israel, on July 27, 2004, the United States entered into
    an agreement with Israel concerning certain aspects of trade in
    agricultural products during the period January 1, 2004, through
    December 31, 2008 (United States-Israel Agreement Concerning Certain
    Aspects of Trade in Agricultural Products (the “2004 Agreement”)).
5.  In Proclamation 7826 of October 4, 2004, the President determined,
    pursuant to section 4(b) of the USIFTA Implementation Act and
    consistent with the 2004 Agreement, that, in order to maintain the
    general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions
    with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, it was necessary
    to provide duty-free access into the United States through December
    31, 2008, for specified quantities of certain agricultural products
    of Israel. Each year from 2008 through 2021, the United States and
    Israel entered into agreements to extend the period that the 2004
    Agreement was in force for 1-year periods to allow additional time
    for the two governments to conclude an agreement to replace the 2004
    Agreement. To carry out the extension agreements, the President in
    Proclamations 8334 of December 31, 2008; 8467 of December 23, 2009;
    8618 of December 21, 2010; 8770 of December 29, 2011; 8921 of
    December 20, 2012; 9072 of December 23, 2013; 9223 of December 23,
    2014; 9383 of December 21, 2015; 9555 of December 15, 2016; 9687 of
    December 22, 2017; 9834 of December 21, 2018; 9974 of December 26,
    2019; 10128 of December 22, 2020; and 10326 of December 23, 2021,
    modified the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS)
    to provide duty-free access into the United States for specified
    quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel, each time for
    an additional 1-year period. On December 8, 2022, the United States
    entered into an agreement with Israel to extend the period that the
    2004 Agreement is in force through December 31, 2023, and to allow
    for further negotiations on an agreement to replace the 2004
    Agreement. Pursuant to section 4(b) of the USIFTA Implementation
    Act, I have determined that it is necessary, in order to maintain
    the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous
    concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, to
    provide duty-free access into the United States through the close of
    December 31, 2023, for specified quantities of certain agricultural
    products of Israel, as provided in Annex I of this proclamation.
6.  Proclamation 7971 of December 22, 2005, implemented the United
    States-Morocco Free Trade Agreement (USMFTA) with respect to the
    United States and, pursuant to section 201 of the United
    States-Morocco Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the “USMFTA
    Act”) (19 U.S.C. 3805 note), made the staged reductions in rates of
    duty that the President determined to be necessary or appropriate to
    carry out or apply articles 2.3, 2.5, 2.6, 4.1, 4.3.9, 4.3.10,
    4.3.11, 4.3.13, 4.3.14, and 4.3.15, and the schedule of duty
    reductions with respect to Morocco set forth in Annex IV of the
    USMFTA.
7.  Section 1205(a) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988
    (the “1988 Act”) (19 U.S.C. 3005(a)) directs the United States
    International Trade Commission (the “Commission”) to keep the HTS
    under continuous review and periodically to recommend to the
    President such modifications to the HTS as the Commission considers
    necessary or appropriate to accomplish the purposes set forth in
    that subsection. Pursuant to sections 1205(c) and (d) of the 1988
    Act (19 U.S.C. 3005(c) and (d)), in 2016 and 2021 the Commission
    recommended modifications to the HTS to conform the HTS to
    amendments made to the International Convention on the Harmonized
    Commodity Description and Coding System and the Protocol thereto
    (the “Convention”).
8.  Section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)) authorizes the
    President to proclaim modifications to the HTS based on the
    recommendations of the Commission under section 1205 of the 1988 Act
    if the President determines that the modifications are in conformity
    with United States obligations under the Convention and do not run
    counter to the national economic interest of the United States.
9.  Proclamation 9549 of December 1, 2016, and Proclamation 10326 of
    December 23, 2021, modified the HTS pursuant to section 1206 of the
    1988 Act to conform the HTS to the amendments to the Convention.
    However, the HTS modifications authorized in Proclamation 9549 and
    Proclamation 10326 included certain technical errors.
10. I have determined that additional modifications to the HTS are
    necessary or appropriate to carry out the staged reductions in rates
    of duty previously proclaimed in Proclamation 7971, including
    certain technical or conforming changes within the tariff schedule.
11. Section 604 of the Trade Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483),
    authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the
    relevant provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import
    treatment, and actions taken thereunder, including the removal,
    modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or
    other import restriction.  
      
    NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United
    States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the
    Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including
    but not limited to section 111(a) of the AGOA, sections 506A(a)(1)
    and 506A(a)(3) of the Trade Act, section 4(b) of the USIFTA
    Implementation Act, and section 604 of the Trade Act, as amended, do
    proclaim that:  
      
    (1) The designation of Burkina Faso as a beneficiary sub-Saharan
    African country for purposes of section 506A of the Trade Act is
    terminated, effective January 1, 2023.  
      
    (2) In order to reflect in the HTS that beginning January 1, 2023,
    Burkina Faso shall no longer be designated as a beneficiary
    sub-Saharan African country, general note 16(a) to the HTS is
    modified by deleting “Burkina Faso” from the list of beneficiary
    sub-Saharan African countries. Note 7(a) to subchapter II and note 1
    to subchapter XIX of chapter 98 of the HTS are each modified by
    deleting “Burkina Faso,” from the list of beneficiary countries.
    Further, note 2(d) to subchapter XIX of chapter 98 of the HTS is
    modified by deleting “Burkina Faso;” from the list of lesser
    developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries.  
      
    (3) The modifications to the HTS set forth in paragraphs (1)
    through (2) of this proclamation shall be effective with respect to
    goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for
    consumption, on or after January 1, 2023.  
      
    (4) In order to implement tariff commitments under the 2004
    Agreement through December 31, 2023, the HTS is modified as set
    forth in Annex I of this proclamation.  
      
    (5) The modifications and technical rectifications to the HTS made
    by Annex I of this proclamation shall enter into effect on the
    applicable dates set forth in Annex I of this proclamation.  
      
    (6) In order to make the modifications and technical rectifications
    to the HTS described in clauses 6 through 11 of this proclamation,
    the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex II of this proclamation.
    These modifications and technical rectifications shall enter into
    effect on the applicable dates set forth in Annex II of this
    proclamation.  
      
    (7) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders
    that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation
    are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.  
      
    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
    twenty-third day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand
    twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America
    the two hundred and forty-seventh.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
