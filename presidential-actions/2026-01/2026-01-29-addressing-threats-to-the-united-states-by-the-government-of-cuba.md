title: Addressing Threats to the United States by the Government of Cuba
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) (IEEPA), the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq*.) (NEA), and section
301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby determine and order:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">National Emergency</span>.  As
President of the United States, I have an imperative duty to protect the
national security and foreign policy of this country.  I find that the
policies, practices, and actions of the Government of Cuba constitute an
unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or
substantial part outside the United States, to the national security and
foreign policy of the United States.

The Government of Cuba has taken extraordinary actions that harm and
threaten the United States.  The regime aligns itself with — and
provides support for — numerous hostile countries, transnational
terrorist groups, and malign actors adverse to the United States,
including the Government of the Russian Federation (Russia), the
People’s Republic of China (PRC), the Government of Iran, Hamas, and
Hezbollah.  For example, Cuba blatantly hosts dangerous adversaries of
the United States, inviting them to base sophisticated military and
intelligence capabilities in Cuba that directly threaten the national
security of the United States.  Cuba hosts Russia’s largest overseas
signals intelligence facility, which tries to steal sensitive national
security information of the United States.  Cuba continues to build deep
intelligence and defense cooperation with the PRC.  Cuba welcomes
transnational terrorist groups, such as Hezbollah and Hamas, creating a
safe environment for these malign groups so that these transnational
terrorist groups can build economic, cultural, and security ties
throughout the region and attempt to destabilize the Western Hemisphere,
including the United States.  Cuba has long provided defense,
intelligence, and security assistance to adversaries in the Western
Hemisphere, attempting to thwart United States and international
sanctions designed to enforce the stability of the region, uphold the
rule of law, and safeguard the national security and foreign policy of
the United States.  Cuba continues to try to thwart United States
efforts to address threats to the United States posed by hostile
countries, transnational terrorist groups, and malign actors, including
in the Western Hemisphere. 

Further, contrary to the interests and foreign policy of the United
States, the Cuban communist regime supports terrorism and destabilizes
the region through migration and violence.  The communist regime
persecutes and tortures its political opponents; denies the Cuban people
free speech and press; corruptly profits from their misery; and commits
other human-rights violations.  For example, families of political
prisoners face retaliation for peacefully protesting the improper
confinement of their loved ones.  Cuban authorities harass worshippers,
block free association by civil society organizations, prohibit free
press, and deny the ability to speak freely, including on the internet.
 The Cuban regime continues to spread its communist ideas, policies, and
practices around the Western Hemisphere, threatening the foreign policy
of the United States.  

The United States has zero tolerance for the depredations of the
communist Cuban regime.  The United States will act to protect the
foreign policy, national security, and national interests of the United
States, including by holding the Cuban regime accountable for its malign
actions and relationships, while also remaining committed to supporting
the Cuban people’s aspirations for a free and democratic society.

I find that the policies, practices, and actions of the Government of
Cuba directly threaten the safety, national security, and foreign policy
of the United States.  The policies, practices, and actions of the
Government of Cuba are designed to harm the United States and support
hostile countries, transnational terrorist groups, and malign actors
that seek to destroy the United States.  The policies, practices, and
actions of the Government of Cuba are also repugnant to the moral and
political values of democratic and free societies and conflict with the
foreign policy of the United States to encourage peaceful change in Cuba
and to promote democracy, the principle of free expression and press,
the rule of law, and respect for human rights throughout the world.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, find that the situation with respect to Cuba constitutes an
unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or
substantial part outside the United States, to the national security and
foreign policy of the United States and hereby declare a national
emergency with respect to that threat. 

To deal with the national emergency declared in this order, I determine
that it is necessary and appropriate to establish a tariff system, as
described below.  Under this system, an additional *ad valorem* duty may
be imposed on imports of goods that are products of a foreign country
that directly or indirectly sells or otherwise provides any oil to
Cuba.  In my judgment, the tariff system, as described below, is
necessary and appropriate to address the national emergency declared in
this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Imposition of Tariffs</span>. 
(a)  Beginning on the effective date of this order, an additional *ad
valorem* rate of duty may be imposed on goods imported into the United
States that are products of any other country that directly or
indirectly sells or otherwise provides any oil to Cuba, in accordance
with subsections (b) and (c) of this section.

(b)(i)  The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of
State and any senior official the Secretary of Commerce deems
appropriate, shall determine whether, after the effective date of this
order, a foreign country directly or indirectly sells or otherwise
provides any oil to Cuba.  After the Secretary of Commerce finds that a
foreign country directly or indirectly sells or otherwise provides any
oil to Cuba, the Secretary of Commerce shall inform the Secretary of
State of his finding, including any information relevant to that
finding. 

(ii)  The Secretary of Commerce may issue rules, regulations, and
guidance necessary or appropriate to implement this order.  The
Secretary of Commerce may also make any other determinations or take any
other actions necessary or appropriate to implement this order.

(c)(i)  After the Secretary of Commerce makes an affirmative finding
pursuant to subsection (b)(i) of this section and informs the Secretary
of State of his finding, the Secretary of State, in consultation with
the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary
of Homeland Security, and the United States Trade Representative, shall
determine whether and to what extent an additional *ad valorem* rate of
duty should be imposed on goods that are products of the foreign country
found to directly or indirectly sell or otherwise provide any oil to
Cuba.

\(ii\)   If the Secretary of State determines that an additional *ad
valorem* rate of duty should be imposed on goods that are products of
the country found to directly or indirectly sell or otherwise provide
any oil to Cuba, the Secretary of State shall inform me of his
recommendation, and the Secretary of Commerce shall inform me of his
finding related to that recommendation.  I will then consider the
recommendation and finding, among other relevant things, in determining
whether and to what extent to impose an additional *ad valorem* rate of
duty on goods that are products of the country in question.

(iii)  The Secretary of State may issue rules, regulations, and guidance
necessary or appropriate to implement this order.  The Secretary of
State may also make any other determinations or take any other actions
necessary or appropriate to implement this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Modification Authority</span>. 
(a)  To ensure that the national emergency declared in this order is
dealt with, I may modify this order, including in light of additional
information, recommendations from senior officials, or changed
circumstances.

(b)  Should a foreign country retaliate against the United States in
response to this order or any action taken pursuant to this order, I may
modify this order or actions taken pursuant to this order to ensure the
efficacy of this order and the actions taken pursuant to this order to
deal with the national emergency declared in this order. 

(c)  Should the Government of Cuba or another foreign country affected
by this order take significant steps to address the national emergency
declared in this order and align sufficiently with the United States on
national security and foreign policy matters, I may modify this order. 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Monitoring and
Recommendations</span>.  (a)  The Secretary of State, in consultation
with any senior official the Secretary of State deems appropriate, shall
monitor the circumstances involving the national emergency declared in
this order.  The Secretary of State shall inform me of any circumstance
that, in his opinion, might indicate the need for further Presidential
action to deal with the national emergency declared in this order.

(b)  The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the
Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security,
the United States Trade Representative, and any other senior official
the Secretary of State deems appropriate, shall recommend to me
additional action, if necessary, if the actions in this order or taken
pursuant to this order are not effective in dealing with the national
emergency declared in this order.

(c)  The Secretary of Commerce shall monitor whether a foreign country
directly or indirectly sells or otherwise provides any oil to Cuba.  The
Secretary of Commerce shall continue such monitoring after a foreign
country has been found to do so.
