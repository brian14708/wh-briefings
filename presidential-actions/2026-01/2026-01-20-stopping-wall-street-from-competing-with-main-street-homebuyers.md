title: Stopping Wall Street from Competing with Main Street Homebuyers
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose and Policy</span>.
 Buying and owning a home has long been considered the pinnacle of the
American dream and a way for families to invest and build lifetime
wealth.  But because of the recent high inflation and interest rates
caused by the previous administration, that American dream has been
increasingly out of reach for too many of our citizens, especially
first-time homebuyers.  

At the same time, a growing share of single-family homes, often
concentrated in certain communities, have been purchased by large Wall
Street investors, crowding out families seeking to buy homes.
 Hardworking young families cannot effectively compete for starter homes
with Wall Street firms and their vast resources.  Neighborhoods and
communities once controlled by middle-class American families are now
run by faraway corporate interests.  People live in homes, not
corporations.  My Administration will take decisive action to stop Wall
Street from treating America’s neighborhoods like a trading floor and
empower American families to own their homes.

To preserve the supply of single-family homes for American families and
increase the paths to homeownership, it is the policy of my
Administration that large institutional investors should not buy
single-family homes that could otherwise be purchased by families.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Definitions</span>.  Within 30
days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury shall
develop, in consultation with the Assistant to the President for
Economic Policy, definitions of “large institutional investor” and
“single-family home” for the purpose of implementing this order, which
other executive departments and agencies (agencies) may adopt as
required for such implementation.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Restrictions on the Sale of
Single-Family Homes by the Federal Government</span>.  (a)  Within 60
days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Agriculture, the
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary of Veterans
Affairs, the Administrator of General Services, and the Director of the
Federal Housing Finance Agency, as appropriate, shall issue guidance to:

\(i\)   prevent agencies and Government-sponsored enterprises from
engaging in the following, to the maximum extent permitted by law:

\(A\)  providing for, approving, insuring, guaranteeing, securitizing,
or facilitating the acquisition by a large institutional investor of a
single-family home that could otherwise be purchased by an individual
owner-occupant; or

\(B\)  disposing of Federal assets in a manner that transfers a
single-family home to a large institutional investor; and

\(ii\)  promote sales to individual owner-occupants, including through
anti-circumvention provisions, first-look policies, and disclosure
requirements.

\(b\)  The guidance issued pursuant to subsection (a)(i) of this section
shall include appropriate, narrowly tailored exceptions for
build-to-rent properties that are planned, permitted, financed, and
constructed as rental communities, and such other appropriate, narrowly
tailored exceptions as the applicable agency may determine appropriate
to further the policies of my Administration.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Additional Measures to Combat
Speculation in Single-Family Housing Markets by Large Institutional
Investors</span>.  (a)  The Secretary of the Treasury shall review the
rules and guidance that relate to large institutional investors
acquiring or holding single-family homes and consider revising them, in
accordance with applicable law, if appropriate to advance the policy set
forth in section 1 of this order.

\(b\)  The Attorney General and the Chairman of the Federal Trade
Commission shall review substantial acquisitions, including series of
acquisitions, by large institutional investors of single-family homes in
local single-family housing markets for anti-competitive effects and
prioritize enforcement of the antitrust laws, as appropriate, against
coordinated vacancy and pricing strategies by large institutional
investors in local single-family home rental markets.

\(c\)  The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall, to the
maximum extent permitted by law, require owners and managing agents of
single-family home rentals participating in Federal housing assistance
programs to disclose to the Department of Housing and Urban Development
direct or indirect owners, managers, or affiliates, including changes in
ownership or control of single-family rentals, to the extent necessary
to determine any involvement of large institutional investors. 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Legislation</span>.  The
Deputy Chief of Staff for Legislative, Political and Public Affairs
shall prepare a legislative recommendation to codify the policy set
forth in section 1 of this order so that large institutional investors
do not acquire single-family homes that could otherwise be purchased by
families.

Sec. 6.  Severability.  If any provision of this order, or the
application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to
be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its
provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected
thereby.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">7</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.
 (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

\(i\)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or
agency, or the head thereof; or

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

\(c\)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

\(d\)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Department of the Treasury.
