title: Celebrating American Greatness with American Motor Racing
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose and Policy</span>.  For
over 100 years, American INDYCAR racing has set the pace for motor
sports.  With speeds topping over 200 miles per hour, the cars and
drivers inspire awe and respect in all who watch this quintessentially
American sport.  It has given us racing legends such as A.J. Foyt and
Mario Andretti, and continues to thrill every Memorial Day weekend when
people travel from across the globe to the Indianapolis 500, the largest
single-day sporting event in the world.

INDYCAR racing is a source of pride and entertainment for our Nation,
which is why I am pleased to announce the Freedom 250 Grand Prix in
Washington, D.C.  This race, the first motor race ever to be held in our
Nation’s capital near the National Mall, will showcase the majesty of
our great city as drivers navigate a track around our iconic national
monuments in celebration of America’s 250th birthday.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Designating the Race
Route</span>.  Within 14 days of the date of this order, the Secretary
of the Interior and the Secretary of Transportation shall designate a
route through Washington, D.C., that is suitable for conducting an
INDYCAR street race and that will showcase the majesty of our capital
city in celebration of the 250th anniversary of America’s independence.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Permits and Approvals</span>.
 The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Transportation shall
take steps to ensure that all permits, approvals, and other
authorizations as are necessary to plan, prepare for, and conduct the
Freedom 250 Grand Prix are issued and granted as expeditiously as
possible.  Such steps may include the Secretary of the Interior
considering the Freedom 250 Grand Prix to be a “special event” under 36
C.F.R. 7.96(g), as amended by 90 *Fed. Reg.* 25498 (temporary rule re:
 National Capital Region; America250 Events), if the Secretary of the
Interior deems it necessary and appropriate.  The Secretary of
Transportation shall use available funds to help facilitate the
presentation of the race, consistent with applicable law and as deemed
appropriate by the Secretary of Transportation, and, working with and
through the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, take
steps to ensure that unmanned aircraft systems and other means of aerial
photography may be utilized by appropriately permitted individuals to
enhance the public’s enjoyment of the race and to celebrate the beauty
of the Nation’s capital without compromising nearby Government
facilities.  The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of
Transportation, in coordination with the Mayor of Washington, D.C., as
needed, shall ensure that any roads, trails, or bridges to be used as
part of the race course are properly maintained and capable of being
used in such a manner.

<u>Sec</u>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. 
(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

\(c\)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
