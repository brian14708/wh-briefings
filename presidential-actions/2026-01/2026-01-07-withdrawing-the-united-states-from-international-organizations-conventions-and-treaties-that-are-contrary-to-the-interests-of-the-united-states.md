MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  (a)  On
February 4, 2025, I issued Executive Order 14199 (Withdrawing the United
States from and Ending Funding to Certain United Nations Organizations
and Reviewing United States Support to All International
Organizations).  That Executive Order directed the Secretary of State,
in consultation with the United States Representative to the United
Nations, to conduct a review of all international intergovernmental
organizations of which the United States is a member and provides any
type of funding or other support, and all conventions and treaties to
which the United States is a party, to determine which organizations,
conventions, and treaties are contrary to the interests of the United
States.  The Secretary of State has reported his findings as required
by Executive Order 14199.

(b)  I have considered the Secretary of State’s report and, after
deliberating with my Cabinet, have determined that it is contrary to the
interests of the United States to remain a member of, participate in, or
otherwise provide support to the organizations listed in section 2 of
this memorandum. 

(c)  Consistent with Executive Order 14199 and pursuant to the authority
vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United
States of America, I hereby direct all executive departments and
agencies (agencies) to take immediate steps to effectuate the withdrawal
of the United States from the organizations listed in section 2 of this
memorandum as soon as possible.  For United Nations entities, withdrawal
means ceasing participation in or funding to those entities to the
extent permitted by law.

\(d\)  My review of further findings of the Secretary of State remains
ongoing.
