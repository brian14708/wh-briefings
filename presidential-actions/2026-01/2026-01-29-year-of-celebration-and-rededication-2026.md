BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

On January 1, 2026, the United States began our year-long commemoration
of an important milestone in the history of our country:  250 years of
American freedom and independence.

Two and a half centuries ago, on July 4, 1776, thousands of years’ worth
of wisdom, philosophy, and culture were brought together in Philadelphia
where delegates to the Second Continental Congress gathered to declare
the birth of a new nation — “conceived in Liberty and dedicated to the
proposition that all men are created equal” — and, in so doing, launched
the single greatest force for goodness, justice, prosperity, and human
flourishing the world has ever known.

As we celebrate the 250th year since the signing of the Declaration of
Independence, we acknowledge with gratitude and pride that July 4, 1776,
represents the most seminal political event in all of human history.

Unlike other nations, America’s Founding was rooted in the belief that
every man, woman, and child is “endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit
of Happiness.”

This conviction, enshrined in our Declaration of Independence, and
indelibly etched upon every American heart, remains the bedrock of our
government and the crown jewel of Western civilization.  For 250 years,
the burning flame of liberty has been passed down from one generation to
the next, and has carried our Nation and our people to heights that our
Founding Fathers could have never dreamed.

Guided by the example of Founding Fathers like George Washington, John
Adams, James Madison, Benjamin Franklin, and other American patriots who
helped light the torch of liberty in 1776, let us ask our Creator to
bless America, free our Nation and our people from all threats to our
safety and happiness, and to guide our actions for the security and
common good of all Americans.

This year, we honor and cherish the generations of pioneers, warriors,
statesmen, preachers, inventors, risk-takers, workers, and heroes whose
unwavering commitment to the promise of freedom gave rise to the
greatest Republic ever created.  Today and throughout this year, I call
on every American to celebrate this triumph of the American spirit, and
to rededicate themselves to the sacred cause of liberty and justice for
all.

The Bible teaches: “In all circumstances give thanks.”  As such, it is
fitting that we mark this special year as a unique occasion to celebrate
our proud history, reflect on our abundant blessings, pray for our
country and our people, and rededicate ourselves as one Nation under
God.

From the earliest days of our national story, reflection and
thanksgiving have been central to our character, identity, and destiny. 
Just weeks before declaring independence, the Second Continental
Congress ordered a day of “fasting, humiliation and prayer,” petitioning
God “to pardon all our manifold sins and transgressions” and to
“establish the peace and freedom of America, upon a solid and lasting
foundation.”  Later, in the heart of the Revolutionary War, the Second
Continental Congress declared it “the indispensable duty of all men to
adore the superintending providence of Almighty God.”

In the sweltering summer of 1776, the promise of Freedom moved our
ancestors to break with a tyrannical empire, issue the Declaration of
Independence, and go on to overcome every hardship to establish a
Republic like no other.  It is this unwavering spirit of courage, faith
and patriotism that propelled Paul Revere on his famous midnight ride,
and that later inspired some of the world’s greatest men to pledge their
lives, fortunes, and sacred honor to build a new nation.  It is this
spirit that led General George Washington to persevere at Valley Forge;
inspired Davy Crockett to make his last stand at the Alamo; sustained
settlers on the Oregon Trail; held the bloody ridges of Gettysburg; set
slavery on a path to worldwide extinction; roused a generation of young
men to conquer tyranny and communism overseas; and carried our beautiful
Stars and Stripes to the face of the moon.  To this very day, it is this
American spirit that lives on in the hearts, minds, and souls of every
patriot — and inspires every new generation of American citizens to
reach further and aim higher.

When the Second Continental Congress voted in favor of independence,
General George Washington issued General Orders to his army.  In words
that have echoed throughout history, he wrote: “The fate of unborn
Millions will now depend, under God, on the Courage and Conduct of this
army… Let us therefore rely upon the goodness of the Cause, and the aid
of the supreme Being, in whose hands Victory is, to animate and
encourage us to great and noble Actions.”

Today, too, we pray that our noble cause continues to be guided by the
hand of providence and the grace of God — and that the fire of freedom
will forever burn brightly in the heart of every American.  Above all,
this year, we pray and endeavor that the triumph of the American spirit
and the glorious truths expressed in our Declaration of Independence
will shine more radiantly than ever before.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, do hereby proclaim 2026 as a Year of Celebration and
Rededication.  I call on every American to reflect upon and celebrate
the wisdom and deeds of the heroes of our Founding who made the miracle
of America possible.  I call on parents to teach their children about
America’s inspiring history, heritage, and heroes.  I invite the world
to come to our shores to experience the splendor, warmth, and
hospitality of America.  And I encourage all Americans — including
businesses, churches, families, and the military — to observe this year,
reflecting on the blessings our Nation has received, with appropriate
programs, ceremonies, concerts, celebrations, and activities in their
homes, schools, work, communities, military bases, and houses of
worship.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this

twenty-ninth day of January, in the year of our Lord
two thousand twenty-six, and of the Independence of the United States
of America the two hundred and fiftieth.

                               DONALD J. TRUMP
