title: Addressing Addiction through the Great American Recovery Initiative
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose and Policy</span>. 
The disease of addiction, also known as substance use disorder, is a
crisis that touches families in every community and neighborhood in our
Nation.  48.4 million Americans, or 16.8 percent of our Nation’s
population, suffer from addiction, and my Administration will continue
to respond to a crisis of this scale with the attention it deserves. 
Over the past year, we have made incredible progress in stopping the
inflow of illegal drugs that threaten American communities.  We must now
supplement that work by furthering a national effort to prioritize
addiction treatment and recovery.

Addiction is a chronic, treatable disease with relapse rates similar to
other chronic diseases.  Unfortunately, very few Americans who need
treatment ever receive it or believe they need it.  Among the 40.7
million adults who had a substance use disorder in 2024 and did not
receive substance use treatment, 95.6 percent (or 38.1 million people)
did not perceive that they needed treatment.  Despite significant
investment of resources, addiction recovery efforts remain fragmented
and do not keep pace with scientific advancements.  

The costs of these failures are devastating, not only in lives lost, but
also in the ripple effects across our economy, workforce, and national
strength.  Addiction contributes to declining workforce participation,
increased healthcare costs, homelessness, family instability, and lost
productivity that together cost the United States hundreds of billions
of dollars each year.

The framework for addiction treatment should parallel that of other
chronic diseases — utilizing evidence-based care, scientific
advancement, continuous support, and community connection.  My
Administration will drive a new national response to the disease of
addiction that will create stronger coordination across government, the
healthcare sector, faith communities, and the private sector in order to
save lives, restore families, strengthen our communities, and build the
Great American Recovery.
