title: Adjusting Imports of Processed Critical Minerals and Their Derivative Products
  into the United States
---
 
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

1.  On October 24, 2025, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary)
transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effects of
imports of processed critical minerals and their derivative products
(PCMDPs) on the national security of the United States under section 232
of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, 19 U.S.C. 1862 (section
232).  Based on the facts considered in that investigation, which took
into account the close relation of the economic welfare of the Nation to
our national security and other relevant factors, *see* 19 U.S.C.
1862(d), the Secretary found and advised me of his opinion that PCMDPs
are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under
such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the
United States.

2.  The Secretary found that PCMDPs are essential to the national
security of the United States.** ** PCMDPs are indispensable to almost
every industry, including national defense programs and critical
infrastructure.  PCMDPs are embedded across defense and commercial
supply chains and play an essential role in the production of advanced
weapons systems, energy infrastructure, and everyday consumer goods.
 For example, rare earth permanent magnets — a derivative product of
processed critical minerals — are used in and vital to nearly all
electronics and vehicles. 

3.  The Secretary found that PCMDPs are essential to the United States’
defense industrial base and the technological superiority and
operational readiness of the military.  PCMDPs are key components found
throughout the defense industrial base, contributing to virtually all
defense capabilities and activities.  They are essential for the
development and sustainment of high-performance military equipment,
including fighter aircraft, munitions, armor plating, naval ships,
communication networks, navigation systems, and surveillance systems.

4\.  The Secretary also found that processed critical minerals are
essential to each of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors identified
by National Security Memorandum 22 of April 30, 2024 (Critical
Infrastructure Security and Resilience).  For example, the chemical
sector uses critical minerals, such as lithium, fluorite, and bromine,
for chemical synthesis and industrial mechanisms.  The communications
sector uses critical minerals, such as gallium, germanium, indium, and
yttrium, in fiber optic networks and satellite systems.  And the energy
sector relies on critical minerals, such as cobalt, nickel, uranium,
praseodymium, and terbium, for battery storage, nuclear fuel,
generators, and electric vehicle motors.  The Secretary determined that
processed critical minerals underpin critical military and economic
applications.

5.  The Secretary found that the United States is too reliant on foreign
sources of PCMDPs, lacks access to a sufficiently secure and reliable
supply chain to PCMDPs, is experiencing unsustainable price volatility
with respect to critical mineral markets, and is suffering from weakened
domestic manufacturing and production capacity of PCMDPs.  The Secretary
found that these circumstances are a significant national security
vulnerability that could be exploited by foreign actors; weaken the
industrial resilience of the United States; expose the American people
to supply chain disruptions, economic instability, and strategic
vulnerabilities; and jeopardize the United States’ ability to meet
demands for PCMDPs that are essential to its national defense and
critical infrastructure.

6.  As of 2024, the United States was 100 percent net-import reliant for
12 critical minerals, and 50 percent or greater net-import reliant for a
further 29 critical minerals.  Even where the United States has domestic
mining capacity, such as for cobalt, nickel, and rare earth elements,
the United States lacks the domestic processing capacity to avoid
downstream net-import reliance.  In fact, although the United States is
the second largest producer of mined, unprocessed rare earth oxides in
the world, the United States’ limited processing capacity still requires
rare earth oxides to be exported for further refining and processing
before being reimported for domestic use.  As a result, the United
States is too entirely reliant on imports of rare earth permanent
magnets to meet commercial demand, and United States production
currently meets only a fraction of defense needs.  Mining a mineral
domestically does not safeguard the national security of the United
States if the United States remains dependent on a foreign country for
the processing of that mineral.

7.  In addition, the Secretary found that the United States lacks access
to a sufficiently secure and reliable supply chain for PCMDPs.  Even
with respect to the minerals for which the United States has only
partial import reliance, supply disruptions can still expose important
sectors — such as defense, aerospace, telecommunications, and
transportation — to serious risk.  For example, the limited capacity of
the domestic critical minerals industry, combined with foreign
dominance, has exposed the Department of War (DoW) to significant supply
chain risks.  For several key minerals, the vast majority of DoW supply
chains rely on at least one supplier from a single country, underscoring
the urgent need to diversify sources and build resilient domestic
capabilities. 

8\.  The Secretary further found that critical mineral markets are prone
to price volatility.  Price volatility hinders private sector
investment; limits market-based economies’ willingness to maintain
capacity; leads to facility closures; and threatens the long-term
viability of domestic mining, processing, and downstream manufacturing
capacity.  

9.  The Secretary also found that critical mineral production in the
United States has been declining.  The United States has experienced the
closure or reduction in size of facilities related to critical mineral
production, and some United States producers of critical minerals have
offshored their activities to foreign countries.

10.  The Secretary found that despite the decline in refining,
manufacturing, and production of critical minerals in the United States,
United States demand for critical minerals is rapidly increasing and
will continue to increase.  Contributing to the increased United States
demand are vital national security and economic activities, including
rising military threats and growing high-tech industries, such as
artificial intelligence, data centers, nuclear energy, and new energy
technologies.  

11.  In the Secretary’s opinion, it is imperative to the national
security to address these vulnerabilities.  In the Secretary’s view, the
United States must, among other things, ensure that it has a secure
supply chain to obtain PCMDPs and that it has sufficient domestic mining
and processing of critical minerals to reduce import reliance on foreign
countries. 

12.  In light of these findings, the Secretary recommended a range of
actions, including actions to adjust the imports of PCMDPs so that such
imports will not threaten to impair the national security.  For example,
the Secretary recommended that I negotiate agreements with foreign
nations to ensure the United States has adequate critical mineral
supplies and to mitigate the supply chain vulnerabilities as quickly as
possible.  The Secretary also suggested that it may be appropriate to
impose import restrictions, such as tariffs, if satisfactory agreements
are not reached in a timely manner.

13.  After considering the Secretary’s report, the factors in section
232(d) (19 U.S.C. 1862(d)), and other relevant factors and information,
I concur with the Secretary’s finding that PCMDPs are being imported
into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances
as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States.  In
my judgment, and in light of the Secretary’s report, the factors in
section 232(d) (19 U.S.C. 1862(d)), and other relevant factors and
information, I determine that it is necessary and appropriate to enter
into negotiations with trading partners to adjust the imports of PCMDPs
so that such imports will not threaten to impair the national security
of the United States.  Depending on the outcome of such negotiations, I
may consider alternative remedies in the future, including minimum
import prices for specific types of critical minerals.  I therefore
direct the Secretary and the United States Trade Representative (Trade
Representative) to jointly pursue negotiation of agreements or continue
any current negotiations of agreements, such as agreements contemplated
in section 232(c)(3)(A)(i) (19 U.S.C. 1862(c)(3)(A)(i)), to address the
threatened impairment of the national security with respect to PCMDPs. 
Depending on the status or outcome of those negotiations, I may take
other measures to adjust the imports of PCMDPs to address the threat to
the national security found in this proclamation.

14.  Section 232 authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an
article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United
States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to
impair the national security so that such imports will not threaten to
impair the national security.  Section 232 includes the authority to
adopt and carry out a plan of action, with adjustments over time, to
address the national security threat.  That initial plan of action may
include negotiations of agreements with foreign trading partners along
with other measures to adjust imports to address the national security
threat.  If action under section 232 includes the negotiation of an
agreement, such as one contemplated in section 232(c)(3)(A)(i) (19
U.S.C. 1862(c)(3)(A)(i)), the President may also take other actions he
deems necessary to adjust imports and eliminate the threat to the
national security, including if such an agreement is not entered into
within 180 days of the date of this proclamation or is not being carried
out or is ineffective.  *See* 19 U.S.C. 1862(c)(3)(A).

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws
of the United States, including section 232, 19 U.S.C. 1862; and section
301 of title 3, United States Code, do hereby proclaim as follows:

(1)  The Secretary and the Trade Representative, and any other senior
executive branch officials they deem appropriate, shall jointly pursue
negotiation of agreements, including those contemplated in section
232(c)(3)(A)(i) (19 U.S.C. 1862(c)(3)(A)(i)), to address the threatened
impairment of the national security with respect to imports of PCMDPs
from any country.  In negotiating, the Secretary and the Trade
Representative should consider price floors for trade in critical
minerals and other trade-restricting measures.  The Secretary and the
Trade Representative, in consultation with any other senior executive
branch officials they deem appropriate, shall, from time to time, update
me on the status or outcome of the negotiations described in this
proclamation.  The Secretary and the Trade Representative shall provide
one of these updates within 180 days of the date of this proclamation.

(2)  To the extent consistent with applicable law and the purpose of
this proclamation, the Secretary, the Trade Representative, and the
Secretary of Homeland Security are directed and authorized to take all
actions that are appropriate to implement and effectuate this
proclamation and any actions contemplated by this proclamation,
including, consistent with applicable law, the issuance of regulations,
rules, guidance, and procedures and the temporary suspension or
amendment of regulations, within their respective jurisdictions, and to
employ all powers granted to the President under section 232, as may be
appropriate to implement and effectuate this proclamation.  The
Secretary, the Trade Representative, and the Secretary of Homeland
Security may, consistent with applicable law, including section 301 of
title 3, United States Code, redelegate any of these functions within
their respective executive departments or agencies.  All executive
departments and agencies shall take all appropriate measures to
implement and effectuate this proclamation.

(3)  The Secretary shall continue to monitor imports of PCMDPs.  The
Secretary also shall, from time to time, in consultation with any senior
executive branch officials the Secretary deems appropriate, review the
status of such imports with respect to the national security.  The
Secretary shall inform me of any circumstances that, in the Secretary’s
opinion, might indicate the need for further action by the President
under section 232. 

(4)  Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that
is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.  If any provision of
this proclamation or the application of any provision to any individual
or circumstance is held to be invalid, the remainder of this
proclamation and the application of its provisions to any other
individuals or circumstances shall not be affected.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-six, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
fiftieth.

                             DONALD J. TRUMP
