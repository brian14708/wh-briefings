BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

For 250 glorious years, our Nation has been sustained by a simple yet
powerful truth:  The American people — not bureaucrats, politicians, or
left-wing activists — have the God-given right to secure their own
destiny.  This National School Choice Week, we reaffirm this sacred
principle, and we renew our commitment to empowering every American
parent with the freedom to forge their family’s — and our Nation’s —
future.

Tragically, for decades, disastrous Federal education policy led to
record-low reading and math scores and out-of-control Government
spending.  America’s Golden Age begins in the classroom.  For that
reason, I have made it a top priority to expand educational freedom and
once again put children and parents first.

My Administration is fighting every day to ensure that universal school
choice is recognized as a right for every family.  No student should
ever be trapped in a failing school, and parents deserve more choices,
not fewer.  Guided by this vision, we are working to guarantee that
every child — regardless of where they live — has access to a
world-class education and a chance to achieve the American Dream. 

Last July, I proudly signed into law the historic One Big Beautiful
Bill, which for the first time in American history, creates a nationwide
tax credit program to make education more affordable for families.  Any
taxpayer can reduce what they owe the Government by contributing to a
scholarship-granting organization and American families can use these
scholarships to select the education that best fits their needs and
values. 

The One Big Beautiful Bill also makes education more affordable by
giving every American newborn a Trump Account, which makes it easier for
families to use 529 accounts for elementary and high school, not just
college. 

I also signed an Executive Order last year directing the Department of
Education to issue guidance on how States can use Federal funding
formulas to support their K-12 scholarship programs and directing the
Secretary of Education to prioritize school choice programs in the
Department’s grant programs.  I have also ordered the Secretary of
Education to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education,
which will ultimately save billions of dollars and allow States to
determine their own education policy.

To further defend the American parent, my Administration is bringing the
sinister “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion” agenda to a screeching halt
and replacing it with a system based on the fundamental principle of
merit.  We are proudly eliminating Federal funding for schools that
permit discriminatory treatment and anti-American indoctrination.  We
are bringing common sense back to our classrooms and once again teaching
our children to love their country and honor our history.

As my Administration continues to fight for American families, I also
commend every State leading the school choice movement by enacting
universal K-12 school choice programs in their communities.  I look
forward to working with other States and leaders in the Congress to
provide universal school choice for every American family.

Our glorious American future depends on the next generation’s ability to
learn, lead, and innovate.  I will always be a champion for the right of
every parent to be the steward of their children’s education, and
together, we will never waver in putting our parents first, our children
first, and America first.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 25 through
January 31, 2026, as National School Choice Week.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this

twenty-eighth day of January, in the year of our Lord
two thousand twenty-six, and of the Independence of the United States
of America the two hundred and fiftieth.

                               DONALD J. TRUMP
