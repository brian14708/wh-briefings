title: Establishing a Second Emergency Board to Investigate Disputes Between the Long
  Island Rail Road Company and Certain of its Employees Represented by Certain Labor
  Organizations
---
 
Disputes exist between the Long Island Rail Road Company and certain of
its employees represented by certain labor organizations.  The labor
organizations involved in these disputes are the Transportation
Communications Union, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and
Trainmen, the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, and the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.

The disputes have not heretofore been adjusted under the provisions of
the Railway Labor Act, as amended, 45 U.S.C. 151‑188 (RLA).  
  
An emergency board to investigate and report on these disputes was
established on September 18, 2025, by Executive Order 14349 of September
16, 2025 (Establishing an Emergency Board to Investigate Disputes
Between the Long Island Rail Road Company and Certain of Its Employees
Represented by Certain Labor Organizations).  That emergency board
terminated upon submission of its report to the President. 
Subsequently, its recommendations were not accepted by all of the
parties.  
  
A party empowered by the RLA has requested that the President establish
a second emergency board pursuant to section 9A of the RLA (45 U.S.C.
159a).  
Section 9A(e) of the RLA provides that the President, upon such request,
shall appoint a second emergency board to investigate and report on the
disputes.  
  
NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as President by the
Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 9A of
the RLA, it is hereby ordered:

effective 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on January 16, 2026, a Board
composed of a chair and two other members, all of whom shall be
appointed by the President to investigate and report on these disputes. 
No member shall be pecuniarily or otherwise interested in any
organization of railroad employees or any carrier.  The Board shall
perform its functions subject to the availability of funds.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Report</span>.

Board final offers for settlement of the disputes.  As provided by
section 9A(g) of the RLA, within 30 days after the submission of final
offers for settlement of the disputes, the Board shall submit a report
to the President setting forth the Board’s selection of the most
reasonable offer.

Board submits its report to the President, the parties to the
controversy shall make no change in the conditions out of which the
disputes arose except by agreement of the parties.
