BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

One year ago today, I stood in the majestic rotunda of our Nation’s
Capitol and pledged to the American people that we would reclaim our
national sovereignty, restore our safety, rebalance the scales of
justice, and rebuild a country that is proud, prosperous, and free. 
Over the last 12 months, my Administration has swiftly delivered on
these promises in epic fashion, ushering in a new era of peace,
prosperity, and strength, and reclaiming the values and way of life that
have made our Republic the envy of the world for 250 years.  On this
National Day of Patriotic Devotion, we unite as one people to honor our
most sacred American ideals, celebrate our victories, and reaffirm our
solemn mission to make our country greater than ever before.

When I took office 1 year ago, our country was in a state of chaos and
decline.  Our borders were wide open, allowing criminals, drug dealers,
and violent gang members to pour in and poison our communities.  Crime
was surging, law enforcement was under siege, and Christians,
conservatives, and other innocent Americans were being viciously
persecuted.  Inflation was crushing families, wages were stagnant, and
the cost of living was out of control.  American democracy had been
undermined by lawlessness, government abuse, and a collapse of
accountability at the highest levels.  Men were competing in women’s
sports and invading women’s locker rooms.  Extremist left-wing
ideologies were being forced into classrooms.  The worst trade deals in
our history had hollowed out American industry, and our leaders were
undermining our strength on the world stage.

On day one, I immediately began working to fight for the law-abiding,
hardworking men and women who built our Nation, who defend our Nation,
and who make our Nation run. 

One of my most urgent duties was to confront the worst border crisis in
American history.  Shortly after I took the oath of office, I declared a
national emergency at the southern border, designated cartels as Foreign
Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists,
resumed border wall construction, reinstated the Remain in Mexico
policy, halted the practice of catch-and-release, ended asylum for
illegal border crossers, deployed thousands of American soldiers to
defend and protect our southern border, and began carrying out the
largest deportation operation in the history of our country.

In just a few short months, we turned the worst border crisis into the
most secure border ever recorded.  The flood of illegal aliens entering
our country has come to a screeching halt.  Illegal border crossings
over the year have plummeted by 92 percent, and U.S. Customs and Border
Patrol seized more than half a million pounds of drugs.

I have also spared no time in rebuilding our economy.  On the first day
of my Administration, I signed a Presidential Memorandum to secure
emergency price relief for families — ordering Federal departments to
free the American economy from regulatory restraints, restore
affordability, and lower the cost of living.  I have further taken
action to restore American dominance in energy production, and deliver
energy abundance that brought down the cost of gas and electricity
prices to levels not seen in decades.  As a result, inflation is down
70 percent from its peak rate during the previous administration, the
affordability gap is swiftly closing, real wages are soaring, and
housing costs are falling.

Additionally, my Administration has rebuilt American manufacturing and
put an end to the policies that forced our workers and businesses to
compete against foreign nations that exploit our markets.  We have
secured historic investment, infrastructure, and technology deals that
strengthen our supply chains, protect American innovation, and ensure
the future is built by American hands and proud American hearts.

Less than 6 months into my term, we passed the historic One Big
Beautiful Bill — one of the greatest legislative triumphs in American
history — which made the largest tax cuts ever enacted permanent;
delivered no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security, and no tax on
overtime; increased the child tax credit; invested in American
infrastructure; lowered energy costs; and permanently secures the
border.

I have also moved swiftly to reassert American strength on the world
stage.  On my first day back in office, I signed an Executive Order
directing the Secretary of State to ensure that all policies, programs,
personnel, and operations at the Department of State defend America’s
interests and champion the needs of the American people.  I have also
rebuilt the most powerful and capable military anywhere in the world. 
Guided by a foreign policy of peace through strength, my Administration
has already secured major peace agreements between nations torn by
decades of fighting — including in the Middle East — and we will
continue to pursue peaceful resolutions that put America first, protect
our citizens, and promote stability and prosperity both at home and
abroad.  The full might of the American spirit is being fully restored,
and our work is only just beginning.

As President, I have worked to restore the enduring American values that
bind us together as one Nation under God:  Equal justice under the law,
freedom of speech, merit over the sinister “DEI” agenda, and reverence
for our heritage, history, and heroes.  My Administration has ended the
era of government weaponization, strengthened the integrity of our
elections, and reaffirmed that the law applies equally to every
citizen.  Most importantly, we are renewing our civic culture.  Under my
leadership, children are once again being taught to love their country
and always respect our great American flag.

January 20, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day our Nation was
restored to its full greatness and glory.  Never again will America
surrender her sovereignty, silence her people, apologize for her
strength, or suppress the rights and God-given potential of her
citizens.  This National Day of Patriotic Devotion, as we celebrate 250
years since our Nation’s founding, we stand renewed, resolute, and
unafraid, carrying forward the same defiant spirit of July 4, 1776, that
forged our Republic and will secure our future for generations to come.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 20, 2026, as
National Day of Patriotic Devotion, in order to strengthen our bonds to
each other and to our country, and to renew the duties of Government to
the people.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-six, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
fiftieth.

                             DONALD J. TRUMP
