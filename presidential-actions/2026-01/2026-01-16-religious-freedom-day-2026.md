BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

For 250 years, our Nation and our people have abided by a simple truth: 
Every person is born with the God-given right to practice their faith,
follow their conscience, and worship their God freely and without fear. 
This Religious Freedom Day, we honor America’s distinct place in the
halls of history as the only Republic ever founded upon this sacred
principle — and we renew our commitment to upholding our proud legacy as
one glorious Nation under God.

More than 400 years ago, a band of weary settlers set sail on a perilous
journey across the Atlantic on the Mayflower in search of religious
liberty — setting in motion the most epic struggle for freedom and faith
in the history of the world.  Over a century later, following a bloody
Revolutionary War fought to secure our God-given rights, the Virginia
General Assembly moved to dismantle the tyrannical laws of the British
Crown and replace them with statutes worthy of a free people.  From that
effort emerged the legendary Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom.  In
that historic declaration, Founding Father Thomas Jefferson proclaimed
that God “created the mind to be free” and that every individual “shall
be free to profess their opinion in matters of religion.”  These
principles, codified into Virginia law on January 16, 1786, later became
the foundation of our First Amendment, immortalizing in ink the free
exercise of faith.

This year, as we celebrate the 250th anniversary of American
independence, my Administration is boldly bringing faith back to the
public square because the freedom of religion means the freedom to
practice your religion proudly, publicly, and without fear of
persecution.  As President, I am leading a renewal of faith in our
schools, military, workplaces, hospitals, and halls of Government
because the revolution of common sense is incomplete without a
resurgence of faith in God.  To further strengthen families and protect
religious freedom, I established the White House Faith Office and the
Religious Liberty Commission.  I also proudly established a Task Force
to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias, which is charged with identifying and
eliminating all anti-Christian policies, practices, and conduct in
executive departments and agencies.  I directed the Department of
Education to protect the foundational First Amendment right to prayer in
public schools.  And as part of my Administration’s historic Freedom 250
initiative, we launched America Prays — an invitation to Americans of
every background to join together in prayer for wisdom, guidance, and
blessing as our Republic enters its next great chapter.

From the establishment of the Jamestown Colony to the Pilgrims’ arrival
at Plymouth Rock, through periods of war and peace and through every
challenge and every triumph, religious faith has indelibly shaped our
character, informed our laws, and strengthened our national spirit. 
This Religious Freedom Day, I pledge that I will never stop fighting to
restore America as a Nation of prayer, a country of faith, and a radiant
beacon of liberty and justice for all.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 16, 2026, as
Religious Freedom Day.  I call on all Americans to commemorate this day
with events and activities that honor our Nation’s proud history of
religious freedom, and I especially encourage families to gather at
places of worship to praise Almighty God for the blessings of liberty He
has bestowed on our great country.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-six, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
fiftieth.

                             DONALD J. TRUMP
