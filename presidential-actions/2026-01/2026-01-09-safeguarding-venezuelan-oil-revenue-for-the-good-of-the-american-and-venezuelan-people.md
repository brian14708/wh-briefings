title: Safeguarding Venezuelan Oil Revenue for the Good of the American and Venezuelan
  People
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) (IEEPA), the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq.*) (NEA), and section
301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Findings</span>.  As Chief
Executive and Commander in Chief, I find that the threat of attachment
or the imposition of other judicial process against the Foreign
Government Deposit Funds, as defined in section 2 of this order, will
materially harm the national security and foreign policy of the
United States.

Specifically, the attachment or the imposition of other judicial process
against the Foreign Government Deposit Funds will substantially
interfere with our critical efforts to ensure economic and political
stability in Venezuela.  The failure of these critical efforts would
jeopardize major foreign policy objectives of the United States,
including:  ending the dangerous influx of illegal immigrants and the
flood of illicit narcotics, which has resulted in the death of countless
thousands of American citizens; protecting American interests against
malign actors such as Iran and Hezbollah; and bringing peace,
prosperity, and stability to the Venezuelan people and to the Western
Hemisphere more generally. 

Accordingly, the preservation of the Foreign Government Deposit Funds is
of the utmost importance to the United States.  I therefore find that
the possibility of attachment or the imposition of judicial process
against the Foreign Government Deposit Funds constitutes an unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the
United States, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside
the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal
with that threat.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Definition</span>.  For the
purposes of this order, “Foreign Government Deposit Funds” means funds
paid to or held by the United States Government in designated United
States Department of the Treasury accounts or funds on behalf of the
Government of Venezuela or its agencies or instrumentalities, including
the Central Bank of Venezuela and Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A., that are
derived from either the sale of natural resources from, or the sale of
diluents to, the Government of Venezuela or its agencies or
instrumentalities.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Preservation of Foreign
Government Deposit Funds</span>.  (a)  Unless licensed or otherwise
authorized pursuant to this order, any attachment, judgment, decree,
lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial process is prohibited,
and shall be deemed null and void, with respect to the Foreign
Government Deposit Funds.

\(b\)  No Foreign Government Deposit Funds may be transferred, paid,
exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in, except to the extent
provided by regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be
issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered
into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective date of
this order.

\(c\)  This order and actions taken pursuant to this order shall apply
notwithstanding any previously issued Executive Order, and any action
taken pursuant to such an order, to the extent such order or action
blocks, regulates, or otherwise affects the Foreign Government Deposit
Funds.  This order and actions taken pursuant to this order shall
supersede any previously issued Executive Order, and any action taken
pursuant to such an order, to the extent such order or action blocks,
regulates, or otherwise affects the Foreign Government Deposit Funds.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Additional Presidential
Findings and Determinations</span>.  I hereby determine and find that:

\(a\)  Ownership.  The Foreign Government Deposit Funds constitute
property of the Government of Venezuela and do not constitute the
property of any private party, including judgment creditors of Venezuela
or its agencies or instrumentalities, or commercial actors that
transacted or are transacting business with Venezuela or its agencies or
instrumentalities.

\(b\)  Custodial Nature of United States Possession.  The United States
Government will hold the Foreign Government Deposit Funds solely in a
custodial and governmental capacity, and not as a market participant.

\(c\)  Absence of Commercial Use in the United States.  The Foreign
Government Deposit Funds:

\(i\)   have not been, and shall not be, used for any commercial
activity in the United States; and

\(ii\)  shall be held pending sovereign disposition for public,
governmental, or diplomatic purposes determined by the Secretary of
State, on behalf of the Government of Venezuela.

\(d\)  Governmental Purpose.  The retention and administration of the
Foreign Government Deposit Funds serve public sovereign purposes,
including compliance with international obligations, the performance of
government functions, and the maintenance of diplomatic and foreign
policy objectives.

\(e\)  No Waiver of Immunity.  Neither the placement of the Foreign
Government Deposit Funds in a United States Department of the Treasury
deposit account nor any related arrangement or activity constitutes an
express or implied waiver of sovereign immunity from any attachment,
judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial
process, or consent to the jurisdiction of any court for purposes of
enforcing private claims against such funds.

\(f\)  International Comity and Foreign Relations.  Any attachment,
judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial
process against the Foreign Government Deposit Funds would interfere
with the conduct of the foreign relations of the United States and
undermine principles of international comity.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Treatment of Foreign
Government Deposit Funds</span>.  (a)  In holding the Foreign Government
Deposit Funds, the Secretary of the Treasury shall:

\(i\)    designate such funds in a manner that clearly reflects their
status as sovereign property of the Government of Venezuela held in
custody by the United States, and not as the property of the
United States;

\(ii\)   comply with instructions regarding disbursements or transfers
of the Foreign Government Deposit Funds as may be determined by the
Secretary of State, and not permit such funds to be used for any other
purpose; and

\(iii\)  consult, as appropriate, with the Secretary of State, the
Attorney General, and the Secretary of Energy.

\(b\)  The Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General are
authorized and directed to assert, in any judicial or administrative
proceeding, the sovereign immunity of the Foreign Government Deposit
Funds consistent with this order and applicable law.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Administration</span>.  (a)
 The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of
State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Energy, is authorized
to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and
regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA
as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order.  The
Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law,
redelegate any of these functions within the Department of the
Treasury.  The head of each executive department and agency (agency) of
the United States Government shall take all appropriate measures within
the agency’s authority to implement this order.

\(b\)  The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary
of State, is hereby authorized to submit recurring and final reports to
the Congress on the national emergency declared in this order,
consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and
section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">7</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. 
(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

\(i\)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or
agency, or the head thereof; or

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

\(c\)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(d)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Department of the Treasury.
