title: ADJUSTING IMPORTS OF SEMICONDUCTORS, SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT,
  AND THEIR DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS INTO THE UNITED STATES
---
 
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

1.** ** On December 22, 2025, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary)
transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effects of
imports of semiconductors (semiconductors or chips), semiconductor
manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products on the national
security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion
Act of 1962, as amended, 19 U.S.C. 1862 (section 232).  Based on the
facts considered in that investigation, and taking into account the
close relation of the economic welfare of the Nation to our national
security and other relevant factors, *see* 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), the
Secretary found and advised me of his opinion that semiconductors,
semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products are
being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such
circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the
United States.

2.  The Secretary found that the present quantities and circumstances of
imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and
their derivative products pose a threat to the national security and
economy.  The United States’ capacity to produce semiconductors, certain
semiconductor manufacturing equipment such as advanced lithography and
etching tools, and their derivative products is insufficient to meet
domestic demand.  This has led the United States to be dependent on
foreign sources to meet domestic demand for semiconductors,
semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products. 

3\.  The Secretary found that semiconductors are essential to the United
States’ economic, industrial, and military strength.  Modern defense
systems depend on high-performance semiconductors for radar and
communication systems, electronic warfare and cybersecurity systems, and
guidance and control systems for missiles and drones.  Furthermore,
defense systems often require specialized semiconductors that can
withstand extreme environments.  This reliance on semiconductors is
expected only to increase.  

4\.  The Secretary found that semiconductors are essential to each of
the 16 critical infrastructure sectors identified by National Security
Memorandum 22 of April 30, 2024 (Critical Infrastructure Security and
Resilience).  For example, the communications sector requires
semiconductors for broadband networks, routing, switching,
telecommunications infrastructure, smartphones, and satellite
communications systems.  The energy sector requires them for smart grid
control and converter systems.  Nuclear reactors use semiconductors for
sensors and safety systems, control-rod-actuation systems, distributed
control systems, and power-management systems.  The medical sector uses
semiconductors in its imaging systems, diagnostic-assay systems, robotic
surgical systems, and in pacemakers and defibrillators.

5\.  The Secretary found that the United States’ capacity to manufacture
semiconductors is too low to meet projected national defense needs and
to match the requirements of a growing commercial industry.  The United
States consumes roughly one quarter of the world’s semiconductors.  The
United States currently fully manufactures only approximately 10 percent
of the chips it requires, making it heavily reliant on foreign supply
chains.  This dependence on foreign supply chains is a significant
economic and national security risk.  Given the foundational role that
semiconductors play in the modern economy and national defense, a
disruption of import-reliant supply chains could strain the United
States’ industrial and military capabilities.

6\.  The Secretary found that semiconductors that enable artificial
intelligence (AI) are an important element of many data centers
currently in use, such that the importation in current quantities and
circumstances poses a threat to the national security, when such
importation does not contribute to the buildout of the United States
technology supply chain.

7.  In light of these findings, the Secretary recommended a two-phase
plan of action to adjust imports of semiconductors so that such imports
will not threaten to impair the national security of the United States.
 In the first phase, the United States would continue ongoing trade
negotiations with foreign jurisdictions that have the potential to
strengthen the United States semiconductor industry.  The Secretary also
recommended, as part of this first phase, immediately imposing a 25
percent *ad valorem* tariff on a very narrow category of semiconductors
that are an important element of my Administration’s AI and technology
policies, and that such tariff would not apply when the chips are
imported to support the buildout of the United States technology supply
chain.  In the second phase — after trade negotiations have concluded —
the Secretary recommended broader tariffs on semiconductors, at a rate
of duty that is significant.  The Secretary also recommended that this
broader tariff be accompanied by a tariff offset program to enable
companies investing in United States semiconductor production and
certain parts of the United States semiconductor supply chain to obtain
preferential tariff treatment.

8\.  After considering the Secretary’s report, the factors in section
232(d) (19 U.S.C. 1862(d)), and other relevant factors and information,
among other things, I concur with the Secretary’s finding that
semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their
derivative products are being imported into the United States in such
quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the
national security of the United States.  In my judgment, and in light of
the Secretary’s report, the factors in section 232(d) (19 U.S.C.
1862(d)), and other relevant factors and information, I have also
determined that it is necessary and appropriate to adopt a plan of
action, as described below, to adjust such imports of semiconductors,
semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products so
that such imports will not threaten to impair the national security of
the United States. 

9.  I have decided to include in the plan of action negotiations to
address the threatened impairment of the national security with respect
to imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and
their derivative products.  I therefore direct the Secretary and the
United States Trade Representative (Trade Representative) to jointly
pursue negotiation of agreements or continue any current negotiations of
agreements, such as agreements contemplated in section 232(c)(3)(A)(i)
(19 U.S.C. 1862(c)(3)(A)(i)), to address the threatened impairment of
the national security with respect to imported semiconductors,
semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products,
with any foreign jurisdiction the Secretary and the Trade Representative
deem appropriate, and to update me on the progress of such negotiations
within 90 days of the date of this proclamation.  Under current
circumstances and in light of future requirements of the United States,
this action is necessary and appropriate to address the threatened
impairment of the national security. 

10.  I have also determined that it is necessary and appropriate to
impose an immediate 25 percent *ad valorem* duty rate on the import of
certain advanced computing chips and certain derivative products
described in the Annex to this proclamation (Covered Products), when
such importation does not contribute to the buildout of the United
States technology supply chain and the strengthening of domestic
manufacturing capacity for derivatives of semiconductors.  I have
further determined that it is necessary and appropriate that this duty
rate not apply to imports of these Covered Products for use in United
States data centers, for repairs or replacements performed in the United
States, for research and development in the United States involving
these chips, for startups in the United States, for non-data center
consumer applications in the United States, for use in non-data center
civil industrial applications in the United States, for use in United
States public sector applications, or for other uses that the Secretary
determines contribute to the strengthening of the United States
technology supply chain or domestic manufacturing capacity for
derivatives of semiconductors.  In my judgment, the tariff regime
imposed in clause (3) of this proclamation will address the threat to
the national security found in this proclamation by, among other things,
incentivizing the development of domestic manufacturing of certain
semiconductors and their derivative products, reducing reliance on
imports of certain advanced computing chips and certain derivative
products, and promoting research and development in support of the
United States’ high-tech infrastructure and capabilities. 

11.  In my judgment, based on current circumstances as well as the
future needs of the United States, the actions in this proclamation are
necessary and appropriate to address the threat to impair the national
security posed by imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing
equipment, and their derivatives.  In particular, the actions in this
proclamation will, among other things, help increase domestic production
of semiconductors and reduce our Nation’s reliance on foreign sources
and foreign supply chains.  Along with other efforts by my
Administration to promote the domestic semiconductor industry, the
actions in this proclamation will ensure that domestic supply chains
will be able to meet current and future domestic demand for
semiconductors and their derivative products, which is essential for our
defense systems and industry.  These actions will also incentivize
domestic industry to reduce reliance on imports of semiconductors, while
leveraging imported semiconductors in circumstances that accelerate AI
innovation in the United States and aid in building out the domestic
technology supply chain.

12.  Section 232 authorizes the President to take action to adjust the
imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into
the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to
threaten to impair the national security.  Section 232 includes the
authority to adopt and carry out a plan of action, with adjustments over
time, to address the national security threat.  This plan of action may
include negotiations of agreements with foreign trading partners along
with other actions to adjust imports to address the national security
threat, including tariffs.  If action under section 232 includes the
negotiation of an agreement, such as one contemplated in section
232(c)(3)(A)(i) (19 U.S.C. 1862(c)(3)(A)(i)), the President may also
take other actions he deems necessary to adjust imports to eliminate the
threat that the imported article poses to the national security,
including if such an agreement is not entered into within 180 days of
the date of this proclamation, is not being carried out, or is
ineffective.  *See* 19 U.S.C. 1862(c)(3)(A).

13.  Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483)
(section 604), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized
Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes
affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the
removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or
other import restriction.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws
of the United States, including section 232, 19 U.S.C. 1862; section
604, 19 U.S.C. 2483; and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, do
hereby proclaim as follows:

(1)  The Secretary and the Trade Representative, and any senior official
they deem appropriate, shall jointly pursue or continue pursuing
negotiations of agreements contemplated in section 232(c)(3)(A)(i) (19
U.S.C. 1862(c)(3)(A)(i)) to address the threatened impairment of the
national security with respect to imported semiconductors, semiconductor
manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products.  Depending on
the status or resolution of such negotiations, I may consider imposing
significant tariffs on imports of semiconductors, semiconductor
manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products, as well as an
accompanying tariff offset program to incentivize domestic
manufacturing.

\(2\)  Within 90 days of the date of this proclamation, the Secretary
and the Trade Representative, in consultation with any senior official
they deem appropriate, shall update me on the status or outcome of the
negotiations directed under clause (1) of this proclamation.

\(3\)  Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, imports of
Covered Products will be subject to a 25 percent *ad valorem* duty
rate.  This tariff shall be effective with respect to goods entered for
consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after
12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on January 15, 2026, and shall continue
in effect, unless such action is expressly reduced, modified, or
terminated.  This tariff is in addition to any other duties, fees,
exactions, and charges applicable to such imported semiconductors,
unless stated otherwise below.  The duty rate described in this clause
shall not apply to imports of those Covered Products for use in United
States data centers, for repairs or replacements performed in the United
States, for research and development in the United States, for use by
startups, for non-data center consumer applications in the United
States, for use in non-data center civil industrial applications in the
United States, for use in United States public sector applications, or
for other uses that the Secretary determines contribute to the

(6)  No drawback shall be available with respect to the duties imposed
pursuant to this proclamation.

(7)  CBP may take any necessary or appropriate measure to administer the
tariff imposed by this proclamation to the extent permitted by
applicable law.

(8)  Any product described in clause (3) of this proclamation, except
those eligible for admission as “domestic status” as described in 19 CFR
146.43, that is subject to a duty imposed by this proclamation and that
is admitted into a United States foreign trade zone on or after the
effective date of this proclamation must be admitted as “privileged
foreign status” as described in 19 CFR 146.41 and will be subject upon
entry for consumption to any *ad valorem* rates of duty related to the
classification under the applicable HTSUS subheading.

\(9\)  The Secretary shall continue to monitor imports of
semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their
derivative products.  The Secretary also shall, from time to time, in
consultation with any senior executive branch officials the Secretary
deems appropriate, review the status of such imports with respect to the
national security.  The Secretary shall inform me of any circumstances
that, in the Secretary’s opinion, might indicate the need for further
action by the President under section 232.  By July 1, 2026, the
Secretary shall provide me with an update on the market for
semiconductors that are used in United States data centers, so that the
President may determine whether it is appropriate to modify the tariff
imposed in this proclamation.  The Secretary shall also inform me of any
circumstance that, in the Secretary’s opinion, might indicate that the
tariff imposed in this proclamation is no longer necessary.

(10)  To the extent consistent with applicable law and the purpose of
this proclamation, the Secretary, the Trade Representative, and the
Secretary of Homeland Security are directed and authorized to take all
actions that are appropriate to implement and effectuate this
proclamation and any actions contemplated by this proclamation,
including, consistent with applicable law, the issuance of regulations,
rules, guidance, and procedures and the temporary suspension or
amendment of regulations, within their respective jurisdictions, and to
