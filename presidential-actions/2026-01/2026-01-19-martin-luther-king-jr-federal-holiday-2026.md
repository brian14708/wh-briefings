BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

Today, we honor the noble work of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr., whose commitment to justice paved the way to the full realization
of the American promise.  Inspired by the tenets enshrined in our
Declaration of Independence, we proudly renew our pledge to uphold our
Nation’s long-cherished principles of liberty, equal justice under the
law, and the God‑given dignity of the human person.

Beginning in the 1950s, Dr. King pioneered a movement that would go on
to triumphantly reaffirm our national conviction that every man, woman,
and child is endowed by their Creator with rights to life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness.  On August 28, 1963, he stood on the marble
steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., to unify millions of
voices with his legendary articulation of an immortal truth:  The
measure of a person is found not in the color of their skin but in the
content of their character.

More than 60 years after they were first proclaimed, those mighty words
remain embedded in every American heart.  Dr. King’s extraordinary
resolve stands as an enduring testament to the unstoppable fire of
freedom and, tragically, ultimately cost him his life.  As President, I
am steadfastly committed to ensuring that our country will always be
guided by the same principles that Dr. King defended throughout his life
and to upholding the timeless truth that our rights are not granted by
government but endowed by Almighty God.  To honor his legacy, last year,
I proudly ordered the declassification of documents related to his
assassination — because more than 50 years after his death, his family
and the American people deserved the truth.

Today, we honor the brave men and women who remain steadfast in their
commitment to law, order, liberty, and justice for all.  We renew our
resolve to honor our heritage, reclaim our freedom, and recommit to the
truth that America is, was, and forever will be a great Nation.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 19, 2026, as
the Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday.  On this day, I encourage
all Americans to recommit themselves to Dr. King’s dream by engaging in
acts of service to others, to their community, and to our Nation. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-six, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
fiftieth.

                               DONALD J. TRUMP
