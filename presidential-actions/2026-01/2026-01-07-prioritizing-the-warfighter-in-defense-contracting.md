title: Prioritizing the Warfighter in Defense Contracting
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  As Chief
Executive and Commander in Chief, I am committed to ensuring that the
United States military possesses the most lethal warfighting
capabilities in the world.  Our Nation can only be at peace if we
maintain strength.  The performance of America’s defense industrial
base is critical to this capacity.  After years of misplaced priorities,
traditional defense contractors have been incentivized to prioritize
investor returns over the Nation’s warfighters.  

While the United States produces the best military equipment in the
world, we do not make enough of it quickly enough to meet the needs of
our military and our partners.  As a result, in these dangerous times,
it is imperative that our defense contractors be held to the highest
standards intended to ensure the advancement of core national interests,
including with respect to the timeliness and quality of the defense
items that they deliver.

Although some contractors have made critical investments in increased
production capacity and been responsive to our Nation’s vital interests,
far more have not.  Many large contractors — while underperforming on
existing contracts — pursue newer, more lucrative contracts, stock
buy-backs, and excessive dividends to shareholders at the cost of
production capacity, innovation, and on-time delivery. 

Effective immediately, they are not permitted in any way, shape, or form
to pay dividends or buy back stock, until such time as they are able to
produce a superior product, on time and on budget.

Every firm across our economy has a right to profit from prudent
investment and hard work, but the American defense industrial base also
has the responsibility to ensure that America’s warfighters have the
best possible equipment and weapons.  These two objectives are not
mutually exclusive.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of the United States Government to accelerate defense procurement
and revitalize the defense industrial base to maintain peace through
strength.  To achieve this, the United States will no longer allow
defense contractors to single-mindedly pursue investor profits at the
expense of warfighter capability and readiness.  Major defense
contractors will no longer conduct stock buy-backs or issue dividends at
the expense of accelerated procurement and increased production
capacity.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Review</span>.  (a)  Within 30
days of the date of this order, and on a continuing basis thereafter,
the Secretary of War (Secretary) shall identify any defense contractors
for critical weapons, supplies, and equipment that are underperforming
on their contracts, not investing their own capital into necessary
production capacity, not sufficiently prioritizing United States
Government contracts, or whose production speed is insufficient as
determined by the Secretary, and that have, during the period of
underperformance or insufficient prioritization, investment, or
production speed, engaged in any stock buy-back or corporate
distribution.  If a contractor is identified as such, the Secretary
shall provide that contractor with notice describing the nature of the
underperformance or insufficient prioritization, investment, or
production speed.  The Secretary shall then engage as needed with the
relevant contractor to resolve the issues identified in such notice,
including, where permissible under applicable law, providing the
contractor with the opportunity to submit a remediation plan approved by
its board of directors for review by the Secretary, during the 15-day
period following notification.

\(b\)  For those contractors that have already been identified and
studied by the Secretary as of the date of this order, in the manner
described in subsection (a) of this section, an additional review as
described in subsection (a) of this section may not be required, as
determined by the Secretary.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Enforcement</span>.  (a)  In
any case where the contractor’s remediation plan is insufficient as
determined by the Secretary, or the contractor and the Secretary are
unable to resolve the dispute as to underperformance within the relevant
15-day negotiation period, the Secretary may initiate immediate actions
to secure remedies for the Secretary that will expedite production,
prioritize the United States military, and return the contractor to
sufficient performance, investment, prioritization, and production, to
the maximum extent permitted by law, including through use of any
voluntary agreement of the contractor, available enforcement actions
under the Defense Production Act (50 U.S.C. 4501 *et seq*.), and any
available contract enforcement mechanisms within the Federal Acquisition
Regulations and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations Supplement. 
When considering whether to initiate any available enforcement action,
the Secretary, to the extent permitted by law, shall take into account
the financial condition of the defense contractor, the economic
viability of relevant programs, and the potential mutual benefits
offered by robust and sustained growth opportunities from the United
States Government coupled with capital investments by the contractor.

\(b\)  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall
take steps to ensure that any future contract with any new or existing
defense contractor, including any renewal, contains a provision
prohibiting both any stock buy-back and corporate distributions by the
contractor during a period of underperformance, non-compliance with the
contractor’s contract, insufficient prioritization of the contract,
insufficient investment, or insufficient production speed as determined
by the Secretary.  Additionally, the Secretary shall ensure such future
contracts stipulate that executive incentive compensation for
contractors will not be tied to short-term financial metrics, such as
free cash flow or earnings per share driven by stock buy-backs, and
instead will be linked to on-time delivery, increased production, and
all necessary facilitation of investments and operating improvements
required to rapidly expand our United States stockpiles and
capabilities.  Further, the Secretary shall ensure such future contracts
allow the Secretary, upon a finding by the Secretary that a contractor
has engaged in underperformance, non-compliance with the contractor’s
contract, insufficient prioritization of the contract, insufficient
investment, or insufficient production speed, to require that executive
base salaries of the contractor be capped at current levels, with
increases allowed for inflation, consistent with applicable law, for a
time period sufficient to allow the Secretary to scrutinize the
incentive portion of executive compensation to ensure it is directly,
fairly, and tightly tied to the above metrics.

(c)  When a contractor is identified by the Secretary pursuant to
section 3 of this order, the Secretary shall, in consultation with the
Secretary of State and the Secretary of Commerce, consider whether it is
appropriate to cease ongoing advocacy efforts or deny new advocacy cases
for underperforming contractors competing for an international Foreign
Military or Direct Commercial Sale.

\(d\)  The Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission shall
consider whether to adopt amended regulations governing stock buy-backs
under Rule 10b-18 that would prohibit use of the relevant safe harbor
for defense contractors of the type identified by the Secretary pursuant
to section 3 of this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. 
(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(d)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Department of War.
