title: Addressing State and Local Failures to Rebuild Los Angeles After Wildfire Disasters
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  One year ago,
the California State and Los Angeles city and county governments failed
to contain wildfires that ravaged Los Angeles and consumed nearly 40,000
acres of homes and businesses.  The State and local governments failed
to engage in responsible forest management systems out of a misguided
commitment to naturalist and climate policies, which increased the
severity of the fires.  They failed to maintain water distribution and
reservoir systems so that these systems would be available and fully
functional in case of emergency. They then failed to quickly communicate
evacuation warnings and failed to act decisively or cohesively to
contain the fire once it started burning.  In fact, Mayor Karen Bass was
not in Los Angeles to respond to the crisis because she was traveling
abroad.  This marked one of the greatest failures of elected political
leadership in American history, from enabling the wildfires to failing
to manage them, and it continues today with the abject failure to
rebuild.

While the Biden Administration made big promises, debris removal did not
actually begin until my Administration, through Executive Order 14181 of
January 24, 2025 (Emergency Measures to Provide Water Resources in
California and Improve Disaster Response in Certain Areas), initiated
the fastest debris-removal operation in United States history.  The
Federal Government completed hazardous-materials sweeps and cleared over
9,500 properties of over 2.6 million tons of debris in just 6 months.

But since then, American families and small businesses affected by the
wildfires have been forced to continue living in a nightmare of delay,
uncertainty, and bureaucratic malaise as they remain displaced from
their homes, often without a source of income, while State and local
governments delay or prevent reconstruction by approving only a fraction
of the permits needed to rebuild. 

The Federal Government has approved numerous individual relief claims to
provide financial support directly to owners of homes and businesses and
help survivors repair, rebuild, return home, reopen their businesses,
and restore their communities.  But many homeowners and businesses have
been unable to use these funds as they navigate overly burdensome,
confusing, and inconsistent permitting requirements, duplicative
permitting reviews, procedural bottlenecks, and administrative delays at
the city, county, and State levels.  Elected leaders have refused to
take even the minimum action necessary to allow many of these survivors
to move forward and rebuild their lives — the ultimate tragic failure of
the State of California and City of Los Angeles to live up to their
moral and legal obligations to their citizens.  As a result, despite the
Federal Government expeditiously clearing debris and doing its part to
support survivors, the actions of State and local authorities have
ensured that the vast majority of the tens of thousands of homes and
businesses destroyed in the wildfires have not yet been rebuilt a year
later.  

In furtherance of the Presidential Declaration of a Major Disaster for
the State of California (FEMA-4856-DR), immediate and decisive Federal
action is required to ensure that Federal disaster assistance is
delivered and utilized swiftly, effectively, and without obstruction by
State and local governments, to accomplish the purposes for which it is
allocated, as well as to support the American people who have been
devastated by the Pacific Palisades and Eaton Canyon wildfires. 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of my Administration that federally funded reconstruction
projects for homes and businesses in the wildfire-impacted neighborhoods
of the Pacific Palisades and Eaton Canyon areas proceed with the maximum
speed consistent with public safety, and that Federal assistance not be
frustrated by unnecessary, duplicative, or obstructive permitting
requirements that prevent families and businesses from rebuilding.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Preempting State Permitting
Obstacles</span>.  (a)  The Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary),
acting through the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA), and the Administrator of the Small Business
Administration (SBA) shall each consider promulgating regulations to
advance the policies of this order.  In particular, the Administrator of
the SBA and the Secretary, through the Administrator of FEMA, shall
consider promulgating regulations that:

\(i\)   preempt State or local permitting processes, and other similar
pre-approval requirements, that each agency has found to have unduly
impeded the timely use of Federal emergency-relief funds by homeowners,
businesses, or houses of worship in rebuilding such structures following
a disaster; and

\(ii\)  replace preempted State or local permitting regimes, or other
similar pre-approval requirements, with a requirement that builders
self-certify to a Federal designee from each agency that they have
complied with all applicable substantive State and local health and
safety standards with respect to the structure proposed to be rebuilt
using Federal emergency-relief funds.

\(b\)  The Secretary, through the Administrator of FEMA, and the
Administrator of the SBA shall each publish proposed regulations under
subsection (a) of this section, if any, within 30 days of the date of
this order and final regulations within 90 days of the date of this
order.  Each agency head shall further consider whether notice and
comment is unnecessary under 5 U.S.C. 553 or any other statute.

\(c\)  The Secretary, through the Administrator of FEMA, shall continue
to review all repairs and construction activities conducted under this
order for compliance with applicable health, safety, and other
substantive standards.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Expediting Federal
Response</span>.  (a)  The Federal Government has already taken action
to expedite administrative processes related to water delivery, as
detailed in Executive Order 14181 of January 24, 2025 (Emergency
Measures to Provide Water Resources in California and Improve Disaster
Response in Certain Areas).  In addition, the heads of relevant
executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall seek to use all
authorities available under Federal environmental, historic
preservation, natural resource laws, or other similar laws, including
the National Environmental Protection Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 *et seq.*),
the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 *et seq*.), and the National
Historic Preservation Act (54 U.S.C. 300101 *et seq.*), to expedite
waivers, permits, reviews, consultations, or approvals with respect to
homes, businesses, or other such structures proposed to be rebuilt using
Federal emergency-relief funds that are required to facilitate Federal
response and recovery actions that will advance the policy of this
order, consistent with applicable law.  

(b)  The heads of relevant agencies shall take steps to ensure that the
process for evaluating and issuing such waivers, permits, reviews,
consultations, or approvals shall be limited to the minimum scope and
duration required to expeditiously advance the policy of this order and
implement Individual Assistance and Hazard Mitigation Grant Programs
while ensuring public health and safety.

(c)  The heads of relevant agencies shall each designate a senior
official from their agency to ensure timely execution of these actions
without delay.

<u>Sec</u>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Legislation</span>.  Within 90
days of the date of this order, the Secretary, through the Administrator
of FEMA, and the Administrator of the SBA, in consultation with the
Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and the White House
Director of Legislative Affairs, shall submit to the President, through
the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, legislative
proposals that enable FEMA and SBA to address situations in which States
or local governments are not enabling timely recovery after disasters,
including through appropriate regulation.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Accountability for Use of
Taxpayer Dollars</span>.  (a)  The Secretary, through the Administrator
of FEMA, shall:

(i)   within 30 days of the date of this order, determine what amount,
if any, of the nearly $3 billion in unspent Hazard Mitigation Grant
Program (HMGP) funding granted to California, which was awarded to
mitigate hazards, including the threat of future wildfires to the
citizens of California, was awarded arbitrarily, capriciously, or
contrary to law; and

(ii)  within 60 days of the date of this order, conduct a Federal audit
of California’s use of HMGP funding, including of whether funded
projects were completed as approved and on time, whether projected risk
reduction matched actual outcomes, and whether California used Federal
funding in a way that demonstrably mitigated the impact of future
wildfires on its citizens.

\(b\)  Within 30 days of the completion of the audit described in
subsection (a)(ii) of this section, the Secretary, through the
Administrator of FEMA, shall make administrative determinations in light
of the audit’s findings and recommendations, and shall enforce such
determinations by, where appropriate, imposing future grant conditions,
initiating recoupment or recovery actions in accordance with applicable
law, or deploying oversight and technical assistance to expedite the
administration and use of HMGP funds for individuals, families, and
small businesses, to implement this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">7</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.  (a)
 Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise effect:

(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget related to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(d)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Department of Homeland Security.
