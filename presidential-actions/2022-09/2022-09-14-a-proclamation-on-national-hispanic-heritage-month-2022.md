title: "A Proclamation on National Hispanic Heritage Month,\_2022"
---
 
          Hispanic heritage holds an indelible place in the heart and
soul of our Nation, and National Hispanic Heritage Month reminds us that
the American identity is a fabric of diverse traditions and stories
woven together.  Since the beginning, our country has drawn strength and
insights from Hispanic writers, scientists, soldiers, doctors,
entrepreneurs, academics, and leaders in labor and government.  Our
culture has been enriched by the rhythms, art, literature, and
creativity of Hispanic peoples.  And our deepest values have been
informed by the love of family and faith that is at the core of so many
Hispanic communities.  All of these contributions help us realize the
promise of America for all Americans.  
     During National Hispanic Heritage Month, we reaffirm that diversity
is one of our country’s greatest strengths.  We also acknowledge the
Hispanic leaders who have stayed in the struggle for equal justice to
ensure that everyone in this Nation can contribute their talents and
have the opportunity to thrive.  
     My Administration is committed to the success of Hispanic
communities.  Since coming to office, we have provided billions of
dollars in loans, including to Hispanic-owned small businesses, and are
working to increase the share of Government contracts going to
underserved businesses by 50 percent.  We have helped students,
including Hispanic students, earn postsecondary degrees by providing
over $10 billion to community colleges and approximately $11 billion to
Hispanic-Serving Institutions.  My Administration has sent billions of
dollars in emergency financial aid grants directly to students and has
increased the maximum Pell Grant by the largest amount in over
a decade.  Additionally, my Administration is providing up to $20,000 in
debt relief as part of a comprehensive effort to address the burden of
growing college costs.  This action will have a significant impact on
Hispanic borrowers, given that among Hispanic undergraduate borrowers,
65 percent receive Pell Grants.  We have also strengthened rental
assistance for families facing eviction and bolstered community health
centers that predominately serve Hispanic patients and other patients of
color.  Our American Rescue Plan expanded the Child Tax Credit for 2021,
providing critical relief to millions of working families and helping
drive a historic reduction in Hispanic child poverty.  
     As we look ahead, we will continue to build a fair, humane, and
orderly immigration system and fight to protect the rights of Deferred
Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients and others who call this
country home.  That means continuing to support a pathway to citizenship
for those with temporary protected status as well as farm workers and
other essential workers.  It means keeping alive the torch of liberty
that has led generations of immigrants to this land seeking new
opportunities and a better future.  We will also work to strengthen our
partnerships with allies across Latin America.  
     Additionally, we are committed to reflecting the full talents of
our Nation through our own Administration.  I am proud to have appointed
Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, Secretary of
Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, Secretary of Education Miguel
Cardona, and Small Business Administrator Isabel Guzman, as well as
Hispanic staff at every level of the Federal Government.   
     This month, we carry on the important work of honoring Hispanic
heritage.  Let us give thanks to the many generations of Hispanic
leaders who have helped build this country and continue to fight for
equality and justice.  Let us pledge to invest in the next generation of
Hispanic men and women who hold the destiny of our Nation in their
hands.   
     In recognition of the achievements of the Hispanic community, the
Congress, by Public Law 100-402, as amended, has authorized and
requested the President to issue annually a proclamation designating
September 15 through October 15 as “National Hispanic Heritage Month.”  
     NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United
States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the
Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim
September 15 through October 15, 2022, as National Hispanic Heritage
Month.  I call upon all Americans to observe this month with appropriate
ceremonies, activities, and programs that celebrate Hispanic heritage
and recognize the impact Hispanic peoples have had on our Nation.  
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
fourteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord
two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States
of America the two hundred and forty-seventh.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
