title: "Executive Order on Advancing Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Innovation\
  \ for a Sustainable, Safe, and Secure American\_Bioeconomy"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:

Section 1.  Policy.  It is the policy of my Administration to coordinate
a whole-of-government approach to advance biotechnology and
biomanufacturing towards innovative solutions in health, climate change,
energy, food security, agriculture, supply chain resilience, and
national and economic security.  Central to this policy and its outcomes
are principles of equity, ethics, safety, and security that enable
access to technologies, processes, and products in a manner that
benefits all Americans and the global community and that maintains
United States technological leadership and economic competitiveness.

Biotechnology harnesses the power of biology to create new services and
products, which provide opportunities to grow the United States economy
and workforce and improve the quality of our lives and the environment.
 The economic activity derived from biotechnology and biomanufacturing
is referred to as “the bioeconomy.”  The COVID-19 pandemic has
demonstrated the vital role of biotechnology and biomanufacturing in
developing and producing life-saving diagnostics, therapeutics, and
vaccines that protect Americans and the world.  Although the power of
these technologies is most vivid at the moment in the context of human
health, biotechnology and biomanufacturing can also be used to achieve
our climate and energy goals, improve food security and sustainability,
secure our supply chains, and grow the economy across all of America.

For biotechnology and biomanufacturing to help us achieve our societal
goals, the United States needs to invest in foundational scientific
capabilities.  We need to develop genetic engineering technologies and
techniques to be able to write circuitry for cells and predictably
program biology in the same way in which we write software and program
computers; unlock the power of biological data, including through
computing tools and artificial intelligence; and advance the science of
scale‑up production while reducing the obstacles for commercialization
so that innovative technologies and products can reach markets faster.

Simultaneously, we must take concrete steps to reduce biological risks
associated with advances in biotechnology.  We need to invest in and
promote biosafety and biosecurity to ensure that biotechnology is
developed and deployed in ways that align with United States principles
and values and international best practices, and not in ways that lead
to accidental or deliberate harm to people, animals, or the environment.
 In addition, we must safeguard the United States bioeconomy, as foreign
adversaries and strategic competitors alike use legal and illegal means
to acquire United States technologies and data, including biological
data, and proprietary or precompetitive information, which threatens
United States economic competitiveness and national security.

We also must ensure that uses of biotechnology and biomanufacturing are
ethical and responsible; are centered on a foundation of equity and
public good, consistent with Executive Order 13985 of January 20, 2021
(Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through
the Federal Government); and are consistent with respect for human
rights.  Resources should be invested justly and equitably so that
biotechnology and biomanufacturing technologies benefit all Americans,
especially those in underserved communities, as well as the broader
global community.

To achieve these objectives, it is the policy of my Administration to:

(a)  bolster and coordinate Federal investment in key research and
development (R&D) areas of biotechnology and biomanufacturing in order
to further societal goals;

(b)  foster a biological data ecosystem that advances biotechnology and
biomanufacturing innovation, while adhering to principles of security,
privacy, and responsible conduct of research;

(c)  improve and expand domestic biomanufacturing production capacity
and processes, while also increasing piloting and prototyping efforts in
biotechnology and biomanufacturing to accelerate the translation of
basic research results into practice;

(d)  boost sustainable biomass production and create climate-smart
incentives for American agricultural producers and forest landowners;

(e)  expand market opportunities for bioenergy and biobased products and
services;

(f)  train and support a diverse, skilled workforce and a next
generation of leaders from diverse groups to advance biotechnology and
biomanufacturing;

(g)  clarify and streamline regulations in service of a science- and
risk-based, predictable, efficient, and transparent system to support
the safe use of products of biotechnology;

(h)  elevate biological risk management as a cornerstone of the life
cycle of biotechnology and biomanufacturing R&D, including by providing
for research and investment in applied biosafety and biosecurity
innovation;

(i)  promote standards, establish metrics, and develop systems to grow
and assess the state of the bioeconomy; to better inform policy,
decision-making, and investments in the bioeconomy; and to ensure
equitable and ethical development of the bioeconomy;

(j)  secure and protect the United States bioeconomy by adopting a
forward‑looking, proactive approach to assessing and anticipating
threats, risks, and potential vulnerabilities (including digital
intrusion, manipulation, and exfiltration efforts by foreign
adversaries), and by partnering with the private sector and other
relevant stakeholders to jointly mitigate risks to protect technology
leadership and economic competitiveness; and

\(k\)  engage the international community to enhance biotechnology R&D
cooperation in a way that is consistent with United States principles
and values and that promotes best practices for safe and secure
biotechnology and biomanufacturing research, innovation, and product
development and use.

The efforts undertaken pursuant to this order to further these policies
shall be referred to collectively as the National Biotechnology and
Biomanufacturing Initiative.

management of biotechnology- and biomanufacturing-related R&D globally;
and

(viii)  explore how to align international classifications of
biomanufactured products, as appropriate, to measure the value of those
products to both the United States and global bioeconomies.

(b)  Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State,
in coordination with the USTR and the heads of other agencies as
determined by the Secretary, as appropriate, shall submit to the APNSA a
plan to support the objectives described in subsection (a) of this
section with foreign partners, international organizations, and
nongovernmental entities.

Sec. 13.  Definitions.  For purposes of this order:

(a)  The term “agency” has the meaning given that term by 44 U.S.C.
3502(1).

(b)  The term “biotechnology” means technology that applies to or is
enabled by life sciences innovation or product development.

(c)  The term “biomanufacturing” means the use of biological systems to
develop products, tools, and processes at commercial scale.

(d)  The term “bioeconomy” means economic activity derived from the life
sciences, particularly in the areas of biotechnology and
biomanufacturing, and includes industries, products, services, and the
workforce.

(e)  The term “biological data” means the information, including
associated descriptors, derived from the structure, function, or process
of a biological system(s) that is measured, collected, or aggregated for
analysis.

(f)  The term “biomass” means any material of biological origin that is
available on a renewable or recurring basis.  Examples of biomass
include plants, trees, algae, and waste material such as crop residue,
wood waste, animal waste and byproducts, food waste, and yard waste.

(g)  The term “biobased product” has the meaning given that term in 7
U.S.C. 8101(4).

(h)  The term “bioenergy” means energy derived in whole or in
significant part from biomass.

(i)  The term “multiomic information” refers to combined information
derived from data, analysis, and interpretation of multiple omics
measurement technologies to identify or analyze the roles,
relationships, and functions of biomolecules (including nucleic acids,
proteins, and metabolites) that make up a cell or cellular system.
 Omics are disciplines in biology that include genomics,
transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics.

(j)  The term “key R&D areas” includes fundamental R&D of emerging
biotechnologies, including engineering biology; predictive engineering
of complex biological systems, including the designing, building,
testing, and modeling of entire living cells, cell components, or
cellular systems; quantitative and theory-driven multi-disciplinary
research to maximize convergence with other enabling technologies; and
regulatory science, including the development of new information,
criteria, tools, models, and approaches to inform and assist regulatory
decision-making.  These R&D priorities should be coupled with advances
in predictive modeling, data analytics, artificial intelligence,
bioinformatics, high-performance and other advanced computing systems,
metrology and data-driven standards, and other non-life science enabling
technologies.
