title: "A Proclamation on the\_Death of Queen Elizabeth\_II"
---
 
    Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II was more than a monarch.  She defined
an era.

    In a world of constant change, she was a steadying presence and a
source of comfort and pride for generations of Britons, including many
who have never known their country without her.  Queen Elizabeth II led
always with grace, an unwavering commitment to duty, and the
incomparable power of her example.  She was a stateswoman of unmatched
dignity and constancy who deepened the bedrock Alliance between the
United Kingdom and the United States.  She helped make our relationship
special.  The seven decades of her history-making reign bore witness to
an age of unprecedented human advancement and the forward march of human
dignity.  Her legacy will loom large in the pages of British history,
and in the story of our world. 

   As a mark of respect for the memory of Queen Elizabeth II, by the
authority vested in me as President of the United States by
the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby
order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at
the White House and upon all public buildings and grounds, at all
military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the
Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the
United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset, on the
day of interment.  I also direct that the flag shall be flown
at half-staff for the same length of time at all United States
embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad,
including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-seventh.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
