title: "A Proclamation on World Suicide Prevention Day,\_2022"
---
 
    On World Suicide Prevention Day, our Nation joins the World Health
Organization, the International Association for Suicide Prevention, and
countries across the globe in mourning those who have died by suicide. 
Suicide is a devastating tragedy that leaves loved ones with unanswered
questions and families missing a piece of their soul, wishing for more
time together.  We are still in the early stages of learning about the
conditions that can lead to suicide, including job strain or loss;
serious illnesses; and financial, criminal, legal, and relationship
problems.  Acknowledging suicide and the impact it has on our
communities is a first step to understanding how it can be prevented
more effectively.   
     Suicide accounts for 1 of every 100 deaths globally, and it is the
second leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 10 and
34.  In the United States, American Indians, Alaska Native youth,
LGBTQI+ youth, and rural men are disproportionately affected.  Far too
many service members, veterans, and law enforcement officials have taken
or considered taking their own lives.  And too frequently, these
patriots and public servants do not receive the help they need due both
to stigmas surrounding mental health challenges and lack of access to
necessary resources.  
     During my State of the Union Address, I discussed tackling the
mental health crisis as a key component of my Administration’s Unity
Agenda.  My Administration released a comprehensive Government strategy
designed to address mental health with the same substance and
specificity as our approach to physical health.  It connects more
Americans to care and creates a full spectrum of prevention and recovery
support.  My Administration’s budget proposes investing over $22.8
billion in Fiscal Year 2023 to bolster our mental health and care
workforce, to establish new nontraditional health delivery sites, and to
integrate quality mental health and substance use care into primary care
settings.  As we look ahead, we must advance equity in mental health and
transform how mental health is understood, perceived, and treated.  We
also remain committed to expanding mental health research and services
around the world.  
     Over the last 2 years, we have invested heavily in expanding the
National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which we transitioned from a
10-digit number to the 3-digit dialing code, 9-8-8, this summer.  This
new, easier-to-access tool connects people in crisis to trained
professionals, 24-hours per day, 365 days per year.  
     This summer, I signed into law the first meaningful gun safety bill
in nearly 30 years, which helps States implement red-flag laws that make
it harder for people more likely to harm themselves and others to
purchase guns.  It funds more crisis intervention services and improves
mental health access for children and families.  With funding from my
American Rescue Plan, my Administration strengthened our support for the
Garrett Lee Smith State and Tribal Youth Suicide Prevention and Early
Intervention Program, which awards money to States and Tribes
implementing critical strategies to save lives.  
     Last November, my Administration released a comprehensive public
health strategy for reducing military and veteran suicide, which we are
now working to implement.  In March, the Department of Defense
established the Suicide Prevention and Response Independent Review
Committee to prevent suicide in the military and address suicide risk
for service members who have experienced sexual assault.  I also signed
an Executive Order directing the Department of Health and Human Services
to expand mental health care access to LGBTQI+ youth as a means of
preventing suicide.  
     From committed crisis counselors who serve on hotlines and in
schools to clinicians, behavioral health care practitioners, faith
leaders, teachers, friends, and family members — we each have a role to
play.  Together, we can reduce the stigmatization of mental health
issues, learn how to respond to suicide risk, and offer individuals and
populations most impacted the essential care they need when a crisis
arises.  Together, we can save lives.  
     On this day of commemoration and action, we commit to studying the
risk factors associated with suicide and to making mental health care
accessible and affordable.  Finally, to those experiencing emotional
distress:  please know that you are loved, and that you are not alone. 
There is hope, and there is help, and I encourage you to call or text
9-8-8 to reach the National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.  
     NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United
States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the
Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim
September 10, 2022, as World Suicide Prevention Day.  I call upon all
Americans, communities, organizations, and all levels of government to
join me in creating hope through action and committing to preventing
suicide across America.  
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-seventh.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
