  \ who Commit, Threaten to Commit, or Support\_Terrorism"

On September 23, 2001, by Executive Order 13224, the President declared
a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq*.) to deal with the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and
economy of the United States constituted by the grave acts of terrorism
and threats of terrorism committed by foreign terrorists, including the
terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, in New York and Pennsylvania
and against the Pentagon, and the continuing and immediate threat of
further attacks against United States nationals or the United States.

On September 9, 2019, the President signed Executive Order 13886 to
strengthen and consolidate sanctions to combat the continuing threat
posed by international terrorism and to take additional steps to deal
with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13224, as
amended.

The actions of persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support
terrorism continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.
 For this reason, the national emergency declared in Executive Order
13224 of September 23, 2001, as amended, and the measures adopted to
deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond September 23,
2022.  Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the
national emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to
commit, or support terrorism declared in Executive Order 13224, as
amended.

This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and transmitted
to the Congress.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
September 19, 2022.
