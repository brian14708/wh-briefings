---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Alaska and ordered Federal assistance to
supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas
affected by a severe storm, flooding, and landslides from September 15
to September 20, 2022.

The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in the Regional Educational Attendance Areas of Bering
Strait, Kashunamiut, Lower Kuskokwim, and Lower Yukon.

Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.

Federal funding also is available to state, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency protective measures in the Regional
Educational Attendance Areas of Bering Strait, Kashunamiut, Lower
Kuskokwim, and Lower Yukon.

Lastly, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Timothy B. Manner as the
Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas. 

Damage assessments are continuing in other areas, and more areas and
additional forms of assistance may be designated after the assessments
are fully completed.

Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance
