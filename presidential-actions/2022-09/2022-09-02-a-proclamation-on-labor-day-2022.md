title: "A Proclamation on Labor Day,\_2022"

     American workers have built our communities, laid the foundation
for our democracy, and powered the engine of our prosperity.  From the
factory hands who forged an Arsenal of Democracy and helped beat back
fascism during World War II, to the immigrants who assembled the
transcontinental railroad that connected America’s coasts, to the health
care professionals and first responders who mobilized selflessly during
the pandemic to save countless lives, American workers have guided us
through our most difficult moments and delivered some of our Nation’s
greatest triumphs.  
     Unions have been the voice of American workers, guiding their path
to power as a major force in our society.  Unions fought for higher
wages and family-supporting benefits, established vital health and
safety standards, secured an 8-hour work day, eradicated child labor,
guarded against discrimination and harassment, and bargained for every
worker’s fair share of economic prosperity.  They give workers a say in
critical decisions affecting their lives and livelihoods and play a
transformative role in shaping the future of our democracy.  The middle
class built America, and unions built the middle class.  When organized
labor wins, families win.  We all win.  
     I said from the start that I would be the most pro-worker and
pro-union President in American history, and I am keeping that promise. 
When I took office, I put money in the pockets of hardworking Americans
with the American Rescue Plan, offering families much-needed breathing
room.  I have now enacted a bold, long-term economic agenda that will
lead to historic investments in our Nation and our workers:  the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the
Inflation Reduction Act.  My economic agenda is a once-in-a-generation
blueprint to rebuild America, outcompete every other economy in the
world, and create thousands of good-paying and clean-manufacturing
jobs.  We are putting plumbers, pipefitters, electrical workers, steel
workers, and so many others to work on a range of projects — from
rebuilding our infrastructure to manufacturing semiconductors, electric
vehicles, wind turbines, and solar panels.  Many of these jobs will be
union jobs.  
     This is just the beginning.  To give workers more power and raise
wages, I signed an Executive Order calling for a ban on unfair
non-compete agreements that hinder people from building on their
experience to take new jobs in their industries.  I created a White
House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment with the aim of
identifying new ways the executive branch can facilitate the organizing
of workers.  I also appointed a former union president and card-carrying
union member to serve this country as the Secretary of Labor.  
     Still, there is more we can do.  I believe every worker should have
a free and fair choice to organize and bargain collectively with their
employer without coercion or intimidation.  That is why I called on the
Congress to finally pass the Richard L. Trumka Protecting the Right to
Organize Act and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act, which will
make it easier for private-sector, State, and local government workers
to join a union and bargain collectively.  
     As our economy recovers and rebuilds, we must build it from the
bottom up and the middle out — not the top down — so everyone benefits. 
Our Nation continues to fall short of its promise to deliver equal
opportunity to workers of color and women, among others, and we can do
more to ensure that good-paying jobs are accessible to everyone.  Only
when all workers have a strong voice in their wages, benefits, and job
treatment can we start to change how we value their labor.  Only then
can we begin to reward work and not just wealth.  
     I have had the honor of meeting workers of every stripe.  I have
visited longshore workers in California, firefighters in Colorado,
transit workers in New Jersey, welders in Wisconsin, and teachers in
Virginia, among many others.  I also welcomed frontline
worker-organizers into the Oval Office.  Whenever I meet members of
America’s labor community — dedicated women and men who derive purpose
from their work — I am reminded of something my father used to tell me:
“A job is about more than a paycheck — it is about dignity and
respect.”  
     This Labor Day, let us honor those trailblazers who have fought for
the rights of working people.  Let us stand in solidarity with all
workers and strengthen their ability to organize and bargain with
employers.  Let us give thanks to all of America’s workers who build
this Nation and pave our future.  
     NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United
States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the
Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim
September 5, 2022, as Labor Day.  I call upon all public officials and
people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate
programs, ceremonies, and activities that honor the energy and
innovation of working Americans.  
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
second day of September, in the year of our Lord
two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States
of America the two hundred and forty-seventh.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
