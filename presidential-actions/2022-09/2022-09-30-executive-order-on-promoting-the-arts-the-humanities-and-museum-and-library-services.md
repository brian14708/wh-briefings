title: "Executive Order on Promoting the Arts, the Humanities, and Museum and Library\_\
  Services"
---
 
     By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as
follows:  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.  <span
style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  The arts, the
humanities, and museum and library services are essential to the
well-being, health, vitality, and democracy of our Nation.  They are the
soul of America, reflecting our multicultural and democratic
experience.  They further help us strive to be the more perfect Union to
which generation after generation of Americans have aspired.  They
inspire us; provide livelihoods; sustain, anchor, and bring cohesion
within diverse communities across our Nation; stimulate creativity and
innovation; help us understand and communicate our values as a people;
compel us to wrestle with our history and enable us to imagine our
future; invigorate and strengthen our democracy; and point the way
toward progress.  
  
     It is the policy of my Administration to advance the cultural
vitality of the United States by promoting the arts, the humanities, and
museum and library services.  To that end, my Administration will
advance equity, accessibility, and opportunities for all Americans,
particularly in underserved communities as defined in Executive Order
13985 of January 20, 2021 (Advancing Racial Equity and Support for
Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government), so that they
may realize their full potential through the arts, the humanities, and
access to museum and library services.  Additionally, we will strengthen
America’s creative and cultural economy, including by enhancing and
expanding opportunities for artists, humanities scholars, students,
educators, and cultural heritage practitioners, as well as the museums,
libraries, archives, historic sites, colleges and universities, and
other institutions that support their work.  
  
     Under my Administration, the arts, the humanities, and museum and
library services will be integrated into strategies, policies, and
programs that advance the economic development, well-being, and
resilience of all communities, especially those that have historically
been underserved.  The arts, the humanities, and museum and library
services will be promoted and expanded to strengthen public, physical,
and mental health; wellness; and healing, including within military and
veteran communities.  We will enhance access to high-quality arts and
humanities education and programming with the aim of enabling every
child in America to obtain the broad creative skills and enrichment
vital to succeed.  My Administration’s efforts to tackle the climate
crisis will be bolstered through Federal and societal support for and
advancement of the arts, the humanities, and museum and library
services.  We will also safeguard and promote the artistic and cultural
heritage of the United States and its people domestically and
internationally.  Finally, my Administration will strengthen our
Nation’s democracy, increase civic engagement and public service,
bolster social cohesion, and advance the cause of equity and
accessibility by lifting up more — and more diverse — voices and
experiences through Federal support for the arts, the humanities, and
museum and library services.
