MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

SUBJECT:       Presidential Waiver of Statutory Requirements Pursuant to
Section 303 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended  
  
  
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including section 303 of the
Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (the “Act”) (50 U.S.C. 4533),
I hereby determine, pursuant to section 303(a)(7)(B) of the Act, that
action is necessary to increase the production capacity of material
critical to support the defense against adversarial aggression and that
a shortfall in this area would severely impair national defense
capability.  Therefore, I waive the requirements of sections 303(a)(5)
and 303(a)(6) of the Act for the purpose of expanding and accelerating
the domestic production capability of critical weapons and equipment
needed for national defense.  
  
You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the
*Federal Register.*

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
