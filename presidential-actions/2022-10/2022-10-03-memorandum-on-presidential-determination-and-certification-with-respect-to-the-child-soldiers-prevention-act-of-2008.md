Pursuant to section 404 of the Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008 (22
U.S.C. 2370c-1) (CSPA), I hereby:  
  
Determine that it is in the national interest of the United States to
waive in part the application of the prohibition in section 404(a) of
the CSPA with respect to the Central African Republic and the Democratic
Republic of the Congo to allow for the provision of International
Military Education and Training (IMET) and Peacekeeping Operations (PKO)
assistance, to the extent that the CSPA would restrict such assistance;
to waive in part the application of the prohibition in section 404(a) of
the CSPA with respect to Somalia and Yemen to allow for the provision of
IMET and PKO assistance and support provided pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 333,
to the extent that the CSPA would restrict such assistance or support;
to waive the application of the prohibition in section 404(a) of the
CSPA with respect to allowing for the issuance of licenses for direct
commercial sales related to other United States Government assistance
for the above countries and, with respect to Russia, solely for direct
commercial sales in connection with the International Space Station;
and  
  
Certify that the governments of the above countries are taking effective
and continuing steps to address the problem of child soldiers.   
  
Accordingly, I hereby waive such applications of section 404(a) of the
CSPA.

You are authorized and directed to submit this determination and
certification to the Congress, along with the Memorandum of
Justification, and to publish this determination in the *Federal
