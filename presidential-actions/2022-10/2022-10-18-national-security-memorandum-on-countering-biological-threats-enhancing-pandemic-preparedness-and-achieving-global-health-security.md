              Health Security  
   
   
It is a vital interest of the United States to prepare for, prevent,
detect, respond to, and recover from biological threats at home and
abroad.  The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has highlighted that
the United States and the world are vulnerable to biological threats,
whether naturally occurring, accidental, or deliberate.  COVID-19 has
cost millions of lives and has resulted in trillions of dollars in
economic loss and major setbacks in health and economic development
globally.  No sector of the United States economy or society is immune
to the effects of a major biological incident.  Moreover, few other
national security threats are capable of producing catastrophic and
potentially existential global consequences at the scale and speed of
biological threats.  Therefore, countering biological threats, advancing
pandemic preparedness, and achieving global health security are top
national and international security priorities for the United States.
 Nearly all executive departments and agencies (agencies) contribute to
the biodefense mission of the United States Government.  Moving forward,
the United States must fundamentally transform its capabilities to
protect our Nation from biological threats and advance pandemic
preparedness and health security more broadly for the world.  
   
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.  <span
style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the policy of
the United States to preserve our health, economic, social, and national
security by protecting the Nation from biological threats and promoting
pandemic preparedness and global health security.  The United States
Government will undertake actions at home and with partners globally to
reduce the risk of naturally occurring, accidental, and deliberate
biological events with the potential to significantly impact humans,
animals (domestic and wildlife), plants, and the environment, and to
negatively affect health, the economy, society, and security.  
   
     The foundational policies for the United States Government’s role
in biodefense include:  the National Biodefense Strategy for Countering
Biological Threats, Enhancing Pandemic Preparedness, and Achieving
Global Health Security (Biodefense Strategy) and its associated
Implementation Plan, American Pandemic Preparedness:  Transforming Our
Capabilities, and the U.S. Global Health Security Strategy.  Agency
activities in support of the Biodefense Strategy and its Implementation
Plan shall be conducted consistent with the Biodefense Strategy.
 Activities undertaken to implement existing Executive Orders and
Presidential Directives, including but not limited to those listed in
Annex IV of the Biodefense Strategy, shall be conducted consistent with
the Biodefense Strategy.  Further, implementation of this memorandum
shall ensure consistent integration with Presidential Directives
regarding domestic response.  
   
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span
style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.  <span
style="text-decoration: underline">Coordination and Governance of United
States Biodefense Efforts</span>.  The policy set forth in section 1 of
this memorandum shall be implemented, to the extent permitted by law and
available appropriations and subject to the internal programmatic and
budgetary processes of relevant agencies, as follows:  
   
     (a)  The Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs
(APNSA) shall serve as the lead for policy coordination and review,
acting through the process described in National Security Memorandum 2
(NSM-2) of February 4, 2021 (Renewing the National Security Council
System), to provide strategic input and facilitate policy integration
for Federal biodefense efforts.  
   
     (b)  In accordance with Executive Order 13987 of January 20, 2021
(Organizing and Mobilizing the United States Government to Provide a
Unified and Effective Response to Combat COVID-19 and to Provide United
States Leadership on Global Health and Security), and National Security
Memorandum 1 of January 21, 2021 (United States Global Leadership to
Strengthen the International COVID-19 Response and to Advance Global
Health Security and Biological Preparedness), the APNSA shall coordinate
the Federal Government’s efforts to prepare for, prevent, detect,
respond to, and recover from biological threats and to advance global
health security, international pandemic preparedness, and global health
resilience.  This subsection does not apply to Federal law enforcement
activities, criminal investigations, or intelligence activities related
to domestic incidents involving suspected terrorist threats, terrorist
attacks, significant cyber incidents or other acts within the criminal
jurisdiction of the United States.  
   
     (c)  The heads of agencies shall:  
   
          (i)    implement the Biodefense Strategy, as well as related
strategies such as the U.S. Global Health Security Strategy, and include
biodefense-related activities, including resourcing and achieving the
goals of the Biodefense Strategy and the priorities, targets, and
actions of its Implementation Plan, within their strategic planning and
budgetary processes;  
   
          (ii)   in the event of the determination of a nationally or
internationally significant biological incident, implement Federal
response efforts in accordance with Homeland Security Presidential
Directive 5 of February 28, 2003 (Management of Domestic Incidents),
Presidential Policy Directive 8 of March 30, 2011 (National
Preparedness), Presidential Policy Directive 44 of November 7, 2016
(Enhancing Domestic Incident Response), and Federal Government response
and recovery frameworks and operational plans;  
   
          (iii)  coordinate their biodefense policies with other
agencies that have responsibilities or capabilities pertaining to
biodefense, as well as with appropriate non-Federal entities;  
   
          (iv)   share information and coordinate decision-making
related to the biodefense enterprise; and  
   
          (v)    monitor, evaluate, and hold their respective agencies
accountable for the implementation of section 3(a) of this memorandum.  
   
     (d)  Heads of agencies are not required to share information on
counterproliferation activities, military plans or operations,
intelligence activities, or specific law enforcement activities and
criminal investigations.  
   
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span

style="text-decoration: underline">Implementation</span>.  (a)  At least
once every 3 years, in alignment with the annual budget cycle, the APNSA
and the Assistant to the President and Homeland Security Advisor
(APHSA), in coordination with the heads of relevant agencies, shall
review and update, as necessary, biodefense priorities under the
Biodefense Strategy’s Implementation Plan.  These updates shall be
submitted to the President through the APNSA and, to the extent
permitted by and consistent with applicable law and policy, released to
the public.  
   
     (b)  Within 1 year of the date of this memorandum and annually
thereafter, the APNSA or the APHSA, in coordination with the Director of
the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Assistant to the
President for Domestic Policy, shall chair a Principals Committee Senior
Officials Exercise (SOE) on a biopreparedness health emergency in
coordination with the heads of relevant agencies.  The SOE shall include
a detailed summary of conclusions, which shall inform the review listed
in subsection (a) of this section.  The heads of relevant agencies
shall, on an annual basis, submit all related SOE After Action Reports
to the APNSA and the APHSA to inform the review listed in subsection (a)
of this section; the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency to inform the National Exercise Program; and the heads of
relevant agencies to inform biopreparedness.  
   
     (c)  Within 1 year of the date of this memorandum, and annually
thereafter in alignment with the annual budget cycle:    
   
          (i)    the heads of relevant agencies shall include in their
annual budget requests to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
information on those activities, programs, and projects that are
planned, programmed, or have been executed that advance or are expected
to advance the Biodefense Strategy and its Implementation Plan; ensure
that these new and existing activities are prioritized in their annual
budget requests; quantify resources allocated to biodefense within their
annual budget requests; make a determination on whether their budget
requests are sufficient to meet priorities established in the Biodefense
Strategy’s Implementation Plan; and meet annually with National Security
Council (NSC) staff to review their annual budget requests;  
   
          (ii)   as part of the annual budget process, the Director of
OMB, in consultation with the APNSA, shall conduct an analysis of
Federal biodefense and pandemic preparedness programs to assess whether
resources are sufficient to meet the objectives of the Biodefense
Strategy’s Implementation Plan; and  
   
          (iii)  the APNSA, through the process described in NSM-2 and
in coordination with the Director of OMB, shall convene relevant
agencies to ensure that interagency budgets for programs that contribute
directly to the implementation of this memorandum and additional
relevant resource requests are directed to meet the objectives of the
Biodefense Strategy’s Implementation Plan.  
   
     (d)  To facilitate effective implementation of the Biodefense
Strategy, within 90 days of the date of this memorandum and at least
quarterly thereafter, the NSC staff Directorate for Global Health
Security and Biodefense shall convene lead agencies identified in the
Biodefense Strategy’s Implementation Plan at the Assistant Secretary
level.  These agencies shall brief the NSC staff on progress towards key
milestones and timelines, as well as on critical gaps and barriers to
progress.  The NSC staff Directorate for Global Health Security and
Biodefense shall provide updates quarterly to the APNSA based off of
these briefs, summarizing progress towards the implementation of the
Biodefense Strategy by highlighting the extent to which the goals and
objectives are being met, outlining major gaps and impediments to timely
and effective implementation, and presenting options for overcoming
these gaps.  The APNSA shall provide to the President, on an annual
basis, a memorandum summarizing these updates.  
   
     (e)  Within 180 days of the date of this memorandum and annually
thereafter, or more frequently as warranted, the Director of National
Intelligence, in coordination with the Secretaries of Defense and
Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and the heads of relevant
agencies, shall provide to the APNSA and the heads of relevant agencies
a threat assessment on potential actors and threats, delivery systems,
and methods that could be directed against or affect the national
biodefense enterprise or that could negatively affect global health
security, prioritizing high consequence or potentially catastrophic
biological threats.  These threat assessments shall be used to inform
the review listed in subsection (a) of this section.  
  
     (f)  Within 1 year of the date of this memorandum, the APNSA shall,
in coordination with relevant agencies pursuant to Executive Order 13747
