title: "A Proclamation on Columbus Day,\_2022"
---
 
     In 1492, Christopher Columbus sailed from the Spanish port of Palos
de la Frontera on behalf of Queen Isabella I and King Ferdinand II, but
his roots trace back to Genoa, Italy.  The story of his journey remains
a source of pride for many Italian Americans whose families also crossed
the Atlantic.  His voyage inspired many others to follow and ultimately
contributed to the founding of America, which has been a beacon for
immigrants across the world.

     Many of these immigrants were Italian, and for generations, Italian
immigrants have harnessed the courage to leave so much behind, driven by
their faith in the American dream — to build a new life of hope and
possibility in the United States. Today, Italian Americans are leaders
in all fields, including government, health, business, innovation, and
culture.

     Things have not always been easy; prejudice and violence often
stalled the promise of equal opportunity.  In fact, Columbus Day was
created by President Harrison in 1892 in response to the anti-Italian
motivated lynching of 11 Italian Americans in New Orleans in 1891.
 During World War II, Italian Americans were even targeted as enemy
aliens.  But the hard work, dedication to community, and leadership of
Italian Americans in every industry make our country stronger, more
prosperous, and more vibrant.  The Italian American community is also a
cornerstone of our Nation’s close and enduring relationship with Italy —
a vital NATO Ally and European Union partner.  Today, the partnership
between Italy and the United States is at the heart of our efforts to
tackle the most pressing global challenges of our time, including
supporting Ukraine as it defends its freedom and democracy.

     In commemoration of Christopher Columbus’s historic voyage 530
years ago, the Congress, by joint resolution of April 30, 1934, and
modified in 1968 (36 U.S.C. 107), as amended, has requested the
President proclaim the second Monday of October of each year as
“Columbus Day.”

     NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United
States of America, do hereby proclaim October 10, 2022, as Columbus
Day.  I direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all
public buildings on the appointed day in honor of our diverse history
and all who have contributed to shaping this Nation.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
seventh day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two,
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred
and forty-seventh.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
