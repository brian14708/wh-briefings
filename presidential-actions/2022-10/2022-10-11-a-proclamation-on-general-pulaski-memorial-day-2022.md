title: "A Proclamation on General Pulaski Memorial Day,\_2022"

On September 11, 1777, Casimir Pulaski rode into battle with the
Continental Army, led a skillful counterattack to slow the British
advance, and helped save George Washington’s life.  Known as the “Father
of the American Cavalry,” he would rise to the rank of Brigadier
General, continue fighting for American independence in battles across
the colonies, and eventually make the ultimate sacrifice in pursuit of
revolutionary ideas:  freedom, equality, and democracy.  Today, we
commemorate General Pulaski’s heroism and service, honor generations of
immigrants who followed in his path, and celebrate our Nation’s rich
Polish-American heritage.

     Every day, the contributions of 9 million Polish-Americans help
make this country a beacon of hope and opportunity.  As small business
owners and elected representatives of the people, as educators and
doctors, as champions of civil rights and patriots serving in uniform at
home and abroad, Polish-Americans make communities across our Nation
more prosperous, vibrant, and humane.

     As we continue to champion liberty and justice around the world,
America draws great strength from the support of vital international
allies like Poland.  While Russia continues its unprovoked war in
Ukraine, Poland and the United States stand shoulder-to-shoulder in
defense of democracy and our collective security.  As we pay tribute to
General Pulaski and his legacy, may we always remember that the darkness
of autocracy is no match for the flame of liberty that lights the souls
of free people everywhere.

     NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United
States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the
Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October
11, 2022, as General Pulaski Memorial Day.  I encourage all Americans to
commemorate this occasion with appropriate programs and activities
paying tribute to General Casimir Pulaski and honoring all those who
defend the freedom of our great Nation.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
eleventh day of October, in the year of our Lord
two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States
of America the two hundred and forty-seventh.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
