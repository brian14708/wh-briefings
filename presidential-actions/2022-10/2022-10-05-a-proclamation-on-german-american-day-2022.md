title: "A Proclamation on German-American Day,\_2022"

    Since 1683, when thirteen families arrived in Philadelphia and
founded the first German settlement in North America, generations of
Germans have put their faith in the promises of this land and set down
roots in communities across this country.  On German-American Day, we
honor the German immigrants who added their dreams to the American
story, and we celebrate their descendants who continue to nurture and
enrich the soul of this Nation.

     From championing the anti-slavery movement to helping establish the
freedom of the press, from introducing the concept of kindergarten to
advocating for universal education, and from inspiring the music we love
to influencing the food we eat and beer we drink — German-Americans have
strengthened our Nation’s character and sustained our progress and
prosperity.  Today, they are leaders in every industry and every
community, spearheading innovation and making essential contributions
to our Nation’s success.

     On German-American Day, let us also reaffirm the United States’
vital alliance with Germany and our enduring bonds to its people.  As
the closest of friends, the most reliable of partners, and strong NATO
Allies, our countries work together around the world to advance our
shared commitment to democratic principles, human rights, and the
rules-based international order.  Together, we will continue to stand
against authoritarianism and advance freedom and opportunity for all
people.

     NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United
States of America, do hereby proclaim October 6, 2022,
as German-American Day.  I urge all Americans to celebrate the rich and
varied history of German-Americans and remember the many contributions
they have made to our Nation.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-seventh.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
