Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies  
   
SUBJECT:      Certifications Regarding Disclosure of  
              Information in Certain Records Related to the  
              Assassination of President John F. Kennedy

Section 1.  Policy.  In the three decades since the President John F.
Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 (44 U.S.C. 2107
note) (the “Act”) was enacted, the United States Government has
undertaken a comprehensive review of its records and has strived to make
available to the public thousands of classified documents that provide a
fuller understanding of the tragic assassination of President John F.
Kennedy.  As I have reiterated throughout my Presidency, I fully support
the Act’s aim to maximize transparency by disclosing all information in
records concerning the assassination, except when the strongest possible
reasons counsel otherwise.  Executive departments and agencies
(agencies) have worked meticulously over thousands of hours of review to
ensure that the American people have access to every single word that is
appropriate for release under the standards of the Act.  With my final
certification made in this memorandum -– the last required under the Act
-– and definitive plans for future disclosures, my Administration is
fulfilling the promise of transparency to the American people.  
   
Sec. 2.  Background.  (a)  The Act permits the continued postponement of
public disclosure of information in records concerning President
Kennedy’s assassination only when postponement remains necessary to
protect against an identifiable harm to the military defense,
intelligence operations, law enforcement, or the conduct of foreign
relations that is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest
in disclosure.  Agencies have applied this statutory standard when
proposing the continued postponement of public disclosure of specific
information, and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)
has reviewed each of these redactions to determine whether NARA agrees
that these redactions continue to meet the statutory standard.  In the
Presidential Memorandum of December 15, 2022 (Certifications Regarding
Disclosure of Information in Certain Records Related to the
Assassination of President John F. Kennedy) (December 2022 Memorandum),
I certified the temporary continued postponement of public disclosure of
redacted information in a small number of records covered by the Act. 
At the time, the Acting Archivist of the United States (Acting
Archivist) advised that a limited number of records that were the
subject of agency proposals for temporary continued postponement
warranted further review to ensure that information from these records
is disclosed to the maximum extent possible, consistent with the
standards of the Act.  In the December 2022 Memorandum, consistent with
that advice, I directed agencies to continue to work with NARA to review
these records to determine if additional information proposed for
redaction could be disclosed.  
   
(b)  On May 1, 2023, the Acting Archivist informed me that the review
process was complete and recommended that I postpone the public release
of certain redacted information in the records certified for temporary
postponement of public release in the December 2022 Memorandum.  
   
Sec. 3.  Certification.  In light of the recommendation for continued
postponement of public release of information in the records identified
in section 2(b) of this memorandum under the statutory standard, I
hereby certify, by the authority vested in me as President by the
Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including
section 5(g)(2)(D) of the Act, that continued postponement of public
disclosure of that information is necessary to protect against
identifiable harms to the military defense, intelligence operations, law
enforcement, and the conduct of foreign relations that are of such
gravity that they outweigh the public interest in disclosure.  All
information within these records that has been proposed for continued
postponement under section 5(g)(2)(D) of the Act shall accordingly be
withheld from public disclosure.  Future release of the information in
these records shall occur in a manner consistent with the Transparency
Plans described in section 5 of this memorandum.    
   
Sec. 4.  Release.  Any information currently withheld from public
disclosure under section 4 of the December 2022 Memorandum that is not
subject to the certification in section 3 of this memorandum shall be
released to the public by June 30, 2023.  
   
Sec. 5.  Transparency Plans.  As part of their review, each agency
prepared a plan for the eventual release of information (Transparency
Plan) to ensure that information would continue to be disclosed over
time as the identified harm associated with release of the information
dissipates.  Each Transparency Plan details the event-based or
circumstance-based conditions that will trigger the public disclosure of
currently postponed information by the National Declassification Center
(NDC) at NARA.  These Transparency Plans were reviewed by NARA, and the
Acting Archivist previously advised me that use of the Transparency
Plans by the NDC will ensure appropriate continued release of
information covered by the Act.  In the December 2022 Memorandum, I
directed that the Transparency Plans submitted by agencies be used by
the NDC to conduct future reviews of any information that has been
postponed from public disclosure.  On May 1, 2023, the Acting Archivist
recommended continued use of agencies’ Transparency Plans to release
information covered by the Act.  Therefore, I direct the NDC to continue
to use the Transparency Plans to conduct future reviews of any
information covered by the Act that has been postponed from public
disclosure.  The Transparency Plans will ensure that the public will
have access to the maximum amount of information while continuing to
protect against identifiable harms to the military defense, intelligence
operations, law enforcement, and the conduct of foreign relations under
the standards of the Act.  
   
Sec. 6.  Publication.  The Archivist of the United States is hereby
authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the *Federal
Register*.
