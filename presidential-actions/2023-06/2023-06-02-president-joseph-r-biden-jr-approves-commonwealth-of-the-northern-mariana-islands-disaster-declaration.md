Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and ordered
Federal aid to supplement commonwealth and local recovery efforts in the
areas affected by Typhoon Mawar beginning on May 22, 2023, and
continuing.

The President’s action makes Federal funding available to commonwealth
and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit
organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency protective measures,
including direct Federal assistance for the island of Rota.

Mr. Benigno B. Ruiz of FEMA has been appointed to coordinate Federal
recovery operations in the affected areas. 

Damage assessments are continuing, and additional areas and forms of
assistance may be designated after the assessments are fully completed.
