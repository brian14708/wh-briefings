title: "Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to\_Belarus"
---
 
     On June 16, 2006, by Executive Order 13405, the President declared
a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) to deal with the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the
United States constituted by the actions and policies of certain members
of the Government of Belarus and other persons to undermine Belarus’s
democratic processes or institutions, manifested in the fundamentally
undemocratic March 2006 elections; to commit human rights abuses related
to political repression, including detentions and disappearances; and to
engage in public corruption, including by diverting or misusing
Belarusian public assets or by misusing public authority. 

     On August 9, 2021, by Executive Order 14038, I expanded the scope
of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13405, finding
that the Belarusian regime’s harmful activities and long-standing abuses
aimed at suppressing democracy and the exercise of human rights and
fundamental freedoms in Belarus — including illicit and oppressive
activities stemming from the August 9, 2020, fraudulent Belarusian
presidential election and its aftermath, such as the elimination of
political opposition and civil society organizations and the regime’s
disruption and endangering of international civil air travel —
constituted an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security
and foreign policy of the United States.

     The actions and policies of certain members of the Government of
Belarus and other persons, and the Belarusian regime’s harmful
activities and long-standing abuses, continue to pose an unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the
United States.  For this reason, the national emergency declared in
Executive Order 13405, which was expanded in scope in Executive Order
14038, must continue in effect beyond June 16, 2023.  Therefore, in
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 13405.

     This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and
transmitted to the Congress.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
  June 12, 2023.
