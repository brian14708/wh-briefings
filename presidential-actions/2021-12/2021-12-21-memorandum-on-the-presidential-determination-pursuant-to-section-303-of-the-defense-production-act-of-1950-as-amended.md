Presidential Determination  
No.        2022-07 

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE  
  
SUBJECT:       Presidential Determination Pursuant to Section 303 of the
Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended  
  
  
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including section 303 of the
Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (the “Act”) (50 U.S.C. 4533),
I hereby determine, pursuant to section 303(a)(5) of the Act, that:  
  
(1)Large Scale Fabrication, Shipbuilding Industrial Base Expansion for
Resilience and Robustness, and Maritime Workforce Training Pipelines in
support of Virginia Class attack submarine production are industrial
resources, materials, or critical technology items essential to the
national defense;  
  
(2)without Presidential action under section 303 of the Act, United
States industry cannot reasonably be expected to provide the capability
for the needed industrial resource, material, or critical technology
item in a timely manner; and  
  
(3)purchases, purchase commitments, or other action pursuant to section
303 of the Act are the most cost-effective, expedient, and practical
alternative method for meeting the need.  
  
Pursuant to section 303(a)(7)(B) of the Act, I find that action to
expand the domestic production capability for these supply chains is
necessary to avert an industrial resource or critical technology item
shortfall that would severely impair national defense capability.
 Therefore, I waive the requirements of section 303(a)(l)-(a)(6) of the
Act for the purpose of expanding the domestic production capability for
these supply chains.  
  
Ensuring a robust, resilient, and competitive domestic defense
industrial base that has the capability, capacity, and workforce to meet
the Virginia Class submarine undersea warfighting mission is essential
to our national security.  
  
You are authorized and directed to publish this determination in the
*Federal Register*.  
  
  

  
                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
