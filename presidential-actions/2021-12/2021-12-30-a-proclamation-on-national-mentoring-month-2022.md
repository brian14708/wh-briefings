title: "A Proclamation on National Mentoring Month,\_2022"

I often say that America can be defined in one word — possibilities.  No
matter our background or circumstance, every child in America has the
right to go as far as their dreams will take them.  But those dreams are
rarely reached alone.  We all benefit from the support, wisdom, and
nurturing of mentors who navigated the path before us.

By standing on the shoulders of mentors, young people have led America
forward at each inflection point in our history.  I will never forget
the many mentors who encouraged and empowered me as a student, as a
local elected official in my twenties, and as a young United States
Senator finding my way.  During National Mentoring Month, we honor all
those parents and family members, teachers and coaches, employers and
co-workers, community and faith leaders, and so many others who devote
time, care, and energy to helping our young people thrive.

As we continue to build back from the pandemic, my Administration is
making unprecedented investments to set the next generation up for
success.  Earlier this year, the Department of Labor awarded $89 million
through its YouthBuild program and over $20 million through its
Workforce Pathways for Youth programs to dedicated mentors who share
their wisdom and experience and provide employment and counseling
services to young people.  We also proudly support initiatives across
our executive departments and agencies that provide tutoring, community
service opportunities, school-based and after-school programs, summer
learning and enrichment, and work-based learning opportunities.

As advocate and activist Marian Wright Edelman said, “It is the
responsibility of every adult — especially parents, educators, and
religious leaders — to make sure that children hear what we have learned
from the lessons of life and to hear over and over that we love them and
that they are not alone.”  Mentorship is vital to fulfilling this
responsibility, expanding opportunity, and helping our children fulfill
their God-given potential.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States
of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 2022 as
National Mentoring Month.  I call upon Americans across the country to
observe this month with mentoring, appropriate ceremonies, activities,
and programs.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-sixth.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
