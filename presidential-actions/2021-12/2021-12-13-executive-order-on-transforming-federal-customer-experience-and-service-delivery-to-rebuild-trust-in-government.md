title: "Executive Order on Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery\
  \ to Rebuild Trust in\_Government"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:

Section 1.  Purpose.  Our Government must recommit to being “of the
people, by the people, \[and\] for the people” in order to solve the
complex 21st century challenges our Nation faces.  Government must be
held accountable for designing and delivering services with a focus on
the actual experience of the people whom it is meant to serve. 
Government must also work to deliver services more equitably and
effectively, especially for those who have been historically
underserved.  Strengthening the democratic process requires providing
direct lines of feedback and mechanisms for engaging the American people
in the design and improvement of Federal Government programs, processes,
and services.

As the United States faces critical challenges, including recovering
from a global pandemic, promoting prosperity and economic growth,
advancing equity, and tackling the climate crisis, the needs of the
people of the United States, informed by, in particular, an
understanding of how they experience Government, should drive priorities
for service delivery improvements.  In recent years, the annual
paperwork burden imposed by executive departments and agencies
(agencies) on the public has been in excess of 9 billion hours.  That
number is too high.  Agencies must work with the Congress; the private
sector and nonprofit organizations; State, local, Tribal, and
territorial governments; and other partners to design experiences with
the Federal Government that effectively reduce administrative burdens,
simplify both public-facing and internal processes to improve
efficiency, and empower the Federal workforce to solve problems.

The Federal Government must design and deliver services in a manner that
people of all abilities can navigate.  We must use technology to
modernize Government and implement services that are simple to use,
accessible, equitable, protective, transparent, and responsive for all
people of the United States.  When a disaster survivor, single parent,
immigrant, small business owner, or veteran waits months for the
Government to process benefits to which they are entitled, that lost
time is a significant cost not only for that individual, but in the
aggregate, for our Nation as a whole.  This lost time operates as a kind
of tax — a “time tax” — and it imposes a serious burden on our people as
they interact with the Government.  Improving Government services should
also make our Government more efficient and effective overall.

Every interaction between the Federal Government and the public, whether
it involves renewing a passport or calling for a status update on a farm
loan application, should be seen as an opportunity for the Government to
save an individual’s time (and thus reduce “time taxes”) and to deliver
the level of service that the public expects and deserves.  By
demonstrating that its processes are effective and efficient, in
addition to being fair, protective of privacy interests, and
transparent, the Federal Government can build public trust.  Further,
the Federal Government’s management of its customer experience and
service delivery should be driven fundamentally by the voice of the
customer through human-centered design methodologies; empirical customer
research; an understanding of behavioral science and user testing,
especially for digital services; and other mechanisms of engagement.

Executive Order 12862 of September 11, 1993 (Setting Customer Service
Standards), required agencies that provide significant services directly
to the public to identify and gather feedback from customers; establish
service standards and measure performance against those standards; and
benchmark customer service performance against the best customer
experience provided in the private sector.  Executive Order 13571 of
April 27, 2011 (Streamlining Service Delivery and Improving Customer
Service), further required agencies to develop a “Customer Service Plan
. . . to address how the agency will provide services in a manner that
seeks to streamline service delivery and improve the experience of its
customers.”  Executive Order 13707 of September 15, 2015 (Using
Behavioral Science Insights To Better Serve the American People), called
for the use of empirical findings in behavioral science fields to
deliver better results for the American people, including by identifying
“opportunities to help qualifying individuals, families, communities,
and businesses access public programs and benefits.”  And Executive
Order 13985 of January 20, 2021 (Advancing Racial Equity and Support for
Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government), established the
policy of the Federal Government to “pursue a comprehensive approach to
advancing equity for all, including people of color and others who have
been historically underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by
persistent poverty and inequality.”  Consistent with these aims,
agencies have begun assessing whether, and to what extent, their
programs and policies perpetuate systemic barriers to opportunities and
benefits for people of color and other underserved groups.  These
previous actions have laid an important foundation for the policies and
procedures set forth in this order.  However, more is required to
establish the sustained system for Federal Government accountability and
performance necessary to drive an ongoing focus on improved delivery and
results for the people of the United States.

Sec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States that, in a
Government of the people, by the people, and for the people, improving
service delivery and customer experience should be fundamental
priorities.  The Government’s performance must be measured empirically
and by on-the-ground results for the people of the United States,
especially for their experiences with services delivered.  The means of
Government — such as its budget, policy, financial management,
procurement, and human resources practices — must work to achieve those
ends.  Agencies should continually improve their understanding of their
customers, reduce administrative hurdles and paperwork burdens to
minimize “time taxes,” enhance transparency, create greater efficiencies
across Government, and redesign compliance-oriented processes to improve
customer experience and more directly meet the needs of the people of
the United States.  Consistent with the purpose described in section 1
of this order, agencies’ efforts to improve customer experience should
include systematically identifying and resolving the root causes of
customer experience challenges, regardless of whether the source of such
challenges is statutory, regulatory, budgetary, technological, or
process-based.  Furthermore, to engender public trust, agencies must
ensure that their efforts appropriately maintain or enhance protections
afforded under law and policy, including those related to civil rights,
civil liberties, privacy, confidentiality, and information security.

Sec. 3.  Definitions.  For purposes of this order:   
      (a)  The term “customer” means any individual, business, or
organization (such as a grantee or State, local, or Tribal entity) that
interacts with an agency or program, either directly or through a
federally-funded program administered by a contractor, nonprofit, or
other Federal entity.  
      (b)  The term “customer experience” means the public’s perceptions
of and overall satisfaction with interactions with an agency, product,
or service.  
      (c)  The term “customer life experience” means each important
point in a person’s life at which that person interacts with one or more
entities of Government.  
      (d)  The term “equity” means the consistent and systematic fair,
just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals
who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such
treatment, such as Black, Latino, Indigenous and Native American
persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and other persons of
color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities;
persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely
affected by persistent poverty or inequality.  
      (e)  The term “High Impact Service Provider” (HISP) means a
Federal entity, as designated by the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB), that provides or funds customer-facing
services, including Federal services administered at the State or local
level, that have a high impact on the public, whether because of a large
customer base or a critical effect on those served.  
      (f)  The term “human-centered design” means an interdisciplinary
methodology of putting people, including those who will use or be
impacted by what one creates, at the center of any process to solve
challenging problems.  
      (g)  The term “service delivery” means actions by the Federal
Government related to providing a benefit or service to a customer of a
Federal Government entity.  Such actions pertain to all points of the
Government-to-customer delivery process, including when a customer
applies for a benefit or loan, receives a service such as health care or
small business counseling, requests a document such as a passport or
Social Security card, files taxes or declares goods, uses resources such
as a park or historical site, or seeks information such as notices about
public health or consumer protection.

coordination between benefit programs to ensure applicants and
beneficiaries in one program are automatically enrolled in other
programs for which they are eligible;  
            (iv)   to the maximum extent permitted by law, support
streamlining State enrollment and renewal processes and removing
barriers, including by eliminating face-to-face interview requirements

International Development (USAID) shall review and revise, as
appropriate, regulations, forms, instructions, or other sources of
guidance relating to the application for grants and cooperative
agreements in countries in which USAID works to ensure that such
policies are clear and intelligible, do not contain unjustified
administrative burdens or excessive paperwork requirements, and do not
place undue burdens on local organizations and underserved
communities.  
      (n)  Joint Agency Actions:  
            (i)    The Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the
Administrator of General Services shall collaborate to provide seamless
integration of Login.gov accounts to allow customers to access VA.gov,

            (iii)  The Director of OMB, including through the
Administrator of the United States Digital Service, shall collaborate
across the Federal Government with multiple agencies and their
respective customers in order to conduct human-centered design research
and document customer experience challenges related to accessing grant
programs to which Tribal governments are entitled, and shall propose
ways to streamline processes and reduce administrative burdens on Tribal
government customers.  
            (iv)   The Director of OMB, through the Administrator of the
United States Digital Service; the Administrator of General Services;
and the Postmaster General are encouraged to collaborate on ways to
update mailing address records across Government so that members of the
public may change their respective mailing addresses for purposes of all
Government services only once, through the United States Postal Service.

Sec. 5.  Government-wide Actions to Improve Customer Experience. 
Customers often navigate services across multiple agencies in specific
moments of need, such as when they are seeking financing for their
businesses or experiencing food insecurity.  In such situations,
relevant agencies should coordinate their service delivery to achieve an
integrated experience that meets customer needs through the exchange of
data with appropriate privacy protections.  
Such coordination may include providing States that administer elements
of Federal services with guidance and flexibilities with respect to the
elements of Federal programs they administer.  Such coordination would
allow both Federal and State government entities to maximize their
respective expertise and improve efficiency.  To further the policy set
forth in this section:  
      (a)  Within 90 days of the date of this order, and on a regular
basis thereafter, the Deputy Director for Management of OMB and other
members of the President’s Management Council (PMC) shall work with the
Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff, the Assistant to the
President for Domestic Policy, and the Assistant to the President for
Economic Policy to select a limited number of customer life experiences
to prioritize for Government-wide action to improve customer
experience.  
      (b)  The Deputy Director for Management of OMB and other members
of the PMC, in consultation with the Assistant to the President for
Domestic Policy, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and
relevant interagency teams coordinated by OMB, shall organize
appropriate leadership structures to assess customer life experiences
selected pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, work to develop
measurable improvements for such customer life experiences that involve
multiple agencies, develop prospective plans for rigorously testing that
use appropriate empirical methods on which approaches work best, and
share lessons learned across the Federal Government.  
      (c)  Within 180 days of the date of this order and every 6 months
thereafter, the Deputy Director for Management of OMB and other members
of the PMC, through the Deputy Director for Management of OMB, shall
report to the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff on the
status of the actions described in subsection (b) of this section.  
      (d)  The Director of OMB shall work with the head of each relevant
agency to help resolve issues related to overlapping responsibilities
among agencies, work to address barriers to serving customers across
multiple agencies, and coordinate activities to improve customer
experience or service delivery when primary responsibility among
multiple agencies is unclear.  
      (e)  Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Administrator
of the Office of Electronic Government and the Administrator of the
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within OMB, in consultation
with relevant interagency councils (including the Chief Information
Officers Council, the Federal Privacy Council, the Chief Data Officer
Council, the Evaluation Officer Council, and the Interagency Council on
Statistical Policy), shall coordinate their current, respective efforts
to develop guidance for agencies, ensuring that such guidance
incorporates opportunities to:  
            (i)   improve the efficiency and effectiveness of data
sharing and support processes among agencies and with State and local
governments; and  
            (ii)  streamline the process for agencies to provide
services to State and local governments, consistent with applicable
law.  
      (f)  Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Administrator
of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs shall provide
guidance for agencies on:  
            (i)   identifying specific steps to reduce information
collection burdens on customers to enhance access across agencies; and  
            (ii)  clarifying and updating recommendations and
flexibilities under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 *et
seq*.), including to facilitate stakeholder engagement and feedback
processes to support the implementation of this order.  
      (g)  Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Administrator
of General Services shall submit to the Director of OMB a roadmap for
the development of prioritized common services and standards (such as
the United States Web Design System or systems for login and identity
management), platforms (such as notification capabilities), and digital
products (such as USA.gov) that support increased efficiency,
integration, and improved service delivery of designated customer life
experiences.

Sec. 6.  Ongoing Accountability for Federal Service Delivery.  (a)  The
Director of OMB shall designate as HISPs those Federal entities that
provide or fund customer-facing services, including Federal services
administered at the State or local level, that have a high impact on the
public, whether because of a large customer base or a critical effect on
those served.  The Director of OMB shall maintain a list of designated
HISPS and may update this list at any time.  
      (b)  The Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the
Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary
of Commerce, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Health and Human
Services, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary
of Transportation, the Secretary of Education, the Secretary of Veterans
Affairs, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Administrator of the
Small Business Administration, the Commissioner of Social Security, the
Administrator of General Services, the Administrator of the United
States Agency for International Development, and the Director of the
Office of Personnel Management shall each submit to the Director of OMB
a report including an assessment of the improvements needed in each
agency’s customer experience management and service design capabilities
in light of this order, to be prioritized within each agency’s
respective available and budgeted resources.  
      (c)  The head of each HISP shall, in consultation with the Deputy
Director for Management of OMB, annually designate a limited number of
services for prioritized improvement (designated services). 
Identification of designated services should be based on the moments
that matter most to the individuals served, as illustrated through
human-centered design and other research, and on those services’
public-facing nature, the number of individuals served, the volume of
transactions, the total Federal dollars spent, the safety and protection
of lives, or the critical nature of the services provided in the lives
of the individuals they serve.  
      (d)  The Deputy Director for Management of OMB shall issue
guidance for HISPs that outlines an annual process for assessing their
capacity to manage customer experience, assessing their performance of
designated services through meaningful measures from the perspective of
the public and planning for the improvement of the customer experience.
 Assessments should include, as appropriate, the identification of
customer experience challenges experienced by customers of the HISP in
the form of administrative burdens or other barriers, informed by
experiential data (including, as appropriate, through randomized
controlled trials or other rigorous program evaluation); ethnographic
research; feedback from public engagement; human-centered design
methodologies such as journey mapping; operational and administrative
data analysis; direct observations; examination, from a customer
perspective, of how to navigate the agency’s service offerings, apply
for a benefit, or comply with a requirement of the agency; observations
of customer interaction with the agency’s website or application
processes and tools; or observations of customer support service
delivery such as activities at call centers.  Informed by findings from
these assessments, plans for improvement should include, as appropriate,
actions such as conducting outreach to the public about the agency’s
programs and other Federal programs for which those served by the agency
may be eligible, providing assistance to members of the public enrolling
in the agency’s programs and other Federal programs, streamlining and
improving accessibility of forms and digital experiences, eliminating
unnecessary administrative burdens on customers, ensuring the
accessibility of services for customers with disabilities and those with
limited English proficiency, developing targeted actions to advance
equity for communities that face inequitable barriers to service access,
or engaging in other efforts to coordinate with other agencies to reduce
the need for those they serve to interact separately with multiple
agencies.  
      (e)  The Director of OMB shall establish a team within OMB to lead
and support agency customer experience initiatives as well as such
initiatives that reach across agencies, including by facilitating the
decision-making processes needed to achieve the objectives of this
order; coordinating HISP activities as outlined in this order; and
developing strategies for the integration of services and development of
products involving multiple agencies as contemplated in this order.  
      (f)  All agencies, whether identified in this section or not, are
urged to apply guidance issued pursuant to subsection (d) of this
section to improve their service delivery.

Sec. 7.  Additional Agency Actions to Improve Customer Experience.  The
heads of agencies shall:   
      (a)  integrate activities to improve customer experience, as
appropriate and consistent with applicable law, into their respective:  
            (i)    agency strategic plans developed pursuant to section
306(a) of title 5, United States Code;  
            (ii)   Agency Performance Plans developed pursuant to
sections 1115 and 1116 of title 31, United States Code;

consistent with section 4312 of title 5, United States Code, and for
other senior employees consistent with section 4302 of title 5, United
States Code; and  
            (vii)  as permitted by law, any other agency activities,
acquisitions, and strategies that the Director of OMB determines to be
appropriate to further the implementation of the policy articulated in
this order;  
      (b)  direct all of their respective program offices to apply the
guidance from OMB’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs
described in section 5(f) of this order, as well as the requirements of
the Paperwork Reduction Act related to collections of information,
consistently with guidance contained in the Office of Information and
Regulatory Affairs Memorandum of July 22, 2016 (Flexibilities under the
Paperwork Reduction Act for Compliance with Information Collection
Requirements), which provides that the Paperwork Reduction Act does not
apply to agencies’ general solicitations of public views and feedback,
certain ratings and rankings of Federal services by members of the
public using Government websites, or direct observations of users
interacting with digital tools and products;  
      (c)  direct all of their respective program offices to identify
opportunities to apply policies, including those set forth in
subsections 1(a) and (b) of Executive Order 13707, and to engage in
promising practices such as the advance testing of information
collections described in the Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs Memorandum of August 9, 2012 (Testing and Simplifying Federal
Forms);  
      (d)  identify opportunities, as appropriate and consistent with
applicable law, to modify their respective agencies’ regulations,
internal and public-facing guidance, and policies to include positive
and equitable customer experiences and service delivery as part of their
respective agencies’ missions; issue internal directives or policies on
customer experience and service delivery to articulate how their
respective agencies’ strategies and missions relate to customer
experience and service delivery outcomes; and promote coordination
within and among their respective agencies concerning those customer
life experiences that cut across agency or agency component
responsibilities;  
      (e)  improve the digital customer experience for their respective
agencies’ customers by modernizing agency websites, using human-centered
design methodologies, digitizing agency services and forms, modernizing
records management, updating network infrastructure and mobility
capabilities, and accelerating the use of electronic signatures when
aligned with policy priorities, as required by the 21st Century
Integrated Digital Experience Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 note); and  
      (f)  identify means by which their respective agencies can improve
transparency and accessibility through their compliance with the Plain
Writing Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-274) and related requirements and
guidance.

Sec. 8.  OMB Guidance.  The Director of OMB shall review and update OMB
Government-wide guidance and supporting processes (such as information
collection reviews or data sharing approvals) as necessary and
applicable, to ensure conformity with this order and to assist agencies
in improving their service delivery and customer experience.

Sec. 9.  Independent Agencies.  Independent agencies are strongly
encouraged to comply with the provisions of this order.
