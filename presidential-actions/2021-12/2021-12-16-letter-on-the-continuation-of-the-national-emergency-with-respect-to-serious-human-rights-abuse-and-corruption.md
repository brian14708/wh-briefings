title: Letter on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to Serious
  Human Rights Abuse and Corruption
---
 
Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)  
  
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13818
of December 20, 2017, is to continue in effect beyond December 20,
2021.  
  
The prevalence and severity of human rights abuse and corruption that
have their source, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United
States, continue to threaten the stability of international political
and economic systems.  Human rights abuse and corruption undermine the
values that form an essential foundation of stable, secure, and
functioning societies; have devastating impacts on individuals; weaken
democratic institutions; degrade the rule of law; perpetuate violent
conflicts; facilitate the activities of dangerous persons; undermine
economic markets; and continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary
threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the
United States.  Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to
continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13818 with
respect to serious human rights abuse and corruption.  
                               

Sincerely,   
                                JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
