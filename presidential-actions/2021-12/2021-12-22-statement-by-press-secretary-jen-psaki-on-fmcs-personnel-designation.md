Today, President Biden designated Gregory Goldstein as Acting Director
of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) and we call on
the Senate to quickly confirm Javier Ramirez to serve as the permanent
FMCS Director.  
   
Goldstein is a career member of the Senior Executive Service and has
served as the Chief Operating Officer for FMCS since 2018. Ramirez began
his FMCS career as a Commissioner in 2005 and is currently the Executive
Manager of the Division of Agency Initiatives. He has mediated disputes
in almost all sectors of the American economy, including multi-party
disputes in manufacturing, construction, and education.   
   
Because of the President’s American Rescue Plan and Build Back Better
agenda, our economy has recovered more rapidly than predicted from the
COVID-19 pandemic downturn. With tighter labor markets and more money in
their pockets, workers have greater power to demand their fair share
from employers in collective bargaining with unions across the country.
These conditions have put a spotlight on the important role of the
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service in facilitating productive
collective bargaining relationships and labor-management partnerships.  
   
The President’s designation of Gregory Goldstein, and his urging of the
Senate to confirm Javier Ramirez, should help the FMCS play an even more
proactive role in helping unions and employers successfully negotiate
collective bargaining agreements, including where there are strikes or
lockouts currently underway.
