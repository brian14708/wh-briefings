---
 
By the authority vested in me as President of the United States by the
Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order
to extend the display of the flag at half-staff as a mark of respect for
Robert Joseph Dole, it is hereby ordered that Proclamation 10320 of
December 5, 2021, is amended by deleting in the first sentence the words
“until sunset on December 9, 2021” and inserting in their place the
words “through Saturday, December 11.”

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-sixth.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
