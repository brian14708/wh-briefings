As a mark of respect for Robert Joseph Dole, a statesman like few in our
history and a war hero among the greatest of the Greatest Generation, I
hereby order, by the authority vested in me as President of the United
States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the
White House and upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military
posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal
Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States
and its Territories and possessions until sunset on December 9, 2021.  I
also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same
length of time at all United States embassies, legations, consular
offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities
and naval vessels and stations.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-sixth.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
