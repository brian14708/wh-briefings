  \ Organized\_Crime"

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, I hereby order as follows:  
  
Section 1.  Purpose.  Transnational organized crime (TOC) poses a direct
and escalating threat to public health, public safety, and national
security.  Transnational criminal organizations engage in a broad range
of criminal activities, including drug and weapons trafficking, migrant
smuggling, human trafficking, cybercrime, intellectual property theft,
money laundering, wildlife and timber trafficking, illegal fishing, and
illegal mining.  
  
These networks continue to expand in size and influence in the United
States and abroad.  Transnational criminal organizations contribute
directly to tens of thousands of drug-overdose deaths in the United
States each year and adversely affect American communities and economic
prosperity.  They also threaten United States national security by
degrading the security and stability of allied and partner nations,
undermining the rule of law, fostering corruption, acting as proxies for
hostile state activities, directly or indirectly funding insurgent and
terrorist groups, depleting natural resources, harming human health and
the environment, contributing to climate change through illegal
deforestation and logging, and exploiting and endangering vulnerable
populations.  In some regions, transnational criminal organizations
wield state-like capabilities, disregarding sovereign borders,
compromising the integrity of democratic institutions and threatening
the legitimacy of fragile governments, and securing their power through
intimidation, corruption, and violence.  For these reasons, it is in the
national interest of the United States to counter TOC.  Addressing TOC
requires a coordinated Federal framework accompanied by a cohesive
whole-of-government effort executed in collaboration with State, local,
Tribal, territorial, and civil society partners in the United States and
in close coordination with foreign partners, international and regional
organizations, and international and local civil society groups
abroad.  
  
Sec 2.  Policy.  Executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall
take actions within their respective authorities, including, as
appropriate, through the provision of technical and financial
assistance, to enhance efforts to counter TOC.  It is the policy of the
United States to:  
     (a)  employ authorized intelligence and operational capabilities in
an integrated manner to target, disrupt, and degrade transnational
criminal organizations that pose the greatest threat to national
security;  
      (b)  collaborate with private entities and international,
multilateral, and bilateral organizations to combat TOC, while also
strengthening cooperation with and advancing efforts to build capacity
in partner nations to reduce transnational criminal activity;  
      (c)  improve information sharing between law enforcement entities
and the Intelligence Community to enhance strategic analysis of, and
efforts to combat, transnational criminal organizations and their
activities, while also preserving our ability to speedily bring TOC
actors to justice;  
      (d)  expand tools and capabilities to combat illicit finance,
which underpins all TOC activities; and  
      (e)  develop and deploy new technologies to identify and disrupt
existing and newly emerging TOC threats.  
  
Sec. 3.  Establishments.  (a)  There shall be established a United
States Council on Transnational Organized Crime (USCTOC), which shall
report to the President through the Assistant to the President for
National Security Affairs.  The USCTOC shall monitor the production and
implementation of coordinated strategic plans for whole-of-government
counter-TOC efforts in support of and in alignment with policy
priorities established by the President through the National Security
Council.  
          (i)    The USCTOC shall replace the Threat Mitigation Working
Group, previously directed to lead whole-of-government efforts on TOC
under Executive Order 13773 of February 9, 2017 (Enforcing Federal Law
With Respect to Transnational Criminal Organizations and Preventing
International Trafficking).  Accordingly, section 3 of Executive Order
13773 is hereby revoked.  
          (ii)   The USCTOC shall consist of the following members or
their designees:  
               (A)  the Secretary of State;  
               (B)  the Secretary of the Treasury;  
               (C)  the Secretary of Defense;  
               (D)  the Attorney General;  
               (E)  the Secretary of Homeland Security; and  
               (F)  the Director of National Intelligence.  
          (iii)  The USCTOC may request other agencies to contribute to
the USCTOC’s efforts as necessary, including by detail or assignment of
personnel consistent with subsection (b)(v) of this section.  
          (iv)   The USCTOC shall meet not later than 60 days from the
date of this order and periodically thereafter.  
     (b)  There shall be established a USCTOC Strategic Division
(Division), an interagency working group housed at the Department of
Justice, comprising personnel from agencies designated in subsection
(a)(ii) of this section.  
          (i)    The Division shall produce coordinated strategic plans
for whole-of-government counter-TOC efforts in support of and in
alignment with policy priorities established by the President through
the National Security Council.  These strategic plans shall be informed
by intelligence assessments, be developed in coordination with agencies,
and include recommendations for actions by agencies.  The Division shall
submit its completed strategic plans to the USCTOC.  
          (ii)   The Division shall be chaired by a senior official from
the Department of Justice or the Department of Homeland Security.  The
Chairperson shall serve a 2 year term.  The Attorney General and the
Secretary of Homeland Security, or their designees, shall alternate
every 2 years selecting the Chairperson.  
          (iii)  The Division shall be established for administrative
purposes within the Department of Justice, and the Department of Justice
shall, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of
appropriations, provide administrative support and funding for the
Division.  
          (iv)   Agencies designated in subsection (a)(ii) of this
section are hereby directed, consistent with their authorities, budget
priorities, and mission constraints, and to the extent permitted by law
and consistent with the need to protect intelligence and law enforcement
sources, methods, operations, and investigations, to provide to the
Division:

                  (A)  details or assignments of personnel, who shall be
qualified subject-matter experts and strategic planners, and who shall
serve on full-time assignments of not less than 1 year;  
                  (B)  relevant information, research, intelligence, and
analysis; and  
                  (C)  such other resources and assistance as the
Division may request for the purpose of carrying out the
responsibilities outlined in this section.  
            (v)    To the extent permitted by law, agencies designated
in subsection (a)(ii) of this section are encouraged to detail or assign
their employees to the Division on a non-reimbursable basis.  
            (vi)   The Division, within 120 days of the date of this
order, shall submit to the USCTOC a report describing a process that the
USCTOC can implement on an ongoing basis and as necessary to identify
and prioritize the most significant TOC threats in alignment with policy
priorities established by the President through the National Security
Council.  
  
Sec. 4.  Report.  The Director of National Intelligence, within 120 days
of the date of this order and annually thereafter, shall submit a report
to the President through the Assistant to the President for National
Security Affairs assessing the Intelligence Community’s posture with
respect to TOC-related collection efforts, including recommendations on
resource allocation and prioritization.  
  
Sec. 5.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this order:   
      (a)  the term “Intelligence Community” has the meaning ascribed to
it under 50 U.S.C. 3003(4); and  
      (b)  the term “transnational criminal organizations” refers to
groups, networks, and associated individuals who operate transnationally
for the purpose of obtaining power, influence, or monetary or commercial
gain, wholly or in part by illegal means, while advancing their
activities through a pattern of crime, corruption, or violence, and
while protecting their illegal activities through a transnational
organizational structure and the exploitation of public corruption or
transnational logistics, financial, or communication mechanisms.  
  
Sec. 6.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be
construed to impair or otherwise affect:  
            (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive
department or agency, or the head thereof; or  
            (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.  
      (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable
law and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
      (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
