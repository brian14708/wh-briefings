title: "A Proclamation on the Death of Harry\_Reid"
---
 
From humble roots in Searchlight, Nevada, Harry Reid rose to become one
of the great Senate Majority Leaders in American history.  He was a man
of action, and a man of his word — guided by faith, loyalty, and
unshakeable resolve.

Throughout his long career of public service, Harry Reid was
instrumental in passing landmark legislation that made a positive
difference in the lives of countless Americans and made our Nation
stronger and safer.  His devoted service to our Nation was not about
power for power’s sake.  It was about the power to do right by the
American people.

As a mark of respect for his memory, I hereby order, by the authority
vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of
America, that on the day of his interment, the flag of the United States
shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and upon all public
buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on
all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia
and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions
until sunset on such day.  I also direct that the flag shall be flown
at half-staff for the same period at all United States embassies,
legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all
military facilities and naval vessels and stations.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-sixth.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
