title: Joint Statement on Meeting of the U.S.-Israel Strategic Consultative Group
---
 
U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Israeli National
Security Advisor Dr. Eyal Hulata led a December 22 meeting in Jerusalem
of the U.S.-Israel Strategic Consultative Group.  The U.S. and Israeli
delegations included senior officials from across their respective
foreign policy, defense, and intelligence agencies. 

The officials discussed the exceptional level of engagement and
consultation between the U.S. and Israeli governments this past year on
issues of vital strategic importance to the region.  Mr. Sullivan
reaffirmed the United States’ unwavering commitment to Israel’s security
and self-defense and underscored the importance of continuing to expand
bilateral cooperation on the challenges and opportunities in the Middle
East, including expanding and strengthening the Abraham Accords.  

The delegations discussed the need to confront all aspects of the threat
posed by Iran, including its nuclear program, destabilizing activities
in the region, and support for terrorist proxy groups.  They agreed that
Iran’s rapidly advancing nuclear program poses a grave threat to
the region and to international peace and security.  Mr. Sullivan
updated the Israeli delegation on recent developments in the Vienna
talks and the two sides exchanged views on the way forward. The
officials affirmed that the United States and Israel are aligned in
their determination to ensure that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon. 
Mr. Sullivan and Dr. Hulata agreed that they will continue to deepen
their close dialogue on all matters of regional security in the new
year.
