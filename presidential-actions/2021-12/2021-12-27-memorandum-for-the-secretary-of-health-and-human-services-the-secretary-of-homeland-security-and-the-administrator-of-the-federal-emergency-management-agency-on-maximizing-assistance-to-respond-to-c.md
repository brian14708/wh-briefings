style="text-decoration: underline">Policy.</span>  It is the policy of
my Administration to combat and respond to the coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic with the full capacity and capability of the Federal
Government to protect and support our families, schools, and businesses,
and to assist State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments to do
the same.  This policy includes the use of emergency and disaster

provide testing sites, launched and operated by HHS in close
coordination with State, local, Tribal, and territorial public health
departments.  
     (b)  FEMA’s mission assignments will require HHS to adjudicate
State, Tribal, and territorial requests through the Emergency Support
Function \#8 Advisory Council.  
     (c)  FEMA shall fund 100 percent of the cost of activities
associated with the mission assignments to HHS to provide COVID‑19

authorized by sections 403 (42 U.S.C. 5170b), 502 (42 U.S.C. 5192), and
503 (42 U.S.C. 5193) of the Stafford Act.
