title: "Executive Order on Imposing Sanctions on Foreign Persons Involved in the Global\
  \ Illicit Drug\_Trade"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) (IEEPA), the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq.*) (NEA), the Fentanyl
Sanctions Act (21 U.S.C. 2301 *et seq*.) (FSA), sections 212(f) and
215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)
and 1185(a)), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,

I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, find
that the trafficking into the United States of illicit drugs, including
fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, is causing the deaths of tens of
thousands of Americans annually, as well as countless more non-fatal
overdoses with their own tragic human toll.  Drug cartels, transnational
criminal organizations, and their facilitators are the primary sources
of illicit drugs and precursor chemicals that fuel the current opioid
epidemic, as well as drug-related violence that harms our communities. 
I find that international drug trafficking — including the illicit
production, global sale, and widespread distribution of illegal
drugs; the rise of extremely potent drugs such as fentanyl and other
synthetic opioids; as well as the growing role of Internet-based drug
sales — constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national
security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.  This
serious threat requires our country to modernize and update our response
to drug trafficking.  I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with
that threat. Accordingly, I hereby order:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">1.</span>  (a)  The Secretary of the
Treasury is authorized to impose any of the sanctions described in

          (i)  to have engaged in, or attempted to engage in, activities
or transactions that have materially contributed to, or pose a
significant risk of materially contributing to, the international

          (ii)  to have knowingly received any property or interest in
property that the foreign person knows:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span

sanctioned person that are in the United States, that hereafter come
within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the
possession or control of any United States person, and provide that such
property and interests in property may not be transferred, paid,
exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in;  
          (ii)   prohibit any transfers of credit or payments between

to the extent that such transfers or payments are subject to the

of the sanctioned person, or on persons performing similar functions and
with similar authorities as such officer or officers, any of the
sanctions described in subsections (a)(i)-(v) of this section that are
applicable.  
     (b)  The heads of the relevant executive departments and agencies,
in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, shall take the
following actions as necessary and appropriate to implement the
sanctions selected by the Secretary of the Treasury:  
          (i)    with respect to a sanctioned person that is a financial
institution:  
               (A)  the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall not designate, and shall
rescind any prior designation of, the sanctioned person as a primary
dealer in United States Government debt instruments; and  
               (B)  the sanctioned person shall not serve as an agent of
the United States Government or serve as a repository for United States
Government funds;  
          (ii)   actions required to ensure that executive departments
and agencies shall not procure, or enter into a contract for the
procurement of, any goods or services from the sanctioned person;  
          (iii)  actions required to suspend entry into the United
States of any noncitizen whom the Secretary of the Treasury, in
consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the
Secretary of Homeland Security, determines is a leader, official, senior
executive officer, or director of, or a shareholder with a controlling
interest in, the sanctioned person; or  
          (iv)   actions required to impose on the principal executive
officer or officers of the sanctioned person, or on persons performing
similar functions and with similar authorities as such officer or

this section that are applicable.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">3.</span>  The prohibitions in
section 2 of this order apply except to the extent provided by statutes,
or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued
pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or
any license or permit granted prior to the date of this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">4.</span>  (a)  The unrestricted
immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of noncitizens
determined to meet any of the criteria in section l(a)-(c) of this
order, and for whom the sanctions described in section 2(a)(i) or
2(b)(iii) of this order have been selected, would be detrimental to the
interests of the United States, and the entry of such persons into the
United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, is hereby suspended,
except when the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland
Security, as appropriate, determines that the person’s entry would not
be contrary to the interests of the United States, including when the
Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security, as
appropriate, so determines, based on a recommendation of the Attorney
General, that the person’s entry would further important United States
law enforcement objectives.  
     (b)  The Secretary of State shall implement this order as it
applies to visas pursuant to such procedures as the Secretary of State,
in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, may
establish.  
     (c)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall implement this order
as it applies to the entry of noncitizens pursuant to such procedures as
the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary
of State, may establish.  
     (d)  Such persons shall be treated by this section in the same
manner as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24,
2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security
Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act
Sanctions).

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">5.</span>  The prohibitions in
section 2(a)(i) of this order include:  
     (a)  the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods,
or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and
interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and  
     (b)  the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods,
or services from any such person.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">6.</span>  (a)  Any transaction that
evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a
violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth
in this order is prohibited.  
     (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set
forth in this order is prohibited.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">7.</span>  I hereby determine that
the making of donations of the types of articles specified in section
203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of
any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant
to this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the
national emergency declared in this order, and I hereby prohibit such
donations as provided by section 2(a) of this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">8.</span>  For the purpose of this
order:   
     (a)  the term “entity” means a partnership, association, trust,
joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;  
     (b)  the term “financial institution” includes a depository
institution (as defined in section 3(c)(l) of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(c)(l))), including a branch or agency of a
foreign bank (as defined in section 1(b)(7) of the International Banking
Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 3101(7))); a credit union; a securities firm,
including a broker or dealer; an insurance company, including an agency
or underwriter; and any other company that provides financial
services;  
     (c)  the term “foreign person” means any citizen or national of a
foreign state (including any such individual who is also a citizen or
national of the United States, provided such individual does not reside
in the United States) or any entity not organized under the laws of the
United States;  
     (d)  the term “knowingly” or “knows” with respect to conduct, a
circumstance, or a result, means that a person has actual knowledge, or
should have known, of the conduct, the circumstance, or the result;  
     (e)  the phrase “means of production” includes any activities or
transactions involving any equipment, chemical, product, or material
that may be used, directly or indirectly, in the manufacture of illicit
drugs or precursor chemicals;  
     (f)  the term “noncitizen” means any person who is not a citizen or
noncitizen national of the United States;  
     (g)  the term “person” means an individual or entity;  
     (h)  the term “proliferation of illicit drugs” means any illicit
activity to produce, manufacture, distribute, sell, or knowingly finance
or transport:  narcotic drugs, controlled substances, listed chemicals,
or controlled substance analogues, as defined in section 102 of the
Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802);  
     (i)  the term “sanctioned person” means any person sanctioned
pursuant to this order;  
     (j)  the term “United States financial institution” means a
financial institution (including its foreign branches) organized under
the laws of the United States or of any jurisdiction within the
United States or located in the United States; and  
     (k)  the term “United States person” means any United States
citizen, lawful permanent resident, entity organized under the laws of
the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">9.</span>  For those persons whose
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order
who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find
that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets
instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken
pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual.  I
therefore determine that for those measures to be effective in
addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be
no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to this
order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">10.</span>  The Secretary of the
Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney
General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, is authorized to take
such actions, including promulgating rules and regulations, and to
employ all powers granted to the President by the FSA or IEEPA as may be
necessary to implement this order.  The Secretary of the Treasury may,
consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within
the Department of the Treasury.  All executive departments and agencies
shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement
the provisions of this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">11.</span>  The Secretary of the
Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby
authorized to submit recurring and final reports to the Congress on the
national emergency declared in this order, consistent with section
401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA
(50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">12.</span>  (a)  Nothing in this
order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:  
          (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department
or agency, or the head thereof; or  
          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office
of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.  
     (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
