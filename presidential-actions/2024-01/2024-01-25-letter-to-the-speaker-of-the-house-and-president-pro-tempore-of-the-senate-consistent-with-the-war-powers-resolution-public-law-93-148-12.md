Dear Mr. Speaker:   (Dear Madam President:)  
   
As I have reported previously, militia groups affiliated with Iran’s
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) have perpetrated a series of
attacks against United States personnel and facilities in Iraq and
Syria.  These attacks, including the recent attack on Al-Asad Air Base
by Iran-affiliated militia groups, have caused injuries to United States
personnel and Coalition forces operating alongside United States forces
and have placed their lives under grave threat.  
   
Previously, in response to these attacks and the threat of future
attacks, at my direction, United States forces have conducted targeted
strikes against facilities in Iraq and Syria used by the IRGC and
IRGC-affiliated groups.  
   
On the night of January 23, 2024, at my direction, United States forces
conducted discrete strikes against facilities in Iraq used by
IRGC-affiliated militia groups for training, logistics support, and
other purposes.  The strikes were taken to degrade militias’
capabilities and deter future attacks and were conducted in a manner
designed to limit the risk of escalation and avoid civilian casualties.
 I directed the strikes in order to protect and defend our personnel and
assets who are in Iraq conducting military operations pursuant to the
2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40).  The
strikes were intended to degrade and disrupt Iran and Iran‑affiliated
militia groups from conducting or supporting further attacks on United
States personnel and facilities.  
   
I directed this military action consistent with my responsibility to
protect United States citizens both at home and abroad and in
furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy
interests, pursuant to my constitutional authority as Commander in Chief
and Chief Executive and to conduct United States foreign relations and
in accordance with the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force
(Public Law 107-40) and the Authorization for Use of Military Force
Against Iraq (Public Law 107-243).  The United States took this
necessary and proportionate action consistent with international law and
in the exercise of the United States’ inherent right of self-defense as
reflected in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.  The United
States stands ready to take further action, as necessary and
appropriate, to address further threats or attacks.  
   
I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress
fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law
93-148).  I appreciate the support of the Congress in this action.  
 

  
                                      Sincerely,  
   
   
                                      JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
