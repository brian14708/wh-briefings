Dear Mr. Speaker:   (Dear Madam President:)  
   
I am providing this report regarding recent military action as part of
my efforts to keep the Congress fully informed, consistent with the War
Powers Resolution (Public Law 93-148).  
   
I directed this military action consistent with my responsibility to
protect United States citizens both at home and abroad and in
furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy
interests, pursuant to my constitutional authority as Commander in Chief
and Chief Executive, and to conduct United States foreign relations and
in accordance with the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force
(Public Law 107-40) and the Authorization for Use of Military Force
Against Iraq (Public Law 107-243).  The United States took this
necessary and proportionate action consistent with international law and
in the exercise of the United States’ inherent right of self-defense as
reflected in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.  The United
States stands ready to take further action, as necessary and
appropriate, to address further threats or attacks.  
   
Additional information is available in the attached classified annex. 
I appreciate the support of the Congress in this action.  
   
                                    Sincerely,  
   
   
                                    JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
