title: "Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to the Situation\
  \ in and in Relation to\_Burma"
---
 
On February 10, 2021, by Executive Order 14014, I declared a national
emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act
(50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat
to the national security and foreign policy of the United States
constituted by the situation in and in relation to Burma.

The situation in and in relation to Burma, and in particular the
February 1, 2021 coup, in which the military overthrew the
democratically elected civilian government of Burma and unjustly
arrested and detained government leaders, politicians, human rights
defenders, journalists, and religious leaders, thereby rejecting the
will of the people of Burma as expressed in elections held in November
2020 and undermining the country’s democratic transition and rule of
law, continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the
national security and foreign policy of the United States.  For this
reason, the national emergency declared on February 10, 2021, must
continue in effect beyond February 10, 2023.  Therefore, in accordance
with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)),
I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive
Order 14014 with respect to the situation in and in relation to Burma.

This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and transmitted
to the Congress.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
    February 6, 2023.
