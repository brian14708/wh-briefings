Last night, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major
disaster exists in the State of North Dakota and ordered Federal
assistance to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in
the areas affected by a severe winter storm, snowstorm, and
straight-line winds from November 9 to November 11, 2022.

Federal funding is available to state, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the severe winter storm, snowstorm, and
straight-line winds in the counties of Dickey, Kidder, Mercer, Nelson,
Ransom, Sargent, and Wells.

In addition, Federal funding is available to the State, tribal, and
eligible local governments on a cost-sharing basis for snow assistance
for a continuous 48-hour period during or proximate to the incident
period in the counties of Kidder, Mercer, Nelson, and Wells.

Lastly, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Kenneth G. Clark as the
Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas. 

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
