SUBJECT:       United States Conventional Arms Transfer Policy

**Section 1.  Purpose.**  The United States Conventional Arms Transfer
(CAT) Policy establishes the executive branch’s priorities and rationale
for adjudicating the export of conventional arms.  The transfer of
defense articles and services is an important tool for achieving United
States foreign policy and national security objectives by helping allies
and partners increase their contributions to global security, as well as
by promoting shared interests with allies and partners.  Acquisitions of
United States defense articles and services by trusted allies and
partners reinforce diplomatic relations and deepen military
interoperability, in turn shaping the international security environment
in a manner that furthers United States foreign policy and national
security interests.  
  
The United States is stronger and safer when it works in concert with
allies and partners, and arms transfers are an important mechanism to
strengthen partner contributions to global security and reinforce these
security relationships.  Mutually beneficial alliances and partnerships
are an enduring strength of the United States, and are critical to
achieving our objectives.  As the United States faces complex
international challenges, this policy will facilitate the United States’
ability to work with its allies and partners to secure and promote
United States interests, including protecting human rights, bolstering
international security and stability, maintaining technological
advantages, strengthening interoperability, and preventing proliferation
and arms diversion.  The transfer of United States defense articles and
services is a tangible symbol of United States commitment and
partnership to recipient countries, their neighbors, and United States
competitors.  
  
The United States CAT Policy will bolster the security of allies and
partners and contribute to shared security objectives; enhance global
deterrence; promote respect for international humanitarian law and human
rights; adhere to international nonproliferation norms; strengthen
partnerships that preserve and extend our global influence; spur
research and development efforts; and enhance interoperability with our
allies and partners.  By aligning United States conventional arms
transfer policy with United States foreign policy and national security
objectives, the United States can continue to be the primary security
cooperation partner of choice for its allies and partners, as well as a
global leader in advancing the protection of human rights, supporting
nonproliferation, and strengthening stability.  
  
The United States will promote norms and controls for the responsible
international transfer of conventional arms and exercise restraint in
transfers of weapons systems that may be destabilizing or dangerous to
international peace and security.  The United States will consider arms
transfers on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the diversity of
United States foreign policy and national security interests.  In cases
where the United States denies arms transfers for any of the reasons
described in the considerations of this policy, it will encourage other
arms exporting countries to exercise commensurate restraint when facing
similar decisions.  To this end, the United States aims to serve as a
model for other countries’ national policies and practices related to
the responsible international transfer of conventional arms.  Out of a
desire to promote both norms and controls, and consistent with statutory
requirements, the United States will continue to require adherence to
end-use monitoring requirements.  Further, when needed, the United
States will conduct defense institution building to promote compliance
with international humanitarian law and the law of armed conflict.  
  
United States foreign policy and national security objectives are best
advanced by facilitating arms transfers to trusted actors who will use
them responsibly and who share United States interests.  This policy
recognizes that, when not employed responsibly, defense materiel can be
used to violate human rights and international humanitarian law,
increase the risk of civilian harm, and otherwise damage United States
interests.

**Sec. 2.  United States Conventional Arms Transfer Policy Scope and
Objectives.**  This policy applies to decisions on whether to authorize
the transfer of United States arms to a foreign user, including certain
items on the Commerce Control List, the transfer of defense articles,
related technical data, and defense services, regardless of the
authority or United States Government department or agency under which
the transfer would occur.

The United States CAT Policy supports the following United States
foreign policy and national security objectives:

-   Strengthen the collective security of the United States and its
    allies and partners by enhancing interoperability and supporting
    United States-led diplomacy in building and maintaining
    international coalitions;
-   Help allies and partners contribute to global security and deter and
    defend themselves against aggression and foreign malign influence;
-   Promote international peace and stability and the settlement of
    international disputes through diplomacy and deterrence;
-   Strengthen United States national security by reinforcing respect
    for human rights, international humanitarian law, democratic
    governance, and rule of law;
-   Prevent arms transfers that risk facilitating or otherwise
    contributing to violations of human rights or international
    humanitarian law;
-   Strengthen ally and partner capacity to respect their obligations
    under international law and reduce the risk of civilian harm,
    including through arms transfers, as well as appropriate tools,
    training, advising, and institutional capacity-building efforts;
-   Ensure the United States military maintains technological advantages
    over current and potential adversaries and promote the United
    States’ comparative advantage over our strategic competitors,
    including Russia and China;
-   Strengthen the United States manufacturing and defense industrial
    base and ensure resiliency in global supply chains;
-   Ensure that arms transfers do not fuel corruption or undermine good
    governance, while incentivizing effective, transparent, and
    accountable security sector governance; and
-   Prevent proliferation of equipment and technology that is
    destabilizing, would advance the ability to develop or deliver
    weapons of mass destruction (WMD), or would otherwise provide
    capabilities inconsistent with international nonproliferation
    agreements, arrangements, and norms.

**Sec. 3.  Arms Transfer Decisions. ** Arms transfer decisions will
continue to meet the requirements of all applicable statutes, including:

-   The Arms Export Control Act of 1976, as amended;
-   The Export Control Reform Act of 2018; and
-   The Foreign Assistance Act, the International Emergency Economic
    Powers Act, and annual National Defense Authorization Acts.

Arms transfer decisions will be consistent with the requirements of all
applicable export control regulations and United States international
obligations and commitments.  These laws and regulations will apply, as
appropriate, regardless of whether transfers are accomplished through
direct commercial sales, government-to-government transfers, export or
re-export approvals of certain items on the Commerce Control List,
United States assistance programs, approvals for the re‑transfer of
arms, changes of end use, or upgrades.  
  
As decisions regarding arms transfers are important tools for achieving
United States foreign policy and national security objectives, the
Secretary of State shall coordinate decisions regarding arms transfers
with other relevant executive departments and agencies.  The executive
branch will, in consultation with the Congress as appropriate, review
transfers of conventional arms to ensure alignment with United States
foreign policy and national security objectives and will integrate arms
transfer policy into broader diplomatic strategies that promote United
States foreign policy and national security objectives.

All decisions on potential arms transfers will be made on a case-by-case
basis, taking into account the following considerations:

-   The degree to which the transfer supports United States strategic
    and foreign policy interests and bolsters the capabilities of our
    allies and partners to counter international and transnational
    threats;
-   The risk that the recipient may use the arms transfer to contribute
    to a violation of human rights or international humanitarian law,
    based on an assessment of the available information and relevant
    circumstances, including the capacity and intention of the recipient
    to respect international obligations and commitments;
-   The overall stability of the recipient country’s political system,
    and the degree to which a receiving government possesses
    well-governed security institutions that are subject to the rule of
    law, with effective accountability mechanisms for its security
    sector, effective civilian control of security forces, and a
    demonstrated commitment to improving transparency and countering
    corruption in its defense acquisition system;
-   The risk that the transfer will have adverse political, social, or
    economic effects within the recipient country, including by
    negatively impacting the protection of human rights, fundamental
    freedoms, or the activity of civil society; encourage or contribute
    to corruption; contribute to instability, authoritarianism, or
    transnational repression; contribute to impunity of security forces;
    or undermine democratic governance or the rule of law;
-   The degree to which the transfer contributes to ally and partner
    interoperability with United States forces and increases the
    partner’s ability to operate alongside or in lieu of United States
    forces;
-   The degree to which the transfer reduces an ally’s or partner’s
    dependence on United States competitors and/or helps displace
    long-term reliance on those competitors;
-   The degree to which the transfer increases United States access and
    influence in the support of strategic, foreign policy, and defense
    interests; contributes to countering terrorism, narcotics
    trafficking, transnational organized crime, or similar threats to
    national security; and advances the United States’ interests in
    regional stability;
-   The degree to which the introduction of a capability could
    destabilize a country, increase regional tensions, or contribute to
    an arms race;
-   The degree to which (a) the recipient is confronting, has
    confronted, or is likely to confront armed aggression from United
    States adversaries or strategic competitors, and (b) the transfer is
    related to improving the recipient’s self-defense capabilities
    against such aggression;
-   Whether the transfer is consistent with United States international
    arms control, disarmament, and nonproliferation commitments and
    obligations;
-   The recipient’s ability to field, maintain and support, employ,
    secure, and fund the requested system effectively and appropriately
    in accordance with its intended end use;
-   The risk of diversion and the recipient’s ability and willingness to
    protect sensitive equipment and technology, including its history of
    compliance with end‑use requirements and whether the end-use country
    maintains strong export controls and nonproliferation practices,
    which can be demonstrated, among other things, by its membership
    and/or alignment with multilateral nonproliferation regimes;
-   An assessment of whether the transfer might contribute to a
    recipient’s pursuit of WMD and their means of delivery;
-   The transfer’s contribution to United States innovation and
    technological advancement that helps improve United States and
    partner responses to security threats, as well as its effect on the
    United States defense industrial base;
-   The transfer’s effect on the technological advantage of the United
    States, and the risk of compromise to United States systems and
    operational capabilities; and
-   The risk that the transfer of a competitor’s system would undermine
    United States national security considerations outlined above.

If the United States determines at any time that a transfer is no longer
in accordance with United States foreign policy objectives, national
security goals, or legal obligations, the United States may cease the
transfer of or future support for a transferred defense article or
service.

**Sec. 4.  Arms Transfers and Human Rights.**  United States national
security is strengthened by greater respect worldwide for human rights
and international law, including international humanitarian law.  The
legitimacy of and public support for arms transfers among the
populations of both the United States and recipient nations depends on
the protection of civilians from harm, and the United States
distinguishes itself from other potential sources of arms transfers by
elevating the importance of protecting civilians.  Strong United States
human rights and security sector governance standards for arms transfers
— in addition to ensuring compliance with end-use requirements and
providing human rights and international humanitarian law training, as
appropriate — encourage recipient governments to respect international
law, human rights, and good governance, and help prevent violations of
human rights or international humanitarian law.  These United States
standards can serve as a model for other countries’ policies on the
responsible international transfer of conventional arms.  The
United States will work bilaterally and multilaterally to assist other
suppliers in developing responsible arms transfer policies.  
  
In light of these considerations, and consistent with applicable law, no
arms transfer will be authorized where the United States assesses that
it is more likely than not that the arms to be transferred will be used
by the recipient to commit, facilitate the recipients’ commission of, or
to aggravate risks that the recipient will commit:  genocide; crimes
against humanity; grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949,
including attacks intentionally directed against civilian objects or
civilians protected as such; or other serious violations of
international humanitarian or human rights law, including serious acts
of gender‑based violence or serious acts of violence against children. 
This assessment shall include consideration of the available information
and relevant circumstances, including the proposed recipient’s current
and past actions, credible reports that the recipient committed any of
the above violations, and other information related to the overall
capacity or intention of the recipient to respect international law.  If
a transfer had previously been authorized and circumstances have changed
in ways that would materially increase the risk of any of the negative
consequences listed above, the United States will re-assess and, as
appropriate, review options for ceasing the transfer of or support for a
previous authorization.  
  
The recipient government of an arms transfer is responsible for
complying with conditions of arms transfers and its obligations under
international law, including those relating to human rights.  The United
States will engage in appropriate monitoring as part of its effort aimed
at ensuring transferred arms are used responsibly and in accordance with
these conditions and obligations.

**Sec. 5.  Arms Transfer Restraint and Promotion of Responsible Defense
Trade.**  The United States will continue to promote control, restraint,
and transparency of arms transfers, including leading the development of
norms and controls on the responsible international transfer of arms
that contain sensitive technologies.  The United States will exercise
restraint in international arms transfers that may be destabilizing or
threaten international peace and security and will also exercise
restraint in transfers involving materials that might be used as
delivery systems for WMD or result in adversaries obtaining capabilities
that could threaten the security of the United States or of our allies
and partners.  
  
The United States recognizes that good security sector governance,
including the transparent, accountable, and legitimate management and
oversight of security policy and practice, is integral to the
responsible possession and use of United States-origin defense
materiel.  The United States will therefore encourage recipients of
United States arms transfers to demonstrate effective security sector
governance and seek to ensure their ability to protect United
States-origin defense materiel from misuse or illicit transfer, properly
deploy and sustain that materiel, and conduct military operations in a
manner that addresses, rather than exacerbates, the underlying drivers
of conflict.  
  
The United States will continue participation in and support for
multilateral, regional, and sub-regional arrangements that contribute to
the objectives and interests outlined in this policy, such as the United
Nations Register of Conventional Arms; the United Nations Standardized
Instrument for Reporting Military Expenditures; the United Nations
Principles for Transactions Linked to Foreign Government End‑Users for
Products or Services with Surveillance Capabilities; regional
initiatives that enhance transparency in conventional arms transactions;
the Missile Technology Control Regime; the Wassenaar Arrangement on
Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and
Technologies; the Inter-American Convention on Transparency in
Conventional Weapons Acquisitions; and any other relevant or successor
arrangements.  Such multilateral arrangements promote common national
policies of restraint against the transfer of armaments and sensitive
dual‑use goods and technologies to states whose conduct is cause for
serious concern.  The United States will work bilaterally and
multilaterally to assist other countries transferring conventional arms
in developing effective export control mechanisms in support of
responsible export policies that align with those of the United States
and the highest possible common international standards for regulating
the international trade in conventional arms.

**Sec. 6.  Supporting Arms Transfer Decisions.**  Arms transfer
decisions are foreign policy and national security decisions that
support broader United States policy objectives.  The United States will
pursue policies, processes, and regulatory changes to create
efficiencies in the security cooperation field to provide conventional
capabilities that support United States national interests.  Although
the general policy principle of restraint shall govern decision making
on arms transfers, in an increasingly competitive market, the United
States Government will promote transfers when they are in the United
States national interest, in line with the considerations of this
policy, and consistent with defense trade advocacy procedures.  Arms
transfers consistent with security cooperation objectives enable the
United States to enhance partner interoperability and enable partners to
export security.  
  
The United States will seek to address impediments to bilateral defense
trade relations with potential recipient countries that may preclude
prudent arms transfers from proceeding, limit United States Government
and United States defense contractors’ market access, or prevent United
States entities from competing on a level playing field.

**Sec. 7.  Arms Transfers Involving Emerging Technologies.**  This
policy applies to all United States arms transfers, including those that
involve emerging technologies.  Consistent with the Export Control
Reform Act of 2018 and other existing law, the United States also will
review and develop, as required, additional policy guidance for the
review of arms transfers related to or incorporating emerging
technologies implicating national security.

**Sec. 8.  Earlier Presidential Actions.**  This memorandum supersedes
National Security Presidential Memorandum 10 of April 19, 2018 (United
States Conventional Arms Transfer Policy).

**Sec. 9.  General Provisions.**  (a)  Nothing in this memorandum shall
be construed to impair or otherwise affect:  
  
i. the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or
the head thereof; or  
  
ii. the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b)  This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
  
(c)  This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
