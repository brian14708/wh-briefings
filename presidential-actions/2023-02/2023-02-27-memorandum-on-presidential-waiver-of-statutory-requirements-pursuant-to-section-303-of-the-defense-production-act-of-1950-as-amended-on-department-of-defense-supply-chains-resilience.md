MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

              Act of 1950, as amended, on Department of

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including section 303 of the
Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (the “Act”) (50 U.S.C. 4533),
I hereby determine, pursuant to section 303(a)(7)(B) of the Act, that
action is necessary to avert shortfalls in critical Department of
Defense supply chains that would severely impair national defense
capability.  Therefore, I waive the requirements of section
303(a)(1)-(a)(6) of the Act for supply chains enumerated in the June
2021 White House report titled “Building Resilient Supply Chains,
Revitalizing American Manufacturing, and Fostering Broad-Based Growth:
 100-Day Reviews Under Executive Order 14017” and the February 2022
Department of Defense report titled “Securing Defense-Critical Supply
Chains:  An Action Plan Developed in Response to President Biden’s
Executive Order 14017,” specifically for defense organic industrial base
supply chains critical to the Department of Defense and critical supply
chains for electronics, kinetic capabilities, castings and forgings,
minerals and materials, and power and energy storage.  
  
Ensuring a robust, resilient, and sustainable domestic industrial base
is essential to our national security and the preservation of domestic
critical infrastructure.  
  
You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the
