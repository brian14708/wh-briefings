title: "Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency Concerning the Coronavirus\
  \ Disease 2019 (COVID-\u206019)\_Pandemic"
---
 
     On March 13, 2020, by Proclamation 9994, the President declared a
national emergency concerning the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic.  Today, we are in a different phase of the response to that
pandemic than we were in March of 2020, and my Administration is
planning for an end to the national emergency, but an orderly transition
is critical to the health and safety of the Nation.  For this reason,
the national emergency declared on March 13, 2020, and beginning March
1, 2020, must continue in effect beyond March 1, 2023.  Therefore, in
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency declared in
Proclamation 9994 concerning the COVID-19 pandemic.  I anticipate
terminating the national emergency concerning the COVID-19 pandemic on
May 11, 2023.

     This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and
transmitted to the Congress.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
   February 10, 2023.
