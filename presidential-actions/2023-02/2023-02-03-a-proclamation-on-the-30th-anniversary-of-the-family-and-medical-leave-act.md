title: "A Proclamation on the 30th Anniversary of the Family and Medical Leave\_Act"
---
 
     For 30 years, the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) has given
American workers the right to take time to care for themselves and their
loved ones without losing their jobs.  When President Clinton signed it
into law on February 5, 1993, I was proud to have fought for it as a
United States Senator alongside tenacious advocates and Members of
Congress.  
     Before its passage, parents were not guaranteed time off for
staying home with a newborn or sick child, and workers could lose their
health insurance for taking leave to fight an illness.  The FMLA ended
that for millions of Americans, guaranteeing up to 12 weeks of unpaid
leave annually to care for a spouse, a parent, a child, or themselves,
and preserving their jobs until they returned.  The law has given
countless Americans peace of mind in their toughest moments.  It has
made workplaces fairer and healthier.  And it has made it easier for
millions of women — who still disproportionately shoulder caregiving
responsibilities — to remain in the workforce, benefitting our whole
economy.  
     But it is not enough to just protect people’s jobs; we must also
protect their paychecks so every American worker can afford to be there
for their loved ones.  The COVID-19 pandemic made this even more
obvious.  The United States is one of the only countries in the world
that does not provide paid leave to its workers, undermining the health
and economic security of families and our Nation.  As millions more
Americans join today’s so-called “sandwich generation,” struggling to
care for both young kids and aging parents, we need to help.  
     That is why, when I took office as President, I proposed the first
national paid family and medical leave program in our history.  Paid
leave would help bring more people back into the workforce — boosting
productivity, securing wages, and easing budgets for working families.
 And it would give workers more dignity and control over their own
lives.      
During the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic, my Administration expanded
the Child Tax Credit to give millions of families a little more
breathing room, helping cut child poverty to the lowest rate on record.
 We gave 200,000 childcare providers the funding needed to keep their
doors open, serving over 9.5 million children nationwide.  We invested
$145 million in the National Family Caregiver Support Program, which
gives family and other informal care providers counseling, training, and
respite care to support loved ones.  I recently signed the Pregnant
Workers Fairness Act to ensure that employers make reasonable
accommodations related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical
conditions.  And just yesterday, I signed a Presidential Memorandum to
make sure Federal employees are able to access leave when they need it,
to the fullest extent possible.  
     I ran for President to restore the backbone of this country — the
middle class. My Administration is fighting for working families across
the board.  We are lowering health care costs and prescription drug
costs.  We are reducing home energy bills.  We have created nearly 11
million jobs, reducing unemployment to a 50-year low as wages keep
rising.  And we have protected the pensions that over a million American
workers and retirees worked for their whole lives, making sure they can
retire with dignity and respect.  Thirty years after the FMLA was
signed, we reaffirm that nothing is more important than being there for
the ones you love when they need you most.  
      NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United
States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the
Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim
February 5, 2023, as the 30th Anniversary of the Family and Medical
Leave Act.  I call upon Americans to honor those who advocated for this
crucial legislation and to join the fight for the dignity and rights of
workers across this Nation.  
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
third day of February, in the year of our Lord
two thousand twenty-three, and of the Independence of the United States
of America the two hundred and forty-seventh.  
                                             

 JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
