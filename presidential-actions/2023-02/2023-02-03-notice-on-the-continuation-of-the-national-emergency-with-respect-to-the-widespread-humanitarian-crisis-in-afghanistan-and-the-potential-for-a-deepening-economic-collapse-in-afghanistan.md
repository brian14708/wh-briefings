title: "Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to the Widespread\
  \ Humanitarian Crisis in Afghanistan and the Potential for a Deepening Economic\
  \ Collapse in\_Afghanistan"
---
 
     On February 11, 2022, by Executive Order 14064, the President
declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency
Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) to deal with the unusual
and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of
the United States constituted by the widespread humanitarian crisis in
Afghanistan and the potential for a deepening economic collapse in
Afghanistan.

     The widespread humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan — including the
urgent needs of the people of Afghanistan for food security, livelihoods
support, water, sanitation, health, hygiene, shelter and settlement
assistance, and COVID-19-related assistance, among other basic human
needs — and the potential for a deepening economic collapse in
Afghanistan continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the
national security and foreign policy of the United States.  In addition,
the preservation of certain property of Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) held
in the United States by United States financial institutions is of the
utmost importance to addressing this national emergency and the welfare
of the people of Afghanistan.  Various parties, including
representatives of victims of terrorism, have asserted legal claims
against certain property of DAB or indicated in public court filings an
intent to make such claims.  This property is blocked under Executive
Order 14064.

     For these reasons, the national emergency declared in Executive
Order 14064 of February 11, 2022, must continue in effect beyond
February 11, 2023.  Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14064 with respect to
the widespread humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and the potential for
a deepening economic collapse in Afghanistan.

     This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and
transmitted to the Congress.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
   February 3, 2023.
