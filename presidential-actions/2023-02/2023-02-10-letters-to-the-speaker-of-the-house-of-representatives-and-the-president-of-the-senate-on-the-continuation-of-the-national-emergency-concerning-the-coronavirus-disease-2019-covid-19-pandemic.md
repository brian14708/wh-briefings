Dear Mr. Speaker:   (Dear Madam President:)  
  
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency declared in Proclamation 9994 of
March 13, 2020, beginning March 1, 2020, concerning the coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, is to continue in effect beyond March
1, 2023.  
  
Today, we are in a different phase of the response to that pandemic than
we were in March of 2020, and my Administration is planning for an end
to the national emergency, but an orderly transition is critical to the
health and safety of the Nation.   
  
Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the
national emergency declared in Proclamation 9994 concerning the COVID-19
pandemic.  I anticipate terminating the national emergency concerning
the COVID-19 pandemic on May 11, 2023.

                               Sincerely,  
  
  
                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
