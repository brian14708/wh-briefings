title: "A Proclamation on Remembering the 500,000 Americans Lost to COVID- \u2060\
  \ 19"
---
 
As of this week during the dark winter of the COVID-19 pandemic, more
than 500,000 Americans have now died from the virus.  That is more
Americans who have died in a single year of this pandemic than in World
War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War combined.  On this solemn
occasion, we reflect on their loss and on their loved ones left behind. 
We, as a Nation, must remember them so we can begin to heal, to unite,
and find purpose as one Nation to defeat this pandemic.

In their memory, the First Lady and I will be joined by the Vice
President and the Second Gentleman for a moment of silence at the White
House this evening.  I ask all Americans to join us as we remember the
more than 500,000 of our fellow Americans lost to COVID-19 and to
observe a moment of silence at sunset.  I also hereby order, by the
authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United
States, that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff
at the White House and on all public buildings and grounds, at all
military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the
Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the
United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset
February 26, 2021.  I also direct that the flag shall be flown at
half-staff for the same period at all United States embassies,
legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all
military facilities and naval vessels and stations.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day
of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-fifth.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
