title: "Executive Order on America\u2019s Supply\_Chains"
---
 
     By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as
follows:  
     Section 1.  Policy.  The United States needs resilient, diverse,
and secure supply chains to ensure our economic prosperity and national
security.  Pandemics and other biological threats, cyber-attacks,
climate shocks and extreme weather events, terrorist attacks,
geopolitical and economic competition, and other conditions can reduce
critical manufacturing capacity and the availability and integrity of
critical goods, products, and services.  Resilient American supply
chains will revitalize and rebuild domestic manufacturing capacity,
maintain America’s competitive edge in research and development, and
create well-paying jobs.  They will also support small businesses,
promote prosperity, advance the fight against climate change, and
encourage economic growth in communities of color and economically
distressed areas.    
     More resilient supply chains are secure and diverse — facilitating
greater domestic production, a range of supply, built-in redundancies,
adequate stockpiles, safe and secure digital networks, and a world-class
American manufacturing base and workforce.  Moreover, close cooperation
on resilient supply chains with allies and partners who share our values
will foster collective economic and national security and strengthen the
capacity to respond to international disasters and emergencies.  
     Therefore, it is the policy of my Administration to strengthen the
resilience of America’s supply chains.  
     Sec. 2.  Coordination.  The Assistant to the President for National
Security Affairs (APNSA) and the Assistant to the President for Economic
Policy (APEP) shall coordinate the executive branch actions necessary to
implement this order through the interagency process identified in
National Security Memorandum 2 of February 4, 2021 (Renewing the
National Security Council System).  In implementing this order, the
heads of agencies should, as appropriate, consult outside stakeholders —
such as those in industry, academia, non-governmental organizations,
communities, labor unions, and State, local, and Tribal governments — in
order to fulfill the policy identified in section 1 of this order.  
     Sec. 3.  100-Day Supply Chain Review.  (a)  To advance the policy
described in section 1 of this order, the APNSA and the APEP, in
coordination with the heads of appropriate agencies, as defined in
section 6(a) of this order, shall complete a review of supply chain
risks, as outlined in subsection (b) of this section, within 100 days of
the date of this order.  
     (b)  Within 100 days of the date of this order, the specified heads
of agencies shall submit the following reports to the President, through
the APNSA and the APEP:  
          (i)    The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the
heads of appropriate agencies, shall submit a report identifying risks
in the semiconductor manufacturing and advanced packaging supply chains
and policy recommendations to address these risks.  The report shall
include the items described in section 4(c) of this order.  
          (ii)   The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the heads

          (iii)  The Secretary of Defense (as the National Defense
Stockpile Manager), in consultation with the heads of appropriate
agencies, shall submit a report identifying risks in the supply chain
for critical minerals and other identified strategic materials,
including rare earth elements (as determined by the Secretary of
Defense), and policy recommendations to address these risks.  The report
shall also describe and update work done pursuant to Executive Order
13953 of September 30, 2020 (Addressing the Threat to the Domestic
Supply Chain From Reliance on Critical Minerals From Foreign Adversaries
and Supporting the Domestic Mining and Processing Industries).  The
report shall include the items described in section 4(c) of this
order.  
          (iv)   The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in
consultation with the heads of appropriate agencies, shall submit a
report identifying risks in the supply chain for pharmaceuticals and
active pharmaceutical ingredients and policy recommendations to address
these risks.  The report shall complement the ongoing work to secure the
supply chains of critical items needed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic,
including personal protective equipment, conducted pursuant to Executive
Order 14001 of January 21, 2021 (A Sustainable Public Health Supply
Chain).  The report shall include the items described in section 4(c) of
this order.  
     (c)  The APNSA and the APEP shall review the reports required under
subsection (b) of this section and shall submit the reports to the
President in an unclassified form, but may include a classified annex.  
     (d)  The APNSA and the APEP shall include a cover memorandum to the
set of reports submitted pursuant to this section, summarizing the
