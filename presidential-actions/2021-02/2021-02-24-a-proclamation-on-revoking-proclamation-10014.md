title: "A Proclamation on Revoking Proclamation\_10014"

     The suspension of entry imposed in Proclamation 10014 of April 22,
2020 (Suspension of Entry of Immigrants Who Present a Risk to the United
States Labor Market During the Economic Recovery Following the 2019
Novel Coronavirus Outbreak), as extended by section 1 of Proclamation
10052 of June 22, 2020 (Suspension of Entry of Immigrants and
Nonimmigrants Who Present a Risk to the United States Labor Market
During the Economic Recovery Following the 2019 Novel Coronavirus
Outbreak), and section 1 of Proclamation 10131 of December 31, 2020
(Suspension of Entry of Immigrants and Nonimmigrants Who Continue To
Present a Risk to the United States Labor Market During the Economic
Recovery Following the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Outbreak), does not
advance the interests of the United States.  To the contrary, it harms
the United States, including by preventing certain family members of
United States citizens and lawful permanent residents from joining their
families here.  It also harms industries in the United States that
utilize talent from around the world.  And it harms individuals who were
selected to receive the opportunity to apply for, and those who have
likewise received, immigrant visas through the Fiscal Year 2020
Diversity Visa Lottery.  Proclamation 10014 has prevented these
individuals from entering the United States, resulting, in some cases,
in the delay and possible forfeiture of their opportunity to receive
Fiscal Year 2020 diversity visas and to realize their dreams in the
United States.  
     NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United
States, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws
of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of
the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a),
hereby find that the unrestricted entry into the United States of
persons described in section 1 of Proclamation 10014 is not detrimental
to the interests of the United States.  I therefore hereby proclaim the
following:   
     Section 1.  Revocation.  Proclamation 10014, section 1 of
Proclamation 10052, and section 1 of Proclamation 10131 are revoked.   
     Sec. 2.  Review of Agency Guidance.  The Secretary of State, the
Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall review
any regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, and any other
similar agency actions developed pursuant to Proclamation 10014 and, as
appropriate, issue revised guidance consistent with the policy set forth
in this proclamation.  
     Sec. 3.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this proclamation
shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:  
          (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department
or agency, or the head thereof; or  
          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office
of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.  
     (b)  This proclamation shall be implemented consistent
with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
     (c)  This proclamation is not intended to, and does not, create any
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in
equity by any party against the United States, its departments,
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other
person.  
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth
day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-fifth

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
