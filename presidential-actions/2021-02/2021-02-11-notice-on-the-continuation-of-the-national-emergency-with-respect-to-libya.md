NOTICE

------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO LIBYA

On February 25, 2011, by Executive Order 13566, the President declared a
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701‑1706) to deal with the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the
United States constituted by the actions of Colonel Muammar Qadhafi, his
government, and close associates, which took extreme measures against
the people of Libya, including by using weapons of war, mercenaries, and
wanton violence against unarmed civilians.  In addition, there was a
serious risk that Libyan state assets would be misappropriated by
Qadhafi, members of his government, members of his family, or his close
associates if those assets were not protected.  The foregoing
circumstances, the prolonged attacks, and the increased numbers of
Libyans seeking refuge in other countries from the attacks caused a
deterioration in the security of Libya and posed a serious risk to its
stability.

The situation in Libya continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States,
and measures are needed to protect against the diversion of assets or
other abuses by members of Qadhafi’s family, their associates, and other
persons hindering Libyan national reconciliation.

For this reason, the national emergency declared on February 25, 2011,
must continue in effect beyond February 25, 2021.  Therefore, in
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 13566.

This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and transmitted
to the Congress.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
