title: A Proclamation on Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States

ADJUSTING IMPORTS OF ALUMINUM INTO THE UNITED STATES

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

1.  Proclamation 10139 of January 19, 2021 (Adjusting Imports of
    Aluminum Into the United States), amended Proclamation 9704
    (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), as amended,
    with respect to tariffs on certain imports of aluminum articles
    proclaimed under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, as amended
    (19 U.S.C. 1862). Proclamation 10139 provides that those amendments
    will not take effect until 12:01 a.m. on February 3, 2021.
2.  I consider it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national
    security interests to maintain, at this time, the tariff treatment
    applied to aluminum article imports from the United Arab Emirates
    (UAE) under Proclamation 9704, as amended, as they are currently in
    effect as of this date. Accordingly, and as provided for in
    clause (6) of Proclamation 10139, I am terminating the modifications
    contained in that proclamation before they take effect.
3.  Proclamation 9704 applied tariffs to help ensure the economic
    viability of the domestic aluminum industry â€” an industry that the
    Secretary of Commerce had previously identified as essential to our
    critical industries and national defense. Because robust domestic
    aluminum production capacity is essential to meet our current and
    future national security needs, Proclamation 9704 aimed to revive
    idled aluminum facilities, open closed smelters and mills, preserve
    necessary skills, and maintain or increase domestic production by
    reducing United States reliance on foreign producers.
4.  In my view, the available evidence indicates that imports from the
    UAE may still displace domestic production, and thereby threaten to
    impair our national security. Proclamation 9704 authorized the
    Secretary of Commerce to grant exclusions from the aluminum tariffs
    based on specific national security considerations or if specific
    imported aluminum articles were determined not to be produced
    sufficiently in the United States, such that the imports would not
    diminish domestic production. Tellingly, there have been 33 such
    exclusion requests for aluminum imported from the UAE, covering
    587,007 metric tons of articles, and the Secretary of Commerce has
    denied 32 of those requests, covering 582,007 metric tons. This
    indicates the large degree of overlap between imports from the UAE
    and what our domestic industry is capable of producing.
5.  Since the tariff on aluminum imports was imposed, such imports
    substantially decreased, including a 25 percent reduction from the
    UAE, and domestic aluminum production increased by 22 percent
    through 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic began. In light of
    that history, I believe that maintaining the tariff is likely to be
    more effective in protecting our national security than the untested
    quota described in Proclamation 10139.
6.  Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended,
    authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its
    derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such
    quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the
    national security.
7.  Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483),
    authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule
    of the United States the substance of statutes affecting import
    treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal,
    modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or
    other import restriction.  
    Now, Therefore, I, Joseph R. Biden Jr., President of the United
    States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution
    and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232
    of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title
    3, United States Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as
    amended, do hereby proclaim that Proclamation 10139, including the
    Annex, is revoked.  
    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
    first day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand
    twenty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America
    the two hundred and forty-fifth.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
