title: Executive Order on the Establishment of the White House Office of Faith-Based
  and Neighborhood Partnerships
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, and in order to better serve
people in need through partnerships with civil society, while preserving
our fundamental constitutional commitments, it is hereby ordered:  
     Section 1.  Policy.  Faith-based and other community-serving
organizations are vital to our Nation’s ability to address the needs of,
and lift up, low-income and other underserved persons and communities,
notably including persons of color.  The American people are key drivers
of fundamental change in our country, and few institutions are closer to
the people than our faith-based and other community organizations.  It
is important that the Federal Government strengthen the ability of such
organizations and other nonprofit providers in our communities to
deliver services effectively in partnership with Federal, State, and
local governments and with other private organizations, while preserving
our fundamental constitutional commitments guaranteeing the equal
protection of the laws and the free exercise of religion and forbidding
the establishment of religion.  The Federal Government can preserve
these fundamental commitments while empowering faith-based and secular
organizations to assist in the delivery of vital services in our
neighborhoods.  These partnerships are also vital for the success and
effectiveness of the United States’ diplomatic, international
development, and humanitarian work around the world.  
     Sec. 2.  Establishment.  There is established a White House Office
of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships (White House Partnerships
Office) within the Executive Office of the President, supported by the
Domestic Policy Council and the Office of Public Engagement, that will
have lead responsibility in the executive branch for establishing
policies, priorities, and objectives for the Federal Government’s
comprehensive effort to enlist, equip, enable, empower, and expand the
work of community-serving organizations, both faith-based and secular,
to the extent permitted by law.  
     Sec. 3.  Functions.  The principal functions of the White House
Partnerships Office are, to the extent permitted by law:   
     (a)  to assist in organizing more effective efforts to serve people
in need across the country and around the world, in partnership with
civil society, including faith-based and secular organizations;  
     (b)  to develop, lead, and coordinate the Administration’s policy
agenda affecting faith-based and other community programs and
initiatives and to optimize the role of such efforts in communities;  
     (c)  to ensure that policy decisions and programs throughout the
Federal Government are consistent with the policy set forth in section 1
of this order with respect to faith-based and other community
initiatives;  
     (d)  to bring concerns, ideas, and policy options to Administration
leadership for assisting, strengthening, and replicating partnerships,
whether financial or nonfinancial, with faith-based and other community
organizations; and  
     (e)  to promote awareness among diverse civil society leaders of
opportunities to partner — both financially and otherwise — with the
Federal Government to serve people in need and to build institutional
capacity.  
     Sec. 4.  Administration.  (a)  The White House Partnerships Office
may make use of established or ad hoc committees, task forces, or
interagency groups.  
     (b)  The White House Partnerships Office shall be led by an
Executive Director and a Deputy Director.  The operations of the White
House Partnerships Office shall begin within 30 days of the date of this
order.  
     (c)  The White House Partnerships Office shall coordinate with the
liaison and point of contact designated by each executive department and
agency (agency) with respect to this initiative.  
     (d)  All agencies shall cooperate with the White House Partnerships
Office and provide such information, support, and assistance to the
White House Partnerships Office as it may request, to the extent
permitted by law.  
     (e)  In order to ensure that Federal programs and practices
involving grants or contracts to faith-based organizations are
consistent with applicable law, the Executive Director of the White
House Partnerships Office, acting through the Counsel to the President,
may seek the opinion of the Attorney General on any constitutional and
statutory questions involving existing or prospective programs and
