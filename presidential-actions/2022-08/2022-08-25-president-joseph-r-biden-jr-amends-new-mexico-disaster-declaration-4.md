On Wednesday, August 24, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. made additional
disaster assistance available to the State of New Mexico by authorizing
an increase in the level of Federal funding for debris removal and

flows during the period of April 5 to July 23, 2022.  
   
On June 27, 2022, the President amended his declaration of May 4, 2022,

measures, including direct Federal assistance, at 100 percent of the
