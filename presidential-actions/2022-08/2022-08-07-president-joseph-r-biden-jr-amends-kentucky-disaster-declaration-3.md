Yesterday, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. made additional disaster
assistance available to the Commonwealth of Kentucky by authorizing an
increase in the level of federal funding for emergency
work undertaken in the Commonwealth of Kentucky as a result of severe
storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides beginning on July 26, 2022,
and continuing.  
  
Under the President’s major disaster declaration issued for
the Commonwealth of Kentucky on July 29, 2022, federal funding was made
available for Public Assistance and Hazard Mitigation at 75 percent of
the total eligible costs.  
  
Under the President’s order today, Federal funds for debris
removal and emergency protective measures, including direct Federal
assistance, has been increased to 100 percent of the total eligible
costs for a 30-day period of the Commonwealth’s choosing within the
first 120 days of the declaration.
