Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)

Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice,
stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13222 of
August 17, 2001, in light of the expiration of the Export Administration
Act of 1979, is to continue in effect for 1 year beyond August 17, 2022.

                           Sincerely,

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
