title: "A Proclamation on National Wilderness Month,\_2022"
---
 
     From the peaks of the Sierras to the rolling foothills of the
Alleghenies, our Nation’s wilderness boasts national treasures that
provide opportunities for discovery, wonder, and serenity.  They are
also the current and ancestral homelands of Tribal Nations and
Indigenous peoples, many of whom have deep cultural, historic, and
spiritual connections to these places.  During National Wilderness
Month, let us express gratitude for lands and waters that remain in
their natural condition, acknowledge the importance of making public
lands accessible to all Americans, and rededicate ourselves to
conserving and protecting the earth for future generations.  
     When designated wilderness areas are left intact, they defend us
against climate change, keep us resilient when natural disasters strike,
and create a refuge for biodiversity.  Our Nation’s forests offset 10
percent of our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions every year.  Native
grasslands, wetlands, and other healthy soils retain water at faster
rates, protecting us against flooding and offering drought relief for
surrounding vegetation.  Owing to the beauty of these places — and
perhaps anticipating their environmental importance — President
Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law the 1964 Wilderness Act and created
the National Wilderness Preservation System.  In the years since, the
Congress has designated over 800 wilderness areas comprising more than
111 million acres of land.  
     Still, America’s natural spaces are in danger.  Extreme wildfires
threaten to destroy our woodlands.  Rising tides imperil our coastlines.
 Runoff from toxic chemicals pollutes our rivers and endangers species.
 Even if designated wilderness areas appear safe from harm for now, the
unpredictable nature of climate change and biodiversity loss looms over
our entire Nation.  
     In response, my Administration has set ambitious goals to scale
back our GHG emissions and chart a new course with clean energy.  We
pledged to reduce emissions by up to 52 percent by 2030, achieve 100
percent carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035, and create an economy
with net-zero emissions by 2050.  We set the first-ever national
conservation goal through the America the Beautiful Initiative to
voluntarily conserve at least 30 percent of lands and waters in the
United States by 2030.  We are funding ecosystem restoration and
reforestation efforts with billions of dollars from the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law and through the America the Beautiful Challenge,
which merges Federal investments with private and philanthropic
donations to boost conservation.  We are making strategic investments
through the Great American Outdoors Act to conserve at-risk lands,
including critical habitats and migration corridors.  On Earth Day, I
signed an Executive Order to strengthen our Nation’s, and the world’s,
vitally important forests.  
     As we reflect upon the work that remains before us, we must
acknowledge that not all Americans share equal access to public lands.
 I remain committed to ensuring that everyone can benefit from the
natural beauty and bountiful gifts of our wild spaces.  I also remain
committed to ensuring that Tribal Nations and Indigenous communities can
continue sustainably using and connecting with their sacred lands.  My
Administration will honor those whose ancestors stewarded these lands
since time immemorial.  
     This National Wilderness Month, we give thanks for the magnificent
beauty that surrounds us, offer our gratitude to the men and women who
maintain our public lands, and affirm our duty to safeguard designated
wilderness areas and natural spaces across our world.  
     NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United
States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the
Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim
September 2022 as National Wilderness Month.  I encourage all Americans
to experience our Nation’s outdoor heritage, to recreate responsibly and
to leave no trace, to celebrate the value of preserving an enduring
wilderness, and to strengthen our commitment to protecting these vital
lands and waters now and for future generations.  
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first
day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-seventh.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
