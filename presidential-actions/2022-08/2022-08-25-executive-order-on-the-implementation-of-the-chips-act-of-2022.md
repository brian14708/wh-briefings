title: "Executive Order on the Implementation of the CHIPS Act of\_2022"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, and in order to effectively
implement the incentives for semiconductor research, development, and
manufacturing provided by division A of H.R. 4346 (the “Act”), it is
hereby ordered as follows:  
  
Section 1.  Background.  The Act, known as the Creating Helpful
Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) Act of 2022, will make
transformative investments to restore and advance our Nation’s
leadership in the research, development, and manufacturing of
semiconductors.  These investments will strengthen our Nation’s
manufacturing and industrial base; create well-paying, high-skilled jobs
in construction, manufacturing, and maintenance; catalyze regional
economic development throughout the country; bolster United States
technology leadership; and reduce our dependence on critical
technologies from China and other vulnerable or overly concentrated
foreign supply chains.  
  
Meeting these objectives will require effective implementation of the
Act by my Administration, in collaboration with State, local, Tribal,
and territorial governments; the private sector; institutions of higher
education; workforce development organizations; labor unions and other
worker organizations; and allied and partner countries.  
  
Sec. 2.  Implementation Priorities.  In implementing the Act, all
agencies (as described in section 3502(1) of title 44, United States
Code, except for the agencies described in section 3502(5) of title 44)
shall, as appropriate and to the extent consistent with law,
prioritize:  
  
     (a)  protecting taxpayer resources, including by ensuring strong
compliance and accountability measures for funding recipients;  
  
     (b)  meeting economic, sustainability, and national security needs,
including by building domestic manufacturing capacity that reduces
reliance on vulnerable or overly concentrated foreign production for
both leading-edge and mature microelectronics;  
  
      (c)  ensuring long-term leadership in the microelectronics sector,
including by establishing a dynamic, collaborative network for
microelectronics research and innovation to enable long-term United
States leadership in critical industries;  
  
      (d)  catalyzing private-sector investment, including by reducing
risk and maximizing large-scale private investment in production,
breakthrough technologies, and worker and workforce development;  
  
       (e)  generating benefits — such as well-paying, high-skilled
union jobs and opportunities for startups; small businesses; and
minority-owned, veteran-owned, and women-owned businesses — for a broad
range of stakeholders and communities, including by investing in
disadvantaged communities and by partnering with State, local, Tribal,
and territorial governments and with institutions of higher education;
and  
  
       (f)  strengthening and expanding regional manufacturing and
innovation ecosystems, including by investing in suppliers,
manufacturers, workforce development, basic and translational research,
and related infrastructure and cybersecurity throughout the
microelectronics supply chain, and by facilitating the expansion,
creation, and coordination of semiconductor clusters.  
  
Sec. 3.  CHIPS Implementation Steering Council.  (a)  There is
established within the Executive Office of the President the CHIPS
Implementation Steering Council (Steering Council).  The function of the
Steering Council is to coordinate policy development to ensure the
effective implementation of the Act within the executive branch.  
  
        (b)  The Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, the
Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the
Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy shall serve as
Co-Chairs of the Steering Council.  
  
        (c)  In addition to the Co-Chairs, the Steering Council shall
consist of the following members:

1.   the Secretary of State;
2.   the Secretary of the Treasury;
3.   the Secretary of Defense;
4.   the Secretary of Commerce;
5.   the Secretary of Labor;
6.   the Secretary of Energy;
7.   the Director of the Office of Management and Budget;
8.   the Administrator of the Small Business Administration;
9.   the Director of National Intelligence;
10.  the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy;
11.  the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers;
12.  the National Cyber Director;
13.  the Director of the National Science Foundation; and
14.  the heads of such other executive departments, agencies, and
    offices as the Co-Chairs may from time to time invite to participate

       (d)  The Co-Chairs may create and coordinate subgroups consisting
of Steering Council members or their designees, as appropriate.  
  
       (e)  The Co-Chairs may consult with leaders from industry, labor
unions and other worker organizations, institutions of higher education,
research institutions, and civil society, as appropriate and consistent
with law, to provide individual perspectives and advice to the Steering
Council on the effective implementation of the Act.  
  
        (f)  The Co-Chairs may consult with the President’s Council of
Advisors on Science and Technology, as appropriate and consistent with
law, to provide advice to the Steering Council.  
  
Sec. 4.  Effective and Efficient Stewardship and Oversight of Taxpayer
Resources.  The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall
take appropriate actions to promote and monitor, with respect to
execution of the Act, the effective and efficient stewardship and
oversight of taxpayer resources, in collaboration with the Steering
Council and the heads of agencies responsible for implementing the
Act.  
  
Sec. 5.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be
construed to impair or otherwise affect:  
       (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or
agency, or the head thereof; or  
       (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management
and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
  
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.  
  
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
