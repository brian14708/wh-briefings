MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE  
                THE SECRETARY OF ENERGY

SUBJECT:       Presidential Determination on the Proposed Agreement to
Extend the Agreement for Cooperation between the United States of
America and the Republic of South Africa Concerning Peaceful Uses of
Nuclear Energy  
  
I have considered the proposed Agreement to Extend the Agreement for
Cooperation between the United States of America and the Republic of
South Africa Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy (the “proposed
Agreement”), along with the views, recommendations, and statements of
the interested departments and agencies.  
  
I have determined that the performance of the proposed Agreement will
promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common
defense and security.  Pursuant to section 123 b. of the Atomic Energy
Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2153(b)), I hereby approve the
proposed Agreement and authorize the Secretary of State to arrange for
its execution.  
  
The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this
determination in the *Federal Register*.  
                            

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
