Dear Mr. Speaker:   (Dear Madam President:)  
  
Consistent with subsection 204(b) of the International Emergency
Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(b), I hereby report that I have
issued an Executive Order that terminates the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 13288 of March 6, 2003, and revokes that
order, Executive Order 13391 of November 22, 2005, and Executive Order
13469 of July 25, 2008.  
  
The declaration of a national emergency in Executive Order 13288 with
respect to the actions and policies of certain members of the Government
of Zimbabwe and other persons to undermine Zimbabwe’s democratic
processes or institutions, as relied upon for additional steps taken in
Executive Order 13391 and as expanded by Executive Order 13469, should
no longer be in effect.     
  
Although I continue to be concerned with the situation in Zimbabwe,
particularly with respect to acts of violence and other human rights
abuses against political opponents and with respect to public
corruption, including misuse of public authority, I have determined that
the declaration of a national emergency in Executive Order 13288 is no
longer needed.  Moreover, the United States Government will continue to
use existing sanctions authorities to hold accountable persons involved
in corruption and serious human rights abuse in Zimbabwe.  
  
Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to terminate the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13288, and revoke that
order, Executive Order 13391, and Executive Order 13469.  
  
I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.  
  
  
                                      Sincerely,  
  
  
  
                                      JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
