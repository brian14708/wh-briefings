title: "Executive Order on Advancing Women\u2019s Health Research and\_Innovation"
---
 
    By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as
follows:

     Section 1.  Policy.  My Administration is committed to getting
women the answers they need about their health.  For far too long,
scientific and biomedical research excluded women and undervalued the
study of women’s health.  The resulting research gaps mean that we know
far too little about women’s health across women’s lifespans, and those
gaps are even more prominent for women of color, older women, and women
with disabilities.  

     The notion of including women in clinical trials used to be
revolutionary — which means many diagnostics and treatments were
developed without women in mind and thus failed to account for women’s
health.  Over 30 years ago, the Congress passed the landmark National
Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-43) to
direct the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the largest public
funder of biomedical research in the world, to include women and people
of color in NIH-funded clinical research.  In 2016, the Congress built
on these requirements in the 21st Century Cures Act (Public Law
114-255), which directed the NIH to further its pursuit of women’s
health research, including by strengthening clinical trial inclusion and
data analysis, developing research and data standards to advance the
study of women’s health, and improving NIH-wide coordination on women’s
health research.

     These policies led to significant increases in women’s
participation in clinical trials, and ongoing investments in biomedical
research have supported breakthroughs in women’s health.  Through the
discovery of genetic factors that increase the risk of breast cancer and
innovations in mammography, we have transformed our approach to
prevention, early detection, and treatment, and have improved outcomes
for women facing a breast cancer diagnosis.  We have improved access to
life-saving treatments for women with severe heart failure by ensuring
that the devices they need are the right size for a woman’s body.  We
have also identified some of the most characteristic symptoms of heart
attack in women, which are different from those in men — discoveries
that have helped deliver faster treatment to women when every second
counts.  This is what we can achieve when we invest in women’s health
research.

     It is time, once again, to pioneer the next generation of
discoveries in women’s health.  My Administration seeks to fundamentally
change how we approach and fund women’s health research in the United
States.  That is why I established the first-ever White House Initiative
on Women’s Health Research (Initiative) — which is within the Office of
the First Lady and includes a wide array of executive departments and
agencies (agencies) and White House offices — to accelerate research
that will provide the tools we need to prevent, diagnose, and treat
conditions that affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or
differently.

     Together with the First Lady’s tireless efforts, the Initiative is
already galvanizing the Federal Government to advance women’s health,
including through investments in innovation and improved coordination
within and across agencies.  We are also mobilizing leaders across a
wide range of sectors, including industry, philanthropy, and the medical
and research communities, to improve women’s health.

     It is the policy of my Administration to advance women’s health
research, close health disparities, and ensure that the gains we make in
research laboratories are translated into real-world clinical benefits
for women.  It is also the policy of my Administration to ensure that
women have access to high-quality, evidence-based health care and to
improve health outcomes for women across their lifespans and throughout
the country.

     I will continue to call on the Congress to provide the
transformative investments necessary to help our researchers and
scientists answer today’s most pressing questions related to women’s
health.  Investing in innovation in women’s health is an investment in
the future of American families and the economy.  At the same time,
agencies must use their existing authorities to advance and integrate
women’s health across the Federal research portfolio, close research
gaps, and make investments that maximize our ability to prevent,
diagnose, and treat health conditions in women. 

     Sec. 2.  Definitions.  For purposes of this order:

     (a)  The term “women’s health research” means research aimed at
