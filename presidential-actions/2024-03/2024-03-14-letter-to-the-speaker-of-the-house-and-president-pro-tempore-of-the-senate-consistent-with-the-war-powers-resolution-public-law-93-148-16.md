Dear Mr. Speaker:   (Dear Madam President:)

While some positive efforts have been made to resolve the instability in
Haiti, there remain heightened security concerns for the United States
Embassy and its supporting facilities in Port-au-Prince.  To protect
United States diplomatic personnel and diplomatic facilities, on March
12, 2024, at my direction, a security force of military personnel
deployed to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, to strengthen United States Embassy
security.  Although this military security force is equipped for combat,
its movement was undertaken as a precautionary measure solely for the
purpose of protecting United States diplomatic facilities and diplomatic
personnel.  The United States Armed Forces personnel are anticipated to
remain in Haiti for as long as the security environment requires.

I directed this action consistent with my responsibility to protect
United States diplomatic missions abroad and in furtherance of United
States national security and foreign policy interests, pursuant to my
constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive and
to conduct United States foreign relations.

I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress
fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law
93-148).  I appreciate the support of the Congress in this action.

                             Sincerely,

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
