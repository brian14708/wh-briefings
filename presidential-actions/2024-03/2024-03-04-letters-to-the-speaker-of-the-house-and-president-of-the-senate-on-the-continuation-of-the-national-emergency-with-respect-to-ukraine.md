Dear Mr. Speaker:   (Dear Madam President:)  
   
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660 of
March 6, 2014, which was expanded in scope in Executive Order 13661,
Executive Order 13662, and Executive Order 14065, and under which
additional steps were taken in Executive Order 13685 and Executive Order
13849, is to continue in effect beyond March 6, 2024.   
   
The actions and policies of persons that undermine democratic processes
and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability,
sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the
misappropriation of its assets, as well as the actions and policies of
the Government of the Russian Federation, including its purported
annexation of Crimea and its use of force in Ukraine, continue to pose
an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign
policy of the United States.  Therefore, I have determined that it is
necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order
13660 with respect to Ukraine.  
   
                                      Sincerely,  
   
   
   
                                      JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
