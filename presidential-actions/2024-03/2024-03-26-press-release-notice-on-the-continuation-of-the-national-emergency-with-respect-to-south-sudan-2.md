title: "Press Release: Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect\
  \ to South\_Sudan"
---
 
On April 3, 2014, by Executive Order 13664, the President declared a
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706)to deal with the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the
United States constituted by the situation in and in relation to South
Sudan, which has been marked by activities that threaten the peace,
security, or stability of South Sudan and the surrounding region,
including widespread violence and atrocities, human rights abuses,
recruitment and use of child soldiers, attacks on peacekeepers, and
obstruction of humanitarian operations.

The situation in and in relation to South Sudan continues to pose an
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign
policy of the United States.  For this reason, the national emergency
declared on April 3, 2014, must continue in effect beyond April 3, 2024.
 Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13664.

This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and transmitted
to the Congress.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

    March 26, 2024.
