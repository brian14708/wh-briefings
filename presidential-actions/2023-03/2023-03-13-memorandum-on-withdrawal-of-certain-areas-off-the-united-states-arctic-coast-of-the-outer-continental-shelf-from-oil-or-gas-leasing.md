MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR  
   
SUBJECT:       Withdrawal of Certain Areas off the United States  
               Arctic Coast of the Outer Continental Shelf from  
               Oil or Gas Leasing  
   
   
Consistent with principles of responsible public stewardship, and (1)
with due consideration of the irreplaceable marine and coastal
environments — including for marine mammals, other wildlife, wildlife
habitat, scientific research, and Alaska Native subsistence use — of the
Beaufort Sea area of the Outer Continental Shelf; (2) independently with
due consideration of the vulnerability of the ecosystems and coastal
communities to oil spills, particularly where limited or no oil and gas
development has yet occurred; and (3) independently with due
consideration of the national need to curtail, mitigate, build
resilience against, and adapt to the devastating and irreversible
consequences of climate change for the human environment and for the
marine and coastal environments, I hereby direct as follows:  
   
Under the authority granted to me in section 12(a) of the Outer
Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 1341(a), I hereby withdraw from
disposition by oil or gas leasing for a time period without specific
expiration the areas designated by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management
as the Beaufort Planning Area of the Outer Continental Shelf that have
not previously been withdrawn.    
   
The boundaries of the withdrawn areas are more specifically delineated
in the attached map.  The map forms a part of this memorandum.  The
withdrawal directed by this memorandum prevents consideration of
withdrawn areas for any future oil or gas leasing for purposes of
exploration, development, or production.  
   
Nothing in this withdrawal affects rights under existing leases in the
withdrawn areas.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
