2022.  
  
Federal funding is available to state, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the severe storm and flooding in the counties of
Franklin, Knox, Oxford, Somerset, Waldo, and York.  
  
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.  
  
Mr. William F. Roy of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has
been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the affected
areas.Â   
  
Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
