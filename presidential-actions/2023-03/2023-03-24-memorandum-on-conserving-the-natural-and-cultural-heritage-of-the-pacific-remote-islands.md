MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR  
               THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE  
  
   
SUBJECT:       Conserving the Natural and Cultural Heritage of  
               the Pacific Remote Islands  
  
   
In the middle of the Pacific Ocean lie Howland, Baker, Jarvis, and Wake
Islands; Johnston and Palmyra Atolls; and Kingman Reef, whose
surrounding reefs, seamounts, and ocean are filled with some of the most
diverse and remarkable marine life on the planet, including sharks,
rays, marlin, tuna, giant clams, hawksbill turtles, ancient coral
forests, and whales.  Uninhabited today, for centuries wayfinders of
Pacific Island Indigenous Peoples visited these islands while navigating
through the expanse of the vast Pacific Ocean.  
   
For years, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Island Indigenous communities,
conservation advocates, and scientists have advocated for the protection
of United States waters around these remote islands from industrial
fishing, oil drilling, and mining.  Through Proclamation 8336 of January
6, 2009 (Establishment of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National
Monument), the President partially fulfilled these requests by
establishing the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument, which
permanently protected the islands, atolls, and emerged reef and 50
nautical miles of water around each.  Through Proclamation 9173 of
September 25, 2014 (Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument
Expansion), the President took a further step to expand the Monument to
include 200 nautical miles — the full extent of the United States
Exclusive Economic Zone — around Jarvis and Wake Islands and Johnston
Atoll.  In addition, some areas within the Monument are designated as
National Wildlife Refuges.  
   
The areas around Howland and Baker Islands, Palmyra Atoll, and Kingman
Reef that remain unprotected include ecologically significant deep-water
habitats and an associated array of seamounts with exceptional value for
their biodiversity; spawning and feeding grounds for skipjack,
yellowfin, and bigeye tuna species; and multiple apex predators that
play a vital role in maintaining ecological balance and resilience of
the ecosystem.  Research continues to reveal the importance of these
relatively unexplored habitats to the health, nutrient cycling, and
carbon sequestration of the ocean.  
   
To further ensure the protection of this unique and fragile area,
support more abundant fisheries in surrounding areas, conserve the
capacity of a healthy ocean to capture and store greenhouse gases that
would otherwise enter the atmosphere, and appropriately honor ancestral,
historical, and cultural connections to this and other Pacific
conservation areas, and by the authority vested in me as President by
the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby
direct the following:  
   
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.  <span
style="text-decoration: underline">Initiating National Marine Sanctuary
Designation</span>.  (a)  Within 30 days of the date of this memorandum,
the Secretary of Commerce should consider initiating designation of a
National Marine Sanctuary pursuant to the National Marine Sanctuaries
Act, 16 U.S.C. 1431 *et seq.*, to provide the most comprehensive and
lasting protections to the significant natural and cultural resources of
the submerged lands and waters surrounding the seven islands, atolls,
and reefs of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument –both
within and outside the Monument boundary, to the full extent of the
seaward limit of the United States Exclusive Economic Zone — including
marine life, shoals, seamounts, reefs, banks, and sediments high in
minerals and sequestered carbon dioxide for the benefit of present and
future generations.  
   
     (b)  In any proposal of a National Marine Sanctuary designation, as
described in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of Commerce
shall identify the anticipated timeline for the completion of the
National Marine Sanctuary designation process as expeditiously as
possible, consistent with applicable law.  
   
     (c)  For any final designation, the Secretary of Commerce shall
establish a National Marine Sanctuary advisory council and pursue, as
appropriate, opportunities to collaborate with Indigenous Peoples with
ancestral, historical, and cultural connections to the area on planning
and management.  
   
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span
style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.  Collaboration on
Conservation.  The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of
Commerce (Secretaries) shall collaborate, as appropriate, regarding
conservation of the lands and surrounding waters of the Pacific Remote
Islands.  
   
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span
style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.  Collaborative Process on
Naming.  In recognition of the deep and enduring cultural significance
of this region to the oceanic cultures of the Pacific, the Secretaries
shall develop and implement a process to collaborate with Indigenous
language experts, Native Hawaiian Organizations, and other
representatives from Indigenous Peoples with ancestral, historical, and
cultural connections to the area to develop names and naming conventions
reflecting ancestral, historical, and cultural connections for the
National Wildlife Refuges and any National Marine Sanctuary designated
in the area of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument and
for the islands, atolls, reefs, and other natural features in the area.
 Within 2 years of the date of this memorandum and through the process
they develop, the Secretaries shall identify appropriate names for the
National Wildlife Refuges within the Pacific Remote Islands Marine
National Monument and any National Marine Sanctuary that is designated
in the area, provide a recommendation to the President on the potential
renaming of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument, and
identify appropriate naming conventions and processes for naming natural
features within the boundaries of the Monument and any National Marine
Sanctuary that is designated in the area.  
   
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span
style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.  Recommendations on
Appropriate Cultural Recognition.  Within 2 years of the date of this
memorandum, the Secretaries shall engage with Native Hawaiian
Organizations and relevant Pacific Island Indigenous communities and
coordinate with other executive departments and agencies, as
appropriate, to provide the President with recommendations on honoring
the heritage, traditional practices, ancestral pathways, and stopping
points for Pacific Island voyagers and on providing posthumous
recognition for the Hui Panalā\`au, who were Native Hawaiians sent to
the Pacific Remote Islands between 1935 and 1942, many of whom were
young men from the Kamehameha Schools.  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span
style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.  <span
style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.  (a)

person.
