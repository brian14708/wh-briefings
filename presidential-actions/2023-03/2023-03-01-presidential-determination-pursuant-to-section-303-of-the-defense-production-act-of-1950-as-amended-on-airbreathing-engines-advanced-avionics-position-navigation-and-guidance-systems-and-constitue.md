Presidential Determination  
No.        2023-05        

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE  
  
SUBJECT:       Presidential Determination Pursuant to  
               Section 303 of the Defense Production Act  
               of 1950, as amended, on Airbreathing Engines,  
               Advanced Avionics Position Navigation and  
               Guidance Systems, and Constituent Materials for  
               Hypersonic Systems  
  
  
Ensuring a robust, resilient, and competitive domestic defense
industrial base that has the capability, capacity, and workforce to meet
the hypersonic warfighting mission is essential to our national
security.  Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the
Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including
section 303 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (the
“Act”) (50 U.S.C. 4533), I hereby determine, pursuant to section
303(a)(5) of the Act, that:  
  
     (1)  airbreathing engines, advanced avionics position navigation
and guidance systems, and constituent materials for hypersonic systems
are essential to the national defense;   
  
     (2)  without Presidential action under section 303 of the Act,
United States industry cannot reasonably be expected to provide the
additional investment required to provide airbreathing engines and
constituent materials for hypersonic systems adequately and in a timely
manner; and   
  
     (3)  purchases, purchase commitments, or other action pursuant to
section 303 of the Act are the most cost-effective, expedient, and
practical alternative method for meeting the need for this critical
industrial production capability.  
  
Pursuant to section 303(a)(7)(B) of the Act, I find that action to
expand the domestic production capability for these supply chains is
necessary to avert an industrial resource or critical technology item
shortfall that would severely impair national defense capability. 
Therefore, I waive the requirements of section 303(a)(1)-(a)(6) of the
Act for the purpose of expanding the domestic production capability for
airbreathing engines, advanced avionics position navigation and guidance
systems, and constituent materials for hypersonic systems.  
  
You are authorized and directed to publish this determination in the
*Federal Register*.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
