title: "Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to\_Venezuela"
---
 
     On March 8, 2015, the President issued Executive Order 13692,
declaring a national emergency with respect to the situation in
Venezuela, including the Government of Venezuela’s erosion of human
rights guarantees, persecution of political opponents, curtailment of
press freedoms, use of violence and human rights violations and abuses
in response to antigovernment protests, and arbitrary arrest and
detention of antigovernment protesters, as well as the exacerbating
presence of significant government corruption.

     The President took additional steps pursuant to this national
emergency in Executive Order 13808 of August 24, 2017; Executive Order
13827 of March 19, 2018; Executive Order 13835 of May 21, 2018;
Executive Order 13850 of November 1, 2018; Executive Order 13857 of
January 25, 2019; and Executive Order 13884 of August 5, 2019.

     The circumstances, as described in Executive Order 13692 and
subsequent Executive Orders issued with respect to Venezuela, have not
improved, and they continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat
to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national
emergency declared in Executive Order 13692.

     This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and
transmitted to the Congress.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,   
 March 1, 2023.
