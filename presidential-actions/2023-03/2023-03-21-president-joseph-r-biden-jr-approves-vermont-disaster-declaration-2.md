disaster exists in the State of Vermont and ordered Federal assistance
to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by
a severe storm and flooding from December 22 to December 24, 2022.  
  
Federal funding is available to state and eligible local governments and
certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for
emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by
the severe storm and flooding in the counties of Chittenden, Essex,
Franklin, Grand Isle, Lamoille, Orange, Orleans, and Washington.  
  
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.
