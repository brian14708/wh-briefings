Presidential Determination  
No.        2023-06        

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE  
  
SUBJECT:       Presidential Determination Pursuant to  
               Section 303 of the Defense Production Act of  
               1950, as amended, on Printed Circuit Boards  
               and Advanced Packaging Production Capability

Ensuring a robust, resilient, and sustainable domestic industrial base
is essential for the national defense.  Therefore, by the authority
vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United
States of America, including section 303 of the Defense Production Act
of 1950, as amended (the “Act”) (50 U.S.C. 4533), I hereby determine,
pursuant to section 303(a)(5) of the Act, that:  
  
     (1)  printed circuit boards and advanced packaging, their
components, and the manufacturing systems that produce such systems and
components are industrial resources, materials, or critical technology
items essential to national defense;  
  
     (2)  without Presidential action under section 303 of the Act,
United States industry cannot reasonably be expected to provide the
capability for the needed industrial resource, material, or critical
technology item in a timely manner; and  
  
     (3)  purchases, purchase commitments, or other action pursuant to
section 303 of the Act are the most cost-effective, expedient, and
practical alternative method for meeting the need.  
  
Pursuant to section 303(a)(7)(B) of the Act, I find that action to
expand the domestic production capability for printed circuit boards and
advanced packaging is necessary to avert an industrial resource or
critical technology item shortfall that would severely impair national
defense capability. Therefore, I waive the requirements of section
303(a)(1)-(a)(6) of the Act for the purpose of expanding the domestic
production capability for these supply chains.  
  
You are authorized and directed to publish this determination in the
*Federal Register*.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
