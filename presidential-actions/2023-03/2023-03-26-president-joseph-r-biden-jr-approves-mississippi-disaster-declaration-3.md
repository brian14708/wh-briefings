title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Approves Mississippi Disaster\_Declaration"
---
 
Early Sunday morning, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a
major disaster exists in the State of Mississippi and ordered Federal
aid to supplement State, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas
affected by severe storms, straight-line winds, and tornadoes from March
24 to March 25, 2023.  
   
The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in the counties of Carroll, Humphreys, Monroe, and
Sharkey.  
   
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.  
   
Federal funding also is available to State, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work in the counties of Carroll,
Humphreys, Monroe, and Sharkey.  
   
Lastly, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.  
   
Mr. John F. Boyle of FEMA has been appointed to coordinate Federal
recovery operations in the affected areas.  
   
Damage assessments are continuing in other areas, and more counties and
additional forms of assistance may be designated after the assessments
are fully completed.  
   
Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance at
[www.DisasterAssistance.gov](//fema.net/hqss/rrshare/SHARE/AGREES/Florida/2022/4673%20Ian/www.DisasterAssistance.gov),
by calling 800-621-FEMA (3362), or by using the [FEMA
App](https://www.ready.gov/fema-app). Anyone using a relay service, such
as video relay service (VRS), captioned telephone service or others, can
give FEMA the number for that service.
