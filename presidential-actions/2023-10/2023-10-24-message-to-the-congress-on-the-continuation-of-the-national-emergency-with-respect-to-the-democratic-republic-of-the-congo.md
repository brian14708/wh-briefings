title: "Message to the Congress, on the Continuation of the National Emergency With\
  \ Respect to the Democratic Republic of the\_Congo"
---
 
TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:

     Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to the situation in or
in relation to the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared in
Executive Order 13413 of October 27, 2006, as amended by Executive Order
13671 of July 8, 2014, is to continue in effect beyond October 27,
2023. 

     The situation in or in relation to the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, which has been marked by widespread violence and atrocities that
continue to threaten regional stability, continues to pose an unusual
and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States. 
Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13413, as amended by
Executive Order 13671, with respect to the situation in or in relation
to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
October 24, 2023.
