Dear Mr. Speaker:   (Dear Madam President:)  
  
Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C.
1701 *et seq*.) (IEEPA), I hereby report that I have issued an Executive
Order that takes additional steps to deal with the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 13694 of April 1, 2015 (Blocking the
Property of Certain Persons Engaging in Significant Malicious
Cyber-Enabled Activities), as amended by Executive Order 13757 of
December 28, 2016 (Taking Additional Steps to Address the National
Emergency With Respect to Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled
Activities), and further amended by Executive Order 13984 of January 19,
2021 (Taking Additional Steps To Address the National Emergency With
Respect to Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities).  
  
Significant malicious cyber-enabled activities continue to pose an
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign
policy, and economy of the United States.  To address this continuing
national emergency and developments in associated technologies,
subsections 4.2(c)-(d) of the Executive Order I have issued impose
additional record-keeping and reporting requirements with respect to
foreign persons who use United States Infrastructure as a Service
Products and foreign resellers of those Products, including to train
large Artificial Intelligence models with potential capabilities that
could be used in malicious cyber-enabled activity.  
  
In subsection 4.2(e) of the Executive Order I have issued, I have
authorized the Secretary of Commerce to take such actions, including the
promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted
to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes
of subsections 4.2(c) and(d) of the Executive Order I have issued.  
  
I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.

                            Sincerely,

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
