title: "A Proclamation on German-American Day,\_2023"
---
 
     On German-American Day, we honor the over 40 million Americans who
claim German heritage and the countless ways they have strengthened the
diverse fabric of our Nation.

     They have since the beginning.  In 1683, 13 German families fled
religious persecution at home and founded the first German settlement
just outside of Philadelphia.  Ever since, the story of German Americans
has been inextricable from the story of America:  German Americans
fought for our freedom in the Revolutionary War, debates over the
deliberations of the Continental Congress happened in German
coffeehouses, a local German newspaper was the first to break the news
that the Declaration of Independence had been signed, and so much
more.  
  
     Today, German Americans continue to enrich our Nation’s character
and culture as leaders in every sector and community.  They also form
the cornerstone of our Nation’s strong bonds with Germany and its
people.  As capable allies and close friends, the partnership between
Germany and the United States is essential to our joint efforts to
address global challenges — from tackling climate change and food
insecurity to defending human rights and democracy.  And together, we
will continue to stand up for the values that unite us — freedom,
liberty, and sovereignty — including standing with the brave people of
Ukraine as they defend themselves against Russia’s brutal aggression.

     On this day — 340 years after the first German settlement was
founded on American shores — let us celebrate the incredible legacy of
generations of German Americans and the unbreakable bonds of friendship
between our two countries.

     NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United
States of America, do hereby proclaim October 6, 2023, as
German-American Day.  I urge all Americans to celebrate the rich and
varied history of German Americans and remember the many contributions
they have made to our Nation.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-three, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-eighth.  

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
