title: "President\_Biden Names Fortieth Round of Judicial Nominees and Announces Nominees\
  \ for U.S. Attorney, U.S. Marshal, and the U.S. Sentencing\_Commission"
---
 
The President is announcing his intent to nominate two individuals to
federal district courts—both of whom are extraordinarily qualified,
experienced, and devoted to the rule of law and our Constitution.

These choices also continue to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure
that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our
greatest assets as a country—both in terms of personal and professional
backgrounds.

This will be President Biden’s fortieth round of nominees for federal
judicial positions, bringing the number of announced federal judicial
nominees to 193.

The President is also announcing his intent to nominate two new nominees
to serve as U.S. Attorney and two new nominees to serve as U.S. Marshal.
These are officials who will be indispensable to upholding the rule of
law as top federal law enforcement officials.

These individuals were chosen for their devotion to enforcing the law,
their professionalism, their experience and credentials, their
dedication to pursuing equal justice for all, and their commitment to
the independence of the Department of Justice.

The President has now announced 74 nominees to serve as U.S. Attorneys
and 24 nominees to serve as U.S. Marshals.

The President is also announcing his intent to re-nominate two
experienced and qualified Commissioners of the U.S. Sentencing
Commission, a bipartisan independent agency created during the Reagan
Administration. The Commission was created to reduce sentencing
disparities and promote transparency and proportionality in criminal
sentencing.

The Commission lacked a quorum and was prevented from doing critical
business from 2019 until 2022, when the President first nominated a
bipartisan slate of seven Commissioners. If confirmed again, these two
U.S. Sentencing Commission members would continue serving with the
President’s other five bipartisan nominees whose terms have not expired.
