Dear Mr. Speaker:   (Dear Madam President:)  
  
In accordance with section 506A(a)(3)(B) of the Trade Act of 1974, as
amended (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(3)(B)), I am providing advance notification
of my intent to terminate the designation of the Central African
Republic, the Gabonese Republic (Gabon), Niger, and the Republic of
Uganda (Uganda) as beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries under the
African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA).  
  
I am taking this step because I have determined that the Central African
Republic, Gabon, Niger, and Uganda do not meet the eligibility
requirements of section 104 of the AGOA.  Specifically, the Government
of the Central African Republic has engaged in gross violations of
internationally recognized human rights and has not established, or is
not making continual progress toward establishing, the protection of
internationally recognized worker rights, the rule of law, and political
pluralism.  Niger and the Government of Gabon have not established, or
are not making continual progress toward establishing, the protection of
political pluralism and the rule of law.  Finally, the Government of
Uganda has engaged in gross violations of internationally recognized
human rights.   
  
Despite intensive engagement between the United States and the Central
African Republic, Gabon, Niger, and Uganda, these countries have failed
to address United States concerns about their non-compliance with the
AGOA eligibility criteria.    
  
Accordingly, I intend to terminate the designation of these countries as
beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries under the AGOA, effective
January 1, 2024.  I will continue to assess whether the Central African
Republic, Gabon, Niger, and Uganda meet the AGOA eligibility
requirements.

                   Sincerely,

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
