Dear Mr. Speaker:   (Dear Madam President:)

Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to Sudan declared in
Executive Order 13067 of November 3, 1997, is to continue in effect
beyond November 3, 2023.  
  
The crisis that led to the declaration of a national emergency in
Executive Order 13067; the expansion of the scope of that emergency in
Executive Order 13400 of April 26, 2006; the taking of additional steps
with respect to that emergency in Executive Order 13412 of October 13,
2006, Executive Order 13761 of January 13, 2017, and Executive Order
13804 of July 11, 2017; and the further expansion of the scope of that
emergency in Executive Order 14098 of May 4, 2023, has not been
resolved.  The policies and actions of the Government of Sudan, and the
situation in Sudan and Darfur, continue to pose an unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the
United States.  Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to
continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13067, as
expanded by Executive Orders 13400 and 14098, with respect to Sudan.

                                Sincerely,  

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
