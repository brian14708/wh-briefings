title: "Letters to the Speaker pro tempore of the House and the President of the Senate\
  \ on the Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Situation in\
  \ and in Relation to\_Syria"

Dear Mr. Speaker pro tempore: (Dear Madam President:)  
  
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13894 of
October 14, 2019, with respect to the situation in and in relation to
Syria, is to continue in effect beyond October 14, 2023.  
  
The situation in and in relation to Syria, and in particular the actions
by the Government of Turkey to conduct a military offensive into
northeast Syria, undermines the campaign to defeat the Islamic State of
Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, endangers civilians, and further threatens to
undermine the peace, security, and stability in the region, and
continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national
security and foreign policy of the United States.      
  
Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13894 with respect to the
situation in and in relation to Syria.

                               Sincerely,

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
