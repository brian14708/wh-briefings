title: "Message to the Congress on the Continuation of the National Emergency With\
  \ Respect to Significant Narcotics Traffickers Centered in\_Colombia"

TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:  
  
  
     Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to significant
narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia declared in Executive
Order 12978 of October 21, 1995, is to continue in effect beyond October
21, 2023. 

     The circumstances that led to the declaration of a national
emergency on October 21, 1995, have not been resolved.  The actions of
significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia continue to pose
an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign
policy, and economy of the United States and to cause an extreme level
of violence, corruption, and harm in the United States and abroad.  For
this reason, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 12978 with respect to
significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
 October 17, 2023.
