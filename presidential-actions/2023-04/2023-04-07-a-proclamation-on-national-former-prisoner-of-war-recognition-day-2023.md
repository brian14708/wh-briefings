title: "A Proclamation on National Former Prisoner Of War Recognition Day,\_2023"
---
 
     On National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, we honor the
more than half a million service members who sacrificed their freedom as
prisoners of war in order to defend freedom for their fellow Americans.
 These brave patriots remind us of the grave costs of war and the
sacrifice we ask of those who fight for us.  We owe them and their
families, caregivers, and survivors a debt of gratitude we can never
fully repay.

     This year, we mark the 50th anniversary of Operation Homecoming,
the repatriation of nearly 600 Americans held captive during the Vietnam
War, as well as the 70th anniversary of Operations Big Switch and Little
Switch, which brought home more than 3,700 American prisoners of the
Korean War.  These heroes — and other prisoners of war from every
conflict throughout our history — stand among the bravest of our Nation,
serving honorably under intolerable circumstances.  Their unwavering
courage helped defend an idea unlike any other in human history:  the
idea of the United States of America.

     Our Nation has many obligations, but our one truly sacred
obligation is to equip those we send into harm’s way and to care for
them and their families when they return home.  To every prisoner of war
now safely reunited with their loved ones:  We will never fail to honor
your sacrifice.  To every family still awaiting answers about a hero who
went missing in action:  We will never stop working to bring them home. 
And to every service member defending our Nation and our values around
the world today:  We will never forget what you give to this country
each day.

     May God bless our former prisoners of war and their families,
caregivers, and survivors, and may God protect our troops.

     NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United
States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the
Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April
9, 2023, as National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day.  I call
upon Americans to observe this day by honoring the service and sacrifice
of all former prisoners of war as our Nation expresses its eternal
gratitude for their sacrifice.  I also call upon Federal, State, and
local government officials and organizations to observe this day with
appropriate ceremonies and activities.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
seventh day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-three,
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred
and forty-seventh.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
