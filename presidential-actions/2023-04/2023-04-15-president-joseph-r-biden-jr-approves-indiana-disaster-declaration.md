title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Approves Indiana Disaster\_Declaration"
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Indiana and ordered Federal aid to supplement
State and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by severe storms,
straight-line winds, and tornadoes from March 31 to April 1, 2023.  
  
The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in the counties of Allen, Benton, Clinton, Grant, Howard,
Johnson, Lake, Monroe, Morgan, Owen, Sullivan, and White.  
  
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.  
  
Brian F. Schiller of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has
been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the affected
areas.   
  
Damage assessments are continuing in other areas, and more counties and
additional forms of assistance may be designated after the assessments
are fully completed.  
  
Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance at
[www.DisasterAssistance.gov](www.DisasterAssistance.gov), or by calling
800-621-FEMA (3362), or by using the [FEMA
App](https://www.ready.gov/fema-app). Anyone using a relay service, such
as video relay service (VRS), captioned telephone service or others, can
give FEMA the number for that service.
