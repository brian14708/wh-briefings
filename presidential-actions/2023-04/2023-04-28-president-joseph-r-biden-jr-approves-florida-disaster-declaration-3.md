title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Approves Florida Disaster\_Declaration"
---
 
Last night, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major
disaster exists in the State of Florida and ordered Federal aid to
supplement State, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas
affected by severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding from April 12 to
April 14, 2023.  
  
The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in Broward County.  
  
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.  
  
Federal funding is also available to state and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding in
Broward County.  
  
Lastly, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.  
  
Mr. Brett H. Howard has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery
operations in the affected areas.   
  
Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.  
  
Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance at
[www.DisasterAssistance.gov](//fema.net/hqss/rrshare/SHARE/AGREES/South%20Carolina/2022/4677%20Ian/www.DisasterAssistance.gov),
by calling 800-621-FEMA (3362), or by using the [FEMA

give FEMA the number for that service.
