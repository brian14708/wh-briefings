TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:  
  
  
     Effective today, pursuant to the National Emergencies Act (50
U.S.C. 1601 *et seq*.) and section 12302 of title 10, United States
Code, and in order to respond to the national emergency declared in
Executive Order 14059 of December 15, 2021 (Imposing Sanctions on
Foreign Persons Involved in the Global Illicit Drug Trade), I am
authorizing the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland
Security to order to active duty such units and individual members of
the Ready Reserve under the jurisdiction of the Secretary concerned as
the Secretary concerned considers necessary, consistent with the terms
of section 12302 of title 10, United States Code.  The authorities that
have been invoked will ensure the Department of Defense can properly
sustain its support of the Department of Homeland Security concerning
international drug trafficking along the Southwest Border.

     A copy of the Executive Order I have issued is enclosed.
