---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Tennessee and ordered Federal aid to supplement
State, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by
severe storms, straight-line winds, and tornadoes from March 31 to April
1, 2023.  
  
The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in the counties of Cannon, Hardeman, Hardin, Haywood, Lewis,
Macon, McNairy, Rutherford, Tipton, and Wayne.  
  
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.  
  
Federal funding also is available to State, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work in the counties of Cannon,
Hardeman, Hardin, Haywood, Lewis, Macon, McNairy, Rutherford, Tipton,
and Wayne.  
  
Lastly, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.  
  
Mr. Andrew D. Friend of FEMA has been appointed to coordinate Federal
recovery operations in the affected areas.  
  
Damage assessments are continuing in other areas, and more counties and
additional forms of assistance may be designated after the assessments
are fully completed.  
  
Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance at
