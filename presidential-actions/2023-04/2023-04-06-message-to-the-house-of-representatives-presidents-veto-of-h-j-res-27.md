  \ Res\_27"

TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:

     I am returning herewith without my approval H.J. Res. 27,
a resolution that would disapprove the revised definition of “Waters of
the United States”.

     The 2023 revised definition of “Waters of the United States”
carefully sets the bounds for which bodies of water are protected under
the Clean Water Act.  It provides clear rules of the road that will help
advance infrastructure projects, economic investments, and agricultural
activities — all while protecting water quality and public health.

     The resolution would leave Americans without a clear definition of
“Waters of the United States”.  The increased uncertainty caused by H.J.
Res. 27 would threaten economic growth, including for agriculture, local
economies, and downstream communities.  Farmers would be left wondering
whether artificially irrigated areas remain excluded or not.
 Construction crews would be left wondering whether their waterfilled
gravel pits remain excluded or not.  The resolution would also
negatively affect tens of millions of United States households that
depend on healthy wetlands and streams.

     Therefore, I am vetoing this resolution.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
April 6, 2023.
