title: "Executive Order on Revitalizing Our Nation\u2019s Commitment to Environmental\
  \ Justice for\_All"
---
 
     By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States of America, and in order to advance
environmental justice, it is hereby ordered as follows:  
  
     Section 1.  Policy.  To fulfill our Nation’s promises of justice,
liberty, and equality, every person must have clean air to breathe;
clean water to drink; safe and healthy foods to eat; and an environment
that is healthy, sustainable, climate-resilient, and free from harmful
pollution and chemical exposure.  Restoring and protecting a healthy
environment — wherever people live, play, work, learn, grow, and worship
— is a matter of justice and a fundamental duty that the Federal
Government must uphold on behalf of all people.  
  
     We must advance environmental justice for all by implementing and
enforcing the Nation’s environmental and civil rights laws, preventing
pollution, addressing climate change and its effects, and working to
clean up legacy pollution that is harming human health and the
environment.  Advancing environmental justice will require investing in
and supporting culturally vibrant, sustainable, and resilient
communities in which every person has safe, clean, and affordable
options for housing, energy, and transportation.  It is also necessary
to prioritize building an equitable, inclusive, and sustainable economy
that offers economic opportunities, workforce training, and high-quality
and well-paying jobs, including union jobs, and facilitating an
equitable transition of the workforce as part of a clean energy future. 
Achieving this vision will also require improving equitable access to
parks, tree cover, playgrounds, sports fields, rivers, ponds, beaches,
lakes, and all of the benefits provided by nature, including America’s
public lands and waters.  Pursuing these and other objectives integral
to advancing environmental justice can successfully occur only through
meaningful engagement and collaboration with underserved and
overburdened communities to address the adverse conditions they
experience and ensure they do not face additional disproportionate
burdens or underinvestment.    
  
     We have more work to do to make environmental justice a reality for
our Nation, both for today and for the generations that will follow us.
 Even as many communities in the United States have prospered and
thrived in recent decades, many other communities have been left behind.
 Communities with environmental justice concerns face entrenched
disparities that are often the legacy of racial discrimination and
segregation, redlining, exclusionary zoning, and other discriminatory
land use decisions or patterns.  These decisions and patterns may
include the placement of polluting industries, hazardous waste sites,
and landfills in locations that cause cumulative impacts to the public
health of communities and the routing of highways and other
transportation corridors in ways that divide neighborhoods.  These
remnants of discrimination persist today.  Communities with
environmental justice concerns exist in all areas of the country,
including urban and rural areas and areas within the boundaries of
Tribal Nations and United States Territories.  Such communities are
found in geographic locations that have a significant proportion of
people who have low incomes or are otherwise adversely affected by
persistent poverty or inequality.  Such communities are also found in
places with a significant proportion of people of color, including
individuals who are Black, Latino, Indigenous and Native American, Asian
American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander.  Communities with
environmental justice concerns also include geographically dispersed and
mobile populations, such as migrant farmworkers.  
  
     Communities with environmental justice concerns experience
disproportionate and adverse human health or environmental burdens.
 These burdens arise from a number of causes, including inequitable
access to clean water, clean air, natural places, and resources for
other basic human health and environmental needs; the concentration of
pollution, hazardous waste, and toxic exposures; and underinvestment in
affordable housing that is safe and healthy and in basic infrastructure
and services to support such housing, including safe drinking water and
effective sewage management.  The cumulative impacts of exposure to
those types of burdens and other stressors, including those related to
climate change and the environment, further disadvantage communities
with environmental justice concerns.  People in these communities suffer
from poorer health outcomes and have lower life expectancies than those
in other communities in our Nation.  Moreover, gaps in environmental and
human health data can conceal these harms from public view, and, in
doing so, are themselves a persistent and pernicious driver of
environmental injustice.  
  
     Nearly three decades after the issuance of Executive Order 12898 of
February 11, 1994 (Federal Actions To Address Environmental Justice in
Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations), the Federal Government
must build upon and strengthen its commitment to deliver environmental
justice to all communities across America.  Our Nation needs an
ambitious approach to environmental justice that is informed by
scientific research, high-quality data, and meaningful Federal
engagement with communities with environmental justice concerns and that
uses the tools available to the Federal Government, including
enforcement of civil rights and environmental laws.  Our Nation must
also take further steps to dismantle racial discrimination and
institutional bias that disproportionately affect the health,
environment, safety, and resiliency of communities with environmental
justice concerns.  
  
     To ensure that the Nation’s policies and investments respond to the
needs of every community, all people should be afforded the opportunity
to meaningfully participate in agency decision-making processes that may
affect the health of their community or environment.  The Federal
Government must continue to remove barriers to the meaningful
involvement of the public in such decision-making, particularly those
barriers that affect members of communities with environmental justice
concerns, including those related to disability, language access, and
lack of resources.  The Federal Government must also continue to respect
Tribal sovereignty and support self-governance by ensuring that Tribal
Nations are consulted on Federal policies that have Tribal
implications.  In doing so, we must recognize, honor, and respect the
different cultural practices — including subsistence practices, ways of
living, Indigenous Knowledge, and traditions — in communities across
America.  As our Nation reaffirms our commitment to environmental
justice, the Federal Government must continue to be transparent about,
and accountable for, its actions.  
  
     It is the policy of my Administration to pursue a
whole-of-government approach to environmental justice.  This order
builds upon my Administration’s ongoing efforts to advance environmental
justice and equity consistent with Executive Order 13985 of January 20,
2021 (Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities
Through the Federal Government), Executive Order 13990 of January 20,
2021 (Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science
To Tackle the Climate Crisis), Executive Order 14008 of January 27, 2021
(Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad), Executive Order 14052
of November 15, 2021 (Implementation of the Infrastructure Investment
and Jobs Act), Executive Order 14057 of December 8, 2021 (Catalyzing
Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability),
Executive Order 14082 of September 12, 2022 (Implementation of the
Energy and Infrastructure Provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of
2022), and Executive Order 14091 of February 16, 2023 (Further Advancing
Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the
Federal Government).  This order also supplements the foundational
efforts of Executive Order 12898 to address environmental justice.  In
partnership with State, Tribal, territorial, and local governments, as
well as community organizations, businesses, and members of the public,
the Federal Government will advance environmental justice and help
create a more just and sustainable future for all.
