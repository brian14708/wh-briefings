  Nation"

Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists for the Navajo Nation and ordered federal aid to supplement the
Tribal Nation’s efforts in the areas affected by severe winter storms
and flooding from January 14 to January 17, 2023.

Federal funding is available to the Navajo Nation and certain private
nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and
the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe winter
storms and flooding.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures for the Navajo Nation.

Mr. Benigno B. Ruiz of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas. 

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
Tribal Nation and warranted by the results of further damage
assessments.
