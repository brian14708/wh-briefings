  \ Respect to North\_Korea"

TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:  
  
  
     Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to North Korea that was
declared in Executive Order 13466 of June 26, 2008, expanded in scope in
Executive Order 13551 of August 30, 2010, addressed further in Executive
Order 13570 of April 18, 2011, further expanded in scope in Executive
Order 13687 of January 2, 2015, and under which additional steps were
taken in Executive Order 13722 of March 15, 2016, and Executive Order
13810 of September 20, 2017, is to continue in effect beyond June 26,
2024.

     The existence and risk of the proliferation of weapons-usable
fissile material on the Korean Peninsula; the actions and policies of
the Government of North Korea that destabilize the Korean Peninsula and
imperil United States Armed Forces, allies, and trading partners in the
region, including its pursuit of nuclear and missile programs; and other
provocative, destabilizing, and repressive actions and policies of the
Government of North Korea, continue to constitute an unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and
economy of the United States.

     For this reason, I have determined that it is necessary to continue
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466 with respect to
North Korea.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
    June 13, 2024.
