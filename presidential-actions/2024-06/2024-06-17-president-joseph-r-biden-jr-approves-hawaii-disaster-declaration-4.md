---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Hawaii and ordered Federal assistance to
supplement state and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by
severe storms, flooding, and landslides from April 11 to April 14, 2024.

Federal funding is available to state and eligible local governments and
certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for
emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by
the severe storms, flooding, and landslides in Kauai County.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Mr. Curtis Brown of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has
been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the affected
areas. 

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
