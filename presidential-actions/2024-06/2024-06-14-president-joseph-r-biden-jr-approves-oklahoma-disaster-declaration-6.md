title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Approves Oklahoma Disaster\_Declaration"
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Oklahoma and ordered Federal aid to supplement
State, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by
severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes, and flooding from May 19
to May 28, 2024.

The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in the counties of Blaine, Caddo, Custer, Delaware, Jackson,
Mayes, Muskogee, and Rogers.

Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.

Federal funding is also available to State, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes,
and flooding in the counties of Blaine, Delaware, Mayes, and Rogers.

Lastly, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Mr. Maona N. Ngwira of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas.

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
State and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.

Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance at
[www.DisasterAssistance.gov](//fema.net/hqss/rrshare/SHARE/AGREES/Florida/2022/4673%20Ian/www.DisasterAssistance.gov),
by calling 800-621-FEMA (3362), or by using the [FEMA

give FEMA the number for that service.
