title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Approves New Mexico Disaster\_Declaration"
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of New Mexico and ordered Federal aid to supplement
State, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by the
South Fork Fire and Salt Fire beginning on June 17, 2024, and
continuing.

The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in Lincoln County and the Mescalero Apache Tribe.

Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.

Federal funding is also available to State, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work in Lincoln County and the
Mescalero Apache Tribe.

Lastly, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Mr. Robert Patterson, Jr. of the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in
the affected areas. 

Damage assessments are continuing in other areas, and more counties and
additional forms of assistance may be designated after the assessments
are fully completed.

Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance at www.DisasterAssistance.gov,
or by calling 800-621-FEMA (3362), or by using the FEMA App. Anyone
using a relay service, such as video relay service (VRS), captioned
telephone service or others, can give FEMA the number for that service.
