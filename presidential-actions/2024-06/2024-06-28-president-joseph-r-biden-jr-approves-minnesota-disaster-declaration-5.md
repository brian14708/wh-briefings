Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Minnesota and ordered Federal aid to supplement
State, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by
severe storms and flooding beginning on June 16, 2024, and continuing.

Federal funding is available to state, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the severe storms and flooding in the counties of
Blue Earth, Carver, Cass, Cook, Cottonwood, Faribault, Fillmore,
Freeborn, Goodhue, Jackson, Lake, Le Sueur, Murray, Nobles, Pipestone,
Rice, Rock, St. Louis, Steele, Wabasha, Waseca, and Watonwan.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Mr. John F. Boyle of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has
been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the affected
areas. 

Damage assessments are continuing in other areas, and more counties and
additional forms of assistance may be designated after the assessments
are fully completed.
