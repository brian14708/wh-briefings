title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Approves Florida Disaster\_Declaration"
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Florida and ordered Federal aid to supplement
State, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by
severe storms, straight-line winds, and tornadoes on May 10, 2024.

The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in Leon County.

Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.

Federal funding is also available to State, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for debris emergency work and the repair or
replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storms, straight-line
winds, and tornadoes in the counties of Baker, Gadsden, Hamilton,
Lafayette, Leon, Liberty, Madison, Suwannee, Taylor, and Wakulla.

Lastly, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Mr. John E. Brogan of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has
been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the affected
areas.

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.

Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance at
