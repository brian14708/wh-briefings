Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Tennessee and ordered Federal aid to supplement
state and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by severe storms,
tornadoes, and flooding during the period of May 8 to May 9, 2024.

Federal funding is available to state and eligible local governments and
certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for
emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by
the severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding in Cannon, Cheatham, Giles,
Hamilton, Jackson, Macon, Maury, Montgomery, Polk, Smith, Sumner, and
Warren Counties.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Ms. Leda M. Khoury of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has
been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the affected
areas. 

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
