Supporting United States economic and business interests abroad is a
foreign policy priority.  United States business has a critical role to
play in advancing broader United States national security and foreign
policy interests.  Economic diplomacy can help to promote broad-based,
inclusive, responsible, and sustainable economic growth, which enhances
regional stability and creates new and growing markets for United States
companies and opportunities for United States workers.  By the authority
vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United
States of America, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code,
and section 708 of the Championing American Business Through Diplomacy
Act of 2019 (Title VII of Division J of Public Law 116-94) (the “Act”),
I hereby establish the Economic Diplomacy Action Group (EDAG) and
delegate to you the functions and authorities vested in the President by
subsection 708(c)(3) of the Act to appoint to the EDAG senior officials
from your respective executive departments and agencies (agencies).   
  
With respect to the performance of responsibilities under this
memorandum, the Secretary of State, in coordination with the heads of
relevant agencies, shall encourage and coordinate the appointment of
members of the EDAG by the heads of their respective agencies. 
Consistent with the Act, such members, as well as any designated
alternates, shall be senior officials who exercise significant
decision-making authority within their respective agencies.  
  
The delegation in this memorandum shall apply to any provisions of any
future public laws that are the same or substantially the same as those
provisions referenced in this memorandum.  
  
The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this
memorandum in the *Federal Register*.
