title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Approves South Carolina Disaster\_Declaration"
---
 
Yesterday, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of South Carolina and ordered Federal assistance to
supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas
affected by severe storms and flooding from November 6 to November 14,
2024.

Federal funding is available to state, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the severe storms and flooding in the counties of
Bamberg, Calhoun, and Orangeburg.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Mr. Brian F. Schiller of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas. 

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
