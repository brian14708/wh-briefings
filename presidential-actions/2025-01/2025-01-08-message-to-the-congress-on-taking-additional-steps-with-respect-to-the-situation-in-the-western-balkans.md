TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:

    Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act
(50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C.
1601 *et seq.*), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I
hereby report that I have issued an Executive Order in order to take
additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in
Executive Order 13219 of June 26, 2001 (Blocking Property of Persons Who
Threaten International Stabilization Efforts in the Western Balkans), as
amended by Executive Order 13304 of May 28, 2003 (Termination of
Emergencies With Respect to Yugoslavia and Modification of Executive
Order 13219 of June 26, 2001), and expanded in scope by Executive Order
14033 of June 8, 2021 (Blocking Property and Suspending Entry Into the
United States of Certain Persons Contributing to the Destabilizing
Situation in the Western Balkans).  
    The order is intended to provide additional prongs for targeting
persons for designation under Executive Order 14033 and deter
individuals from attempting to evade United States sanctions.  This
includes amendments to:  add attempt as a basis for designation
throughout the order; add a prong for leadership of membership in a
sanctioned entity; add a prong for ownership or control of a sanctioned
person; and add a prong for being a spouse or adult child of a
sanctioned person.  
    I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued. 

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

    January 8, 2025.
