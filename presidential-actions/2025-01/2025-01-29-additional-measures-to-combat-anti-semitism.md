title: Additional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 1.  Purpose.</span>  My
Administration has fought and will continue to fight anti-Semitism in
the United States and around the world.  On December 11, 2019, I issued
Executive Order 13899, my first Executive Order on Combating
Anti-Semitism, finding that students, in particular, faced anti-Semitic
harassment in schools and on university and college campuses.  Executive
Order 13899 provided interpretive assistance on the enforcement of the
Nation’s civil rights laws to ensure that they would protect American
Jews to the same extent to which all other American citizens are
protected.  The prior administration effectively nullified Executive
Order 13899 by failing to give the terms of the order full force and
effect throughout the Government.  This order reaffirms Executive Order
13899 and directs additional measures to advance the policy thereof in
the wake of the Hamas terrorist attacks of October 7, 2023, against the
people of Israel.  These attacks unleashed an unprecedented wave of vile
anti-Semitic discrimination, vandalism, and violence against our
citizens, especially in our schools and on our campuses.  Jewish
students have faced an unrelenting barrage of discrimination; denial of
access to campus common areas and facilities, including libraries and
classrooms; and intimidation, harassment, and physical threats and
assault.  A joint report by the House Committees on Education and the
Workforce, Energy and Commerce, Judiciary, Oversight and Accountability,
Veterans’ Affairs, and Ways and Means calls the Federal Government’s
failure to fight anti-Semitism and protect Jewish students “astounding.”
 This failure is unacceptable and ends today.  
   
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 2.  Policy.</span>  It
shall be the policy of the United States to combat anti-Semitism
vigorously, using all available and appropriate legal tools, to
prosecute, remove, or otherwise hold to account the perpetrators of
unlawful anti-Semitic harassment and violence.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 3.  Additional Measures to
Combat Campus Anti-Semitism.</span>  (a)  Within 60 days of the date of
this order, the head of each executive department or agency (agency)
shall submit a report to the President, through the Assistant to the
President for Domestic Policy, identifying all civil and criminal
authorities or actions within the jurisdiction of that agency, beyond
those already implemented under Executive Order 13899, that might be
used to curb or combat anti-Semitism, and containing an inventory and
analysis of all pending administrative complaints, as of the date of the
report, against or involving institutions of higher education alleging
civil-rights violations related to or arising from post-October 7, 2023,
campus anti-Semitism.  
(b)  The report submitted by the Attorney General under this section
shall additionally include an inventory and an analysis of all court
cases, as of the date of the report, against or involving institutions
of higher education alleging civil-rights violations related to or
arising from post-October 7, 2023, campus anti-Semitism and indicate
whether the Attorney General intends to or has taken any action with
respect to such matters, including filing statements of interest or
intervention.  
(c)  The Attorney General is encouraged to employ appropriate
civil-rights enforcement authorities, such as 18 U.S.C. 241, to combat
anti-Semitism.   
(d)  The report submitted by the Secretary of Education under this
section shall additionally include an inventory and an analysis of all
Title VI complaints and administrative actions, including in K-12
education, related to anti-Semitism — pending or resolved after October
7, 2023 — within the Department’s Office for Civil Rights.  
(e)  In addition to identifying relevant authorities to curb or combat
anti-Semitism generally required by this section, the Secretary of
State, the Secretary of Education, and the Secretary of Homeland
Security, in consultation with each other, shall include in their
reports recommendations for familiarizing institutions of higher
education with the grounds for inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)
so that such institutions may monitor for and report activities by alien
students and staff relevant to those grounds and for ensuring that such
reports about aliens lead, as appropriate and consistent with applicable
law, to investigations and, if warranted, actions to remove such
aliens.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 4.  General
Provisions.</span>  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to
impair or otherwise affect  
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or  
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.  
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
