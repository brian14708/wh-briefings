supplement the Tribal Nation’s efforts in the areas affected by a severe
storm and flooding from August 16 to August 18, 2024.

Federal funding is available to the Native Village of Kipnuk and certain
private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency
work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe
storm and flooding.

mitigation measures for the Native Village of Kipnuk.
