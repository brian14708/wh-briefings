MEMORANDUM FOR THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE GENERAL SERVICES

   ADMINISTRATION

SUBJECT:       Promoting Beautiful Federal Civic Architecture

I hereby direct the Administrator of the General Services
Administration, in consultation with the Assistant to the President for
Domestic Policy and the heads of departments and agencies of the United
States where necessary, to submit to me within 60 days recommendations
to advance the policy that Federal public buildings should be visually
identifiable as civic buildings and respect regional, traditional, and
classical architectural heritage in order to uplift and beautify public
spaces and ennoble the United States and our system of self-government. 
Such recommendations shall consider appropriate revisions to the Guiding
Principles for Federal Architecture and procedures for incorporating
community input into Federal building design selections.

If, before such recommendations are submitted, the Administrator of the
General Services Administration proposes to approve a design for a new
Federal public building that diverges from the policy set forth in this
memorandum, the Administrator shall notify me, through the Assistant to
the President for Domestic Policy, not less than 30 days before the
General Services Administration could reject such design without
incurring substantial expenditures.  Such notification shall set forth
the reasons the Administrator proposes to approve such design.
