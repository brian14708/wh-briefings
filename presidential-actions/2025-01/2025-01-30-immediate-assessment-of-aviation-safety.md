MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION  
THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE FEDERAL AVIATION  
ADMINISTRATION

  
SUBJECT:       Immediate Assessment of Aviation Safety

On January 29, 2025, a commercial aircraft and a military helicopter
horrifically collided near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. 
American families today woke up without their loved ones after what
should have been a routine trip, and the entire Nation mourns the loss
of the victims.

This shocking event follows problematic and likely illegal decisions
during the Obama and Biden Administrations that minimized merit and
competence in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  The Obama
Administration implemented a biographical questionnaire at the FAA to
shift the hiring focus away from objective aptitude.  During my first
term, my Administration raised standards to achieve the highest
standards of safety and excellence.  But the Biden Administration
egregiously rejected merit-based hiring, requiring all executive
departments and agencies to implement dangerous “diversity equity and
inclusion” tactics, and specifically recruiting individuals with “severe
intellectual” disabilities in the FAA.   

On my second day in office, I ordered an immediate return to merit-based
recruitment, hiring, and promotion, elevating safety and ability as the
paramount standard.  Yesterday’s devastating accident tragically
underscores the need to elevate safety and competence as the priority of
the FAA. 

Consistent with the Presidential Memorandum of January 21, 2025 (Keeping
Americans Safe in Aviation), I am further ordering the Secretary of
Transportation (Secretary) and the Administrator of the Federal Aviation
Administration (Administrator) to review all hiring decisions and
changes to safety protocols made during the prior 4 years, and to take
such corrective action as necessary to achieve uncompromised aviation
safety, including the replacement of any individuals who do not meet
qualification standards.  This review shall include a systematic
assessment of any deterioration in hiring standards and aviation safety
standards and protocols during the Biden Administration.

Consistent with the Presidential Memorandum of January 21, 2025, the
Secretary and the Administrator shall take all actions necessary to
reverse concerning safety and personnel trends during the prior 4 years,
instill an unwavering commitment to aviation safety, and ensure that all
Americans fly with peace of mind.
