MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE

THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR 

SUBJECT:       Putting People over Fish:  Stopping Radical

Environmentalism to Provide Water to Southern

California

I hereby direct the Secretary of Commerce and Secretary of the Interior,
in consultation with the heads of other departments and agencies of the
United States as necessary, to immediately restart the work from my
first Administration by the National Marine Fisheries Service, U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Reclamation, and other agencies to route
more water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to other parts of the
state for use by the people there who desperately need a reliable water
supply. 

During my first term, the State of California, at the direction of its
Governor, filed a lawsuit to stop my Administration from implementing
improvements to California’s water infrastructure.  My Administration’s
plan would have allowed enormous amounts of water to flow from the snow
melt and rainwater in rivers in Northern California to beneficial use in
the Central Valley and Southern California.  This catastrophic halt was
allegedly in protection of the Delta smelt and other species of fish. 
Today, this enormous water supply flows wastefully into the Pacific
Ocean. 

The recent deadly and historically destructive wildfires in Southern
California underscore why the State of California needs a reliable water
supply and sound vegetation management practices in order to provide
water desperately needed there, and why this plan must immediately be
reimplemented.

Within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, the Secretary of Commerce
and Secretary of the Interior shall report to me regarding the progress
made in implementing the policies in this memorandum and provide any
recommendations regarding future implementation.
