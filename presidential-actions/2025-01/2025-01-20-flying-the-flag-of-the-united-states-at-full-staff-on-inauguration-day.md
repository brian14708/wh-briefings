BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

By the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the
United States of America, and in honor of Inauguration Day and
everything good and noble that it represents about our Nation, our
people, and our form of Government, I hereby order that, on this and all
future Inauguration Days, the flag of the United States shall be flown
at full-staff.

Accordingly, I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be
flown at full-staff at the White House and upon all public buildings and
grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval
vessels of the Federal Government, in the District of Columbia and
throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions, for
the remainder of this day beginning immediately.

I also direct that, for the same period of time, the flag shall be flown
at full-staff at all United States embassies, legations, consular
offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities
and naval vessels and stations.

Upon the end of this Inauguration Day, I hereby order that the flag of
the United States shall be returned to half-staff as directed by
Proclamation 10876 of December 29, 2024 (Announcing the Death of James
Earl Carter, Jr.), in recognition of the memory of our former President,
until the period of 30 days from the day of his death has concluded.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-ninth.

(*AS PREPARED*)
