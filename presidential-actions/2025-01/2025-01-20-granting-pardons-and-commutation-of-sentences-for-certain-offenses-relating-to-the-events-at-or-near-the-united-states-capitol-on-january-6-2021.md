A PROCLAMATION

This proclamation ends a grave national injustice that has been
perpetrated upon the American people over the last four years and begins
a process of national reconciliation.

Acting pursuant to the grant of authority in Article II, Section 2, of
the Constitution of the United States, I do hereby:

(a)  commute the sentences of the following individuals convicted of
offenses related to events that occurred at or near the United States
Capitol on January 6, 2021, to time served as of January 20, 2025: 

•    Stewart Rhodes

•    Kelly Meggs

•    Kenneth Harrelson

•    Thomas Caldwell

•    Jessica Watkins

•    Roberto Minuta

•    Edward Vallejo

•    David Moerschel

•    Joseph Hackett

•    Ethan Nordean

•    Joseph Biggs

•    Zachary Rehl

•    Dominic Pezzola

•    Jeremy Bertino

\(b\)  grant a full, complete and unconditional pardon to all other
individuals convicted of offenses related to events that occurred at or
near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021;

The Attorney General shall administer and effectuate the immediate
issuance of certificates of pardon to all individuals described in
section (b) above, and shall ensure that all individuals convicted of
offenses related to events that occurred at or near the United States
Capitol on January 6, 2021, who are currently held in prison are
released immediately.  The Bureau of Prisons shall immediately implement
all instructions from the Department of Justice regarding this
directive.

I further direct the Attorney General to pursue dismissal with prejudice
to the government of all pending indictments against individuals for
their conduct related to the events at or near the United States Capitol
on January 6, 2021.  The Bureau of Prisons shall immediately implement
all instructions from the Department of Justice regarding this
directive.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this

twentieth day of January, in the year of our Lord
two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States
of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.
