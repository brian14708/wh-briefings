Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Missouri and ordered Federal assistance to
supplement state and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by
severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding from
November 3 to November 9, 2024.

Federal funding is available to state and eligible local governments and
certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for
emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by
the severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding in the
counties of Carter, Crawford, Dent, Douglas, Howell, Oregon, Ozark,
Phelps, Pulaski, Reynolds, Shannon, Texas, Washington, and Wright.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Mr. Andrew P. Meyer of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas. 

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
