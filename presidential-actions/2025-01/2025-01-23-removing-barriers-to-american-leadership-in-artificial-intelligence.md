title: Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:

  
Section 1. Purpose. The United States has long been at the forefront of
artificial intelligence (AI) innovation, driven by the strength of our
free markets, world-class research institutions, and entrepreneurial
spirit. To maintain this leadership, we must develop AI systems that are
free from ideological bias or engineered social agendas. With the right
Government policies, we can solidify our position as the global leader
in AI and secure a brighter future for all Americans.  
This order revokes certain existing AI policies and directives that act
as barriers to American AI innovation, clearing a path for the United
States to act decisively to retain global leadership in artificial
intelligence.

  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 2. Policy.</span> It is
the policy of the United States to sustain and enhance America’s global
AI dominance in order to promote human flourishing, economic
competitiveness, and national security.

  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 3. Definition.</span> For
the purposes of this order, “artificial intelligence” or “AI” has the
meaning set forth in 15 U.S.C. 9401(3).

  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 4. Developing an
Artificial Intelligence Action Plan. </span>(a) Within 180 days of this
order, the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology (APST),
the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto, and the Assistant to the
President for National Security Affairs (APNSA), in coordination with
the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, the Assistant to the
President for Domestic Policy, the Director of the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB Director), and the heads of such executive departments
and agencies (agencies) as the APST and APNSA deem relevant, shall
develop and submit to the President an action plan to achieve the policy
set forth in section 2 of this order.

  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 5. Implementation of Order
Revocation.</span> (a) The APST, the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto,
and the APNSA shall immediately review, in coordination with the heads
of all agencies as they deem relevant, all policies, directives,
regulations, orders, and other actions taken pursuant to the revoked
Executive Order 14110 of October 30, 2023 (Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy
Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence). The APST, the Special
Advisor for AI and Crypto, and the APNSA shall, in coordination with the
heads of relevant agencies, identify any actions taken pursuant to
Executive Order 14110 that are or may be inconsistent with, or present
obstacles to, the policy set forth in section 2 of this order. For any
such agency actions identified, the heads of agencies shall, as
appropriate and consistent with applicable law, suspend, revise, or
rescind such actions, or propose suspending, revising, or rescinding
such actions. If in any case such suspension, revision, or rescission
cannot be finalized immediately, the APST and the heads of agencies
shall promptly take steps to provide all available exemptions authorized
by any such orders, rules, regulations, guidelines, or policies, as
appropriate and consistent with applicable law, until such action can be
finalized.  
(b) Within 60 days of this order, the OMB Director, in coordination with
the APST, shall revise OMB Memoranda M-24-10 and M-24-18 as necessary to
make them consistent with the policy set forth in section 2 of this
order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">  
Sec. 6. General Provisions.</span> (a) Nothing in this order shall be
construed to impair or otherwise affect:  
(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or  
(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.  
(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
