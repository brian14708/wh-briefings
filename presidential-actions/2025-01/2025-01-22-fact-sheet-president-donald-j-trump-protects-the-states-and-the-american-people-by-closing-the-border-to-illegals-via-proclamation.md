title: 'FACT SHEET: President Donald J. Trump Protects the States and the American
  People by Closing the Border to Illegals via Proclamation'

GUARANTEEING THE STATES PROTECTION AGAINST INVASION: Today, President
Trump signed an Executive Order that suspends the physical entry of
aliens engaged in an invasion of the United States through the southern
border.

-   In joining the Union, the States agreed to surrender much of their
    sovereignty in exchange for the federal government’s promise in
    Article IV, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution, to “protect each of
    \[the States\] against Invasion.” 
-   States, such as the Great State of Texas, have asked the Federal
    Government for protection against invasion during the Biden
    Administration, but it failed to protect them from millions of
    illegal aliens entering the United States, invading their
    communities, and imposing billions of dollars of costs upon State
    and local governments.
-   The President has the authority under the Immigration and
    Nationality Act, as well as inherent authority under Article II of
    the Constitution, to prevent the physical entry of illegal aliens
    into the United States across the southern border.

DIRECTION TO IMMEDIATELY REPEL, REPATRIATE, AND REMOVE ILLEGAL ALIENS
INVOLVED IN AN INVASION:

-   Through the exercise of his authority under the Immigration and
    Nationality Act and the Constitution of the United States, President
    Trump is authorizing and directing the Department of Homeland
    Security, the Department of Justice, and the Department of State to
    take all necessary action to immediately repel, repatriate, and
    remove illegal aliens across the southern border of the United
    States.
-   Through the exercise of his authority, President Trump has further
    restricted access to the provisions of the immigration laws that
    would enable any illegal alien involved in an invasion across the
    southern border of the United States to remain in the United States,
    such as asylum.

PROMISES KEPT: In 2024, President Trump promised to “seal the border on
Day 1.”

-   As President Trump described in 2018: “Illegal immigration affects
    the lives of all Americans. Illegal immigration hurts American
    workers; burdens American taxpayers; and undermines public safety;
    and places enormous strain on local schools, hospitals, and
    communities in general, taking precious resources away from the
    poorest Americans who need them most. Illegal immigration costs our
    country billions and billions of dollars each year…And I will
    therefore take every lawful action at my disposal to address this
    crisis. And that’s what we’re doing.”
