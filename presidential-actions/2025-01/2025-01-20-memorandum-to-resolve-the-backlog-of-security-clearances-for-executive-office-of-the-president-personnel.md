MEMORANDUM TO THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL

SUBJECT:      Memorandum to Resolve the Backlog of Security

Clearances for Executive Office of the President

Personnel

The Executive Office of the President requires qualified and trusted
personnel to execute its mandate on behalf of the American people.
 There is a backlog created by the Biden Administration in the
processing of security clearances of individuals hired to work in the
Executive Office of the President.  Because of this backlog and the
bureaucratic process and broken security clearance process, individuals
who have not timely received the appropriate clearances are ineligible
for access to the White House complex, infrastructure, and technology
and are therefore unable to perform the duties for which they were
hired.  This is unacceptable.

Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the
Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby
order:

1.  The White House Counsel to provide the White House Security Office
and Acting Chief Security Officer with a list of personnel that are
hereby immediately granted interim Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented
Information (TS/SCI) security clearances for a period not to exceed six
months; and

2.  That these individuals shall be immediately granted access to the
facilities and technology necessary to perform the duties of the office
to which they have been hired; and

3.  The White House Counsel, as my designee, may supplement this list as
necessary; and

4.  The White House Counsel, as my designee, shall have the authority to
revoke the interim clearance of any individual as necessary.

This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
