title: Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:   
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 1.  Purpose and
Policy.</span>  Parents trust America’s schools to provide their
children with a rigorous education and to instill a patriotic admiration
for our incredible Nation and the values for which we stand.    
In recent years, however, parents have witnessed schools indoctrinate
their children in radical, anti-American ideologies while deliberately
blocking parental oversight.  Such an environment operates as an echo
chamber, in which students are forced to accept these ideologies without
question or critical examination.  In many cases, innocent children are
compelled to adopt identities as either victims or oppressors solely
based on their skin color and other immutable characteristics.  In other
instances, young men and women are made to question whether they were
born in the wrong body and whether to view their parents and their
reality as enemies to be blamed.  These practices not only erode
critical thinking but also sow division, confusion, and distrust, which
undermine the very foundations of personal identity and family unity.  
  
Imprinting anti-American, subversive, harmful, and false ideologies on
our Nation’s children not only violates longstanding anti-discrimination
civil rights law in many cases, but usurps basic parental authority.
 For example, steering students toward surgical and chemical mutilation
without parental consent or involvement or allowing males access to
private spaces designated for females may contravene Federal laws that
protect parental rights, including the Family Educational Rights and
Privacy Act (FERPA) and the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA),
and sex-based equality and opportunity, including Title IX of the
Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX).  Similarly, demanding
acquiescence to “White Privilege” or “unconscious bias,” actually
promotes racial discrimination and undermines national unity.  
  
My Administration will enforce the law to ensure that recipients of
Federal funds providing K-12 education comply with all applicable laws
prohibiting discrimination in various contexts and protecting parental
rights, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI),
42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.; Title IX, 20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.; FERPA, 20
U.S.C. 1232g; and the PPRA, 20 U.S.C. 1232h.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 2.  Definitions.</span>
 As used herein:  
(a)  The definitions in the Executive Order “Defending Women from Gender
Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal
Government” (January 20, 2025) shall apply to this order.  
(b)  “Discriminatory equity ideology” means an ideology that treats
individuals as members of preferred or disfavored groups, rather than as
individuals, and minimizes agency, merit, and capability in favor of
immoral generalizations, including that:   
(i)     Members of one race, color, sex, or national origin are morally
or inherently superior to members of another race, color, sex, or
national origin;   
(ii)    An individual, by virtue of the individual’s race, color, sex,
or national origin, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether
consciously or unconsciously;   
(iii)   An individual’s moral character or status as privileged,
oppressing, or oppressed is primarily determined by the individual’s
race, color, sex, or national origin;   
(iv)    Members of one race, color, sex, or national origin cannot and
should not attempt to treat others without respect to their race, color,
sex, or national origin;   
(v)     An individual, by virtue of the individual’s race, color, sex,
or national origin, bears responsibility for, should feel guilt,
anguish, or other forms of psychological distress because of, should be
discriminated against, blamed, or stereotyped for, or should receive
adverse treatment because of actions committed in the past by other
members of the same race, color, sex, or national origin, in which the
individual played no part;   
(vi)    An individual, by virtue of the individual’s race, color, sex,
or national origin, should be discriminated against or receive adverse
treatment to achieve diversity, equity, or inclusion;   
(vii)   Virtues such as merit, excellence, hard work, fairness,
neutrality, objectivity, and racial colorblindness are racist or sexist
or were created by members of a particular race, color, sex, or national
origin to oppress members of another race, color, sex, or national
origin; or  
(viii)  the United States is fundamentally racist, sexist, or otherwise
discriminatory.  
(c)  “Educational service agency” (ESA) has the meaning given in 20
U.S.C. 1401(5), and the terms “elementary school,” “local educational
agency” (LEA), “secondary school,” and “state educational agency” (SEA)
have the meanings given in 34 C.F.R. 77.1(c).  
(d)  “Patriotic education” means a presentation of the history of
America grounded in:   
(i)    an accurate, honest, unifying, inspiring, and ennobling
characterization of America’s founding and foundational principles;   
(ii)   a clear examination of how the United States has admirably grown
closer to its noble principles throughout its history;   
(iii)  the concept that commitment to America’s aspirations is
beneficial and justified; and  
(iv)   the concept that celebration of America’s greatness and history
is proper.  
(e)  “Social transition” means the process of adopting a “gender
identity” or “gender marker” that differs from a person’s sex.  This
process can include psychological or psychiatric counseling or treatment
by a school counselor or other provider; modifying a person’s name
(e.g., “Jane” to “James”) or pronouns (e.g., “him” to “her”); calling a
child “nonbinary”; use of intimate facilities and accommodations such as
bathrooms or locker rooms  specifically designated for persons of the
opposite sex; and participating in school athletic competitions or other
extracurricular activities specifically designated for persons of the
opposite sex.  “Social transition” does not include chemical or surgical
mutilation.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 3.  Ending Indoctrination
Strategy.</span>  (a)  Within 90 days of the date of this order, to
advise the President in formulating future policy, the Secretary of

contracts, that directly or indirectly support or subsidize the
instruction, advancement, or promotion of gender ideology or

(B)  in K-12 teacher education, certification, licensing, employment, or
training;   
(ii)   Each agency’s process to prevent or rescind Federal funds, to the
maximum extent consistent with applicable law, from being used by an

promotion of gender ideology or discriminatory equity ideology in:   
(A)  K-12 curriculum, instruction, programs, or activities; or   
(B)  K-12 teacher certification, licensing, employment, or training;

parents.

treatment without the requisite license; or
