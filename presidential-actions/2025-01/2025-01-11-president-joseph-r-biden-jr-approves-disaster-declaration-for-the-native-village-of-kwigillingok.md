Yesterday, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists for the Native Village of Kwigillingok and ordered federal aid to
supplement the Tribal Nation’s efforts in the areas affected by a severe
storm and flooding from August 15 to August 18, 2024.

Federal funding is available to the Native Village of Kwigillingok and
certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for
emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by
the severe storm and flooding.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures for the Native Village of Kwigillingok.

Mr. Lance E. Davis of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has
been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the affected
areas. 

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
Tribal Nation and warranted by the results of further damage
assessments.
