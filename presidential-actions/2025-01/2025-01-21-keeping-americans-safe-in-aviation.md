title: Keeping Americans Safe in Aviation
---
 
SUBJECT:       Keeping Americans Safe in Aviation

Every day, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), within the U.S.
Department of Transportation, oversees safety for more than 45,000
flights and 2.9 million airline passengers.  These Americans trust the
FAA’s public servants with their lives, and it is therefore imperative
that they maintain a commitment to excellence and efficiency.  
   
During the prior administration, however, the FAA betrayed its mission
by elevating dangerous discrimination over excellence.  For example,
prior to my Inauguration, the FAA Diversity and Inclusion website
revealed that the prior administration sought to specifically recruit
and hire individuals with serious infirmities that could impact the
execution of their essential life-saving duties.  
   
Illegal and discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)
hiring, including on the basis of race, sex, disability, or any other
criteria other than the safety of airline passengers and overall job
excellence, competency, and qualification, harms all Americans, who
deserve to fly with confidence.  It also penalizes hard-working
Americans who want to serve in the FAA but are unable to do so, as they
lack a requisite disability or skin color.  FAA employees must hold the
qualifications and have the ability to perform their jobs to the highest
possible standard of excellence.  
   
I hereby order the Secretary of Transportation and the Federal Aviation
Administrator to immediately return to non-discriminatory, merit-based
hiring, as required by law.  All so-called DEI initiatives, including
all dangerous preferencing policies or practices, shall immediately be
rescinded in favor of hiring, promoting, and otherwise treating
employees on the basis of individual capability, competence,
achievement, and dedication.   
   
The Secretary of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administrator
shall review the past performance and performance standards of all
individuals in critical safety positions and take all appropriate action
to ensure that any individual who fails or has failed to demonstrate
requisite capability is replaced by a high-capability individual that
will ensure top-notch air safety and efficiency.
