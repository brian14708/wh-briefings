title: "President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology"

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, and in order to establish an
advisory council on science and technology, it is hereby ordered as
follows:

  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 1.  Purpose.</span>
 The American story is one of boundless creativity and bold ambition,
driven by an indomitable pioneering spirit that propels exploration and
discovery.  It is this spirit that illuminated the world with Edison’s
lightbulb, carried the Wright brothers into the skies, and sent
Armstrong to the moon.  Today, a new frontier of scientific discovery
lies before us, defined by transformative technologies such as
artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and advanced biotechnology.
 Breakthroughs in these fields have the potential to reshape the global
balance of power, spark entirely new industries, and revolutionize the
way we live and work.  As our global competitors race to exploit these
technologies, it is a national security imperative for the United States
to achieve and maintain unquestioned and unchallenged global
technological dominance.  To secure our future, we must harness the full
power of American innovation by empowering entrepreneurs, unleashing
private-sector creativity, and reinvigorating our research institutions.

At the heart of scientific progress lies the pursuit of truth.  But this
foundational principle, which has driven every major breakthrough in our
history, is increasingly under threat. Today, across science, medicine,
and technology, ideological dogmas have surfaced that elevate group
identity above individual achievement, enforce conformity at the expense
of innovative ideas, and inject politics into the heart of the
scientific method.  These agendas have not only distorted truth but have
eroded public trust, undermined the integrity of research, stifled
innovation, and weakened America’s competitive edge.

This order establishes the President’s Council of Advisors on Science
and Technology to unite the brightest minds from academia, industry, and
government to guide our Nation through this critical moment by charting
a path forward for American leadership in science and technology.

  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 2.  Establishment.</span>
 (a)  There is hereby established the President’s Council of Advisors on
Science and Technology (PCAST).  
(b)  The PCAST shall be composed of not more than 24 members.  The
Assistant to the President for Science and Technology (APST) and the
Special Advisor for AI & Crypto shall be members of the PCAST.  If also
serving as the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy,
the APST may designate the U.S. Chief Technology Officer as a member.
 The remaining members shall be distinguished individuals and
representatives from sectors outside of the Federal Government appointed
by the President.  These non-Federal members shall have diverse
perspectives and expertise in science, technology, education, and
innovation.  
(c)  The APST and the Special Advisor for AI & Crypto shall serve as
Co-Chairs of the PCAST.  The Co-Chairs may designate up to two Vice
Chairs of the PCAST from among the non-Federal members of the PCAST, to
support the Co-Chairs in the leadership and organization of the PCAST.

  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 3.  Functions.</span>  (a)
 The PCAST shall advise the President on matters involving science,
technology, education, and innovation policy.  The Council shall also
provide the President with scientific and technical information that is
needed to inform public policy relating to the American economy, the
American worker, national and homeland security, and other topics.  
(b)  The PCAST shall meet regularly and shall:  
(i)    respond to requests from the President or the Co-Chairs for
information, analysis, evaluation, or advice;  
(ii)   solicit information and ideas from a broad range of stakeholders,
including the research community; the private sector; universities;
national laboratories; State, local, and Tribal governments;
foundations; and nonprofit organizations;  
(iii)  serve as the advisory committee identified in section 101(b) of
the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-194), as
amended (15 U.S.C. 5511(b)), in which capacity the PCAST shall be known
as the President’s Innovation and Technology Advisory Committee; and  
(iv)    serve as the advisory panel identified in section 4 of the 21st
Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act (Public Law
108-153), as amended (15 U.S.C. 7503), in which capacity the PCAST shall
be known as the National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel.  
(c)  The PCAST shall provide advice from the non-Federal sector to the
National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) in response to requests
from the NSTC.

  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 4.  Administration.
 </span>(a)  The heads of executive departments and agencies shall, to
the extent permitted by law, provide the PCAST with information
concerning scientific and technological matters when requested by the
PCAST Co-Chairs and as required for the purpose of carrying out the
PCAST’s functions.  
(b)  In consultation with the Co-Chairs, the PCAST is authorized to
create standing subcommittees and ad hoc groups, including technical
advisory groups, to assist the PCAST and provide preliminary information
directly to the PCAST.  
(c)  In order to allow the PCAST to provide advice and analysis
regarding classified matters, the Co-Chairs may request that members of
the PCAST, its standing subcommittees, or ad hoc groups who do not hold
a current clearance for access to classified information receive
security clearance and access determinations pursuant to Executive Order
12968 of August 2, 1995 (Access to Classified Information), as amended,
or any successor order.  
(d)  The Department of Energy shall provide such funding and
administrative and technical support as the PCAST may require, to the
extent permitted by law and as authorized by existing appropriations.  
(e)  Members of the PCAST shall serve without any compensation for their
work on the PCAST, but may receive travel expenses, including per diem
in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by law for persons serving
intermittently in the government service (5 U.S.C. 5701–5707).  
(f)  Insofar as the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C.
App.), may apply to the PCAST, any functions of the President under that
Act, except that of reporting to the Congress, shall be performed by the
Secretary of Energy, in accordance with the guidelines and procedures
established by the Administrator of General Services.

  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 5.  Termination.

unless extended by the President.

  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 6.  Revocation.</span>
 Executive Order 14007 of January 27, 2021 (President’s Council of
