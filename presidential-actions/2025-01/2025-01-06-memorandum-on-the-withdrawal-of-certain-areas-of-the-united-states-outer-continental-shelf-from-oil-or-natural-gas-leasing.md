MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR

SUBJECT:       Withdrawal of Certain Areas of the United States Outer
Continental Shelf from Oil or Natural Gas Leasing

Consistent with principles of responsible public stewardship, and with
due consideration of the irreplaceable marine and coastal environments,
including wildlife and wildlife habitat, of the Gulf of Mexico,
Atlantic, and Pacific areas of the Outer Continental Shelf; and
independently with due consideration of the vulnerability of these
ecosystems and coastal communities, where limited or no oil and natural
gas development has yet occurred, to oil spills; and independently with
due consideration of the benefits of expeditious and orderly development
of the vital renewable energy resources of the Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic,
and Pacific areas of the Outer Continental Shelf; and independently with
due consideration of the national need to curtail, mitigate, build
resilience against, and adapt to the devastating and irreversible
consequences of climate change for the human environment and for the
marine and coastal environments, I hereby direct as follows:

Under the authority granted to me in section 12(a) of the Outer
Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 1341(a), I hereby withdraw from
disposition by oil or natural gas leasing for a time period without
specific expiration:

(a)  the areas designated by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management as
the North Atlantic, Mid-Atlantic, South Atlantic, and Straits of Florida
Planning Areas of the Outer Continental Shelf;

(b)  the areas of the Outer Continental Shelf designated by section
104(a) of the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (Public Law
109-432); and

(c)  the areas designated by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management as
the Washington/Oregon, Northern California, Central California, and
Southern California Planning Areas of the Outer Continental Shelf.

The boundaries of the withdrawn areas are more specifically delineated
in the attached map.  The map forms a part of this memorandum.  The
withdrawal directed by this memorandum prevents consideration of
withdrawn areas for any future oil or natural gas leasing for purposes
of exploration, development, or production.

Nothing in this withdrawal affects rights under existing leases in the
withdrawn areas.

                              JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
