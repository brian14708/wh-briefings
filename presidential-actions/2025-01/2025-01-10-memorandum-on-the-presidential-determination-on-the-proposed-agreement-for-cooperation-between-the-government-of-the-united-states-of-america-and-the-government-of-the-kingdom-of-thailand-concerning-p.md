MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE

               THE SECRETARY OF ENERGY

SUBJECT:       Presidential Determination on the Proposed

               Agreement for Cooperation Between the Government

               of the United States of America and the

               Government of the Kingdom of Thailand Concerning

               Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy

I have considered the proposed Agreement for Cooperation Between the
Government of the United States of America and the Government of the
Kingdom of Thailand Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy (the
“proposed Agreement”), along with the views, recommendations, and
statements of the interested departments and agencies.

I have determined that the performance of the proposed Agreement will
promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common
defense and security.  Pursuant to section 123 b. of the Atomic Energy
Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2153(b)), I hereby approve the
proposed Agreement and authorize the Secretary of State to arrange for
its execution.

The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this
determination in the *Federal Register*.

                              JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
