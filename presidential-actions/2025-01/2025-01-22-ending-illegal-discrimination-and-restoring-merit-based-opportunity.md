title: Ending Illegal Discrimination And Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  
  
Section 1.  Purpose.  Longstanding Federal civil-rights laws protect
individual Americans from discrimination based on race, color, religion,
sex, or national origin.  These civil-rights protections serve as a
bedrock supporting equality of opportunity for all Americans.  As
President, I have a solemn duty to ensure that these laws are enforced
for the benefit of all Americans.   
  
Yet today, roughly 60 years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, critical and influential institutions of American society,
including the Federal Government, major corporations, financial
institutions, the medical industry, large commercial airlines, law
enforcement agencies, and institutions of higher education have adopted
and actively use dangerous, demeaning, and immoral race- and sex-based
preferences under the guise of so-called “diversity, equity, and
inclusion” (DEI) or “diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility”
(DEIA) that can violate the civil-rights laws of this Nation.  
  
Illegal DEI and DEIA policies not only violate the text and spirit of
our longstanding Federal civil-rights laws, they also undermine our
national unity, as they deny, discredit, and undermine the traditional
American values of hard work, excellence, and individual achievement in
favor of an unlawful, corrosive, and pernicious identity-based spoils
system.  Hardworking Americans who deserve a shot at the American Dream
should not be stigmatized, demeaned, or shut out of opportunities
because of their race or sex.  
  
These illegal DEI and DEIA policies also threaten the safety of American
men, women, and children across the Nation by diminishing the importance
of individual merit, aptitude, hard work, and determination when
selecting people for jobs and services in key sectors of American
society, including all levels of government, and the medical, aviation,
and law-enforcement communities.  Yet in case after tragic case, the
American people have witnessed first-hand the disastrous consequences of
illegal, pernicious discrimination that has prioritized how people were
born instead of what they were capable of doing.  
  
The Federal Government is charged with enforcing our civil-rights laws. 
The purpose of this order is to ensure that it does so by ending illegal
preferences and discrimination.  
  
Sec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States to protect the
civil rights of all Americans and to promote individual initiative,
excellence, and hard work.  I therefore order all executive departments
and agencies (agencies) to terminate all discriminatory and illegal
preferences, mandates, policies, programs, activities, guidance,
regulations, enforcement actions, consent orders, and requirements.  I
further order all agencies to enforce our longstanding civil-rights laws
and to combat illegal private-sector DEI preferences, mandates,
policies, programs, and activities.  
  
Sec. 3.  Terminating Illegal Discrimination in the Federal Government. 
(a)  The following executive actions are hereby revoked:  
(i)    Executive Order 12898 of February 11, 1994 (Federal Actions to
Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income
Populations);  
(ii)   Executive Order 13583 of August 18, 2011 (Establishing a
Coordinated Government-wide Initiative to Promote Diversity and
Inclusion in the Federal Workforce);  
(iii)  Executive Order 13672 of July 21, 2014 (Further Amendments to
Executive Order 11478, Equal Employment Opportunity in the Federal
Government, and Executive Order 11246, Equal Employment Opportunity);
and  
(iv)   The Presidential Memorandum of October 5, 2016 (Promoting
Diversity and Inclusion in the National Security Workforce).  
(b)  The Federal contracting process shall be streamlined to enhance
speed and efficiency, reduce costs, and require Federal contractors and
subcontractors to comply with our civil-rights laws.  Accordingly:  
(i)    Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965 (Equal Employment
Opportunity), is hereby revoked.  For 90 days from the date of this
order, Federal contractors may continue to comply with the regulatory
scheme in effect on January 20, 2025.  
(ii)   The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs within the
Department of Labor shall immediately cease:  
(A)  Promoting “diversity”;  
(B)  Holding Federal contractors and subcontractors responsible for
taking “affirmative action”; and  
(C)  Allowing or encouraging Federal contractors and subcontractors to
engage in workforce balancing based on race, color, sex, sexual
preference, religion, or national origin.  
(iii)  In accordance with Executive Order 13279 of December 12, 2002
(Equal Protection of the Laws for Faith-Based and Community
Organizations), the employment, procurement, and contracting practices
of Federal contractors and subcontractors shall not consider race,
color, sex, sexual preference, religion, or national origin in ways that
violate the Nation’s civil rights laws.  
(iv)   The head of each agency shall include in every contract or grant
award:  
(A)  A term requiring the contractual counterparty or grant recipient to
agree that its compliance in all respects with all applicable Federal
anti-discrimination laws is material to the government’s payment
decisions for purposes of section 3729(b)(4) of title 31, United States
Code; and  
(B)  A term requiring such counterparty or recipient to certify that it
does not operate any programs promoting DEI that violate any applicable
Federal anti-discrimination laws.  
(c)  The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), with the
assistance of the Attorney General as requested, shall:  
(i)    Review and revise, as appropriate, all Government-wide processes,
directives, and guidance;  
(ii)   Excise references to DEI and DEIA principles, under whatever name
they may appear, from Federal acquisition, contracting, grants, and
financial assistance procedures to streamline those procedures, improve
speed and efficiency, lower costs, and comply with civil-rights laws;
and  
(iii)  Terminate all “diversity,” “equity,” “equitable decision-making,”
“equitable deployment of financial and technical assistance,” “advancing
equity,” and like mandates, requirements, programs, or activities, as
appropriate.  
  
Sec. 4.  Encouraging the Private Sector to End Illegal DEI
Discrimination and Preferences.  (a)  The heads of all agencies, with
the assistance of the Attorney General, shall take all appropriate
action with respect to the operations of their agencies to advance in
the private sector the policy of individual initiative, excellence, and
hard work identified in section 2 of this order.  
(b)  To further inform and advise me so that my Administration may
formulate appropriate and effective civil-rights policy, the Attorney
General, within 120 days of this order, in consultation with the heads
of relevant agencies and in coordination with the Director of OMB, shall
submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy
containing recommendations for enforcing Federal civil-rights laws and
taking other appropriate measures to encourage the private sector to end
illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI.  The report shall
contain a proposed strategic enforcement plan identifying:  
(i)    Key sectors of concern within each agency’s jurisdiction;  
(ii)   The most egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners in each
sector of concern;  
(iii)  A plan of specific steps or measures to deter DEI programs or
principles (whether specifically denominated “DEI” or otherwise) that
constitute illegal discrimination or preferences.  As a part of this
plan, each agency shall identify up to nine potential civil compliance
investigations of publicly traded corporations, large non-profit
corporations or associations, foundations with assets of 500 million
dollars or more, State and local bar and medical associations, and
institutions of higher education with endowments over 1 billion
dollars;  
(iv)   Other strategies to encourage the private sector to end illegal
DEI discrimination and preferences and comply with all Federal
civil-rights laws;  
(v)    Litigation that would be potentially appropriate for Federal
lawsuits, intervention, or statements of interest; and  
(vi)   Potential regulatory action and sub-regulatory guidance.  
  
Sec. 5.  Other Actions.  Within 120 days of this order, the Attorney
General and the Secretary of Education shall jointly issue guidance to
all State and local educational agencies that receive Federal funds, as
well as all institutions of higher education that receive Federal grants
or participate in the Federal student loan assistance program under
Title IV of the Higher Education Act, 20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq., regarding
the measures and practices required to comply with Students for Fair
Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S.
181 (2023).  
  
Sec. 6.  Severability.  If any provision of this order, or the
application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to
be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its
provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected
thereby.  
  
Sec. 7.  Scope.  (a)  This order does not apply to lawful Federal or
private-sector employment and contracting preferences for veterans of
the U.S. armed forces or persons protected by the Randolph-Sheppard Act,

(b)  This order does not prevent State or local governments, Federal
contractors, or Federally-funded State and local educational agencies or
institutions of higher education from engaging in First
Amendment-protected speech.  
(c)  This order does not prohibit persons teaching at a Federally funded
institution of higher education as part of a larger course of academic
instruction from advocating for, endorsing, or promoting the unlawful
employment or contracting practices prohibited by this order.
