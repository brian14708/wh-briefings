title: Initial Rescissions Of Harmful Executive Orders And Actions
---
 
    By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as
follows:

Section 1.  Purpose and Policy.  The previous administration has
embedded deeply unpopular, inflationary, illegal, and radical practices
within every agency and office of the Federal Government.  The injection
of “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI) into our institutions has
corrupted them by replacing hard work, merit, and equality with a
divisive and dangerous preferential hierarchy.  Orders to open the
borders have endangered the American people and dissolved Federal,
State, and local resources that should be used to benefit the American
people.  Climate extremism has exploded inflation and overburdened
businesses with regulation.

To commence the policies that will make our Nation united, fair, safe,
and prosperous again, it is the policy of the United States to restore
common sense to the Federal Government and unleash the potential of the
American citizen.  The revocations within this order will be the first
of many steps the United States Federal Government will take to repair
our institutions and our economy.

     Sec. 2.  Revocation of Orders and Actions.  The following executive
actions are hereby revoked:
