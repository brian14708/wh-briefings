SUBJECT: The Mexico City Policy

I hereby revoke the Presidential Memorandum of January 28, 2021, for the
Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Health
and Human Services, and the Administrator of the United States Agency
for International Development (Protecting Womenâ€™s Health at Home and
Abroad), and reinstate the Presidential Memorandum of January 23, 2017,
for the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Health and Human Services,
and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International
Development (The Mexico City Policy).

I direct the Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of
Health and Human Services, to the extent allowable by law, to implement
a plan to extend the requirements of the reinstated Memorandum to global
health assistance furnished by all departments or agencies.

I further direct the Secretary of State to take all necessary actions,
to the extent permitted by law, to ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars do
not fund organizations or programs that support or participate in the
management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary
sterilization.

This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this
memorandum in the Federal Register.
