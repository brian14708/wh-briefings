title: ENFORCING THE HYDE AMENDMENT
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  
Section 1.  Purpose and Policy.  For nearly five decades, the Congress
has annually enacted the Hyde Amendment and similar laws that prevent
Federal funding of elective abortion, reflecting a longstanding
consensus that American taxpayers should not be forced to pay for that
practice.  However, the previous administration disregarded this
established, commonsense policy by embedding forced taxpayer funding of
elective abortions in a wide variety of Federal programs.  
It is the policy of the United States, consistent with the Hyde
Amendment, to end the forced use of Federal taxpayer dollars to fund or
promote elective abortion.  
Sec. 2.  Revocation of Orders and Actions.  The following Executive
Orders are hereby revoked:  
(a)  [Executive Order
14076](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/07/13/2022-15138/protecting-access-to-reproductive-healthcare-services) of
July 8, 2022; and  
(b)  [Executive Order
14079](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/01/22/memorandum-on-further-efforts-to-protect-access-to-reproductive-healthcare-services/#:~:text=In%20Executive%20Order%2014076%20of,abortion%20care%2C%20including%20medication%20abortion.) of
August 3, 2022.  
Sec. 3.  Implementation.  The Director of the Office of Management and
Budget shall promulgate guidance to the heads of executive departments
and agencies related to implementation of sections 1 and 2 of this
order.  
Sec. 4.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be
construed to impair or otherwise affect:  
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or  
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.  
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
THE WHITE HOUSE,
