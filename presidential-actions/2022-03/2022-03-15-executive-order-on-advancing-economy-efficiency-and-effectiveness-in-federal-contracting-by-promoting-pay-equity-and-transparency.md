title: Executive Order on Advancing Economy, Efficiency, and Effectiveness in Federal
  Contracting by Promoting Pay Equity and Transparency
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 1.  Policy. </span> It
is the policy of my Administration to eliminate discriminatory pay
practices that inhibit the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of the
Federal workforce and the procurement of property and services by the
Federal Government.  The Office of Personnel Management anticipates
issuing a proposed rule that will address the use of salary history in
the hiring and pay-setting processes for Federal employees, consistent
with Executive Order 14035 of June 25, 2021 (Diversity, Equity,
Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce).  The purpose of
this order is to direct the consideration of parallel efforts with
respect to Federal procurement.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 2.  Economy, Efficiency,
and Effectiveness in Federal Procurement.  </span>Consistent with
applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations, the
Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, in consultation with the
Secretary of Labor and the heads of other executive departments and
agencies as appropriate, shall consider issuing proposed rules to
promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in Federal procurement by
enhancing pay equity and transparency for job applicants and employees
of Federal contractors and subcontractors.  In doing so, the Federal
Acquisition Regulatory Council shall specifically consider whether any
such rules should limit or prohibit Federal contractors and
subcontractors from seeking and considering information about job
applicants’ and employees’ existing or past compensation when making
employment decisions.  The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall
also consider the inclusion of appropriate accountability measures in
any such rules.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 3.  General Provisions.
 </span>(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or
otherwise affect:

(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

    March 15, 2022.
