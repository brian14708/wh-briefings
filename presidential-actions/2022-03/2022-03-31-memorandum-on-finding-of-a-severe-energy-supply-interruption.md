MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF ENERGY  
   
SUBJECT:        Finding of a Severe Energy Supply Interruption

The Russian Federation’s unjustified, unprovoked, and unconscionable war
against Ukraine, including its further invasion in violation of
international law and its ongoing destructive military campaign across
Ukraine, has had a profound impact on global oil markets.  On March 1,
2022, the International Energy Agency Governing Board agreed to a
collective release of petroleum reserves and the United States committed
to a drawdown and sale of 30 million barrels from the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve.  Since that time, the Russian Federation has
escalated its attacks across broad swaths of Ukrainian territory and has
devastated the civilian population.  The United States and its allies
have imposed sanctions on the Russian Federation’s economy and financial
system.  Public recognition of the gravity of the Russian Federation’s
actions has precipitated a significant reduction in international
economic engagement with Russian businesses, including with respect to
transactions not currently subject to sanctions.  
  
Based on information from and advice of the Secretary of Energy
(Secretary) and on other information, I find and determine, in
accordance with section 161(d) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act
(EPCA), 42 U.S.C. 6241(d), that a drawdown and sale of petroleum from
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is required by a severe energy
supply interruption, as defined in 42 U.S.C. 6202(8), on the basis that
there is a national energy supply shortage that:  
  
     (A)  is, or is likely to be, of significant scope and duration, and
of an emergency nature;  
  
     (B)  may cause major adverse impact on national safety or the
national economy; and  
  
     (C)  results, or is likely to result, from an interruption in the
supply of imported petroleum products.  
  
For these reasons, the Secretary is authorized and directed to draw down
and sell petroleum from the SPR at public sale to the highest qualified
bidder at a rate the Secretary may determine, in accordance with section
161 of EPCA and the SPR competitive sales procedures in 10 CFR Part
625.  If the Secretary determines the circumstances leading to this
finding no longer support initiation or continuation of a drawdown and
sale of petroleum from the SPR, the Secretary is authorized to cancel in
whole or in part any offer to sell petroleum as a part of any drawdown
and sale pursuant to this finding.   

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
