  \ the Emergency Authority Relating to the Regulation of the Anchorage and Movement\

    On April 21, 2022, by Proclamation 10371, I declared a national
emergency by reason of a disturbance or threatened disturbance of
international relations of the United States and authorized the
Secretary of Homeland Security to regulate the anchorage and movement of
Russian-affiliated vessels, pursuant to the National Emergencies Act (50
U.S.C. 1601 *et seq*.) and section 1 of title II of Public Law 65-24,
ch. 30, June 15, 1917, as amended (Magnuson Act) (46 U.S.C. 70051).

     The policies and actions of the Government of the
Russian Federation to continue the premeditated, unjustified,
unprovoked, and brutal war against Ukraine continue to constitute a
national emergency by reason of a disturbance or threatened disturbance
of international relations of the United States.  Therefore, in
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with
respect to the Russian Federation and the emergency authority
relating to the regulation of the anchorage and movement of
Russian‑affiliated vessels to United States ports set out in
Proclamation 10371.

     This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and
transmitted to the Congress.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

    April 16, 2024.
