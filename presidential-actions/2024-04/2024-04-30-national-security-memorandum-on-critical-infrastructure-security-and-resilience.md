SUBJECT:       Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience  
  
  
Critical infrastructure comprises the physical and virtual assets and
systems so vital to the Nation that their incapacity or destruction
would have a debilitating impact on national security, national economic
security, or national public health or safety.  It is diverse and
complex, and includes distributed networks, varied organizational
structures, operating models, interdependent systems, and governance
constructs.  
  
The United States is in the midst of a generational investment in the
Nation’s infrastructure.  This investment, and the emergence of new
technologies, presents an opportunity to build for the future.  In the
21st century, the United States will rely on new sources of energy,
modes of transportation, and an increasingly interconnected and
interdependent economy.  This modernization effort will ensure critical
infrastructure provides a strong and innovative economy, protects
American families, and enhances our collective resilience to disasters
before they happen — creating a resilient Nation for generations to
come.  
  
The United States also faces an era of strategic competition with
nation-state actors who target American critical infrastructure and
tolerate or enable malicious actions conducted by non-state actors.
 Adversaries target our critical infrastructure using licit and illicit
means.  In the event of crisis or conflict, the Nation’s adversaries
will also likely increase their efforts to compromise critical
infrastructure to undermine the will of the American public and
jeopardize the projection of United States military power. The growing
impact of climate change, including changes to the frequency and
intensity of natural hazards, as well as scarcities; supply chain
shocks; and the potential for instability, conflict, or mass
displacement places further strain on the assets and systems that
Americans depend upon to live and do business.  
  
This memorandum advances our national unity of effort to strengthen and
maintain secure, functioning, and resilient critical infrastructure.  
  
**<u>Policy Principles and Objectives</u>**  
  
It is the policy of the United States to strengthen the security and
resilience of its critical infrastructure, consistent with the following
principles:

1.  Shared Responsibility.  Safeguarding critical infrastructure is a
    responsibility shared by Federal, State, local, Tribal, and
    territorial entities, and the public or private owners and operators
    of critical infrastructure (owners and operators).  All stakeholders
    have unique roles to contribute to the national unity of effort. 
    Public‑private collaboration is vital to this effort.
2.  Risk-Based Approach.  Advancing critical infrastructure security and
    resilience requires a risk-based approach.  The prioritization of
    national efforts must be informed by the relationship between
    specific infrastructure and national security (including national
    defense), national economic security, national public health or
    safety, and the Federal Government’s ability to perform essential
    functions and services.  Risk assessments must consider all threats
    and hazards, likelihood, vulnerabilities, and consequences,
    including shocks and stressors — as well as the scope and scale of
    dependencies within and across critical infrastructure sectors,
    immediate and long-term consequences, and cascading effects.  Owners
    and operators are uniquely positioned to manage risks to their
    individual operations and assets, including their interdependencies
    with other entities and sectors.
3.  Minimum Requirements.  Federal, State, local, Tribal, and
    territorial regulatory and oversight entities have a responsibility
    to prioritize establishing and implementing minimum requirements for
    risk management, including those requirements that address
    sector-specific and cross-sector risks.  These requirements should
    also leverage existing guidance where applicable.  Regulatory
    frameworks should be risk- and performance-based when feasible;
    informed by existing requirements, standards, and guidelines;
    aligned to reduce unnecessary duplication; complementary to
    voluntary public-private collaboration; and scalable and adaptable
    to an evolving risk environment.  Requiring and enforcing minimum
    resilience and security requirements and recommendations that direct
    building resilience into critical infrastructure assets and systems
    upfront, and by-design, shall be a primary responsibility of the
    Federal Government.
4.  Accountability.  Robust accountability and enforcement mechanisms
    from Federal, State, local, Tribal, territorial, and private sector
    entities, as well as independent third parties, are an essential
    component of effective risk management for critical infrastructure. 
    Accountability mechanisms should continuously evolve to keep pace
    with the Nation’s risk environment.
5.  Information Exchange.  The appropriate sharing of timely, actionable
    information, which may include relevant classified and unclassified
    intelligence and law enforcement sensitive information, among
    Federal, State, local, Tribal, and territorial entities; owners and
    operators; and other relevant stakeholders, is essential for
    effective risk management.  The Federal Government will support a
    robust information sharing environment and public-private
    cooperation that enables actions and outcomes that reduce risk.
6.  Expertise and Technical Resources.  The Federal Government will
    leverage expertise and technical resources from all relevant Federal
    departments and agencies to mature the capacity and capability of
    each federally led effort to manage sector‑specific risk under the
    umbrella of the national effort to secure United States critical
    infrastructure.  A primary objective of this effort will be to
    create a consistent experience for owners and operators; State,
    local, Tribal, and territorial governments; and other essential
    stakeholders who collaborate with the Federal Government.
7.  International Engagement.  Recognizing the global interconnectedness
    and interdependencies of critical infrastructure, the Federal
    Government will work closely with international partners to
    strengthen the security and resilience of the international critical
    infrastructure on which the United States depends.
8.  Policy Alignment.  Efforts to safeguard critical infrastructure will
    be fully integrated and coordinated with complementary Federal
    policies and frameworks, including domestic incident management and
    national preparedness; national continuity, including Federal
    Mission Resilience; and counterterrorism, counterintelligence,
    cybersecurity, and other threat-, hazard-, or sector-specific
    policies and frameworks.

It is the objective of the United States under this national effort to:

1.  Refine and clarify the roles and responsibilities of the Federal
    Government for critical infrastructure security, resilience, and
    risk management.
2.  Identify and prioritize critical infrastructure security and
    resilience based on risk and implement a coordinated national
    approach to assess and manage sector-specific and cross-sector risk.
3.  Establish minimum requirements and accountability mechanisms for the
    security and resilience of critical infrastructure, including
    through aligned and effective regulatory frameworks.
4.  Leverage Federal Government agreements, including grants, loans, and
    procurement processes**,** to require or encourage owners and
    operators to meet or exceed minimum security and resilience
    requirements.
5.  Enhance and improve the quality of intelligence collection and
    analysis pertaining to threats to critical infrastructure.
6.  Improve the real-time sharing of timely, actionable intelligence and
    information at the lowest possible classification level among
    Federal, State, local, Tribal, territorial, private sector, and
    international partners to facilitate risk mitigation to critical
    infrastructure.
7.  Promote timely and cost-effective investments in technologies and
    solutions that mitigate risk from evolving threats and hazards to
    critical infrastructure.
8.  Strengthen the security and resilience of critical infrastructure by
    engaging international partners and allies to build situational
    awareness and capacity, facilitate operational collaboration,
    promote effective infrastructure risk management globally, and
    develop and promote international security and resilience
    recommendations.

Federal departments and agencies shall implement this memorandum in a
manner consistent with applicable law; Presidential directives; and
Federal regulations, including those protecting privacy, civil rights,
and civil liberties.  
  
**<u>Roles and Responsibilities</u>**  
  
The Federal Government relies on the specialized authorities,
capabilities, and expertise of Federal departments and agencies to
ensure an effective, whole-of-government effort to secure critical
infrastructure.  Under this effort, the Secretary of Homeland Security
shall provide strategic guidance and coordinate Federal cross-sector
risk management and resilience activities.  Sector Risk Management
Agencies (SRMAs) shall serve as day-to-day Federal interfaces for their
designated critical infrastructure sector and conduct sector-specific
risk management and resilience activities.  Elements of the Intelligence
Community (IC) and law enforcement, regulatory, and other Federal
departments and agencies also play key roles in increasing the security
and resilience of critical infrastructure, including responding to all
threats and hazards that may affect critical infrastructure.  
  
Close and continuous coordination among the Department of Homeland
Security (DHS), SRMAs, and other relevant Federal departments and
agencies, to include law enforcement and the IC, is essential to
ensuring a national unity of effort and accomplishing the objectives of
this memorandum.  The Federal Government also seeks to encourage and
enable strong collaboration with owners and operators; State, local,
Tribal, and territorial governments; international partners; and other
entities.  While most of the Nation’s critical infrastructure is owned
and operated by non-Federal entities, which are primarily responsible
for individual assets’ security and resilience, both Government and the
private sector have a mutual responsibility and incentive to reduce the
risk to critical infrastructure.  
  
Secretary of Homeland Security  
  
The Secretary of Homeland Security shall coordinate the national effort
to enhance the security and resilience of United States critical
infrastructure and provide strategic guidance on this national effort,
based on national priorities and sector-specific or cross-sector risk
assessments and plans, including through the National Infrastructure
Risk Management Plan (National Plan), as required by statute.  The
Secretary of Homeland Security shall maintain situational awareness
about emerging trends, imminent threats, vulnerabilities, and the
consequences of incidents that could jeopardize the security and
resilience of critical infrastructure.  The Secretary of Homeland
Security shall make recommendations to the President, in coordination
with SRMAs and other relevant departments and agencies, on the list of
designated critical infrastructure sectors, subsectors, and SRMAs —
prioritizing critical infrastructure for national security and
resilience efforts.  
  
The Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of the
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) as the National
Coordinator for the Security and Resilience of Critical Infrastructure
(National Coordinator), shall, in coordination with SRMAs and other
Federal departments and agencies:

1.  Coordinate with SRMAs to fulfill their roles and responsibilities to
    implement national priorities consistent with strategic guidance and
    the National Plan and continuously strengthen a unified approach to
    critical infrastructure security and resilience;
2.  Assess progress against national priorities and national resilience
    and support efforts that measure and enhance the strength of
    critical infrastructure sectors and partnerships;
3.  Identify and assess sector and cross-sector risk, analyze the
    dependencies among assets and systems that comprise critical
    infrastructure, and consider key interdependencies of potential
    sector and cross-sector consequences associated with physical and
    cyber threats and vulnerabilities to support critical infrastructure
    risk management and prioritization;
4.  Assess sector and SRMA designations to inform recommendations to the
    President;
5.  Recommend measures to protect the critical infrastructure of the
    United States; and
6.  Identify security and resilience functions that are necessary for
    effective public-private engagement with all critical infrastructure
    sectors.

           To provide expertise in support of national critical
infrastructure security and resilience efforts, the Director of CISA, in
coordination with SRMAs and, as appropriate, other relevant agencies,
shall also:

1.  Provide capabilities and resources, such as cybersecurity expertise,
    risk assessments, and other services, to support SRMAs and national
    critical infrastructure security and resilience efforts;
2.  Develop plans and enable integrated actions for cyber defense
    campaigns at scale and to otherwise mitigate risks to critical
    infrastructure nationally;
3.  Engage international partners to enhance the security and resilience
    of critical infrastructure globally; and
4.  Provide technical and operational assistance, best practices based
    on existing standards and guidance to the greatest extent possible,
    and capacity development to State, local, Tribal, and territorial
    governments; other Federal entities; owners and operators; and
    international partners to enhance the security and resilience of
    critical infrastructure.

Other Department of Homeland Security Activities  
  
As reflected in statute and Presidential policy, the Secretary of
Homeland Security has responsibilities for coordinating Federal
preparedness activities and response operations in the United States,
including when critical infrastructure impacts are implicated.  The
Secretary of Homeland Security is the principal Federal official for
domestic incident management and, consistent with existing Federal law
and policy, including Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5 of
February 28, 2003 (Management of Domestic Incidents), as amended, DHS
may coordinate Federal Government resources used in the response to or
recovery from terrorist attacks, major disasters, or other emergencies,
or as otherwise requested or directed by the President.  In addition,
the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Administrator of
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), works to reduce the loss
of life and property by minimizing the impact of disasters and
protecting the Nation from all hazards.  DHS, acting through the
Director of CISA, serves as the lead Federal agency for cyber asset
response activities in accordance with Presidential Policy Directive 41
of July 26, 2016 (United States Cyber Incident Coordination) (PPD-41). 
Further, the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the
Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration and the
Commandant of the United States Coast Guard, has broad authority to
assess security risks to the Marine Transportation System and other
modes of transportation, develop security measures and regulations, and
seek or ensure compliance with those measures and regulations.  
  
Sector Risk Management Agencies  
  
Each critical infrastructure sector has unique characteristics,
operating models, and risk profiles that benefit from an identified SRMA
with institutional knowledge, specialized expertise, and established
relationships across the sector.  SRMAs help drive the national effort
to strengthen the security and resilience of critical infrastructure. 
Consistent with the statutorily defined roles and responsibilities of
SRMAs, SRMAs shall carry out the following roles and responsibilities
for their respective sectors, in coordination with DHS, including the
National Coordinator, and, as appropriate, other relevant departments
and agencies:

1.  Serve as day-to-day Federal interfaces for the prioritization and
    coordination of sector-specific activities, including the provision
    of technical expertise and assistance, serving as the Federal
    Government coordinating council chair; and participating in
    cross-sector coordinating councils.  Continually collaborate and
    communicate through regular and appropriate outreach and engagement
    mechanisms with their sector’s owners and operators, promoting the
    use of risk mitigation, to include Government-furnished capabilities
    and services for State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments;
    owners and operators; and other non-Federal entities.
2.  Lead outreach to owners and operators within their respective
    sectors on security and resilience issues, consistent with their
    available authorities.
3.  Designate the Accountable Senior Officials — Assistant Secretary

    Function, with the ability to delegate responsibilities to other
    senior leaders within their agencies. The designees will be
    responsible and accountable for the implementation and performance
    of all SRMA roles and responsibilities.
4.  Lead sector risk management within their sector and support
    cross-sector risk management, including establishing and
    implementing programs or initiatives to assist owners and operators
    and State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments with
    identifying, understanding, planning for, and mitigating risks to
    the systems, assets, or services in their respective sector.  This
    should include recommending sector‑specific measures to protect
    critical infrastructure.
5.  Identify, assess, and prioritize sector-specific risk and support
    cross-sector and national risk assessment efforts.
6.  Facilitate the identification of essential critical
    infrastructure-related workforce needs and priorities for security
    and resilience.

    with the FBI to assist in relevant law enforcement activities.
13. In accordance with applicable law and policy, Federal departments
    and agencies with regulatory authorities shall utilize regulation,
    drawing on existing voluntary consensus standards as appropriate, to
    establish minimum requirements and effective accountability
    mechanisms for the security and resilience of critical
    infrastructure.  Departments and agencies shall work to harmonize
    these efforts to the maximum extent possible through participation
    in Federal interagency working groups, such as the Cybersecurity
    Forum for Independent and Executive Branch Regulators.  Departments
    and agencies shall continue to support the development of voluntary
    consensus standards that enable critical infrastructure innovation
    to occur in a secure and resilient manner that considers the impacts
    and effects of risk.
14. Federal department and agency heads are responsible for activities
    concerning the identification, prioritization, assessment,
    remediation, and security of their respective internal critical
    infrastructure and associated infrastructure that supports mission
    essential functions.  Infrastructure supporting primary mission
    essential functions shall be addressed in the plans and execution of
    the requirements in all applicable Executive Orders, National
    Continuity Policies, strategies, and directives.
15. Consistent with applicable law and policy, Federal departments and
    agencies, regardless of designation as an SRMA, shall leverage

    mechanisms to ensure minimum security and resilience requirements
    and effective accountability mechanisms are incorporated into
    critical infrastructure-related projects that receive Federal
    funding, where determined necessary to mitigate risk by the
    administering departments or agencies.  Where applicable law limits
    the ability of Federal departments and agencies to establish minimum
    requirements through agreements, they shall provide guidance and
    recommendations for appropriate security and resilience measures
    alongside the provision of Federal funding.
18. Interagency bodies, such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in
    the United States and the Federal Acquisition Security Council, have
    specific roles in protecting and securing critical infrastructure
    through the review of foreign investment transactions, and shall
    leverage existing authorities to also address the risks to critical
    infrastructure posed by foreign investment activity, and supply
    chain reliability and illicit access to sensitive information,
    respectively.

**<u>Risk Management</u>**  
  
The Federal Government, including SRMAs, shall use a common risk-based
approach to reducing risk to critical infrastructure.  Critical
infrastructure risks can be assessed in terms of threats or hazards,
vulnerability, and consequence.  For the purposes of this effort, the
term “risk” refers to the potential for an unwanted outcome, as
determined by its likelihood and the consequences. Risk management
efforts should be prioritized based on this shared definition, which
necessitates identifying the criticality of assets and systems within
and across sectors.  
  
Asset-level Risk  
  
Critical infrastructure owners and operators have primary
responsibility, and are uniquely positioned, to manage most risks to
their operations and assets.  The policy of the Federal Government shall
be to support and guide the entities that own, operate, or otherwise
control critical infrastructure assets and systems by providing these
entities with the information, intelligence analysis, and other support,
as appropriate, to manage and mitigate asset-level risks.   
  
Nationally Significant Risk  
  
Effective risk management necessitates the Federal Government, in
coordination with owners and operators to the extent practicable,
identify, assess, prioritize, mitigate, and monitor risks that may have
a potentially debilitating impact on national security (including
national defense and continuity of Government), national economic
security, or public health or safety.  These nationally significant
risks may arise within and impact particular sectors or cut across
multiple sectors.  Federal departments and agencies have the
responsibility to identify and mitigate national-level risk through this
whole‑of‑government effort based on the roles and responsibilities
enumerated in statute, regulation, and this memorandum.  This effort
shall be led by DHS in coordination with SRMAs and supported by other
Federal departments and agencies with the necessary expertise,
resources, and regulatory authorities to support or direct risk
mitigation activity.  Federal departments and agencies shall leverage
all available resources, capabilities, and authorities — including
regulatory authorities — to ensure owners and operators implement risk
mitigation measures that limit national-level risks.  This work shall be
coordinated by the National Coordinator, in consultation with the
National Security Council staff and the National Cyber Director, as
appropriate.   
  
Sector Risk  
  
Certain risks that rise to national concern are common to entities
within a particular sector.  SRMAs are responsible for day-to-day
prioritization and coordination of efforts to mitigate risks within each
sector, as part of the broader whole‑of-government effort coordinated by
DHS, including the National Coordinator, to secure United States
critical infrastructure. The Federal Government will support owners and
operators as they manage sector-level risk to individual assets and
systems.  
  
Systemic and Cross-sector Risk  
  
Critical infrastructure has grown increasingly interdependent and
interconnected due to trends in the modern economy, including
digitization and electrification.  These trends are poised to accelerate
over the coming decade due to historic Federal investments in the
modernization of the Nation’s infrastructure.  As such, risks to
individual sectors can quickly cascade into other sectors, necessitating
coordinated action to understand and mitigate risk.  
  
The National Coordinator shall actively manage systemic and cross-sector
risk by working with SRMAs, Federal departments and agencies, and
industry to identify, analyze, prioritize, and manage the most
significant risks involving multiple sectors.  To identify and manage
cross-sector risk, SRMAs shall regularly provide the National
Coordinator available data on individual assets and systems within their
respective sectors.  The National Coordinator shall aggregate and
analyze this data to improve the identification, prioritization, and
mitigation of cross-sector and national risks, and shall provide this
analysis to SRMAs to help manage sector-specific risk.  
  
Minimum Security and Resilience Requirements  
  
Effective risk management will require consistent adoption of minimum
security and resilience requirements, where possible based on
established consensus-based standards, within and across critical
infrastructure sectors.  Voluntary approaches to enhance critical
infrastructure security and resilience have meaningfully mitigated risk
over the past decade, but more must be done to ensure the Nation’s
critical infrastructure is secure and resilient against all threats and
hazards.  The Federal Government must focus on increasing the adoption
of requirements that address sector, national, and cross-sector risks to
critical infrastructure.  
  
DHS, including the National Coordinator, SRMAs, and, as appropriate,
regulators, shall coordinate to produce cross-sector and sector-specific
guidance, performance goals and metrics, and requirements, consistent
with their authorities, to adequately mitigate risk.  SRMAs, in
coordination with regulators, as appropriate and consistent with their
authorities, shall develop sector-specific minimum security and
resilience requirements for each respective sector, as necessary, and a
plan to use existing authorities or other tools to effectively implement
those requirements.  SRMAs shall support the development of
sector-specific performance goals in accordance with National Security
Memorandum 5 of July 28, 2021 (Improving Cybersecurity for Critical
Infrastructure Control Systems).  
  
The National Coordinator shall review proposed sector-specific security
and resilience guidance, performance goals, and requirements in
coordination with SRMAs, and in consultation with regulators, to
facilitate the harmonization of these directives and recommendations at
the national and cross-sector level.  The National Coordinator shall
also provide input into the development of these requirements and
recommendations to ensure they address cross-sector and national-level
risk, while integrating voluntary standards and mandatory requirements
into overall risk management plans and helping to prevent the
promulgation of conflicting directives or requirements across sectors. 
In accordance with the National Cybersecurity Strategy, the National
Cyber Director, in coordination with the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget, shall lead my Administration’s efforts for
cybersecurity regulatory harmonization with respect to security and
resilience requirements, of which portions of the effort outlined in
this memorandum are an essential component.  
  
Operational Collaboration  
  
To further drive down the Nation’s risk, the Federal Government must
improve its ability to collaborate directly with those partners who have
the means and capability to take actions that mitigate vulnerabilities,
respond to incidents, and build resilience at scale.  This will
complement individual owners and operators’ risk mitigation efforts. 
The Federal Government will collaborate with private-sector partners;
State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments; community
organizations; and international partners who can take actions that
provide resilience and security benefits to owners and operators in the
United States and in other countries.  
  
**<u>National Infrastructure Risk Management Plan</u>**  
  
The Secretary of Homeland Security shall develop and submit to the
President on a recurring basis every 2 years a National Infrastructure
Risk Management Plan (National Plan), which shall be informed by:  (1)
individual sector‑specific risk assessments and risk management plans;
and (2) a cross-sector risk assessment.   
  
Sector-specific Components  
  
Each SRMA shall develop sector-specific risk assessments and
sector-specific risk management plans based on strategic direction
provided by the Secretary of Homeland Security, or as prescribed in
another National Security Memorandum.

-   Sector-specific Risk Assessment:  Unless otherwise defined in
    another National Security Memorandum, each SRMA shall, on a biennial
    basis, and in consultation with their sector coordinating councils,
    identify the most significant critical infrastructure risks to their
    sector, including key cross-sector risks and interdependencies. 
    This review shall be based on appropriate Federal, State, local,
    Tribal, and territorial government-level data and analysis,
    enforcement actions, and guidance, as well as information from
    relevant private sector partners, regulators, intelligence analysts,
    and law enforcement professionals.  The risk assessment shall use
    all available information and intelligence to identify the risks
    presented by the current threat environment to critical
    infrastructure within the covered sector. 
-   Sector-specific Risk Management Plan**: ** Each SRMA shall, on a
    biennial basis, develop or refresh, in consultation with their
    sector coordinating councils, a sector-specific risk management plan
    to leverage both individual SRMA tools and authorities, as well as
    other Federal tools and authorities, to safeguard critical
    infrastructure in their sector from all threats and hazards.  The
    plan will take into account national-level priorities and guidance
    from the Secretary of Homeland Security, as well as other changes in
    the critical infrastructure risk environment and any deficiencies in
    the sector’s current risk management approach.  The sector-specific
    plan shall also prioritize specific risks and establish
    corresponding lines of effort that affect resourcing decisions to
    mitigate risk to critical infrastructure.  The plan is intended to
    prioritize threats based on the sector-specific risk assessment. 
    These efforts shall include:
-   A proposal for any necessary authorities to ensure the Federal
    Government can incentivize and compel the owners and operators to
    adequately address sector-level risk from all threats and hazards,
    including: 
-   The identification, harmonization, or development of recommended,
    sector-specific minimum security and resilience requirements,
    consistent with their authorities, for each respective sector based
    on national and cross-sector security and resilience requirements —
    and a plan to use existing tools and authorities to implement those
    requirements across the sector.  SRMAs shall coordinate with
    relevant regulators on the adoption of regulations that promote the
    implementation of these minimum requirements concurrently with the
    submission of the National Plan to the President.  Where existing
    authorities are not sufficient, SRMAs shall develop a proposal to
    request new authorities from the Congress, in coordination with the
    Office of Management and Budget, the National Security Council, and,
    to the extent such authorities pertain to cybersecurity, the Office
    of the National Cyber Director.
-   Prioritized lines of effort the SRMA plans to undertake over the
    next 2 years to mitigate risk to critical infrastructure in their
    sector, including:  efforts to collaborate with law enforcement;
    State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments; and other
    domestic or international partners.
-   A plan to leverage technological innovation to stay ahead of
    evolving trends, including coordination on research and development
    with relevant Federal laboratories.
-   A description of each respective sector’s information sharing
    strategy.
-   A set of objective measures of success that track the overall
    security and resilience of the sector and critical assets or systems
    within the sector.
-   For the second biennial National Plan and each one thereafter, an
    assessment of progress made over the prior 2 years in implementing
    the previous sector-specific risk management plan. 

Sector risk assessments previously directed by statute or executive
action will be integrated with the sector-specific risk assessments
outlined in this memorandum whenever practical.  This integration
improves cross-sector security and resilience planning.  The National
Coordinator and SRMAs will coordinate to synchronize the reporting cycle
of risk reporting to improve efficiency and reduce duplication of
effort.  Government-specific portions of the sector-specific risk
assessments should also be shared with the GSA.  
  
Cross-sector Risk Assessment  
  
The National Coordinator shall develop a cross-sector risk assessment in
coordination with SRMAs, and share this assessment with SRMAs.

-   The cross-sector risk assessment shall identify the most significant
    cross-sector risks to United States critical infrastructure.  This
    review shall be based on Federal and State-level data and analysis,
    enforcement actions, and guidance, as well as interviews with
    relevant private sector partners, SRMA staff, regulators,
    intelligence analysts, and law enforcement professionals. The
    cross‑sector risk assessment shall use all available information and
    intelligence to identify the risks presented by the current threat
    environment to critical infrastructure, with a focus on cross-sector
    risk.  This cross-sector risk assessment will identify risks that
    span across sectors, including where multiple sectors depend on the
    same materials or technologies, as well as risks with consequences
    that cascade across sectors that may be difficult to identify or
    assess without the cross-sector understanding.

National Infrastructure Risk Management Plan  
  
Based on the sector-specific risk assessments and risk management plans
and the cross-sector risk assessment, the Secretary of Homeland Security
shall develop and submit to the President, through the Assistant to the
President and Homeland Security Advisor, the National Plan to guide the
Federal effort to mitigate cross-sector and other national risks to
critical infrastructure.  
  
This forward-looking National Plan shall identify avenues to leverage
all available Federal tools, resources, and authorities to limit
national-level risks, including those cascading across sectors of
critical infrastructure.  The National Plan shall also prioritize
specific cross-sector risks, with a focus on new and emerging threats to
critical infrastructure, and shall identify innovative approaches to
limit the risks from these new and emerging threats, particularly risk
mitigation strategies for increasingly interdependent and interconnected
assets and systems.  This document shall be the Federal Government’s
comprehensive plan to mitigate and manage cross-sector risk —
identifying and funding sensible mitigation actions and investments
across sectors, as well as continuously identifying for interagency
policymakers the gaps and limitations in existing Federal tools or
authorities to address the rapidly changing threat and hazard
landscape.  The National Plan shall also contain:

-   Proposed long-term mitigation activities based on sector-specific
    and cross-sector risk assessments to incorporate
    resilience-by-design approaches that enhance the ability of critical
    infrastructure to prepare for, adapt to, and recover from changing
    conditions presented by new and emerging threats and hazards.
-   The identification, harmonization, and development of recommended
    national and cross-sector minimum security and resilience
    requirements to mitigate cross-sector risks not covered under
    sector-specific requirements, and a plan to use existing tools and
    authorities to implement those requirements.  Where existing
    authorities are not sufficient to implement these minimum
    requirements, the National Coordinator shall develop a proposal to
    request new authorities from the Congress, in coordination with
    other relevant Federal departments and agencies, the Office of
    Management and Budget, the National Security Council, and, to the
    extent such authorities pertain to cybersecurity, the Office of the
    National Cyber Director.
-   A plan for harmonizing minimum security and resilience requirements
    across all sectors based on input from SRMAs and other relevant
    Federal departments and agencies.  The National Coordinator, in
    coordination with regulators, SRMAs, and other appropriate Federal
    departments and agencies, shall lead this all-hazards effort.  The
    National Cyber Director, in coordination with the Director of the
    Office of Management and Budget, shall continue to lead my
    Administration’s efforts for cybersecurity regulatory harmonization.
-   Recommendations for pilot efforts, led by SRMAs or the National
    Coordinator, to limit the risks from cross-sector reliance on new or
    emerging trends in technology, energy production, or sector-specific
    innovations that potentially increase the attack surface for
    critical infrastructure.

If the sector-specific strategies and sector-specific plans do not align
with the strategic guidance issued by the Secretary of Homeland
Security, DHS shall coordinate with SRMAs to resolve any differences,
and, as necessary, elevate disagreements to the National Security
Council staff.  
  
Systemically Important Entities  
  
The National Coordinator shall regularly identify organizations that
own, operate, or otherwise control critical infrastructure that is
prioritized based on the potential for its disruption or malfunction to
cause nationally significant and cascading negative impacts to national
security (including national defense and continuity of Government),
national economic security, or national public health or safety.  This
list of Systemically Important Entities (SIE) shall be informed by
inputs received from SRMAs and other Federal departments and agencies as
appropriate, based on their respective sector‑specific risk assessments,
the cross-sector risk assessment, and other relevant critical
infrastructure data — including submissions of specific organizations
from SRMAs for inclusion in the SIE list.  This list of SIE shall be
developed in coordination with SRMAs, and in consultation with other
relevant Federal departments and agencies and other non‑Federal
entities, as appropriate.  The list will not be made available to the
public.  
  
The SIE list shall inform prioritization of Federal activities,
including the provision of risk mitigation information and other
operational resources to non-Federal entities.  The list of SIE
developed pursuant to this memorandum, as well as any updates to the
list, will satisfy the requirement for the Secretary of Homeland
Security to develop the list described in section 9 of Executive Order
13636 of February 12, 2013 (Improving Critical Infrastructure
Cybersecurity).  Where appropriate, regulators will consider this list
when applying adequate risk management requirements.  
  
Scope of Effort  
  
Departments and agencies recognize that critical infrastructure is often
interconnected globally and shall, as applicable, consider dependencies
and interdependencies with assets, systems, and networks outside the
United States as a part of sector risk management processes. 
Departments and agencies shall also collaborate with private-sector
partners; State, local, Tribal, and territorial entities; foreign
governments; international partners; and other entities that can take
actions that provide resilience and security benefits to critical
infrastructure owners and operators in the United States and globally. 
This effort shall include supporting sector coordinating councils,
including the State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial Government
Coordinating Council.  These councils should be inclusive and include
owners and operators, their trade associations, and other industry
representatives.  
  
**<u>Intelligence Sharing and Information Exchange</u>**  
  
Critical infrastructure risk management requires those who own or
operate infrastructure to be informed of a wide range of threats that
are manmade or result from natural hazards, including by the actionable
and timely intelligence and information available on those threats or
hazards.  To establish a comprehensive, integrated threat picture for
United States critical infrastructure, the DNI shall lead IC efforts, in
consultation with DHS, including the National Coordinator, SRMAs, and
relevant departments and agencies, to:

1.  Use applicable tools and authorities to collect, integrate, analyze,
    and share information from intelligence reporting, data, and
    assessments to understand and identify threats to critical
    infrastructure.  This shall include prioritizing the issuance of
    intelligence reports and analysis on such threats at the lowest
    possible classification level, consistent with the protection of
    sources and methods, such as through the robust use of tearlines,
    and, in coordination with SRMAs, disseminating intelligence reports
    in an accessible, useable, and shareable format for State, local,
    Tribal, and territorial governments, and owners and operators.
2.  Leverage DHS and SRMA Priority Intelligence Requirements to inform
    collection and intelligence assessments related to threats to
    critical infrastructure in accordance with National Security
    Memorandum 12 of July 12, 2022 (The President’s Intelligence
    Priorities), or any successor document, and the associated National
    Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF).
3.  Coordinate with DHS, SRMAs, and other relevant Federal departments
    and agencies; State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments; and
    the private sector to enhance stakeholder and IC understanding of
    relevant threats to critical infrastructure and, where appropriate,
    integrate sector risk perspectives into IC analysis.
4.  Produce, receive, integrate, and share information, to include
    information from intelligence assessments and warnings, that enables
    Federal department or agency leadership to consider the widest
    possible options for mitigating a risk or addressing a threat,
    including the coordinated balancing of national interests,
    stakeholder equities, and authorities.
5.  Share information with regulatory agencies, as appropriate,
    regarding threats to critical infrastructure to ensure they are
    aware of such threats, consistent with the protection of sources,
    methods, and investigations.
6.  In coordination with DHS and DOJ, the DNI shall establish a process
    to ensure that IC elements provide, to the maximum extent possible,
    timely notification to appropriate Federal elements, including the
    FBI, CISA, and relevant SRMAs, when IC elements are aware of
    specific and credible threats to United States critical
    infrastructure.  This process shall be implemented in a manner
    consistent with the protection of sources and methods;
    investigations; Executive Order 12333 of December 4, 1981 (United
    States Intelligence Activities); Executive Order 13636; applicable
    IC directives (including ICD-191); and authorities of the IC and its
    elements, as well as DHS, including title 6 and title 50 of the
    United States Code.  Federal agencies receiving such information
    from the IC shall, to the maximum extent possible and in a manner
    consistent with applicable agency authorities and investigative
    equities, promptly convey threat warnings to the targeted entities.

All departments and agencies, including the IC, shall coordinate with
the National Coordinator and SRMAs designated in this memorandum, as
appropriate, on outreach to entities within SRMAs’ respective sectors to
inform sector and cross-sector risk management and convey threat
warnings.  Collection and analysis of threats to critical infrastructure
shall be informed by the President’s Intelligence Priorities Framework
and further prioritized and coordinated through the NIPF.  
  
CISA shall also facilitate and share information and analysis to support
Federal, State, local, Tribal, territorial, and private sector entities
actions against all threats and hazards to critical infrastructure,
including as the Federal civilian interface for the multi-directional
and cross-sector sharing of information, particularly information
related to cyber threat indicators, defensive measures, and
cybersecurity risks.  The SRMAs shall also share and receive information
directly from owners and operators in their respective sectors. 
Information or intelligence shared with the self-organized and
self-governed councils — commonly referred to as sector coordinating
councils — comprised of a sector’s owners and operators, trade
associations, and other industry representatives, should be shared
through or in coordination with a sector’s respective SRMA.  
  
Departments and agencies shall abide by all pertinent legal and policy
procedures and use all appropriate legal and policy mechanisms to
protect proprietary and sensitive commercial and business information,
as well as sensitive intelligence sources, methods, and activities.  
  
**<u>Designated Critical Infrastructure Sectors and SRMAs</u>**  
  
This memorandum identifies 16 critical infrastructure sectors and
designates associated SRMAs.  In some cases, co-SRMAs are designated
where multiple departments share the roles and responsibilities of the
SRMA.  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall periodically evaluate
the need for and approve changes to critical infrastructure sectors, and
shall make recommendations to the President in accordance with statute
and in consultation with the Assistant to the President and Homeland
Security Advisor.  The sectors and SRMAs are as follows:

**<u>Implementation of This Memorandum  
</u>**  
Except where otherwise directed by existing National Security Memoranda
or Executive Orders: 

1.  Within 30 days of the date of this memorandum, SRMAs shall identify
    a senior leader who will serve as the primary representative to
    sectoral stakeholders for each respective sector and the day-to-day
    Coordinator of the SRMA Function. 
2.  Within 45 days of the date of this memorandum, the Secretary of
    Homeland Security shall issue strategic guidance that provides
    national-level priorities and a format that SRMAs shall use in the
    development of their sector-specific risk assessments and
    sector-specific risk management plans.
3.  Within 180 days of the date of this memorandum, SRMAs, in
    coordination with the National Coordinator, shall develop plans to
    execute the required roles and responsibilities of each SRMA to
    ensure a continuity of effort and the coordination of policy and
    resourcing requirements.  The plans should detail how the identified
    senior leaders will have the sufficient expertise, support capacity,
    and access to resources to consistently execute the roles and
    responsibilities of an SRMA.  Plans should include potential
    colocation options; an assessment of the current structure; detailee
    arrangements between DHS, SRMAs, and the IC; and other potential
    maturity models.  The National Coordinator, SRMAs, and other Federal
    departments and agencies shall, as appropriate, also establish
    personnel exchanges via Memoranda of Understanding in order to
    develop subject matter expertise, interagency familiarity, and
    routine cross-pollination.
4.  Within 1 year of the date of this memorandum, DHS, through CISA,
    shall officially establish or designate an office of the National
    Coordinator to serve as the single coordination point for SRMAs
    across the Federal Government.  This office shall be distinct from
    the elements of CISA that carry out its SRMA functions and shall
    work with SRMAs to perform the duties of the National Coordinator,
    including managing the production of cross-cutting assessments,
    guidance, recommendations, and other priorities related to areas of
    significant cross-sector risk such as climate change, and DCI.  It
    shall also manage the process to identify and support systemically
    important entities.  This office shall also support SRMAs, as they
    work to execute the roles and responsibilities outlined in this
    memorandum, using DHS resources and authorities to help execute
    identified activities and achieve sector-level performance
    objectives, as appropriate.  To the extent practicable, SRMAs will
    consider detailing sector-specific experts to this office for
    limited periods of time to enhance the national unity of effort. 
    Alternatively, the National Coordinator will consider detailing
    representatives to SRMAs.
5.  Within 270 days of the date of this memorandum, and on a recurring
    basis biennially by February 1 of each year, each SRMA shall submit
    its sector-specific risk management plan to the Secretary of
    Homeland Security, based on guidance developed by DHS, through their
    Secretary or Agency Head.  The plan shall be informed by the
    sector-specific risk assessment included as an annex.  Each SRMA
    shall conduct a preliminary interim sector‑specific risk assessment
    for the initial 270-day deliverable, and, on a biennial basis
    thereafter, a more complete and robust risk assessment.  For the
    first sector-specific risk assessment and risk management plan
    cycle, draft sector-specific risk assessments will be provided to
    the National Coordinator within 180 days of the date of this
    memorandum to inform the first cross-sector risk assessment.
6.  Within 1 year of the date of this memorandum, and on a recurring
    basis every 2 years thereafter by June 30 of each year, the
    Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the President and the
    Assistant to the President and Homeland Security Advisor the
    National Plan for approval.  This plan shall be informed by
    sector‑specific risk assessments and the cross-sector risk
    assessment.
7.  Within 270 days of the date of this memorandum, as a one-time
    report, SRMAs and the National Coordinator shall submit to the
    Assistant to the President and Homeland Security Advisor a review of
    the available authorities, incentives, and other tools to encourage
    and require owners and operators to implement identified
    sector-specific or cross-sector minimum security and resilience
    requirements.  This review should focus on identifying the most
    critical gaps in the Federal Government’s capacity to require and
    enforce minimum security and resilience requirements for critical
    infrastructure.  As a part of this one-time report, the National
    Coordinator and SRMAs should provide the Office of Management and
    Budget a legislative proposal for any necessary additional
    authorities or capabilities that could enable the implementation of
    these minimum security and resilience requirements for critical
    infrastructure.
8.  Within 1 year of the date of this memorandum, the Secretary of
    Homeland Security shall review the existing Critical Infrastructure
    Partnership Advisory Council framework for adequacy and make
    proposed changes.  This shall include sector coordinating council
    requirements.
9.  Within 180 days of the date of this memorandum, and thereafter
    annually by September 30 of each year, the DNI, in coordination with
    the Secretary of Defense (acting through the Under Secretary of
    Defense for Intelligence and Security), the Director of the FBI, and
    the Secretary of Homeland Security (acting through the Under
    Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis), and in consultation with
    SRMAs, shall submit to the President an intelligence assessment on
    threats to United States critical infrastructure.  The intelligence
    assessment shall be submitted to the President in classified form at
    the highest level of classification necessary to fully characterize
    the threats.  Within 90 days of the intelligence assessment’s
    publication, including the first issuance and those recurring
    annually, the DNI, in coordination with the Under Secretary of
    Defense for Intelligence and Security on behalf of the Secretary of
    Defense, the Director of the FBI, and the Secretary of Homeland
    Security (acting through the Under Secretary for Intelligence and
    Analysis), shall submit to the President a classified version of
    this assessment for release to appropriately cleared United States
    critical infrastructure owners and operators and SRMAs, and, within
    180 days of the intelligence assessment’s publication, share an
    unclassified version of the assessment with Federal, State, local,
    Tribal, territorial, and private sector partners, to the maximum
    extent possible and consistent with the protection of sources and
    methods.
10. Within 1 year of the date of this memorandum, and thereafter
    annually by June 30 of each year, the DNI, in coordination with IC
    elements, shall submit to the President a report on intelligence
    collection against threats to United States critical
    infrastructure.  The report will describe collection and reporting
    for the prior year, including (by classification level) quantity,
    quality, and collection type; identify any intelligence gaps and
    offer recommendations on how they can be remedied; and analyze the
    extent to which such collection addresses the current threat, the
    President’s Intelligence Framework, and the NIPF, noting any
    opportunities for improvement.
11. Within 18 months of the date of this memorandum, and thereafter
    annually by June 30 of each year, the DNI, in coordination with IC
    elements, shall submit to the President a report on intelligence and
    information sharing on threats to United States critical
    infrastructure with owners and operators and SRMAs.  The report will
    describe, at a strategic level, intelligence and information sharing
    for the prior year by all IC elements with those entities.  This
    will include summaries of the information sharing between each IC
    element and other departments and agencies; infrastructure
    sector(s), including owners and operators; types of content shared
    (e.g., verbal briefing, written product, such as a tearline, etc.);
    and classification levels.  The report also will identify any
    barriers to sharing and offer recommendations on how they can be
    remedied; assess the extent to which the process for reviewing
    requests for downgrades is effective and efficient; and evaluate the
    degree to which sharing in the reporting period addresses the
    requirements of this memorandum and the 2023 National Intelligence
    Strategy (or their successor documents), as well as any
    opportunities for improvement.
12. The DNI, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and SRMAs shall
    maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of United States
    Government engagements with critical infrastructure owners and
    operators by ensuring they are coordinated and deconflicted,
    consistent with agencies’ authorities, third-party agreements, and
    protection of sources and methods.  To accomplish this, the DNI and
    the Secretary of Homeland Security shall jointly develop, within 180
    days of the date of this memorandum, policies, procedures, and
    guidance to ensure, respectively, the full participation of SRMAs
    and IC elements in ensuring this outcome.  Not later than 180 days
    after the completion of these guidance documents, the DNI shall
    institute an organizational approach, to include establishing or
    designating existing IC offices or elements, for coordinating the
    tracking of its engagements and information sharing with critical
    infrastructure owners and operators, and improve centralized
    reporting on these IC engagements, consistent with the protection of
    sources and methods and third-party agreements.  The organizational
    approach should specify minimum tracking requirements, such as
    engagements with SIE, the nature of the engagement, and the date,
    and what general categories of engagements are excluded from
    tracking because of sensitivities involving sources, methods,
    contracts, third‑party agreements, and other considerations.
13. Within 12 months of the date of this memorandum, the DNI shall
    establish implementing guidance to ensure all IC elements, to the
    maximum extent possible, timely notify appropriate Federal
    departments and agencies, including the FBI, CISA, and relevant
    SRMAs, when IC elements are aware of specific and credible threats
    to United States critical infrastructure.  This process shall be
    implemented in a manner consistent with the protection of sources
    and methods; investigations; Executive Order 12333; Executive Order
    13636; applicable IC directives (including ICD-191); and authorities
    of the IC and its elements, as well as DHS.
