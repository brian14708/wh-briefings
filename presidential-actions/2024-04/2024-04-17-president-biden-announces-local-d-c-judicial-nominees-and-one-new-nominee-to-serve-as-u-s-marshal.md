The President is announcing his intent to nominate two individuals to
the District of Columbia Court of Appeals—both of whom are
extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and devoted to the rule of law
and our Constitution.

These choices also continue to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure
that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our
greatest assets as a country—both in terms of personal and professional
backgrounds.

The President has now announced five nominees to serve on the D.C. Court
of Appeals.

The President is also announcing his intent to nominate one individual
to serve as U.S. Marshal. This official will be indispensable to

the law, her professionalism, her experience and credentials, and her
dedication to pursuing equal justice for all.

The President has now announced 29 nominees to serve as U.S. Marshals.
