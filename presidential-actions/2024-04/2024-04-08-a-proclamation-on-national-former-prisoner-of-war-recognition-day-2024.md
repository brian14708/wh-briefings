title: "A Proclamation on National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day,\_2024"

    On this day, we honor the more than half a million brave patriots
who sacrificed their freedom as prisoners of war — risking their own
safety for the safety of their fellow Americans.  We recommit to
fulfilling our country’s one truly sacred obligation:  to prepare and
equip those we send into harm’s way and to care for them and their
families when they return home and when they do not.

Last September, I visited a memorial in Hanoi for my friend, former
United States Senator John McCain, who had been imprisoned there for
five and a half years when he was a Lieutenant Commander in the Navy.  I
reflected on the unfathomable conditions and pain that he and so many
others have endured as prisoners of war.  It was a solemn reminder
of the grave costs of war and the immense sacrifices American service
members are willing to make to defend our Nation.  They have always
embodied the highest expectations of our democracy — daring all and
risking all so that our country remains free and our people remain
safe.  We owe them and their families, caregivers, and survivors a debt
of gratitude we can never fully repay but will never cease trying to
fulfill.

Today, and every day, we recommit to this vow.  We honor the unbending
courage and unshakable devotion of our former prisoners of war.  We
reaffirm our commitment to bringing home all those still missing or
unaccounted for.  We pledge to keep faith in all these heroes and their
families — just as they have kept ultimate faith in our Nation.

May God bless our former prisoners of war and their families,
caregivers, and survivors — and may God protect our troops.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States
of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 9, 2024, as
National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day.  I call upon Americans
to observe this day by honoring the service and sacrifice of all former
prisoners of war as our Nation expresses its eternal gratitude for their
service.  I also call upon Federal, State, and local government
officials and organizations to observe this day with appropriate
ceremonies and activities.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-eighth.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
