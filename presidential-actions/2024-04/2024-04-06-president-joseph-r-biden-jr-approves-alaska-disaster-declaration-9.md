title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Approves Alaska Disaster\_Declaration"
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Alaska and ordered Federal assistance to
supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas
affected by a severe storm, flooding, and landslides on November 20,
2023.

Federal funding is available to state, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the severe storm, flooding, and landslides in the
Prince of Wales-Hyder Census Area, Southeast Island Regional Educational
Attendance Area, and the City and Borough of Wrangell.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Mr. Brian F. Schiller of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas. 

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.

Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance at
[www.DisasterAssistance.gov](/SHARE/FORMATS/DHS%200303/Expedited%20Requests%2003.02.21/www.DisasterAssistance.gov),
by calling 800-621-FEMA (3362), or by using the [FEMA
App](https://www.ready.gov/fema-app). Anyone using a relay service, such
as video relay service (VRS), captioned telephone service or others, can
give FEMA the number for that service.
