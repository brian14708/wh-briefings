TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:

Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency declared in Proclamation 10371 of
April 21, 2022, with respect to the Russian Federation and the emergency
authority relating to the regulation of the anchorage and movement of
Russian-affiliated vessels to United States ports, is to continue in
effect beyond April 21, 2024.

The policies and actions of the Government of the Russian Federation to
continue the premeditated, unjustified, unprovoked, and brutal war
against Ukraine continue to constitute a national emergency by reason of
a disturbance or threatened disturbance of international relations of
the United States.  Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to
continue the national emergency declared in Proclamation 10371.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

    April 16, 2024.
