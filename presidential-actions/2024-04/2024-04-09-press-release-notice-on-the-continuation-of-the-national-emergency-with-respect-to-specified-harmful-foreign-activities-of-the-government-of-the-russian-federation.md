title: "Press Release: Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect\
  \ to Specified Harmful Foreign Activities of the Government of the Russian\_Federation"
---
 
On April 15, 2021, by Executive Order 14024, I declared a national
emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act
(50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq*.) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary
threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the
United States constituted by specified harmful foreign activities of the
Government of the Russian Federation.  On March 8, 2022, I issued
Executive Order 14066 to expand the scope of the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 14024.  On August 20, 2021, March 11, 2022,
April 6, 2022, and December 22, 2023, I issued Executive Orders 14039,
14068, 14071, and 14114, respectively, to take additional steps with
respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14024.

Specified harmful foreign activities of the Government of the Russian
Federation — in particular, efforts to undermine the conduct of free and
fair democratic elections and democratic institutions in the United
States and its allies and partners; to engage in and facilitate
malicious cyber-enabled activities against the United States and its
allies and partners; to foster and use transnational corruption to
influence foreign governments; to pursue extraterritorial activities
targeting dissidents or journalists; to undermine security in countries
and regions important to United States national security; and to violate
well-established principles of international law, including respect for
the territorial integrity of states -‑ continue to pose an unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and
economy of the United States.  For this reason, the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 14024, which was expanded in scope by
Executive Order 14066, and with respect to which additional steps were
taken in Executive Orders 14039, 14068, 14071, and 14114, must continue
in effect beyond April 15, 2024.

Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national
emergency declared in Executive Order 14024.

This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and transmitted
to the Congress.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

    April 9, 2024.
