title: Jewish American Heritage Month, 2025

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  
  
A PROCLAMATION

  
  
Since the time the United States was but a coalition of villages and
settlements, America’s Jewish citizens have played an indispensable role
in our national story.  They arrived as farmers, soldiers, tailors, and
merchants, settling quickly and contributing greatly to the fields of
law, art, science, and medicine.  At crucial moments, Jewish Americans
have joined their fellow citizens in working towards America’s unique
vision of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 

  
The New World allowed those Jewish people emigrating from Europe to
freely practice their faith without persecution, for the American
experiment offered something providential — an escape from every
indignity, every abuse, and every tragedy visited upon the Jewish people
over their long history. 

  
In my proclamation declaring Jewish American Heritage Month in 2019, I
drew from the words President George Washington drafted and sent to the
Hebrew Congregation of Newport, Rhode Island, on August 18, 1790,
addressing the Jewish citizens of our new Republic.  President
Washington’s letter contained a blessing, that “the Children of the
Stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy
the good will of the other Inhabitants; while everyone shall sit in
safety under his own vine and fig tree, and there shall be none to make
him afraid.”

  
During my first 4 years as President, in the several proclamations I
issued for Jewish American Heritage Month, I often had the unfortunate
task of contrasting President Washington’s timeless blessing with
whatever violent acts of anti-Semitism had occurred in the previous
year.  Each time, it was an all too painful reminder of the fragility of
President Washington’s words.

  
Then, October 7, 2023, happened, shattering the peace, not only abroad
but also at home.  Since those horrific attacks, the Jewish community in
the United States — and around the world — has faced an incredible
trial, though one that was not unfamiliar in Jewish history.  College
campuses and city streets erupted into violence.  Blood libels were
displayed proudly at protests.  Those wearing yarmulkes were openly
assaulted in the streets.  The America that its Jewish citizens felt
that they once knew appeared to have shifted completely.

  
In his letter, President Washington championed a different vision:  “For
happily the Government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no
sanction, to persecution no assistance requires only that they who live
under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens.”

  
Since the day I resumed my duties as President — and following President
Washington’s example — my Administration has been determined to confront
anti-Semitism in all its manifestations.  I say that at home and abroad,
on college campuses and in city streets, this dangerous return of
anti-Semitism — at times disguised as anti-Zionism, Holocaust denialism,
and false equivalencies of every kind — must find no quarter.

  
We proudly celebrate the history and culture of the Jewish people in
America, and we hold that President Washington’s words, though nearly
250 years old, still carry the revolutionary promise of our Republic:
 that every citizen who demeans himself as a good citizen shall sit in
safety under his own vine and fig tree — a covenant added to a
blessing.  

I believe there has never been a greater friend to the Jewish people
than my Administration.  We will never deviate from our conviction that
anti-Semitism has no place in the greatest country in the world.  As the
47th President of the United States, I will use every appropriate legal
tool at my disposal to stop anti-Semitic assaults gripping our
universities.  We will proudly stand with our friend and ally, the State
of Israel.  I will never waver in my commitment.  

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2025 as Jewish
American Heritage Month.  I call upon Americans to celebrate the
heritage and contributions of American Jews and to observe this month
with appropriate programs, activities, and ceremonies.  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
sixteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five,
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred
and forty-ninth.  
   
                               DONALD J. TRUMP
