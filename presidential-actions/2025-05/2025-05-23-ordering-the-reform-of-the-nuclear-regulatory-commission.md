title: Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
---
 
  
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  Abundant
energy is a vital national- and economic-security interest.  In
conjunction with domestic fossil fuel production, nuclear energy can
liberate America from dependence on geopolitical rivals.  It can power
not only traditional manufacturing industries but also cutting-edge,
energy-intensive industries such as artificial intelligence and quantum
computing.  
Between 1954 and 1978, the United States authorized the construction of
133 since-completed civilian nuclear reactors at 81 power plants. Since
1978, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has authorized only a
fraction of that number; of these, only two reactors have entered into
commercial operation. The NRC charges applicants by the hour to process
license applications, with prolonged timelines that maximize fees while
throttling nuclear power development. The NRC has failed to license new
reactors even as technological advances promise to make nuclear power
safer, cheaper, more adaptable, and more abundant than ever.  
This failure stems from a fundamental error:  Instead of efficiently
promoting safe, abundant nuclear energy, the NRC has instead tried to
insulate Americans from the most remote risks without appropriate regard
for the severe domestic and geopolitical costs of such risk aversion. 
The NRC utilizes safety models that posit there is no safe threshold of
radiation exposure and that harm is directly proportional to the amount
of exposure.  Those models lack sound scientific basis and produce
irrational results, such as requiring that nuclear plants protect
against radiation below naturally occurring levels.  A myopic policy of
minimizing even trivial risks ignores the reality that substitute forms
of energy production also carry risk, such as pollution with potentially
deleterious health effects.  
Recent events in Europe, such as the nationwide blackouts in Spain and
Portugal, underscore the importance of my Administration’s focus on
dispatchable power generation –including nuclear power — over
intermittent power.  Beginning today, my Administration will reform the
NRC, including its structure, personnel, regulations, and basic
operations.  In so doing, we will produce lasting American dominance in
the global nuclear energy market, create tens of thousands of
high-paying jobs, and generate American-led prosperity and resilience.  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of the United States to:  
(a)  Reestablish the United States as the global leader in nuclear
energy;  
(b)  Facilitate increased deployment of new nuclear reactor
technologies, such as Generation III+ and IV reactors, modular reactors,
and microreactors, including by lowering regulatory and cost barriers to
entry;  
(c)  Facilitate the expansion of American nuclear energy capacity from
approximately 100 GW in 2024 to 400 GW by 2050;  
(d)  Employ emerging technologies to safely accelerate the modeling,
simulation, testing, and approval of new reactor designs;  
(e)  Support the continued operation of, and facilitate appropriate
operational extensions for, the current nuclear fleet, as well as the
reactivation of prematurely shuttered or partially completed nuclear
facilities; and  
(f)  Maintain the United States’ leading reputation for nuclear
safety.  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Reforming the NRC’s
Culture</span>.  The Congress has mandated that the NRC’s “licensing and
regulation of the civilian use of radioactive materials and nuclear
energy be conducted in a manner that is efficient and does not
unnecessarily limit — (1) the civilian use of radioactive materials and
deployment of nuclear energy; or (2) the benefits of civilian use of
radioactive materials and nuclear energy technology to society.”
 Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy
Act of 2024, Public Law 118-67, sec. 501(a).  Just as the Congress
directed, the NRC’s mission shall include facilitating nuclear power
while ensuring reactor safety.  When carrying out its licensing and
related regulatory functions, the NRC shall consider the benefits of
increased availability of, and innovation in, nuclear power to our
economic and national security in addition to safety, health, and
environmental considerations.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Reforming the NRC’s
Structure</span>.  (a)  The current structure and staffing of the NRC
are misaligned with the Congress’s directive that the NRC shall not
unduly restrict the benefits of nuclear power.  The NRC shall, in
consultation with the NRC’s DOGE Team (as defined in Executive Order
14158 of January 20, 2025 (Establishing and Implementing the President’s
“Department of Government Efficiency”)), and consistent with
its governing statutes, reorganize the NRC to promote the expeditious
processing of license applications and the adoption of innovative
technology.  The NRC shall undertake reductions in force in conjunction
with this reorganization, though certain functions may increase in size
consistent with the policies in this order, including those devoted to
new reactor licensing.  The NRC shall also create a dedicated team of at
least 20 officials to draft the new regulations directed by section 5 of
this order.  
 (b)  The personnel and functions of the Advisory Committee on Reactor
Safeguards (ACRS) shall be reduced to the minimum necessary to fulfill
ACRS’s statutory obligations.  Review by ACRS of permitting and
licensing issues shall focus on issues that are truly novel or
noteworthy.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.<span style="text-decoration: underline">
5</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Reforming and
Modernizing the NRC’s Regulations</span>.  The NRC, working with its
DOGE Team, the Office of Management and Budget, and other executive
departments and agencies as appropriate, shall undertake a review and
wholesale revision of its regulations and guidance documents, and issue
notice(s) of proposed rulemaking effecting this revision within 9 months
of the date of this order.  The NRC shall issue final rules and guidance
to conclude this revision process within 18 months of the date of this
order.  In conducting this wholesale revision, the NRC shall be guided
by the policies set forth in section 2 of this order and shall in
particular:  
(a)  Establish fixed deadlines for its evaluation and approval of
licenses, license amendments, license renewals, certificates of
compliance, power uprates, license transfers, and any other activity
requested by a licensee or potential licensee, as directed under the
Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act, rather than the
nonbinding “generic milestone schedules” guidelines the NRC has already
adopted.  Those deadlines shall be enforced by fixed caps on the NRC’s
recovery of hourly fees.  The deadlines shall include:  (1) a deadline
of no more than 18 months for final decision on an application to
construct and operate a new reactor of any type, commencing with the
first required step in the regulatory process, and (2) a deadline of no
more than 1 year for final decision on an application to continue
operating an existing reactor of any type, commencing with the first
required step in the regulatory process.  The regulations should not
provide for tolling those deadlines except in instances of applicant
failure, and must allow a reasonably diligent applicant to navigate the
licensing process successfully in the time allotted.  Moreover, these
are maximum time periods; the NRC shall adopt shorter deadlines tailored
to particular reactor types or licensing pathways as appropriate.   
(b)  Adopt science-based radiation limits.  In particular, the NRC shall
reconsider reliance on the linear no-threshold (LNT) model for radiation
exposure and the “as low as reasonably achievable” standard, which is
predicated on LNT.  Those models are flawed, as discussed in section 1
of this order.  In reconsidering those limits, the NRC shall
specifically consider adopting determinate radiation limits, and in
doing so shall consult with the Department of Defense (DOD), the
Department of Energy (DOE), and the Environmental Protection Agency.  
(c)  Revise, in consultation with the Council on Environmental Quality,
NRC regulations governing NRC’s compliance with the National
Environmental Policy Act to reflect the Congress’s 2023 amendments to
that statute and the policies articulated in sections 2 and 5 of
Executive Order 14154 of January 20, 2025 (Unleashing American
Energy).   
(d) Establish an expedited pathway to approve reactor designs that the
DOD or the DOE have tested and that have demonstrated the ability to
function safely. NRC review of such designs shall focus solely on risks
that may arise from new applications permitted by NRC licensure, rather
than revisiting risks that have already been addressed in the DOE or DOD
processes.  
(e)  Establish a process for high-volume licensing of microreactors and
modular reactors, including by allowing for standardized applications
and approvals and by considering to what extent such reactors or
components thereof should be regulated through general licenses.  
(f)  Establish stringent thresholds for circumstances in which the NRC
may demand changes to reactor design once construction is underway.  
(g)  Revise the Reactor Oversight Process and reactor security rules and
requirements to reduce unnecessary burdens and be responsive to credible
risks.    
(h)  Adopt revised and, where feasible, determinate and data-backed
thresholds to ensure that reactor safety assessments focus on credible,
realistic risks.    
(i)  Reconsider the regulations governing the time period for which a
renewed license remains effective, and extend that period as appropriate
based on available technological and safety data.  
(j)  Streamline the public hearings process.  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.
 (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:  
 (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or
agency, or the head thereof; or  
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.  
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.  
(d)  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall provide funding for
publication of this order in the *Federal Register*.
