title: Delivering Most-Favored-Nation Prescription Drug Pricing to American Patients
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.
 The United States has less than five percent of the world’s population
and yet funds around three quarters of global pharmaceutical profits.
 This egregious imbalance is orchestrated through a purposeful scheme in
which drug manufacturers deeply discount their products to access
foreign markets, and subsidize that decrease through enormously high
prices in the United States.  
The United States has for too long turned its back on Americans, who
unwittingly sponsor both drug manufacturers and other countries.  These
entities today rely on price markups on American consumers, generous
public subsidies for research and development primarily through the
National Institutes of Health, and robust public financing of
prescription drug consumption through Federal and State healthcare
programs.  Drug manufacturers, rather than seeking to equalize evident
price discrimination, agree to other countries’ demands for low prices,
and simultaneously fight against the ability for public and private
payers in the United States to negotiate the best prices for patients.
 The inflated prices in the United States fuel global innovation while
foreign health systems get a free ride.  
This abuse of Americans’ generosity, who deserve low-cost
pharmaceuticals on the same terms as other developed nations, must end. 
Americans will no longer be forced to pay almost three times more for
the exact same medicines, often made in the exact same factories.  As
the largest purchaser of pharmaceuticals, Americans should get the best
deal.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  Americans
should not be forced to subsidize low-cost prescription drugs and
biologics in other developed countries, and face overcharges for the
same products in the United States.  Americans must therefore have
access to the most-favored-nation price for these products.   
My Administration will take immediate steps to end global freeloading
and, should drug manufacturers fail to offer American consumers the
most-favored-nation lowest price, my Administration will take additional
aggressive action.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Addressing Foreign Nations
Freeloading on American-Financed Innovation</span>.  The Secretary of
Commerce and the United States Trade Representative shall take all
necessary and appropriate action to ensure foreign countries are not
engaged in any act, policy, or practice that may be unreasonable or
discriminatory or that may impair United States national security and
that has the effect of forcing American patients to pay for a
disproportionate amount of global pharmaceutical research and
development, including by suppressing the price of pharmaceutical
products below fair market value in foreign countries.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Enabling Direct-to-Consumer
Sales to American Patients at the Most-Favored-Nation Price</span>.  To
the extent consistent with law, the Secretary of Health and Human
Services (Secretary) shall facilitate direct-to-consumer purchasing
programs for pharmaceutical manufacturers that sell their products to
American patients at the most-favored-nation price.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Establishing
Most-Favored-Nation Pricing</span>.  (a)  Within 30 days of the date of
this order, the Secretary shall, in coordination with the Assistant to
the President for Domestic Policy, the Administrator for the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services, and other relevant executive department
and agency (agency) officials, communicate most-favored-nation price
targets to pharmaceutical manufacturers to bring prices for American
patients in line with comparably developed nations.  
(b)  If, following the action described in subsection (a) of this
section, significant progress towards most-favored-nation pricing for
American patients is not delivered, to the extent consistent with law:  
(i)    the Secretary shall propose a rulemaking plan to impose
most-favored-nation pricing;   
(ii)   the Secretary shall consider certification to the Congress that
importation under section 804(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (FDCA) will pose no additional risk to the public’s health and
safety and result in a significant reduction in the cost of prescription
drugs to the American consumer; and if the Secretary so certifies, then
the Commissioner of Food and Drugs shall take action under section
804(j)(2)(B) of the FDCA to describe circumstances under which waivers
will be consistently granted to import prescription drugs on a
case-by-case basis from developed nations with low-cost prescription
drugs;    
(iii)  following the report issued under section 13 of Executive Order
14273 of April 15, 2025 (Lowering Drug Prices by Once Again Putting
Americans First), the Attorney General and the Chairman of the Federal
Trade Commission shall, to the extent consistent with law, undertake
enforcement action against any anti-competitive practices identified
within such report, including through use of sections 1 and 2 of the
Sherman Antitrust Act and section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act,
as appropriate;  
(iv)   the Secretary of Commerce, and the heads of other relevant
agencies as necessary, shall review and consider all necessary action
regarding the export of pharmaceutical drugs or precursor material that
may be fueling the global price discrimination;  
(v)    the Commissioner of Food and Drugs shall review and potentially
modify or revoke approvals granted for drugs, for those drugs that maybe
be unsafe, ineffective, or improperly marketed; and  
(vi)   the heads of agencies shall take all action available, in
coordination with the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, to
address global freeloading and price discrimination against American
patients.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">General
Provisions</span>.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to
impair or otherwise affect:  
(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or  
(ii.) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.  
(d)  The Department of Health and Human Services shall provide funding
for publication of this order in the *Federal Register*.
