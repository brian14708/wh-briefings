title: Establishment of the Religious Liberty Commission
---
 
  
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose and Policy</span>*.* 
It shall be the policy of the executive branch to vigorously enforce the
historic and robust protections for religious liberty enshrined in
Federal law.  The Founders envisioned a Nation in which religious voices
and views are integral to a vibrant public square and human flourishing
and in which religious people and institutions are free to practice
their faith without fear of discrimination or hostility from the
Government.  Indeed, the roots of religious liberty stretch back to the
early settlers who fled religious persecution in Europe, seeking a new
world where they could choose, follow, and practice their faith without
interference from the Government.  The principle of religious liberty
was enshrined in American law with the First Amendment to the
Constitution in 1791.  Since that time, the Constitution has protected
the fundamental right to religious liberty as Americans’ first
freedom.  
During my first term, I issued Executive Order 13798 of May 4, 2017
(Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty).  Pursuant to that order,
the Attorney General issued a memorandum for all executive departments
and agencies (agencies) titled “Federal Law Protections for Religious
Liberty” on October 6, 2017.  The Supreme Court has also continued to
vindicate the Founders’ commitment to religious liberty, including by
giving effect to the principle that religious voices should be welcomed
on an equal basis in the public square.  
In recent years, some Federal, State, and local policies have threatened
America’s unique and beautiful tradition of religious liberty.  These
policies attempt to infringe upon longstanding conscience protections,
prevent parents from sending their children to religious schools,
threaten loss of funding or denial of non-profit tax status for
faith-based entities, and single out religious groups and institutions
for exclusion from governmental programs.  Some opponents of religious
liberty would remove religion entirely from public life.  Others
characterize religious liberty as inconsistent with civil rights,
despite religions’ vital roles in the abolition of slavery; the passage
of Federal civil rights laws; and the provision of indispensable social,
educational, and health services.  
President Ronald Reagan reminded us that “freedom is never more than one
generation away from extinction.”  Americans need to be reacquainted
with our Nation’s superb experiment in religious freedom in order to
preserve it against emerging threats.  Therefore, the Federal Government
will promote citizens’ pride in our foundational history, identify
emerging threats to religious liberty, uphold Federal laws that protect
all citizens’ full participation in a pluralistic democracy, and protect
the free exercise of religion.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Establishment of the Religious
Liberty Commission</span>.  (a)  There is hereby established the
Religious Liberty Commission (Commission).  
(b)  The Commission shall function as follows:  
(i)     The Commission shall be composed of up to 14 members appointed
by the President.  Members of the Commission shall include individuals
chosen to serve as educated representatives of various sectors of
society, including the private sector, employers, educational
institutions, religious communities, and States, to offer diverse
perspectives on how the Federal Government can defend religious liberty
for all Americans.  The President shall designate a Chairman and Vice
Chairman from among the members.  The Commission shall also include the
following ex officio members or such senior officials as those members
may designate:  
                 (A)  the Attorney General;  
                 (B)  the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development;
and  
                 (C)  the Assistant to the President for Domestic
Policy.  
(ii)    Members appointed to the Commission shall serve one term ending
on July 4, 2026, which marks the 250th anniversary of American
Independence.  If the term of the Commission is extended by the
President beyond July 4, 2026, members shall be eligible for
reappointment for a 2-year term.  Members may continue to serve after
the expiration of their terms until the appointment of a successor.  
(iii) The Commission shall produce a comprehensive report on the
foundations of religious liberty in America, the impact of religious
liberty on American society, current threats to domestic religious
liberty, strategies to preserve and enhance religious liberty
protections for future generations, and programs to increase awareness
of and celebrate America’s peaceful religious pluralism. Specific topics
to be considered by the Commission under these categories shall include
the following areas: the First Amendment rights of pastors, religious
leaders, houses of worship, faith-based institutions, and religious
speakers; attacks across America on houses of worship of many religions;
debanking of religious entities; the First Amendment rights of teachers,
students, military chaplains, service members, employers, and employees;
conscience protections in the health care field and concerning vaccine
mandates; parents’ authority to direct the care, upbringing, and
education of their children, including the right to choose a religious
education; permitting time for voluntary prayer and religious
instruction at public schools; Government displays with religious
imagery; and the right of all Americans to freely exercise their faith
without fear or Government censorship or retaliation.  
 (iv)    The Commission shall advise the White House Faith Office and
the Domestic Policy Council on religious liberty policies of the United
States.  Specific activities of the Commission shall include, to the
extent permitted by law, recommending steps to secure domestic religious
liberty by executive or legislative actions as well as identifying
opportunities for the White House Faith Office to partner with the
Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom to further the
cause of religious liberty around the world.  
(v)     Members of the Commission shall serve without any compensation
for their work on the Commission.  Members of the Commission, while
engaged in the work of the Commission, may be allowed travel expenses,
including per diem in lieu of subsistence, to the extent permitted by
law for persons serving intermittently in Government service (5 U.S.C.
5701-5707), consistent with the availability of funds.  
(vi)    To advise members of the Commission:  
             (A)  An Advisory Board of Religious Leaders shall be
designated by the President and shall consist of not more than 15
members.  The Advisory Board of Religious Leaders shall be a
subcomponent of the Commission and report to the Chairman of the
Commission;   
              (B)  An Advisory Board of Lay Leaders from religious
congregations shall be designated by the President and shall consist of
not more than 15 members.  The Advisory Board of Lay Leaders shall be a
subcomponent of the Commission and report to the Chairman of the
Commission; and  
              (C)  An Advisory Board of Legal Experts shall be
designated by the President and shall consist of the Attorney General,
or the Attorney General’s designee, and not more than 10 attorneys.  The
Advisory Board of Legal Experts shall be a subcomponent of the
Commission and report to the Chairman of the Commission.  
(vii)   The Commission shall terminate on July 4, 2026, which marks the
250th anniversary of American Independence, unless extended by the
President.  
(viii)  The Department of Justice shall provide such funding and
administrative and technical support as the Commission may require, to
the extent permitted by law and as authorized by existing
appropriations.  
(ix)    Insofar as the Federal Advisory Committee Act (chapter 10 of
title 5, United States Code) may apply to the Commission or any of its
Advisory Boards, any functions of the President under that Act, except
for those in sections 1005 and 1013 of that Act, shall be performed by
the Attorney General, in accordance with the guidelines and procedures
established by the Administrator of General Services.

 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Severability</span>.  If any
provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any
agency, person, or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of
this order and the application of its provisions to any other agencies,
