title: Rescission of Useless Water Pressure Standards
---
 
MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF ENERGY  
THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR  
THE DEPUTY ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT AND DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF
LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

  
SUBJECT:       Rescission of Useless Water Pressure Standards  
  
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct:  
  
Water conservation requirements for faucets, showers, bathtubs, and
toilets — promulgated by the Department of Energy pursuant to the Energy
Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-486) — make bathroom appliances more
expensive and less functional.  “Efficiency” standards render other
American appliances like clothes washers and dishwashers less useful,
more breakable, and more expensive to repair.  The Federal Government
should not impose or enforce regulations that make taxpayers’ lives
worse.  
  
To address these unnecessary radical green agenda policies, I direct the
Secretary of Energy to consider using all lawful authority to rescind —
or, as appropriate, amend to revert to the standards required by statute
— the regulations found in 10 C.F.R. 430.32(f), relating to water and
energy use in dishwashers; 10 C.F.R. 430.32(o), relating to water use in
faucets; 10 C.F.R. 430.32(p), relating to water use in showerheads; 10
C.F.R. 430.32(q), relating to water use in water closets; 10 C.F.R.
430.32(r), relating to water use in urinals; the definitions of
“automatic clothes washer,” “clothes washer,” “dishwasher,” “faucet,”
“other clothes washer,” “semi-automatic clothes washer,” “urinal,” and
“water closet” contained in 10 C.F.R. 430.2; the residential washing
machine efficiency standards contained in 10 C.F.R. 430.32(g); and the
commercial washing machine efficiency standards contained in 10 C.F.R.
431.156.  
  
Furthermore, I direct the Secretary of Energy to publish in the *Federal
Register* a notice clarifying the Waiver of Federal Preemption of State
regulations covered by the application of “Energy Efficiency Program for
Consumer Products:  Waiver of Federal Preemption of State Regulations
Concerning the Water Use or Water Efficiency of Showerheads, Faucets,
Water Closets and Urinals,” 75 *Fed*. *Reg*. 80289 (December 22,
2010).  
  
I further direct the Secretary of Energy not to enforce any of the
regulatory provisions listed in this memorandum, pending rescission or
reversion of such provisions; the provisions of 42 U.S.C. 6295(j) and
(k); or energy and water efficiency standards for washing machines,
including the provisions in 42 U.S.C. 6295(g) and 42 U.S.C. 6313(e).  
  
Finally, I direct the Secretary of Energy and the Deputy Assistant to
the President and Director of the Office of Legislative Affairs to
jointly prepare and submit recommendations to the President, within 60
days of the date of this memorandum, through the Chair of the National
Energy Dominance Council, for the Congress to rescind, insofar as each
relates to the subject matter of this memorandum, 42 U.S.C. 6295(g),
(j), (k), and (o) and 42 U.S.C. 6313(e), or to repeal the Energy Policy
Act of 1992 in its entirety.  
  
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
