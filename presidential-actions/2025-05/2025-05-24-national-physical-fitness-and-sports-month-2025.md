title: National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, 2025

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  
   
A PROCLAMATION

During National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, we celebrate the
foundational role that physical fitness and sports play in helping us to
live longer, healthier, and more fulfilling lives.  Through sports,
fitness routines, and staying active, we have the opportunity to improve
our health, strengthen our communities, and build a brighter future for
our country. 

For far too long, our Nation has failed to prioritize the health and
well-being of the American people.  This negligence has come at a
devastating cost.  As a result, the United States lags behind other
developed countries in life expectancy, chronic disease prevention, and
overall public health outcomes.

This era of indifference ended when I took office.  I was proud to
appoint Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. as the Secretary of Health and Human
Services to urgently confront and stop this crisis.  I also established
the Make America Healthy Again Commission, tasked with ensuring
Americans have access to nutritious food choices, while addressing the
root causes of childhood chronic diseases.  With public health as a
cornerstone of my Administration, we are forging a future where the
American people are healthier and stronger than ever before.

Engagement and active participation in sports, especially among our
youth, is vital to fostering a culture of health and physical fitness. 
My Administration is committed to ensuring that our sports and
competitive spaces remain safe, free, and accessible for future
generations of Americans.  In my first term, I signed an Executive Order
to nationally expand children’s participation in sports, promoting
physical activity, fitness, and the academic and social benefits of
healthy lifestyles.  I was also proud to recently sign an Executive
Order to keep biological men out of women’s sports, ensuring our female
athletes are free to compete and excel on a level and fair playing
field.

Together, we are building a healthier and more flourishing Nation, one
that champions physical fitness and well-being, empowering every citizen
to reach their full potential and excel in all aspects of life.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2025 as National
Physical Fitness and Sports Month.  I call upon the people of the
United States to incorporate physical fitness and sports participation
into their everyday lives.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day
of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-ninth.

DONALD J. TRUMP
