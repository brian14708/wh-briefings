title: Military Spouse Day, 2025
---
 
By the President of the United States of America  
   
A Proclamation   
 

Military spouses are the heart and soul of our Armed Forces.  Their
unwavering devotion and profound influence enrich our fighting forces
and the communities in which they serve.  On Military Spouse Day, we
proudly honor the wives and husbands who embrace this noble calling.  
Every day, military spouses share their loved ones with a demanding,
no-fail mission.  Yet their own mission is no less daunting — frequent
relocations to destinations not of their choosing; heart-wrenching
separations; parenting, often alone; and career continuity within a
nomadic and uncertain life.  Their ongoing sacrifices are intrinsically
linked to family morale, readiness, and retention.  We cannot maintain
the world’s most lethal fighting force without the love, selflessness,
and support of the military spouses who navigate the unique and
challenging demands in life.  
Employment is a critical challenge.  Military spouses face a 21 percent
unemployment rate — one of the highest demographics in the country — and
a 25 percent wage gap compared to their civilian counterparts.  Frequent
relocations hinder job placements, career advancements, and tenures,
regardless of their education and experience.  During my first
Administration, we made significant strides to improve military spouse
employment by enhancing job opportunities within the Federal Government,
expanding licensure portability, and increasing remote and flexible job
options that provide continuity and financial stability for military
spouses.  Earlier this year, I issued a categorical exemption for
military spouse employees following the return-to-office directive for
Federal civilian employees, and we pledge to pursue additional
innovative solutions to help military spouses thrive.  
It takes uncommon devotion and steadfast love to stand alongside those
who wear our Nation’s uniform.  Yet, generation after generation,
military spouses stand in spite of the uncertainty, global threats,
increasing demands, long hours, and the deployments that last months or
even years.  They stand –with resilience and resolve — not in the shadow
of their loved ones in uniforms, but side by side as an invaluable
mission partner and a force multiplier integral to our national
defense.  The First Lady and I are in admiration of these volunteer
patriots, heroes, and warriors.  Military spouses have our unwavering
support, our prayers, and the respect of a grateful Nation.  
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 9, 2025, as
Military Spouse Day.  I call upon the people of the United States to
honor military spouses with appropriate ceremonies and activities.  
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
ninth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-ninth.  
   
   
   
                               DONALD J. TRUMP
