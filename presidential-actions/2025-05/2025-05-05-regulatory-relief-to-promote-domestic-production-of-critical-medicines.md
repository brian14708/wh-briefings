title: Regulatory Relief to Promote Domestic Production of Critical Medicines
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  During my
first term, my Administration took unprecedented action to improve the
well-being of the American people by restoring capacity for domestic
production of critical pharmaceutical products.  Notably, in Executive
Order 13944 of August 6, 2020 (Combating Public Health Emergencies and
Strengthening National Security By Ensuring Essential Medicines, Medical
Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs Are Made In The United States), I
directed each executive department and agency involved in the
procurement of Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and
Critical Inputs to take a variety of actions to increase their domestic
procurement of Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and
Critical Inputs, as defined in section 7 of that order, and to identify
vulnerabilities in our Nation’s supply chains for these products.
 Unfortunately, the prior administration did too little to advance these
goals.  Critical barriers and information gaps persist in establishing a
domestic, resilient, and affordable pharmaceutical supply chain for
American patients.

One key area of concern is the length of time it takes to build
pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in the United States today.  New
construction must navigate myriad Federal, State, and local requirements
ranging from building standards and zoning restrictions to environmental
protocols that together diminish the certainty needed to generate
investment for large manufacturing projects.  For pharmaceutical
manufacturing, these barriers are heightened by unannounced inspections
of domestic manufacturers by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),
which are more frequent than such inspections at international
facilities.  Industry estimates suggest that building new manufacturing
capacity for pharmaceuticals and critical inputs may take as long as 5
to 10 years, which is unacceptable from a national security standpoint.
 Even expanding existing capacity or modifying existing production lines
to produce new or different products requires extensive permitting and
regulatory approval, making it more difficult to repurpose existing
underutilized pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity available
domestically.

It is in the best interest of the Nation to eliminate regulatory
barriers to the domestic production of the medicines Americans need.  My
Administration will work to make the United States the most competitive
nation in the world for the manufacture of safe and effective
pharmaceutical products.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of the United States that the regulation of manufacturing
pharmaceutical products and inputs be streamlined to facilitate the
restoration of a robust domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing base.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Streamlining Review of
Domestic Pharmaceutical Manufacturing by the Food and Drug
Administration</span>.  Within 180 days of the date of this order, the
Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the Commissioner of Food
and Drugs (FDA Commissioner), shall review existing regulations and
guidance that pertain to the development of domestic pharmaceutical
manufacturing and shall take steps to eliminate any duplicative or
unnecessary requirements in such regulations and guidance; maximize the
timeliness and predictability of agency review; and streamline and
accelerate the development of domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing.
 The FDA Commissioner’s review shall encompass all regulations and
guidance that apply to the inspection and approval of new and expanded
manufacturing capacity, emerging technologies that enable the
manufacturing of pharmaceutical products, active pharmaceutical
ingredients, key starting materials, and associated raw materials in the
United States.  The FDA Commissioner shall:

\(a\)  evaluate the current risk-based approach to prior approval of
licensure inspections, including when such inspections are necessary,
and seek to improve upon this approach to ensure all required
inspections are prompt, efficient, and limited to what is necessary to
ensure compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and
other Federal law;

\(b\)  identify and undertake measures necessary to expand, as
practicable, existing programs that provide early technical advice
before a facility is operational;

\(c\)  identify and undertake measures necessary to improve enforcement
of data reporting under section 510(j)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360(j)(3)), including consideration of publicly
displaying the list of facilities, including foreign facilities, that
are not in compliance;

\(d\)  provide clearer guidance regarding the requirements or
recommendations for site changes, including moving production from a
foreign to domestic facility, and validation of new or updated
components necessary in manufacturing; and

\(e\)  review and, as appropriate, seek to update any other relevant
compliance policies, guidance documents, and regulations.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Enhancing Inspection of
Foreign Manufacturing Facilities</span>.  Within 90 days of the date of
this order, the FDA Commissioner shall develop and advance improvements
to the risk-based inspection regime that ensures routine reviews of
overseas manufacturing facilities involved in the supply of United
States medicines, which shall be funded by increased fees on foreign
manufacturing facilities to the extent consistent with applicable law.
 Additionally, the FDA Commissioner shall publicly disclose the annual
number of inspections that the FDA conducts on such foreign facilities,
with specific detail by country and by manufacturer. 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Streamlining Review of
Domestic Pharmaceutical Manufacturing by the Environmental Protection
Agency</span>.  Within 180 days of the date of this order, the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shall take
action to update regulations and guidance that apply to the inspection
and approval of new and expanded manufacturing capacity of
pharmaceutical products, active pharmaceutical ingredients, key starting
materials, and associated raw materials in the United States to
eliminate any duplicative or unnecessary requirements and maximize the
timeliness and predictability of agency review.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Centralized Coordination of
Environmental Permits to Expand Domestic Pharmaceutical Manufacturing
Capacity</span>.  For purposes of 42 U.S.C. 4336a, the EPA shall be the
lead agency for the permitting of pharmaceutical manufacturing
facilities that require preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C.
4321 *et seq.*, unless that role is assumed by another agency.  The lead
agency shall designate a single point of contact within the agency to
coordinate with permit applicants.  The Office of Management and Budget
shall coordinate with the lead agency and with other relevant agencies
and the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Committee, as needed, to
expedite the review and approval of relevant permits.
