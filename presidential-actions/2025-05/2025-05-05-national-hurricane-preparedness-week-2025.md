title: National Hurricane Preparedness Week, 2025

By the President of the United States of America  
  
A Proclamation 

Every year, hurricanes destroy lives, striking some of our Nation’s most
beautiful regions and leaving devastation in their wake.  National
Hurricane Preparedness Week is a time to raise awareness about the
dangers of these storms and encourage citizens in coastal areas and
inland communities to be vigilant in emergency planning and
preparation.  

Hurricanes, storm surges, and flooding can wash away homes and
properties, but the greatest threat is the loss of life, making
readiness paramount.  Those living in at-risk areas should have a family
evacuation plan and a supply of non-perishable food, water, medicine,
batteries, and other essential items.  

This August marks the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, which
caused widespread destruction and loss of life, leaving an indelible
impact on the Louisiana Delta and Mississippi Coast.  Tragically, in the
decades since, other catastrophic hurricanes — most recently Helene and
Milton — have devastated communities and shattered lives throughout our
Nation.   

In the aftermath of each storm, the intrepid American spirit emerged. 
It was evident in the professionalism and compassion of volunteers and
organizations offering aid, comfort, and temporary shelter — and in the
extraordinary resilience and strength of those left to rebuild their
lives.  I witnessed this firsthand in North Carolina after Hurricane
Helene, where I met with survivors and local leaders working tirelessly
to restore their communities.  

I remain steadfastly committed to supporting hurricane recovery efforts
and ensuring that Federal resources and tax dollars are allocated to
American citizens in need.  I signed an Executive Order giving State and
local authorities a more significant role in resilience, preparedness,
and rapid-response efforts.  Local officials have the insight to make
risk-informed decisions, deploy resources, manage operations, and
eliminate ineffective bureaucracy so we can better serve affected
communities.  

As hurricane season approaches, I urge every household to recognize the
dangers of severe weather, assess their risk, and develop a
comprehensive plan to ensure disaster preparedness.  

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 4 through May 10,
2025, as National Hurricane Preparedness Week.  I call upon Americans
living in hurricane-prone areas to safeguard their families, homes, and
businesses from the dangers of hurricanes. 

  
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of May,
in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-ninth.  
  
  
                               DONALD J. TRUMP
