title: "Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates to Reflect Discussions with the People\u2019\
  s Republic of China"

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) (IEEPA), the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq.*), section 604 of the
Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title
3, United States Code, I hereby determine and order:  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.
 In Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a
Reciprocal Tariff to Rectify Trade Practices that Contribute to Large
and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), I declared a
national emergency arising from conditions reflected in large and
persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits, and imposed additional *ad
valorem* duties that I deemed necessary and appropriate to deal with
that unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or
substantial part outside the United States, to the national security and
economy of the United States.  Section 4(b) of Executive Order 14257
provided that “\[s\]hould any trading partner retaliate against the
United States in response to this action through import duties on U.S.
exports or other measures, I may further modify the \[Harmonized Tariff
Schedule of the United States\] to increase or expand in scope the
duties imposed under this order to ensure the efficacy of this
action.”  
In Executive Order 14259 of April 8, 2025 (Amendment to Reciprocal
Tariffs and Updated Duties as Applied to Low-Value Imports From the
People’s Republic of China), and Executive Order 14266 of April 9, 2025
(Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates To Reflect Trading Partner
Retaliation and Alignment), pursuant to section 4(b) of Executive Order
14257, I ordered modifications of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the
United States (HTSUS) to raise the applicable*ad valorem* duty rate for
imports from the People’s Republic of China (PRC) established in
Executive Order 14257, in recognition of the fact that the State Council
Tariff Commission of the PRC announced that it would retaliate against
the United States in response to Executive Order 14257 and Executive
Order 14259.  
Section 4(c) of Executive Order 14257 provided that, “\[s\]hould any
trading partner take significant steps to remedy non-reciprocal trade
arrangements and align sufficiently with the United States on economic
and national security matters, I may further modify the HTSUS to
decrease or limit in scope the duties imposed under this order.”  Since
I signed Executive Order 14266, the United States has entered into
discussions with the PRC to address the lack of trade reciprocity in our
economic relationship and our resulting national and economic security
concerns.  Conducting these discussions is a significant step by the PRC
toward remedying non-reciprocal trade arrangements and addressing the
concerns of the United States relating to economic and national security
matters.

Pursuant to section 4(c) of Executive Order 14257, I have determined
that it is necessary and appropriate to address the national emergency
declared in that order by modifying the HTSUS to suspend for a period of
90 days application of the additional *ad valorem* duties imposed on the
PRC listed in Annex I to Executive Order 14257, as amended by Executive
Order 14259 and Executive Order 14266, and clarified in the Presidential
Memorandum of April 11, 2025 (Clarification of Exceptions Under
Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025, as Amended), and to instead
impose on articles of the PRC an additional *ad valorem* rate of duty as
set forth herein, pursuant to the terms of, and except as otherwise
provided in, Executive Order 14257, as modified by this order.   
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Suspension of
Country-Specific *Ad Valorem* Rate of Duty</span>.  Effective with
respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse
for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 14,
2025, all articles imported into the customs territory of the United
States from the PRC, including Hong Kong and Macau, shall be, consistent
with law, subject to an additional *ad valorem* rate of duty of
10 percent subject to all applicable exceptions set forth in Executive
Order 14257 and the Presidential Memorandum of April 11, 2025.  This *ad
valorem* rate of duty of 10 percent reflects (i) the modification of the
application of the additional *ad valorem* rate of duty on articles of
China (including articles of Hong Kong and Macau) set forth in Executive
Order 14257, by suspending 24 percentage points of that rate for an
initial period of 90 days, and the retention of the remaining *ad
valorem* rate of 10 percent on those articles pursuant to the terms of
said order; and (ii) the removal of the modified additional *ad
valorem* rates of duty on those articles imposed by Executive Order
14259 and Executive Order 14266.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline"> Tariff Modifications</span>.
 In recognition of the intentions of the PRC to facilitate addressing
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, the HTSUS
shall be modified as follows:  
Effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn
from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight
time on May 14, 2025:   
(a)  heading 9903.01.25 of the HTSUS shall be amended by deleting the
article description and by inserting “Articles the product of any
country, except for products described in headings
9903.01.26–9903.01.33, and except as provided for in heading 9903.01.34,
as provided for in subdivision (v) of U.S. note 2 to this subchapter . .
. . . . ” in lieu thereof;  
(b)  heading 9903.01.63 of the HTSUS shall be amended by deleting “125%”
each place that it appears and by inserting “34%” in lieu thereof;  
(c)  subdivision (v)(xiii)(10) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of
chapter 99 of the HTSUS shall be amended by deleting “125%”, and by
inserting “34%” in lieu thereof; and  
(d)  heading 9903.01.63 and subdivision (v)(xiii)(10) of U.S. note 2 to
subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS are hereby suspended for a

14, 2025.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 *<u>De

Decrease</span>.  To ensure that the reduction in duties pursuant to
section 2 of this order is made fully effective and the purpose of
Executive Order 14257, as amended, is not undermined, I also deem it
necessary and appropriate to:  
(a)  decrease the *ad valorem* rate of duty set forth in section 2(c)(i)
of Executive Order 14256 of April 2, 2025 (Further Amendment to Duties
Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People’s Republic of
China as Applied to Low-Value Imports), as modified by Executive Order
14259 and Executive Order 14266, from 120 percent to 54 percent;  
(b)  retain in effect the per postal item containing goods duty of 100
dollars in section 2(c)(ii) of Executive Order 14256, as modified by
Executive Order 14259 and Executive Order 14266, that has been in effect
since 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 2, 2025, unless and until
otherwise modified by a subsequent executive action, notwithstanding the
increase contemplated effective June 1, 2025, pursuant to Executive
Order 14256, as modified by Executive Order 14259 and Executive Order
14266; and  
(c)  modify the HTSUS, effective with respect to goods entered for
consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after
12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 14, 2025, as follows:  
(i)   subdivision (w) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of
the HTSUS shall be amended by deleting “120 percent”, and by inserting
“54 percent” in lieu thereof; and  
(ii)  subdivision (w) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of
the HTSUS shall be amended by deleting “, and before 12:01 a.m. eastern
daylight time on June 1, 2025.  For merchandise entered for consumption
on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on June 1, 2025, the
applicable specific duty rate is $200 per postal item containing such
goods.”

 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Implementation</span>.  The

the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the
