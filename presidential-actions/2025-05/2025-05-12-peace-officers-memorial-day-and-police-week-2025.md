title: Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, 2025
---
 
By the President of the United States of America  
   
A Proclamation   
 

On Peace Officers Memorial Day and during Police Week, we honor our
brave officers who serve on the front lines to protect our families,
safeguard our communities, and shoulder a burden of responsibility that
most Americans cannot fathom.  This week and always, we honor the
courageous men and women serving in law enforcement and memorialize
those who sacrificed their lives defending the thin blue line.   
A nation in chaos ceases to be a citadel of liberty.  Tragically, the
previous administration allowed lawlessness to permeate our country,
making it harder for our law enforcement officers to do their jobs. 
Their reckless, soft-on-crime policies emboldened criminals and thugs;
wreaked havoc on the sanctity of our homes, businesses, and public
spaces; instilled fear; and jeopardized public trust.  
As your 47th President, I am fulfilling my promise to make America safe
again by reclaiming sovereignty on the border and restoring the rule of
law in communities nationwide.  We will utilize every available means to
equip and train law enforcement, retain qualified officers, and recruit
on the basis of meritocracy.   
The oath to serve and protect comes with extraordinary risk and
sacrifice, and we are indebted to those who choose this righteous
profession.  That is why I have asked the Congress to codify my
Executive Order mandating the death penalty for the murder of a police
officer — sending an unequivocal message that barbaric acts of violence
and blatant disregard for the lives of our Nation’s heroes will not be
tolerated — and to pass a crime bill with enhanced protections for
police officers.  
I stand in steadfast solidarity with those who defend our freedoms and
the families who love and support them.  We pray for those who grieve
the fallen and pledge that their lives, legacies, and sacrifices will
forever be remembered by our grateful Nation.  
By a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962, as amended (Public Law
87-726, 76 Stat. 676), and by Public Law 105-225 (36 U.S.C. 136-137),
the President has been authorized and requested to designate May 15 of
each year as “Peace Officers Memorial Day” and the week in which it
falls as “Police Week.”  
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 2025, as Peace Officers Memorial Day
and May 11 through May 17, 2025, as Police Week.  I call upon all
Americans to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and
activities.  I also call on the Governors of the States and Territories
and officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United
States to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers
Memorial Day.  
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of May,
in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty‑five, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-ninth.

                               DONALD J. TRUMP
