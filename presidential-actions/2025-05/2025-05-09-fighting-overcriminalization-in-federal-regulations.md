title: Fighting Overcriminalization in Federal Regulations
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  The United
States is drastically overregulated.  The Code of Federal Regulations
contains over 48,000 sections, stretching over 175,000 pages — far more
than any citizen can possibly read, let alone fully understand.  Worse,
many carry potential criminal penalties for violations.  The situation
has become so dire that no one -– likely including those charged with
enforcing our criminal laws at the Department of Justice — knows how
many separate criminal offenses are contained in the Code of Federal
Regulations, with at least one source estimating hundreds of thousands
of such crimes.  Many of these regulatory crimes are “strict liability”
offenses, meaning that citizens need not have a guilty mental state to
be convicted of a crime.

This status quo is absurd and unjust.  It allows the executive branch to
write the law, in addition to executing it.  That situation can lend
itself to abuse and weaponization by providing Government officials
tools to target unwitting individuals.  It privileges large
corporations, which can afford to hire expensive legal teams to navigate
complex regulatory schemes and fence out new market entrants, over
average Americans.  

The purpose of this order is to ease the regulatory burden on everyday
Americans and ensure no American is transformed into a criminal for
violating a regulation they have no reason to know exists.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of the United States that:

(a)  Criminal enforcement of criminal regulatory offenses is disfavored.

(b)  Prosecution of criminal regulatory offenses is most appropriate for
persons who know or can be presumed to know what is prohibited or
required by the regulation and willingly choose not to comply, thereby
causing or risking substantial public harm.  Prosecutions of criminal
regulatory offenses should focus on matters where a putative defendant
is alleged to have known his conduct was unlawful.

(c)  Strict liability offenses are “generally disfavored.”  *United
States v. United States Gypsum, Co.*, 438 U.S. 422, 438 (1978).  Where
enforcement is appropriate, agencies should consider civil rather than
criminal enforcement of strict liability regulatory offenses or, if
appropriate and consistent with due process and the right to jury trial,
*see* *Jarkesy v. Securities and Exchange Commission*, 603 U.S. 109
(2024), administrative enforcement.

(d)  Agencies promulgating regulations potentially subject to criminal
enforcement should explicitly describe the conduct subject to criminal
enforcement, the authorizing statutes, and the mens rea standard
applicable to those offenses.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Definitions</span>.  For
purposes of this order:

(a)  “Agency” has the meaning given to “Executive agency” in section 105
of title 5, United States Code;

(b)  “Criminal regulatory offense” means a Federal regulation that is
enforceable by a criminal penalty; and

(c)  “Mens rea” means the state of mind that by law must be proven to
convict a particular defendant of a particular crime.  

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Report on Criminal Regulatory
Offenses</span>.  (a)  Within 365 days of the date of this order, the
head of each agency, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall
provide to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a
report containing:

\(i\)   a list of all criminal regulatory offenses enforceable by the
agency or the Department of Justice; and

(ii)  for each criminal regulatory offense identified in subsection
(a)(i) of this section, the range of potential criminal penalties for a
violation and the applicable mens rea standard for the criminal
regulatory offense.

(b)  At the same time the head of each agency provides to the Director
of OMB the report required by subsection (a) of this section, the agency
head shall publicly post the report on its agency webpage.

(c)  The head of each agency shall periodically, but not less than once
a year, update the report described in subsection (a) of this section.

(d)  Criminal enforcement of any criminal regulatory offense not
identified in the report described in subsection (a) of this section is
strongly discouraged.  The head of each agency shall consider whether a
criminal regulatory offense is included in an agency’s public report
when considering whether to make a criminal referral to the Department
of Justice or, where applicable, to the agency’s Inspector General. 
Further, the Attorney General shall consider whether a criminal
regulatory offense is included in an agency’s public report before
initiating an investigation or initiating criminal proceedings for
violating regulatory standards.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Promoting Regulatory
Transparency</span>.  (a)  Following issuance of this order, all future
notices of proposed rulemaking (NPRMs) and final rules published in the
*Federal Register*, the violation of which may constitute criminal
regulatory offenses, should include a statement identifying that the
rule or proposed rule is a criminal regulatory offense and the
authorizing statute.  Agencies should draft this statement in
consultation with the Department of Justice.

(b)  The regulatory text of all NPRMs and final rules with criminal
consequences published in the *Federal Register* after the date of this
order should explicitly state a mens rea requirement for each element of
a criminal regulatory offense, accompanied by citations to the relevant
provisions of the authorizing statute.

(c)  Strict liability criminal regulatory offenses are disfavored.  Any
proposed or final criminal regulatory offense that includes a strict
liability mens rea for the offense shall be treated as a “significant
regulatory action” and submitted to the Administrator of the Office of
Information and Regulatory Affairs for the review applicable to
significant regulatory actions under Executive Order 12866 of September
30, 1993 (Regulatory Planning and Review), or any successor process.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Default Mens Rea for Criminal
Regulatory Offenses</span>.  (a)  The head of each agency, in
consultation with the Attorney General, shall examine the agency’s
statutory authorities and determine whether there is authority to adopt
a background mens rea standard for criminal regulatory offenses that
applies unless a specific regulation states an alternative mens rea.

(b)  Within 30 days of the submission of the report described in section
4(a) of this order, the head of each agency, in consultation with the
Attorney General, shall submit a report to the Director of OMB
summarizing the information submitted under section 4(a) of this order
and assessing whether the applicable mens rea standards for criminal
regulatory offenses enforced by the agency are appropriate.  If
consistent with the statutory authorities identified pursuant to the
review described in subsection (a) of this section, the report should
present a plan for changing the applicable mens rea standards and
adopting a generally applicable background mens rea standard, and
provide a justification for each criminal regulatory offense for which
the agency proposes to deviate from its default mens rea standard.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">7</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Agency Referrals for Potential
Criminal Enforcement</span>.  Within 45 days of the date of this order,
and in consultation with the Attorney General, each agency should
publish guidance in the *Federal Register* describing its plan to
address criminally liable regulatory offenses.  Each agency’s guidance
should make clear that when the agency is deciding whether to refer
alleged violations of criminal regulatory offenses to the Department of
Justice, the agency should consider factors such as:

\(a\)  the harm or risk of harm, pecuniary or otherwise, caused by the
alleged offense;

\(b\)  the potential gain to the putative defendant that could result
from the offense;

\(c\)  whether the putative defendant held specialized knowledge,
expertise, or was licensed in an industry related to the rule or
regulation at issue; and

\(d\)  evidence, if any is available, of the putative defendant’s
general awareness of the unlawfulness of his conduct as well as his
knowledge or lack thereof of the regulation at issue.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">8</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Effect on Immigration
Enforcement and National Security Functions</span>.  Nothing in
this order shall apply to the enforcement of the immigration laws or
regulations promulgated to implement such laws, nor shall it apply
to the enforcement of laws or regulations related to national security
or defense.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">9</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. 
(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

\(i\)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or
agency, or the head thereof; or

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

\(c\)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
