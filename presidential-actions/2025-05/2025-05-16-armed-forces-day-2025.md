BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  
  
A PROCLAMATION

  
       On Armed Forces Day, we pause to honor the men and women of
America’s Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and Space
Force.  Every day, throughout our homeland and in far-flung regions of
the world, our fighting forces valiantly safeguard our liberty, defend
our border, and support global stability through humanitarian missions
and disaster relief operations.  In America’s legacy of awe-inspiring
heroes, they are without equal.

  
     As Commander in Chief, my highest responsibility is to ensure our
all-volunteer military, 2.1 million-strong, is the world’s most lethal
fighting force.  I have taken bold steps to prioritize military
excellence and readiness across every branch of service, ensuring that
all active duty, National Guard, and Reserve members who wear our
Nation’s uniform are prepared to deploy, fight, and win against any
adversary in any domain.  America’s military will soon be stronger and
more powerful than ever before.  Since November, enlistment numbers for
every branch of the Armed Forces have surged — recruitment is now the
highest it has been in 30 years. 

  
     On Armed Forces Day, we celebrate those for whom patriotism is not
a passive, lofty ideal, but a way of life that is measured by the
unyielding commitment to serve this Nation with valor, vigilance,
integrity, and devotion to duty.  It is worthy not only of a day of
recognition but also a lifetime of respect from a grateful Nation. 

  
     The First Lady joins me in saluting our service members — on land,
at sea, and in air and space — along with their devoted families, who
share in this legacy of service and sacrifice.

  
     NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States
of America and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United
States, continuing the tradition of my predecessors in office, do hereby
proclaim the third Saturday of each May as Armed Forces Day.  I invite
the Governors of the States and Territories and other areas subject to
the jurisdiction of the United States to provide for the observance of
Armed Forces Day within their jurisdiction in an appropriate manner
designed to increase public understanding and appreciation of our Armed
Forces.  I call upon all Americans to display the flag of the United
States at their homes and businesses on Armed Forces Day, and I urge
citizens to learn more about military service by attending and
participating in the local observances of the day.  
     Proclamation 10762 of May 17, 2024, is hereby superseded.

  
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day
of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-ninth.  
  
                              DONALD J. TRUMP
