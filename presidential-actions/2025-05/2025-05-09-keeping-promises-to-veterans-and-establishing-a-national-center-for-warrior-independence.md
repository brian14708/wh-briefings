title: Keeping Promises to Veterans and Establishing a National Center for Warrior
  Independence
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose and Policy</span>.  Our
Nation’s security, prosperity, and freedom would not be possible without
our veterans.  Many service members paid the ultimate sacrifice.  Many
others bear visible and invisible wounds from their service.  Too many
veterans are homeless in America.  Each veteran deserves our gratitude.

Yet the Federal Government has not always treated veterans like the
heroes they are.  During the previous administration, unaccountable
bureaucrats treated them shamefully, failing veterans when they needed
help most and betraying the taxpayers who rightfully expect better.

The story of the West Los Angeles Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center
is indicative of this failure.  More than one hundred years ago, Senator
John Percival Jones and Arcadia Bandini de Stearns Baker generously
donated hundreds of acres of land that they owned in West Los Angeles on
the condition that it be used to house disabled veterans.  The campus
once featured a chapel, billiard hall, 1,000-seat theater, and housed
about 6,000 veterans, but the Federal Government has since allowed this
crown jewel of veteran care to deteriorate over the last few decades.  

The Department of Veterans Affairs (Department) leased parts of the
property to a private school, private companies, and the baseball team
of the University of California, Los Angeles, sometimes at significantly
below-market prices.  As of 2024, there were approximately 3,000
homeless veterans in Los Angeles, more than in any other city in the
country and accounting for about 10 percent of all of America’s homeless
veterans.  Many of these heroes live in squalor in Los Angeles’s
infamous “skid row.”

During my first term, I signed legislation to increase accountability
and expand benefits and choices for veterans in accessing care, and my
second term will build on those efforts.  Accountability will return to
the Department.  Veterans around the Nation will have more choices in
care, benefits, and services.  The VA campus in West Los Angeles will
become the National Center for Warrior Independence with facilities and
resources to help our veterans earn back their self-sufficiency.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Establishing the National
Center for Warrior Independence</span>*.*  The Secretary of Veterans
Affairs (Secretary) shall take all appropriate action to:

\(a\)  designate a National Center for Warrior Independence on the West
Los Angeles VA Campus in which homeless veterans in the Los Angeles
metropolitan area and around the Nation can seek and receive the care,
benefits, and services to which they are entitled;

\(b\)  work with other municipalities and VA facilities to ensure that
homeless veterans outside the Los Angeles metropolitan area who want to
avail themselves of the National Center for Warrior Independence are
provided the means to do so;

\(c\)  in coordination with the Secretary of Health and Human Services,
the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and the heads of any
other relevant executive departments or agencies, ensure that funds that
may have been spent on housing or other services for illegal aliens are
redirected to construct, establish, and maintain this National Center
for Warrior Independence;

\(d\)  work to restore self-sufficiency and the warrior ethos among
homeless veterans through any guidance, requirements, or services needed
to ensure that homeless veterans can access housing, receive substance
abuse or addiction treatment, and return to productive work and
community engagement; and

\(e\)  within 120 days of the date of this order, present an action plan
to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic
Policy, to meet these directives and restore the capacity to house up to
6,000 homeless veterans at the National Center for Warrior Independence
by January 1, 2028.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Voucher Program</span>.  The
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall, in consultation with
the Secretary, use vouchers to support homeless veterans in the Los
Angeles metropolitan area and around the Nation with respect to this
effort.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Restoring Accountability at the
Department of Veterans Affairs</span>*.  *The Secretary shall take the
following steps to restore accountability and excellent service at the
Department:

\(a\)  take appropriate action against individuals who have committed
misconduct, making full use of and in accordance with the Department of
Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017
(Public Law 115-41); and

\(b\)  investigate and take steps to rectify the previous
administration’s decision to rehire and reinstate back pay for employees
previously fired for misconduct and direct such savings back toward
care, benefits, and services for veterans, in accordance with all
applicable laws.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Providing Choices and
Excellence to Veterans</span>.  The Secretary shall take steps to
increase the excellence of and options for care, benefits, and services
for veterans including:

\(a\)  within 60 days of the date of this order, submitting a report to
the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic
Policy, with a plan to reduce wait times for Veterans Health
Administration appointments that explores options like expanding office
hours, offering weekend appointments, and increasing the use of virtual
healthcare options;

\(b\)  within 30 days of the date of this order, directing a feasibility
study at the Manchester VA Medical Center and within 180 days of this
order, submitting to the President, through the Assistant to the
President for Domestic Policy, an action plan to expand services to
support a full-service medical center in New Hampshire so that it is no
longer the only State in the contiguous United States without such a
center; and

\(c\)  in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Director of
the Office of Management and Budget, and the Assistant to the President
for Domestic Policy, developing a strategy to improve the delivery and
quality of the Department’s healthcare services in a more efficient and
effective manner to support veterans; the strategy shall initially
prioritize implementation of actions to reduce access times and improve
service delivery, to include options for offering treatment to veterans
at select military treatment facilities and military beneficiaries at VA
facilities with appropriate reimbursement.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.

Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and

benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
