title: Establishing Project Homecoming
---
 
Over the last 4 years, the United States has endured a full-scale
invasion of aliens entering and remaining in the country illegally,
causing a relentless onslaught of crime, vagrancy, violence, and death
in countless American communities.  This lawless invasion has also
limited the capacity of American schools and hospitals to provide for
American citizens and has diverted billions of dollars in Federal,
State, and local social services from Americans in need.

The continued presence of illegal aliens in our Nation forces American
taxpayers to bear a tremendous fiscal burden to support them, including
through costs related to healthcare, food stamps, public housing,
emergency medical services, education, and shelter, as well as the costs
of crimes committed by illegal aliens.  In Fiscal Year 2023 alone, these
costs were estimated to exceed $150 billion in taxpayer dollars.
 Removal flights of illegal aliens are a necessary aspect of immigration
enforcement and upholding the rule of law, but they require substantial
resources and manpower.

Therefore, the provision of financial incentives to encourage and assist
aliens illegally in the country to elect to depart from the United
States has the potential to save tremendous taxpayer resources, while
restoring the sovereignty of our country.

As President, it is my legal obligation to exercise all tools at my
disposal to end this invasion, remove the illegal-alien invaders from
the United States, and protect the American people.  This proclamation
establishes Project Homecoming, which will present illegal aliens with a
choice:  either leave the United States voluntarily, with the support
and financial assistance of the Federal Government, or remain and face
the consequences.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws
of the United States of America, including the Immigration and
Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1101 *et seq.*), hereby proclaim and
direct as follows:

<u>Section</u> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Free Return Home and CBP Home
Application</span>.  (a)  In furtherance of the purposes of this
proclamation, and to facilitate the rapid departure of illegal aliens
from the United States, I direct, pursuant to section 215(a)(1) of the
INA (8 U.S.C. 1185(a)(1)), the Secretary of State and the Secretary of
Homeland Security, in consultation with the heads of other relevant
executive departments and agencies (agencies), to create seamless
processes for illegal aliens to rapidly depart the United States,
including through available technological resources, such as the “CBP
Home” application.

(b)  Any flights provided to illegal aliens voluntarily and permanently
departing the United States pursuant to processes established under
subsection (a) of this section shall be funded by the Federal
Government.

(c)  In furtherance of the purposes of this proclamation, and to
facilitate the rapid departure of illegal aliens from the United States,
I direct, pursuant to section 215(a)(1) of the INA (8 U.S.C.
1185(a)(1)), the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland
Security to take all appropriate actions to enable the rapid departure
of illegal aliens from the United States who currently lack a valid
travel document from their countries of citizenship or nationality or
who desire to travel to any other country willing to accept their entry.

(d)  The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall
create a concierge service whereby any alien illegally present in the
United States may arrive at an airport, with or without appropriate
travel documents, book air travel to permanently relocate to a different
country, and claim the exit bonus described in section 2 of this
proclamation upon their successful return.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Exit Bonus</span>.  In
furtherance of the purposes of this proclamation, and to facilitate the
rapid departure of illegal aliens from the United States, the Secretary
of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with
the heads of all relevant agencies, shall provide financial incentives
in the form of an “exit bonus” for each illegal alien who voluntarily
and permanently departs the United States.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Penalties for Aliens Who Fail
to Depart</span>.  (a)  The Secretary of State and the Secretary of
Homeland Security, in consultation with the heads of other relevant
agencies, shall conduct a nationwide communications campaign to notify
illegal aliens of the availability of cost-free travel to other
countries; the exit bonus; and the sweeping consequences for those who
choose to remain illegally present, including removal, prosecution,
incarceration, and fines as consistent with applicable law for
immigration-related crimes; the garnishment of wages; and the
confiscation of savings and personal property, including homes and
vehicles.

(b)  No later than 60 days after the date of this proclamation, the
Secretary of Homeland Security shall supplement existing enforcement and
removal operations by deputizing and contracting with State and local
law enforcement officers, former Federal officers, officers and
personnel within other Federal agencies, and other individuals to
increase the enforcement and removal operations force of the Department
of Homeland Security by no less than 20,000 officers in order to conduct
an intensive campaign to remove illegal aliens who have failed to depart
voluntarily.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of May,
in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-ninth.

DONALD J. TRUMP
