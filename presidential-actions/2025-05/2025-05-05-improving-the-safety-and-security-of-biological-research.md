title: Improving the Safety and Security of Biological Research
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  Dangerous
gain-of-function research on biological agents and pathogens has the
potential to significantly endanger the lives of American citizens.  If
left unrestricted, its effects can include widespread mortality, an
impaired public health system, disrupted American livelihoods, and
diminished economic and national security.  
The Biden Administration allowed dangerous gain-of-function research
within the United States with insufficient levels of oversight.  It also
actively approved, through the National Institutes of Health, Federal
life-science research funding in China and other countries where there
is limited United States oversight or reasonable expectation of
biosafety enforcement.   
This recklessness, if unaddressed, may lead to the proliferation of
research on pathogens (and potential pathogens) in settings without
adequate safeguards, even after COVID-19 revealed the risk of such
practices.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of the United States to ensure that United States federally
funded research benefits American citizens without jeopardizing our
Nation’s security, strength, or prosperity.  My Administration will
balance the prevention of catastrophic consequences with maintaining
readiness against biological threats and driving global leadership in
biotechnology, biological countermeasures, biosecurity, and health
research.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Stop
Dangerous Gain-of-Function Research</span>. (a)  The Director of the
Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), in coordination with the
Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Assistant to the
President for National Security Affairs (APNSA), and in consultation
with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the heads of other
relevant executive departments and agencies (agencies) identified by the
Director of OSTP, shall establish guidance for the heads of relevant
agencies, to the extent consistent with the terms and conditions of the
funding, to immediately:  
(i)   end Federal funding of dangerous gain-of-function research
conducted by foreign entities in countries of concern (e.g., China)
pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6627(c), or in other countries where there is not
adequate oversight to ensure that the countries are compliant with
United States oversight standards and policies; and  
(ii) end Federal funding of other life-science research that is
occurring in countries of concern or foreign countries where there is
not adequate oversight to ensure that the countries are compliant with
United States oversight standards and policies and that could reasonably
pose a threat to public health, public safety, and economic or national
security, as determined by the heads of relevant agencies.  
(b)  The Director of OSTP, in coordination with the Director of the
Office of Management and Budget and the APNSA, and in consultation with
the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the heads of other
relevant agencies, shall establish guidance for the Secretary of Health
and Human Services and the heads of other relevant agencies with respect
to suspension of federally funded dangerous gain-of-function research,
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the relevant research funding,
at least until the completion of the policy called for in section 4(a)
of this order.  Heads of agencies shall report any exception to a
suspension to the Director of OSTP for review in consultation with the
APNSA and the heads of relevant agencies.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Secure
Future Research Through Commonsense Frameworks</span>.  (a)  Within 120
days of the date of this order, the Director of OSTP, pursuant to 42
U.S.C. 6627 and in coordination with the APNSA and the heads of relevant
agencies, shall revise or replace the 2024 “*United States Government
Policy for Oversight of Dual Use Research of Concern and Pathogens with
Enhanced Pandemic Potential*” to:  
(i) strengthen top-down independent oversight; increase accountability
through enforcement, audits, and improved public transparency; and
clearly define the scope of covered research while ensuring the United
States remains the global leader in biotechnology, biological
countermeasures, and health research;  
(ii) incorporate enforcement mechanisms, including those described in
section 7 of this order, into Federal funding agreements to ensure
compliance with all Federal policies governing dangerous
gain-of-function research; and  
(iii) provide for review and revision at least every 4 years, or as
appropriate.

(b)**  **Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Director of OSTP,
in coordination with the APNSA and the heads of relevant agencies, shall
revise or replace the 2024 “*Framework for Nucleic Acid Synthesis
Screening*” (Framework) to ensure it takes a commonsense approach and
effectively encourages providers of synthetic nucleic acid sequences to
implement comprehensive, scalable, and verifiable synthetic nucleic acid
procurement screening mechanisms to minimize the risk of misuse.  The
heads of all agencies that fund life-science research shall ensure that
synthetic nucleic acid procurement is conducted through providers or
manufacturers that adhere to the updated Framework.  To ensure
compliance, the updated Framework shall incorporate the enforcement
mechanisms described in section 7 of this order.  The Framework shall be
reviewed and revised at least every 4 years, or as appropriate

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Manage
Risks Associated with Non-federally Funded Research</span>.  Within 180
days of the date of this order, the Director of OSTP, in coordination
with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the APNSA, the
Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and the heads of other
relevant agencies, shall develop and implement a strategy to govern,
limit, and track dangerous gain-of-function research across the United
States that occurs without Federal funding and other life-science
research that could cause significant societal consequences.  This
strategy shall include actions to achieve comprehensive, scalable, and
verifiable nucleic acid synthesis screening in non-federally funded
settings.  Any gaps in authorities necessary to achieve the goals of
this strategy shall be addressed in a legislative proposal to be sent to
the President, through the Director of OSTP and the APNSA, within 180
days of the date of this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Increase
Accountability and Public Transparency of Dangerous Gain-of-Function
Research</span>.  The Director of OSTP, in coordination with the APNSA
and the heads of relevant agencies, shall ensure that the revised policy
called for in section 4(a) of this order includes a mechanism whereby
research institutions that receive Federal funding must report dangerous
gain-of-function research, and to the maximum extent permitted by law,
include research that is supported by non-Federal funding mechanisms.
 The reporting mechanism shall provide a publicly available source of
information about research programs and awards identified pursuant to
this section, including, where permitted by law, those that have been
stopped or suspended pursuant to sections 3(a) and 3(b) of this order,
and all future programs and awards that are covered by the updated
policy developed in section 4(a) of this order.  This reporting shall be
conducted in a way that does not compromise national security or
legitimate intellectual property interests of subject institutions.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">7</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Future Enforcement
Terms</span>.  The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the heads
of other relevant agencies shall, consistent with existing laws and
regulations, include in every life-science research contract or grant
award:  
(a) a term requiring the contractual counterparty or grant recipient to
agree that its compliance in all respects with the terms of this order
and any applicable regulations promulgated by the contracting or
