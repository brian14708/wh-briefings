title: Increasing Efficiency At the Office of the Federal Register
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  Deregulation
is a critical priority for my Administration.  We will foster prosperity
by freeing Americans from the heavy burden of Federal regulations
accumulated over decades.  Although the decision about which regulations
to eliminate is sometimes complex, the administrative process of
removing a regulation from the Code of Federal Regulations through a
rulemaking should be simple.  It is not.  
The Office of the Federal Register frequently takes days or, in some
cases, even weeks to publish new regulatory actions.  Such delay is
unwarranted.  The Office of the Federal Register receives final
documents that are fully executed by the relevant decisionmakers — all
that remains is publication.  Yet despite those delays, executive
departments and agencies are charged $151-$174 per column of text to
publish each rule in the *Federal Register*.  These inefficiencies
inhibit my Administration’s deregulatory agenda and waste taxpayer
money.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Increasing Efficiency in
the *Federal Register*</span>.  (a)  The Archivist of the United States
(Archivist), acting through the Office of the Federal Register, shall
work with the Director of the Government Publishing Office to reduce
publication delays to the greatest extent feasible, including by
modernizing computer systems and eliminating unnecessary bureaucracy.   
(b)  Within 15 days of the date of this order, the Archivist, acting
through the Office of the Federal Register, shall submit a report to the
Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reflecting average
publication times for different categories of documents.   
(c)  Within 45 days of the date of this order, the Archivist, acting
through the Office of the Federal Register, shall review the fee
schedules for publication in the *Federal Register *and, working with
the Director of the Government Publishing Office, take steps to ensure
that fees are based on the actual costs of publication and account for
increased efficiencies achieved as a result of this order.  The
Archivist, acting through the Office of the Federal Register, shall
promptly file a report with the Director of OMB calculating the
percentage difference in fees between any proposed new fee schedule and
the prior one.  
(d) No later than August 22, 2025, the Archivist, acting through the
Office of the Federal Register, shall submit a second report to the
Director of OMB reflecting average publication times between July 15,
2025, and August 15, 2025, for the same categories of documents on which
the Office of the Federal Register reported under subsection (b) of this
section.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">General
Provisions</span>.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to
impair or otherwise affect:  
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or  
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.  
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.  
(d)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
National Archives and Records Administration.
