BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  
   
A PROCLAMATION

More than 200 years ago, the American steamship S.S. Savannah set sail
across the Atlantic, becoming the first vessel of its kind to complete
the journey.  That daring voyage marked the start of American maritime
excellence.  From that first crossing to the increasingly important
shipping lanes of today, America’s strength at sea has always been
driven by the United States Merchant Marine and the skilled merchant
mariners who support our economy and readiness in times of peace,
crisis, and war.  

Merchant mariners play a vital role in our national defense, standing
ready to support military operations whenever they are needed.  As
civilian seafarers, they deliver troops, weapons, and supplies through
dangerous conditions to sustain our Armed Forces in times of conflict. 
During World War II, more than 243,000 merchant mariners risked their
lives to aid the war effort and help secure victory and freedom.  Their
service came at a price as these merchant mariners suffered a higher
casualty rate than all branches of the United States military during the
war.  Their courage and heroism reflect a deep commitment to the Nation
that we hold in the highest honor and shall never forget.  

Beyond their role in national defense, merchant mariners help drive
American economic strength.  They operate the vessels that transport
goods, energy, and raw materials to and from our shores, supporting
global trade and connecting United States producers with international
markets.  Their work supports key industries across the American
economy, including shipping, shipbuilding, logistics, and energy.  

The United States is a proud maritime nation, and as President, I am
bringing a renewed focus to reestablishing our dominance at sea.  Last
month, I signed an Executive Order on Restoring America’s Maritime
Dominance to spur investment in American shipbuilding, eliminate
outdated regulations, and expand merchant mariner training and
education.  These reforms are critical to securing supply chains,
protecting key trade routes, and countering growing threats from foreign
adversaries.  

Today, we celebrate the men and women of the United States Merchant
Marine and all those who support our maritime industry.  Their
dedication upholds our national defense, fuels our economy, and
continues a proud tradition that has shaped our Nation since its
earliest days.   

The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 20, 1933, has
designated May 22 of each year as “National Maritime Day,” to
commemorate the first transoceanic voyage by a steamship, in 1819 by the
S.S. Savannah.  By this resolution, the Congress has authorized and
requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for its
appropriate observance.  

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, do hereby proclaim May 22, 2025, as National Maritime Day.  I
call upon the people of the United States to mark this observance and to
display the flag of the United States at their homes and in their
communities.  I also request that all ships sailing under the American
flag dress ship on that day.  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
twenty-second day of May, in the year of our Lord
two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States
of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.  
   
   
                               DONALD J. TRUMP
