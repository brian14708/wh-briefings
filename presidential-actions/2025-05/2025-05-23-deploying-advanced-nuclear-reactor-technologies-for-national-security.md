title: Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security
---
 
  
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.  The United
States faces a critical national security imperative to ensure a
resilient, secure, and reliable energy supply for critical defense
facilities designated under section 824o-1(c) of title 16, United States
Code, and other mission capability resources.  Advanced computing
infrastructure for artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities and other
mission capability resources at military and national security
installations and national laboratories demands reliable, high-density
power sources that cannot be disrupted by external threats or grid
failures.  These facilities and resources’ vulnerability to energy
disruption represents a strategic risk that must be addressed.   
Advanced nuclear reactors include nuclear energy systems like Generation
III+ reactors, small modular reactors, microreactors, and stationary and
mobile reactors that have the potential to deliver resilient, secure,
and reliable power to critical defense facilities and other mission
capability resources.  However, despite its promise, such technology has
not been utilized in the United States at the scale or speed necessary
to meet the Nation’s urgent national security requirements, while our
adversaries are rapidly exporting and deploying such technology around
the world.  
The Federal Government must utilize its full authority to accelerate the
secure and responsible development, demonstration, deployment, and
export of United States designed advanced nuclear technologies to
bolster readiness and enhance American technological superiority.
 Additionally, the United States must further enhance our ability to
export our nuclear technology to our allies and commercial partners,
strengthening our shared ability to combat reliance on foreign
adversaries through the use of safe, secure, and safeguarded nuclear
technologies.  Therefore, we must unleash the domestic nuclear
industrial base and position American nuclear companies as the partners
of choice for future energy growth throughout the world.   
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of the United States to:  
(a)  ensure the rapid development, deployment, and use of advanced
nuclear technologies to support national security objectives, such as
the protection and operation of critical infrastructure, critical
defense facilities, and other mission capability resources;  
(b)  enable private sector investment, innovation, development, and use
of advanced nuclear technologies in the United States, recognizing their
benefit to national security, by aligning incentives across the Federal
Government to fully leverage federally owned uranium and plutonium
resources declared excess to defense needs, related nuclear material,
supply chain components, and research and development infrastructure;
and  
(c)  coordinate regulatory efforts across the Department of Defense and
the Department of Energy, ensuring that these agencies optimize
resources and risk allocation in accordance with their respective
missions sets.
