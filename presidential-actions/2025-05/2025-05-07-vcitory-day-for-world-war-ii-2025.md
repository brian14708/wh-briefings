title: Victory Day for World War II, 2025
---
 
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  
  
A PROCLAMATION

Today, our Nation proudly commemorates the 80th anniversary of the
Allied Powers’ triumph over national socialism and fascism, and the end
of World War II in Europe — one of the most epic victories for forces of
freedom in the history of the world.  On this Victory Day for World War
II, we celebrate the unmatched might, strength, and power of the
American Armed Forces, and we commit to protecting our sacred birthright
of liberty against all threats, foreign and domestic.  
In the wake of the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, the United
States righteously entered the fray of what would become the apex of the
eternal battle between good and evil.  After nearly 4 years of the
darkest and bloodiest chapters ever recorded in human history, more than
250,000 Americans lost their lives in the fight against the Nazi regime.
 Today and every day, we pay tribute to all those who made the ultimate
sacrifice for their Nation, their liberty, and the survival of Western
civilization.  Without the sacrifice of our American soldiers, this war
would not have been won, and our world today would look drastically
different.  
May 8, 1945 marks the Allies’ acceptance of Germany’s unconditional
surrender — the beginning of the end of years of long, gruesome, and
brutal warfare.  The millions of souls senselessly lost serve as a
reminder of why we must pursue peace through strength.  I remain
steadfastly devoted to stopping the years of endless foreign wars and
preventing the further loss of lives.  As I stated during my Inaugural
Address, we will measure our success not only by the battles we win but
also by the wars we end — and my proudest legacy will be that of a
peacemaker.  
As we commemorate Victory Day for World War II, we offer our unending
thanks to every patriot from the Greatest Generation who left behind his
home and family to fight for our freedom in distant lands.  We honor the
memories of all those who perished.  Above all, we renew our commitment
to keeping America and the entire world safe, secure, prosperous, and
free.  
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 8, 2025, as a day
in celebration of Victory Day for World War II.  
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of May,
in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty‑five, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-ninth.  
   
   
                               DONALD J. TRUMP
