title: Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, 2025

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  
  
A PROCLAMATION

  
     Throughout our history, the United States has been strengthened by
the contributions of citizens from every background, united in the
shared pursuit of the American Dream.  As we recognize Asian American
and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, we celebrate the deep and enduring
impact that Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have had on our
Nation.  Forged by hardship and trial, they have never wavered in their
contributions toward the advancement of our common destiny. 

  
     In the 1980s, Lakshmi and Radhakrishna Chilukuri immigrated from
India to the United States and dedicated their lives to higher
education.  They built a life in America and raised a family, their
daughters Usha and Shreya, instilling in them the values of hard work,
perseverance, and a love of learning.  Their daughter, Usha, now serves
as the Second Lady of the United States.  Tulsi Gabbard, a native of
American Samoa, has dedicated her career to protecting our Republic,
serving in the military and now as the Director of National
Intelligence.  Today, more than 77,000 Asian American and Pacific
Islanders heroically serve our Nation in the Armed Forces.  Their
stories, along with many others, have helped build a stronger, safer,
and more prosperous country.

  
     This month, we honor the proud legacy of Asian Americans and
Pacific Islanders and their contributions to the vast constellation of
all our national triumphs.  They are woven into the fabric of our
Republic, reminding us that the American spirit is one of resilience,
independence, and relentless pursuit of freedom and opportunity.  

  
     NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States
of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2025 as Asian
American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.  The Congress, by Public
Law 102-450, as amended, has also designated the month of May each year
as “Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month.”  I encourage all Americans
to learn more about those of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and
Pacific Islander heritage and to observe this month with appropriate
programs and activities.

  
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
sixteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five,
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred
and forty-ninth.  
  
                              DONALD J. TRUMP
