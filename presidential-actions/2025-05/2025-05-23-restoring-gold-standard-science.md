title: Restoring Gold Standard Science
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including section 7301 of title 5,
United States Code, it is hereby ordered:  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy and Purpose</span>.
 Over the last 5 years, confidence that scientists act in the best
interests of the public has fallen significantly.  A majority of
researchers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics believe
science is facing a reproducibility crisis.  The falsification of data
by leading researchers has led to high-profile retractions of federally
funded research.    
Unfortunately, the Federal Government has contributed to this loss of
trust.  In several notable cases, executive departments and agencies
(agencies) have used or promoted scientific information in a highly
misleading manner.  For example, under the prior Administration, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued COVID-19 guidance on
reopening schools that incorporated edits by the American Federation of
Teachers and was understood to discourage in-person learning.  This
guidance’s restrictive and burdensome reopening conditions led many
schools to remain at least partially closed, resulting in substantial
negative effects on educational outcomes — even though the best
available scientific evidence showed that children were unlikely to
transmit or suffer serious illness or death from the virus, and that
opening schools with reasonable mitigation measures would have only
minor effects on transmission.    
The National Marine Fisheries Service justified a biological opinion by
adopting an admitted “worst-case scenario” projection of the North
Atlantic right whale population that it believed was “very likely”
wrong.  The agency’s proposed actions could have destroyed the historic
Maine lobster fishery.  The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently
overturned that opinion because the agency’s decision to seek out the
worst-case scenario skewed its approach to the evidence.    
Similarly, agencies have used Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)
scenario 8.5 to assess the potential effects of climate change in a
“higher” warming scenario.  RCP 8.5 is a worst-case scenario based on
highly unlikely assumptions like end-of-century coal use exceeding
estimates of recoverable coal reserves.  Scientists have warned that
presenting RCP 8.5 as a likely outcome is misleading.  
Actions taken by the prior Administration further politicized science,
for example, by encouraging agencies to incorporate diversity, equity,
and inclusion considerations into all aspects of science planning,
execution, and communication.  Scientific integrity in the production
and use of science by the Federal Government is critical to maintaining
the trust of the American people and ensuring confidence in government
decisions informed by science.  
My Administration is committed to restoring a gold standard for science
to ensure that federally funded research is transparent, rigorous, and
impactful, and that Federal decisions are informed by the most credible,
reliable, and impartial scientific evidence available.  We must restore
the American people’s faith in the scientific enterprise and
institutions that create and apply scientific knowledge in service of
the public good.  Reproducibility, rigor, and unbiased peer review must
be maintained.  This order restores the scientific integrity policies of
my first Administration and ensures that agencies practice data
transparency, acknowledge relevant scientific uncertainties, are
transparent about the assumptions and likelihood of scenarios used,
approach scientific findings objectively, and communicate scientific
data accurately.  Agency use of Gold Standard Science, as set forth in
this order, will spur innovation, translate discovery to success, and
ensure continued American strength and global leadership in technology.

 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Definitions</span>.  For the
purposes of this order:  
(a)  “Employee” has the meaning given that term in 5 U.S.C. 2105.  
(b)  “Scientific information” means factual inputs, data, models,
analyses, technical information, or scientific assessments related to
such disciplines as the behavioral and social sciences, public health
and medical sciences, life and earth sciences, engineering, physical
sciences, or probability and statistics.  This includes any
communication or representation of knowledge such as facts or data, in
any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic,
narrative, or audiovisual forms.  
(c)  “Scientific misconduct” means fabrication, falsification, or
plagiarism in proposing, performing, reviewing, or reporting the results
of scientific research, but does not include honest error or differences
of opinion.  For the purposes of this definition;  
(i)    “fabrication” is making up data or results and recording or
reporting them;  
(ii)   “falsification” is manipulating research materials, equipment, or
processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the
research is not accurately represented in the research record; and  
(iii)  “plagiarism” is the appropriation of another person’s ideas,
processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit.  
(d)  “Senior appointee” means an individual appointed by the President
(or an individual performing the functions and duties of an individual
appointed by the President) or a non-career member of the Senior
Executive Service.  
(e)  “Weight of scientific evidence” means an approach to scientific
evaluation in which each piece of relevant information is considered
based on its quality and relevance, and then transparently integrated
with other relevant information to inform the scientific evaluation
prior to making a judgment about the scientific evaluation.  Quality and
relevance determinations, at a minimum, should include consideration of
study design, fitness for purpose, replicability, peer review, and
transparency and reliability of data.

(v)     skeptical of its findings and assumptions;  
(vi)    structured for falsifiability of hypotheses;  
(vii)   subject to unbiased peer review;  
(viii)  accepting of negative results as positive outcomes; and  
(ix)    without conflicts of interest.  
(b)  Upon publication of the guidance prescribed in subsection (a), each
agency head, as necessary and appropriate and in consultation with the
Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Director) and the
OSTP Director, shall promptly update applicable agency policies
governing the production and use of scientific information, including
scientific integrity policies, to implement the OSTP Director’s guidance
on Gold Standard Science and ensure that agency scientific activities
are conducted in accordance with this order.  
(c)  Each agency head shall, to the extent practicable, incorporate the
OSTP Director’s guidance on Gold Standard Science and the requirements
of this order into the processes by which their agency conducts,
manages, interprets, communicates, and uses scientific or technological
information prior to the finalization of the updated policies under this
section.  
(d)  Within 60 days of the publication of the guidance prescribed in
section 3(a), agency heads shall report to the OSTP Director on the
actions taken to implement Gold Standard Science at their agency.

<span style="text-decoration: underline"> Improving the Use,
Interpretation, and Communication of Scientific Data</span>.  No later
than 30 days after the date of this order, agency heads and employees
shall adhere to the following rules governing the use, interpretation,
and communication of scientific data, unless otherwise provided by
law:  
(a)  Employees shall not engage in scientific misconduct nor knowingly
rely on information resulting from scientific misconduct.  
(b)  Except as prohibited by law, and consistent with relevant policies
that protect national security or sensitive personal or confidential
business information, agency heads shall in a timely manner and, to the
extent practicable and within the agency’s authority:  
(i)  subject to paragraph (ii), make publicly available the following
information within the agency’s possession:  
(A)  the data, analyses, and conclusions associated with scientific and
technological information produced or used by the agency that the agency
reasonably assesses will have a clear and substantial effect on
important public policies or important private sector decisions
(influential scientific information), including data cited in
peer-reviewed literature; and  
(B)  the models and analyses (including, as applicable, the source code
for such models) the agency used to generate such influential scientific
information.  Employees may not invoke exemption 5 to the Freedom of
Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5)) to prevent disclosure of such
models unless authorized in writing to do so by the agency head
following prior notice to the OSTP Director.  
(ii)  risk models used to guide agency enforcement actions or select
enforcement targets are not information that must be disclosed under
this subsection.  
(c)  When using scientific information in agency decision-making,
employees shall transparently acknowledge and document uncertainties,
including how uncertainty propagates throughout any models used in the
analysis.  
(d) Where employees produce or use scientific information to inform
policy or legal determinations they must use science that comports with
the legal standards applicable to those determinations, including when
agencies evaluate the realistic or reasonably foreseeable effects of an
action.  
(e)  Employees shall be transparent about the likelihood of the
assumptions and scenarios used.  Highly unlikely and overly
precautionary assumptions and scenarios should only be relied upon in
agency decision-making where required by law or otherwise pertinent to
the agency’s action.  
(f)  When scientific or technological information is used to inform
agency evaluations and subsequent decision-making, employees shall apply
a “weight of scientific evidence” approach.  
(g)  Employees’ communication of scientific information shall be
consistent with the results of the relevant analysis and evaluation and,
to the extent that uncertainty is present, the degree of uncertainty
should be communicated.  Communications involving a scientific model or
information derived from a scientific model should include reference to
any material assumptions that inform the model’s outputs.  
(h)  Once the guidance on Gold Standard Science is established and
promulgated pursuant to section 3 of this order, it shall, among other
things, form the basis for employees’ evaluation of all scientific and
technological information called for in this order except where
otherwise required by law.

operational changes, designations, or documents that were issued or
enacted pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of January 27, 2021
(Restoring Trust in Government Through Scientific Integrity and
Evidence-Based Policymaking), which was revoked pursuant to Executive
Order 14154 and shall conduct applicable agency operations in the manner
and revert applicable agency organization to the same form as would have
existed in the absence of such changes, designations, or documents.  
(b)  In updating applicable scientific integrity policies pursuant to
section 3 of this order, agencies should ensure they:  
(i)    encourage the open exchange of ideas;  
(ii)   provide for consideration of different or dissenting viewpoints;
and  
(iii)  protect employees from efforts to prevent or deter consideration
of alternative scientific opinions.  
(c)  Agencies, unless prohibited by law, shall review agency actions
taken between January 20, 2021, and January 20, 2025, including
regulations, guidance documents, policies, and scientific evaluations

 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Enforcement and
Oversight</span>.  (a)  Each agency head shall establish internal
processes to evaluate alleged violations of the requirements of this
order and other applicable agency policies governing the generation,
use, interpretation, and communication of scientific information.  Such
processes shall be the responsibility, and administered under the
direction, of a senior appointee designated by the agency head and shall
provide for taking appropriate measures to correct scientific
information in response to violations, consistent with the requirements
and procedures of section 515 of the statute commonly known as the
Information Quality Act, Public Law 106-554, appendix C (114 Stat.
2763A-153).  The designated senior appointee may also forward potential
violations to the relevant human resources officials for discipline to
the extent the potential violation also violates applicable agency
policies and procedures.  The designated senior appointee may consult
appropriate officials with scientific expertise when establishing such
processes.    
(b)  The processes created under this section are, unless otherwise
required by applicable law, the sole and exclusive means of evaluating
and, as applicable, addressing alleged violations of this order and
