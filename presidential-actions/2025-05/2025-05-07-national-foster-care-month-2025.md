title: National Foster Care Month, 2025

By the President of the United States of America  
   
A Proclamation 

Families raise our children, pass down our values, and hold communities
together, forming the foundation of a strong country.  Yet, far too
often, for reasons beyond their control, children and young people find
themselves in situations without an avenue for safe and loving care. 
These circumstances can be difficult for them, but it is the devoted
foster parents across America who rise to the occasion with selfless
compassion to ensure every child receives love, support, and a sense of
belonging.  
During National Foster Care Month, the First Lady and I honor the
individuals and families who make room in their hearts and homes for
thousands of children and youth throughout the year.  Without a
question, these dedicated men and women are unsung heroes in our local
communities across the country for giving each child in their care as
much normalcy as possible while also preparing them to be reunited with
family or adopted.  
My Administration estimates that, annually, more than 360,000 children
and youth need the safety and stability a foster family provides.  These
licensed and trained foster or kinship-care families step up in times of
need to offer emotional support and stability.  Foster families, with
the help of countless professionals and volunteers — including clergy,
educators, attorneys, judges, social workers, and law enforcement
personnel — can help change the course of young lives for the better. 
These noble caregivers devote their time and talent to ensuring every
child has a safe and healthy environment in which to grow and thrive.  
As a Nation of enduring faith and strong, guiding principles, every
child deserves the blessings of a firm foundation and endless
opportunity.  That is why I proudly signed into law the landmark Family
First Prevention Services Act during my first term, which utilizes
evidence-based intervention methods to keep families intact, whenever
possible.  Targeted, proactive services — including mental health
support, substance abuse treatment, in home parental skills training,
housing assistance, and job training — focus on preventing the root
causes of conflicts in the home.  
Despite the work we have achieved, there is more to be done.  That is
why our First Lady is passionately focused on supporting young people
through her BE BEST initiative and fostering the future for children and
young adults.  Her efforts help children reach their fullest potential,
including transformative action for youth who have experienced foster
care to help them pursue their dreams through education and continued
support.  
Together, we also recognize the need for more men and women to answer
the call and serve as foster families.  Foster families help every child
realize their worth and inherent value, instilling them with the
courage, character, and confidence to achieve their American Dream.  We
are incredibly grateful for their compassion and selfless dedication to
protecting our Nation’s most precious treasure.  
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2025 as National
Foster Care Month.  I call upon all Americans to find ways to support
children and youth in foster care, and to recognize the invaluable
contributions of foster parents and other caregivers.  
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
seventh day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five,
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred
and forty-ninth.  
   
   
                               DONALD J. TRUMP
