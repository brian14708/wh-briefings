title: Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  The United
States led the development of civilian nuclear power through the Atomic
Energy Commission, the National Reactor Testing Station (now known as
Idaho National Laboratory), and several other Federal Government
entities.  This work produced safe and abundant energy.  But in the
decades since, commercial deployment of new nuclear technologies has all
but stopped.  The Idaho National Laboratory has principal responsibility
for constructing and testing new reactor designs; it concluded
construction of new reactors in the 1970s.  Our proud history of
innovation has succumbed to overregulated complacency.  
As I stated in Executive Order 14156 of January 20, 2025 (Declaring a
National Energy Emergency), the United States needs a reliable,
diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive development of
advanced technologies, manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and
defense industries, and to sustain modern life and national security.
Nuclear energy both is vital to this effort and has never held so much
promise. Decades of research and engineering have produced prototypes of
advanced nuclear technologies that incorporate passive safety
mechanisms, improve the physical architecture of reactor designs,
increase reactor operational flexibility and performance, and reduce
risk in fuel disposal.  Advanced reactors — including microreactors,
small modular reactors, and Generation IV and Generation III+ reactors —
have revolutionary potential.  They will open a range of new
applications to support data centers, microchip manufacturing,
petrochemical production, healthcare, desalination, hydrogen production,
and other industries.    
The United States cultivated the effort to design and build the first
Generation IV reactor for commercial use, but the Federal Government has
effectively throttled the domestic deployment of advanced reactors,
ceding the initiative to foreign nations in building this critical
technology.  That changes today.  It is the policy of my Administration
to foster nuclear innovation and bring advanced nuclear technologies
into domestic production as soon as possible.  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Definitions</span>.  For
purposes of this order:  
(a)  The term “advanced reactor” has the same meaning as the term
“advanced nuclear reactor” in 42 U.S.C. 16271(b)(1).  
(b)  The term “Department” means the Department of Energy.  
(c)  The term “qualified test reactor” means an advanced reactor that
satisfies thresholds established by the Department sufficient to
demonstrate that, from the perspective of technical development and
financial backing, the reactor may feasibly be operational within 2
years from the date a substantially complete application is submitted.  
(d)  The term “Secretary” means the Secretary of Energy.  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Findings</span>.  With some
rare and arguable exceptions, no advanced reactors have yet been
deployed in America.  I find that design, construction, operation, and
disposition of such reactors under the auspices of the Department — and
not to produce commercial electric power — would be for research
purposes, rather than “for the purpose of demonstrating the suitability
for commercial application of . . . a reactor” within the meaning of 42
U.S.C. 5842.  The purpose of testing these reactors at this stage in
America’s industrial evolution is to establish fundamental technological
viability.  Thus, at least for the foreseeable future, advanced reactors
over which the Department exercises sufficient control and that do not
produce commercial electric power, including those “under contract with
and for the account of the \[Department\],” 42 U.S.C. 2140(a)(2), fall
within the jurisdiction of the Department, which has authority to foster
research and development in nuclear reactors.  Nothing in this section
alters the authority or jurisdiction of the Department of Defense.  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Reforming the National
Laboratory Process for Reactor Testing</span>.  (a)  Within 60 days of
the date of this order, the Secretary shall issue guidance regarding
what counts as a qualified test reactor for purposes of this order.  
(b)  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall take
appropriate action to revise the regulations, guidance, and procedures
and practices of the Department, the National Laboratories, and any
other entity under the Department’s jurisdiction to significantly
expedite the review, approval, and deployment of advanced reactors under
the Department’s jurisdiction.  The Secretary shall ensure that the
Department’s expedited procedures enable qualified test reactors to be
safely operational at Department-owned or Department-controlled
facilities within 2 years following the submission of a substantially
complete application.  
(c)  Upon finding that an applicant has submitted a substantially
complete application for a qualified test reactor, the Secretary shall
establish a team consisting of representatives from the Secretary’s
office, the relevant National Laboratory or Laboratories, the
Department’s Office of General Counsel, and any other entities within
the Department that possess the authority to deconflict, oppose, or
approve the application.  The team shall provide assistance to the
applicant to ensure expeditious processing of its application.  For
these purposes, each member shall report directly to the Secretary.  
(d)  The Secretary shall prioritize qualified test reactor projects for
processing, as consistent with applicable law.  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Establishing a Pilot Program
Outside the National Laboratories</span>.  (a)  The Secretary shall
create a pilot program for reactor construction and operation outside
the National Laboratories, pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act’s
authorization of reactors under the Department’s sufficient control,
including reactors “under contract with and for the account of” the
Department, in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 2140.  The Secretary shall
approve at least three reactors pursuant to this pilot program with the
goal of achieving criticality in each of the three reactors by July 4,
2026.  
(b)  Upon approval of an application for this pilot program, the
Secretary shall assign a team to provide assistance to the applicant as
specified in subsection 4(c) of this order.  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Streamlining Environmental
Reviews</span>.  (a)  The Secretary shall, in consultation with the
Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality, take action to reform the
Department’s rules governing compliance with the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA) no later than June 30, 2025, consistent with the
policies articulated in sections 2 and 5 of Executive Order 14154 of
January 20, 2025 (Unleashing American Energy), and with applicable law.
   
(b)  The Secretary shall, consistent with applicable law, use all
available authorities to eliminate or expedite the Department’s
environmental reviews for authorizations, permits, approvals, leases,
and any other activity requested by an applicant or potential
applicant.  In addition to the measures outlined in section 7 of the
Executive Order of May 23, 2025 (Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor
Technologies for National Security), such measures shall include
determining which Department functions are not subject to NEPA, creating
categorical exclusions as appropriate for reactors within certain
parameters (or relying on existing categorical exclusions), relying on
supplemental analyses where reactors will be located on existing sites,
or utilizing alternative procedures under NEPA.  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">7</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Implementation</span>.  The
Secretary shall work with the DOGE Team Lead at the Department, as
defined in Executive Order 14158 of January 20, 2025 (Establishing and
Implementing the President’s “Department of Government Efficiency”),
with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and with the
Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to implement
this order.  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">8</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.
 (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:  
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or  
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.  
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.  
(d)  The Department of Energy shall provide funding for publication of
this order in the *Federal Register*.
