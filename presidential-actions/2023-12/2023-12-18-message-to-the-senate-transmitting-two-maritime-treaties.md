title: "Message to the Senate Transmitting Two Maritime\_Treaties"
---
 
     With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to
ratification, I transmit herewith two bilateral maritime boundary
Treaties:  the Treaty between the United States of America and the
Republic of Cuba on the Delimitation of the Continental Shelf in the
Eastern Gulf of Mexico beyond 200 Nautical Miles (the “United
States-Cuba Treaty”), and the Treaty between the Government of the
United States of America and the Government of the United Mexican States
on the Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary in the Eastern Gulf of
Mexico (the “United States-Mexico Treaty”) (together, the “Treaties”),
both of which were signed at Washington on January 18, 2017.  I also
transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the
Department of State with respect to the Treaties.  
  
     The purpose of the Treaties is to establish our continental shelf
boundaries in the eastern Gulf of Mexico with Cuba and Mexico in areas
beyond 200 nautical miles from shore.  The United States-Cuba Treaty
establishes a maritime boundary of approximately 30 nautical miles in
length, and the United States-Mexico Treaty establishes a maritime
boundary of approximately 79 nautical miles in length.  The boundaries
define the limit within which each country may exercise maritime
jurisdiction with respect to its portion of the continental shelf.  The
boundaries address the only remaining area in the Gulf of Mexico where
the maritime boundaries between the United States and its neighbors had
not been agreed.  
  
     The United States-Cuba Treaty also establishes procedures for
addressing the possibility of oil and gas reservoirs that extend across
the continental shelf boundary, which will help protect related United
States interests.  With respect to Mexico, such procedures were
developed and set forth in a separate agreement that is already in
force, as described in the report of the Department of State
accompanying this message.  
  
     I believe the Treaties to be fully in the interest of the United
States.  In light of the relevant coastal geography, the Treaties
allocate approximately two-thirds of the area in question to the United
States, and they provide legal certainty with respect to United States
sovereign rights and jurisdiction over the continental shelf.  
  
     I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration
to the Treaties, and give its advice and consent to ratification.   

                              JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
December 18, 2023.
