---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Utah and ordered Federal assistance to supplement
state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected
by flooding from May 1 to May 27, 2023.

Federal funding is available to state, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the flooding in the counties of Iron, Morgan,
Sanpete, Utah, and Wasatch.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide. 

Mr. Jon K. Huss of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has
been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the affected
areas.  

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
