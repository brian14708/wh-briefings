TO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:  
   
   
     I am returning herewith without my approval S.J.Res. 32,
a resolution that would disapprove of the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau’s (CFPB) final rule titled “Small Business Lending Under the
Equal Credit Opportunity Act (Regulation B).”

     The CFPB’s final rule would provide small business owners, lenders,
and the public with critical information about the $1.7 trillion small
business financing market.  It would bring much needed transparency to
small business lending and improve the ability of lenders and community
organizations to meet the most critical needs of America’s small
businesses.  This rule implements a long-overdue piece of the Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  It is also central to
the effective implementation of the Community Reinvestment Act, which
helps ensure that the needs of all borrowers — including low- and
moderate-income borrowers — are met.  But this Republican-led resolution
would hinder the Government’s ability to conduct oversight of abusive
and predatory lenders, make it harder for 33 million small businesses
across the country to assess lending opportunities and access capital,
and make it more difficult for lenders and community groups to address
the most acute gaps in capital access for minority- and women-owned
businesses.

     If enacted, this resolution would harm all those that stand to
benefit from expanded transparency and accountability.  By hampering
efforts to promote transparency and accountability in small business
lending, Republicans are siding with big banks and corporations over the
needs of small business owners.  Small businesses are the engines of our
economy, and my Administration will not support policies that hurt their
ability to thrive and grow.

     Therefore, I am vetoing this resolution.  
   
   
   
                              JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.  
   
   
   
THE WHITE HOUSE,  
    December 19, 2023.
