---
 
The President is announcing his intent to nominate five individuals to
federal district courts and one individual to the Court of Federal
Claims—all of whom are extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and
devoted to the rule of law and our Constitution.  
  
These choices also continue to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure
that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our
greatest assets as a country—both in terms of personal and professional
backgrounds.  
  
This will be President Biden’s forty-third round of nominees for federal
judicial positions, bringing the number of announced federal judicial
nominees to 209.  
  
The President is also announcing his intent to nominate two individuals
to serve as U.S. Marshals. These officials will be indispensable to
upholding the rule of law and were chosen for their devotion to
enforcing the law, their professionalism, their experience and
credentials, and their dedication to pursuing equal justice for all.  
  
The President has now announced 26 nominees to serve as U.S. Marshals.
