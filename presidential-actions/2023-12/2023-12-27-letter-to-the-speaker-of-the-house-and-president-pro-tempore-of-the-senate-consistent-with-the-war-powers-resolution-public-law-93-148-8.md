Dear Mr. Speaker:   (Dear Madam President:)  
  
As I have reported previously, militia groups affiliated with Iran’s
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) have perpetrated a series of
attacks against United States personnel and facilities in Iraq and
Syria.  These attacks, including the recent attack on the Erbil Air Base
by Iran-affiliated Kataib Hezbollah and affiliated groups, have caused
injuries to United States personnel and have placed under grave threat
the lives of both United States personnel and Coalition forces operating
alongside United States forces.  
  
Previously, in response to these attacks and the threat of future
attacks, at my direction, United States forces have conducted targeted
strikes against facilities in Iraq and Syria used by IRGC and
IRGC-affiliated groups.  
  
On the night of December 25, 2023, at my direction, United States forces
conducted discrete strikes against three facilities in Iraq used by
Iran-affiliated groups for training, logistics support, and other
purposes.  The strikes were taken to deter future attacks and were
conducted in a manner designed to limit the risk of escalation and
minimize civilian casualties.  I directed the strikes in order to
protect and defend our personnel who are in Iraq conducting military
operations pursuant to the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military
Force.  The strikes were intended to degrade and disrupt the ongoing
series of attacks against the United States and our partners, and to
deter Iran and Iran-backed militia groups from conducting or supporting
further attacks on United States personnel and facilities.  
  
I directed this military action consistent with my responsibility to
protect United States citizens both at home and abroad and in
furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy
interests, pursuant to my constitutional authority as Commander in Chief
and Chief Executive and to conduct United States foreign relations.  The
United States took this necessary and proportionate action consistent
with international law and in the exercise of the United States’
inherent right of self-defense as reflected in Article 51 of the United
Nations Charter.  The United States stands ready to take further action,
as necessary and appropriate, to address further threats or attacks.  
  
I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress
fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law
93-148).  I appreciate the support of the Congress in this action.

                              Sincerely,

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
