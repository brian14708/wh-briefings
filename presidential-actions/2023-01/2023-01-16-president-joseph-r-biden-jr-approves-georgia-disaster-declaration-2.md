---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Georgia and ordered Federal aid to supplement
State and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by severe storms,
straight-line winds, and tornadoes on January 12, 2023.

The Presidentâ€™s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in the counties of Butts, Henry, Jasper, Meriwether, Newton,
Spalding, and Troup.

Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.

Federal funding also is available to State and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work in the counties of Butts, Henry,
Jasper, Meriwether, Newton, Spalding, and Troup.

Lastly, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named John F. Boyle as the
Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas.

Damage assessments are continuing in other areas, and more counties and
additional forms of assistance may be designated after the assessments
are fully completed.

Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance at www.DisasterAssistance.gov,
or by calling 800-621-FEMA (3362), or by using the FEMA App. Anyone
using a relay service, such as video relay service (VRS), captioned
telephone service or others, can give FEMA the number for that service.
