MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE  
                THE SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY

SUBJECT:       Extending and Expanding Eligibility for Deferred  
                Enforced Departure for Certain Hong Kong  
               Residents

The United States supports the human rights and fundamental freedoms of
the residents of Hong Kong.  The People’s Republic of China (PRC) has
continued to erode those rights and freedoms, and as such I am directing
an extension and expansion of the deferral of removal of certain Hong
Kong residents who are present in the United States.  
  
By unilaterally imposing on Hong Kong the Law of the People’s Republic
of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (NSL) in June 2020, the PRC has undermined the
enjoyment of rights and freedoms in Hong Kong, including those protected
under the Basic Law and the Sino-British Joint Declaration.  The PRC has
continued its assault on Hong Kong’s autonomy, undermining its remaining
democratic processes and institutions, imposing limits on academic
freedom, and cracking down on freedom of the press.  Since June 2020, at
least 150 opposition politicians, activists, and protesters have been
taken into custody on politically motivated NSL-related charges
including secession, subversion, terrorist activities, and collusion
with a foreign country or external elements.  Over 1,200 political
prisoners are now behind bars, and over 10,000 individuals have been
arrested for other charges in connection with anti-government
protests.  
  
There are compelling foreign policy reasons to extend Deferred Enforced
Departure (DED) for an additional period for those residents of Hong
Kong presently residing in the United States who were under a grant of
DED until February 5, 2023, as well as to defer enforced departure for
other Hong Kong residents who arrived in the United States subsequent to
the initial grant of DED.  The United States is committed to a foreign
policy that unites our democratic values with our foreign policy goals,
which is centered on the defense of democracy and the promotion of human
rights around the world.  Offering safe haven for Hong Kong residents
who have been deprived of their guaranteed freedoms in Hong Kong
furthers United States interests in the region.  The United States will
continue to stand firm in our support of the people in Hong Kong.  
  
Pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct the foreign relations
of the United States, I have determined that it is in the foreign policy
interest of the United States to defer for 24 months the removal of any
Hong Kong resident who is present in the United States on the date of
this memorandum, except for those:

\(1\)  who have voluntarily returned to Hong Kong or the PRC after the
date of this memorandum;

\(2\)  who have not continuously resided in the United States since the
date of this memorandum;

\(3\)  who are inadmissible under section 212(a)(3) of the Immigration
and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)) or deportable under
section 237(a)(4) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(4));

\(4\)  who have been convicted of any felony or two or more misdemeanors
committed in the United States, or who meet any of the criteria set
forth in section 208(b)(2)(A) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1158(b)(2)(A));

\(5\)  who are subject to extradition;

\(6\)  whose presence in the United States the Secretary of Homeland
Security has determined is not in the interest of the United States or
presents a danger to public safety; or

\(7\)  whose presence in the United States the Secretary of State has
reasonable grounds to believe would have potentially serious adverse
foreign policy consequences for the United States.

I further direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to take appropriate
measures to authorize employment for noncitizens whose removal has been
deferred, as provided by this memorandum, for the duration of such
deferral, and to consider suspending regulatory requirements with
respect to F-1 nonimmigrant students who are Hong Kong residents as the
Secretary of Homeland Security determines to be appropriate.  The
Secretary of Homeland Security shall also provide for the prompt
issuance of new or replacement documents in appropriate cases.  
  
The Secretary of Homeland Security is authorized and directed to publish
this memorandum in the *Federal Register*.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
