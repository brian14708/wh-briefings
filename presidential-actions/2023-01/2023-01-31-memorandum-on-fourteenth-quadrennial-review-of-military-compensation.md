MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

SUBJECT:       Fourteenth Quadrennial Review of Military  
                Compensation

Pursuant to the requirements of section 1008(b) of title 37, United
States Code, I direct a complete review of the principles and concepts
of the compensation system for members of the uniformed services.  This
review should commence in January 2023 and be completed within 2 years.
 You will be my Executive Agent for this review.  
  
Our great Nation has the finest fighting force in the world and it
remains our sacred obligation to take care of our men and women in
uniform.  We owe our service members our support and gratitude, and we
recognize the sacrifices they make every day in support of our Nation. 
Further, our service members deserve a 21st century military
compensation system that recognizes and rewards their contributions,
reflects the values of our Nation, and incentivizes the next generation
of men and women to serve.  
  
Accordingly, I direct the 14th Quadrennial Review of Military
Compensation to focus on the following:

     (1)  Review military compensation and benefits, including special
pay, to ensure the Department of Defense is appropriately compensating
service members while remaining responsible stewards of the funds
provided by American taxpayers;

     (2)  Review the military basic pay table to ensure it is structured
to further strengthen service members’ economic security and enhance the
Department of Defense’s ability to recruit and retain the Nation’s
finest;  
  
     (3)  Evaluate military compensation and its current benchmark to
determine how a shift toward dual-income households and the unique
factors affecting military household incomes might require structural
changes, to include the development of a new benchmark for military
compensation.  This evaluation should include, but is not limited to,
consideration of factors such as the challenge of military spouse
unemployment, frequent military moves, periods of geographic separation
between service members and their spouses (including dual military
couples), and childcare access and cost;

     (4)  Review the statutory requirements and current methodologies
used to calculate housing, subsistence, and cost-of-living allowances,
including the Basic Needs Allowance, to ensure service members are food
secure and able to procure suitable housing; and

     (5)  Review military compensation relative to anticipated future
requirements in technology and other fields that are critical to the
Department of Defense.  
  
 As the Executive Agent, you will ensure representatives of other
executive departments and agencies participate in this review, as
appropriate.  I look forward to receiving the results of your review.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
