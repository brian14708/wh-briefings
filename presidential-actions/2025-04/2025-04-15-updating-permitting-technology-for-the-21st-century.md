title: Updating Permitting Technology for the 21st Century
---
 
The Government does not properly leverage technology to effectively and
efficiently evaluate environmental permits, causing significant delay to
important infrastructure projects that impact our economic well-being. 
This will now change.  My Administration will apply modern technologies
to longstanding problems to deliver outstanding results at 21st-century
speeds.  To that end, and pursuant to the authority vested in me as
President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of
America, I hereby direct the following:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy and Purpose</span>.
 Executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall make maximum use of
technology in environmental review and permitting processes for
infrastructure projects of all kinds, such as roads, bridges, mines,
factories, power plants, and others, to:

\(a\)  eliminate the use of paper-based application and review
processes;

\(b\)  accelerate the processing time for projects, with little to no
impact on quality of review;

\(c\)  reduce the length and increase the accessibility of documents
related to permit applications;

\(d\)  reduce duplicative data submissions;

\(e\)  increase the interagency use of existing analyses including
analyses from other agencies relevant to different permit applications
for the same projects;

\(f\)  eliminate friction in coordination between agencies in the
environmental review and permitting processes;

\(g\)  improve the transparency and predictability of project permitting
schedules;

\(h\)  ensure agency legal departments have the support, funding, and
technology to provide the most expeditious and best defense of
challenged environmental documents and permit decisions;

\(i\)  streamline the overall environmental review and permitting
process at the Federal level, with the goal of speeding data gathering
and decision-making that can improve timeliness for State, local and
tribal decision-making as well; and

\(j\)  maintain a readily available source of information that may be
relevant to judicial review of any permits.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Permitting Technology
Modernization</span>.  (a)  Within 45 days of the date of this
memorandum, the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ),
in consultation with the National Energy Dominance Council and relevant
permitting agencies, shall issue a Permitting Technology Action Plan for
modernizing the technology used for Federal permitting and environmental
review processes for infrastructure projects.

\(b\)  The Permitting Technology Action Plan shall include:

\(i\)    an initial data and technology standard for permit applications
and reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA),
42 U.S.C. 4321 *et seq.*, and other applicable permits and
authorizations;

\(ii\)   minimum functional requirements for agency NEPA and
permitting-related software systems, including systems related to case
management, automation to expedite low-level reviews, data-driven
document structure, and data collection and reporting to minimize
timeline uncertainty for environmental reviews;

\(iii\)  a roadmap for creating a unified interagency permitting and
environmental review data system consisting of interconnected agency
systems and shared services that includes iterative development of new
platforms, tools, and capabilities, key investments and decision points
for consolidating digital infrastructure, and resulting outcomes for
environmental review and permitting;

\(iv\)   an interagency governance structure for oversight of
implementation of the Permitting Technology Action Plan; and

(v)    a timeline for agencies to accomplish the activities outlined in
the Permitting Technology Action Plan.

\(c\)  Within 90 days of the date of the issuance of CEQ’s Permitting
Technology Action Plan, the officials listed in 42 U.S.C.
4370m–1(b)(2)(B)(i)-(xii) and others as determined by the Chairman of
CEQ shall adopt and begin implementing the CEQ data and technology
standard and minimum functional requirements referred in sections
2(b)(i) and 2(b)(ii) of this memorandum in new and existing agency
environmental review and permitting systems to facilitate efficient
environmental reviews.

\(d\)  In carrying out the requirements of this section, the Chairman of
CEQ shall coordinate with relevant agency Chief Environmental Review and
Permitting Officers and Chief Information Officers to provide oversight
on the implementation of the data and technology standard.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Permitting Innovation
Center</span>.  (a)  Within 15 days of the date of this memorandum, the
Chairman of CEQ shall establish and lead an interagency Permitting
Innovation Center that will design and test prototype tools that could
be implemented pursuant to the Permitting Technology Action Plan for
NEPA reviews and other environmental permits and authorizations.  The
Permitting Innovation Center shall facilitate agency adoption of
prototype software systems, including for case management systems,
application submission and tracking portals, automation of application
and review processes, data exchange between agency systems, and
acceleration of complex reviews.

\(b\)  The Administrator of General Services, through the General
Service Administration’s Technology Transformation Services, shall
provide support for the establishment of the Permitting Innovation
Center consistent with applicable law.
