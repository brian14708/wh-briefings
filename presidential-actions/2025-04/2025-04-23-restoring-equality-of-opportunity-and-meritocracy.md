title: Restoring Equality of Opportunity and Meritocracy
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.
 A bedrock principle of the United States is that all citizens are
treated equally under the law.  This principle guarantees equality of
opportunity, not equal outcomes.  It promises that people are treated as
individuals, not components of a particular race or group.  It
encourages meritocracy and a colorblind society, not race- or sex-based
favoritism.  Adherence to this principle is essential to creating
opportunity, encouraging achievement, and sustaining the American
Dream.  
But a pernicious movement endangers this foundational principle, seeking
to transform America’s promise of equal opportunity into a divisive
pursuit of results preordained by irrelevant immutable characteristics,
regardless of individual strengths, effort, or achievement.  A key tool
of this movement is disparate-impact liability, which holds that a near
insurmountable presumption of unlawful discrimination exists where there
are any differences in outcomes in certain circumstances among different
races, sexes, or similar groups, even if there is no facially
discriminatory policy or practice or discriminatory intent involved, and
even if everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed.  Disparate-impact
liability all but requires individuals and businesses to consider race
and engage in racial balancing to avoid potentially crippling legal
liability.  It not only undermines our national values, but also runs
contrary to equal protection under the law and, therefore, violates our
Constitution.    
On a practical level, disparate-impact liability has hindered businesses
from making hiring and other employment decisions based on merit and
skill, their needs, or the needs of their customers because of the
specter that such a process might lead to disparate outcomes, and thus
disparate-impact lawsuits.  This has made it difficult, and in some
cases impossible, for employers to use bona fide job-oriented
evaluations when recruiting, which prevents job seekers from being
paired with jobs to which their skills are most suited — in other words,
it deprives them of opportunities for success.  Because of
disparate-impact liability, employers cannot act in the best interests
of the job applicant, the employer, and the American public.   
Disparate-impact liability imperils the effectiveness of civil rights
laws by mandating, rather than proscribing, discrimination.  As the
Supreme Court put it, “\[t\]he way to stop discrimination on the basis
of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.”  
Disparate-impact liability is wholly inconsistent with the Constitution
and threatens the commitment to merit and equality of opportunity that
forms the foundation of the American Dream.  Under my Administration,
citizens will be treated equally before the law and as individuals, not
consigned to a certain fate based on their immutable characteristics.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of the United States to eliminate the use of disparate-impact
liability in all contexts to the maximum degree possible to avoid
violating the Constitution, Federal civil rights laws, and basic
American ideals.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Revoking Certain Presidential
Actions</span>.  The following Presidential approvals of the regulations
promulgated under 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1 are hereby revoked:  
(a)  the Presidential approval of July 25, 1966, of the Department of
Justice Title VI regulations (31 *Fed. Reg.* 10269), as applied to 28
C.F.R. 42.104(b)(2) in full; and  
(b)  the Presidential approval of July 5, 1973, of the Department of
Justice Title VI regulations (38 *Fed. Reg*. 17955, FR Doc. 73-13407),
as applied to the words “or effect” in both places they appear in 28
C.F.R. 42.104(b)(3), and as applied to 28 C.F.R. 42.104(b)(6)(ii) and 28
C.F.R. 42.104(c)(2) in full.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Enforcement Discretion to
Ensure Lawful Governance</span>.  Given the limited enforcement
resources of executive departments and agencies (agencies), the
unlawfulness of disparate-impact liability, and the policy of this
order, all agencies shall deprioritize enforcement of all statutes and
regulations to the extent they include disparate-impact liability,
including but not limited to 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2, 28 C.F.R.
42.104(b)(2)–(3), 28 C.F.R. 42.104(b)(6)(ii), and 28 C.F.R.

for all agencies to the extent they contemplate disparate-impact
liability.  
(b)  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Attorney General, in
coordination with the heads of all other agencies, shall report to the
President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy:  
(i)   all existing regulations, guidance, rules, or orders that impose
disparate-impact liability or similar requirements, and detail agency
steps for their amendment or repeal, as appropriate under applicable
law; and  
(ii)  other laws or decisions, including at the State level, that impose
disparate-impact liability and any appropriate measures to address any
constitutional or other legal infirmities.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Review of Current
Matters</span>.  (a)  Within 45 days of the date of this order, the
Attorney General and the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission shall assess all pending investigations, civil suits, or
positions taken in ongoing matters under every Federal civil rights law
within their respective jurisdictions, including Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, that rely on a theory of disparate-impact liability,
and shall take appropriate action with respect to such matters
consistent with the policy of this order.    
(b)  Within 45 days of the date of this order, the Attorney General, the
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Director of the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau, the Chair of the Federal Trade Commission,

Credit Opportunity Act (Public Law 93-495), Title VIII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 (the Fair Housing Act (Public Law 90-284, as
amended)), or laws prohibiting unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or
practices shall evaluate all pending proceedings that rely on theories
of disparate-impact liability and take appropriate action with respect
to such matters consistent with the policy of this order.  
(c)  Within 90 days of the date of this order, all agencies shall
evaluate existing consent judgments and permanent injunctions that rely
on theories of disparate-impact liability and take appropriate action
with respect to such matters consistent with the policy of this order.  

 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">7</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Future Agency Action</span>.
 (a)  In coordination with other agencies, the Attorney General shall
determine whether any Federal authorities preempt State laws,
regulations, policies, or practices that impose disparate-impact
liability based on a federally protected characteristic such as race,
sex, or age, or whether such laws, regulations, policies, or practices
have constitutional infirmities that warrant Federal action, and shall
take appropriate measures consistent with the policy of this order.  
(b)  The Attorney General and the Chair of the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission shall jointly formulate and issue guidance or
technical assistance to employers regarding appropriate methods to
promote equal access to employment regardless of whether an applicant
has a college education, where appropriate.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">8</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Severability</span>. 
If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to
any individual or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of

benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
