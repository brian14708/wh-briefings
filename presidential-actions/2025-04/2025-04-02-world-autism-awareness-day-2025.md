title: World Autism Awareness Day, 2025

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

On World Autism Awareness Day, we recognize the millions of Americans
living with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).  Their proud perseverance in
overcoming tremendous hurdles is emblematic of the strength and grit
that makes America great.  The First Lady and I extend our heartfelt
appreciation to the families, friends, and communities aiding Americans
with ASD as we empower every citizen to take part in and shape our new
golden age.

Autism now affects 1 in 36 children in the United States, a staggering
increase from the 1980s, when the disorder was found in only 1 to 4 out
of every 10,000 individuals.  I created the Make America Healthy Again
Commission to investigate and address the root causes of our escalating
health crisis, with a focus on childhood disorders like autism.  As part
of this effort, my Administration is prioritizing gold-standard research
and increasing transparency to gain new insights to aid those with ASD.

Under my leadership, our great Nation will be stronger than ever before,
with opportunities for all Americans to thrive and prosper.  Despite
challenges, Americans with ASD have made, and will continue to make
outstanding contributions for our country and the world. 

Early detection is crucial to improving the quality of life of those
with ASD, as timely intervention can significantly improve long-term
outcomes.  Identifying signs of autism at the onset allows parents and
healthcare providers to implement therapies and support strategies which
can enhance communication and social skills.  Loving parents want the
best for their children in educational environments and so do we.  By
supporting our children and their families, we can help them in
overcoming challenges during childhood, the most crucial stage of
development.

Together, on World Autism Awareness Day, we declare our unending support
and wholehearted respect for Americans living with autism.  My
Administration will empower them to reach their full potential and
realize their American Dream.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2, 2025, as
World Autism Awareness Day.  I call upon all Americans to learn more
about the signs of autism to improve early diagnosis, understand the
challenges faced by individuals with autism, and find ways to support
those with autism and their families.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
first day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five,
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred
and forty-ninth.
