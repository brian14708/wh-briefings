title: Amendments to Adjusting Imports of Automobiles and Automobile Parts Into the
  United States
---
 
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  
  
A PROCLAMATION

1\.  On February 17, 2019, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary)
transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effects of
imports of passenger vehicles (sedans, sport utility vehicles, crossover
utility vehicles, minivans, and cargo vans) and light trucks
(collectively, automobiles) and certain automobile parts (engines and
engine parts, transmissions and powertrain parts, and electrical
components) (collectively, automobile parts) on the national security of
the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962,
as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862) (section 232).  Based on the facts
considered in that investigation, the Secretary found and advised me of
his opinion that automobiles and certain automobile parts are being
imported into the United States in such quantities and under such
circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the
United States.  
2.  In Proclamation 9888 of May 17, 2019 (Adjusting Imports of
Automobiles and Automobile Parts Into the United States), I concurred
with the Secretary’s finding in the February 17, 2019, report that
automobiles and certain automobile parts are being imported into the
United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to
threaten to impair the national security of the United States.  I
directed the United States Trade Representative (Trade Representative),
in consultation with other executive branch officials, to pursue
negotiation of agreements to address the threatened impairment of the
national security of the United States with respect to imported
automobiles and certain automobile parts from certain countries.  The
Trade Representative’s negotiations did not lead to any agreements of
the type contemplated by section 232.  I also directed the Secretary to
monitor imports of automobiles and certain automobile parts and inform
me of any circumstances that, in the Secretary’s opinion, might indicate
the need for further action under section 232 with respect to such
imports.  
3.  In Proclamation 10908 of March 26, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of
Automobiles and Automobile Parts Into the United States), I found, based
on information newly provided by the Secretary, that imports of
automobiles and certain automobile parts continued to threaten to impair
the national security of the United States and deemed it necessary and
appropriate to impose a tariff system to adjust imports of automobiles
and certain automobile parts so that such imports will not threaten to
impair national security.  The tariffs on automobiles have been in
effect since 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 3, 2025; the
tariffs on automobile parts are set to go into effect on or after 12:01
a.m. eastern daylight time on May 3, 2025.   
4.  In Proclamation 10908, I also deemed it necessary and appropriate to
establish processes to identify and impose tariffs on additional
automobile parts to ensure that the tariffs on automobiles and certain
automobile parts are not circumvented and that the purpose of this
action to eliminate the threat to the national security of the United
States by imports of automobiles and certain automobile parts is not
undermined.  I directed the Secretary to set up such a process within 90
days of the date of Proclamation 10908.  
5.  In Proclamation 10908, I also directed the Secretary to continue to
monitor imports of automobiles and automobile parts, to review the
status of such imports with respect to national security, and to inform
me of any circumstances that, in the Secretary’s opinion, might indicate
the need for further action by the President under section 232.  The
Secretary has advised me that additional action is warranted in the
interest of meeting the national security objectives outlined in
Proclamation 10908.  
6.  In my judgment, it is necessary and appropriate to modify the system
of monetary fees and related measures imposed to adjust imports of
automobiles and certain automobile parts pursuant to Proclamation 10908
to more effectively eliminate the threat imports of automobiles and
certain automobile parts pose on the national security of the United
States.  
7.  I determine that the modified system, by linking the ultimate
monetary fee imposed on imports of automobile parts to the imports’ use
in assembly of automobiles within the United States, in the way and on
the timeline described below, will adjust imports of automobiles and
automobile parts and more effectively eliminate such imports’ threat to
impair national security.  I find that the modified system will more
effectively eliminate the national security threat because it will more
quickly reduce reliance on foreign manufacturing and importation of
automobiles and automobile parts; strengthen United States vehicle
assembly operations by encouraging companies to expand domestic
production capacity, which is critical to a strong domestic defense
industrial base; shift manufacturing activity into the United States;
increase domestic automotive research and development so that
American-owned producers can produce cutting-edge technologies that are
essential to the United States defense industrial base and our military
superiority; create jobs in the automotive industry that increase the
number of employees in the domestic automotive industry; and ensure that
other benefits of production are concentrated in the United States.   
8.  Section 232 authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an
article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United
States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to
impair the national security of the United States so that such imports
will not threaten to impair national security.  
9.  Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483),
authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of
the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import
treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification,
continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import
restriction.  
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws
of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3,
United States Code; section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended;
and section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, do
hereby proclaim as follows:  
(1)  To more effectively eliminate the threat to impair national
security posed by imports of automobiles and automobile parts, I find
that it is necessary to modify the system imposed in Proclamation 10908
by reducing duties assessed on automobile parts accounting for 15
percent of the value of an automobile assembled in the United States for
1 year and equivalent to 10 percent of that value for an additional year
as follows:  
(a)  For automobiles assembled in the United States, automobile
manufacturers shall be eligible to receive an import adjustment offset
amount applicable to section 232 duties on automobile parts based on the
following schedule:  
(i)   The automobile manufacturer may apply for an import adjustment
offset amount equal to 3.75 percent of the aggregate Manufacturer’s
Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) value of all automobiles assembled in the
United States from April 3, 2025, through April 30, 2026.  
(ii)  The automobile manufacturer may apply for an import adjustment
offset amount equal to 2.5 percent of the aggregate MSRP value of all
automobiles assembled in the United States from May 1, 2026, through
April 30, 2027.  
(b)  The percentage rate provided in subsection (i) reflects the total
duty that would be owed when a 25 percent duty is applied to parts
accounting for 15 percent of an automobile’s MSRP value.  The percentage
rate provided in subsection (ii) reflects the total duty that would be
owed when a 25 percent duty is applied to parts accounting for
10 percent of an automobile’s MSRP value.   
(c)  Only automobiles that undergo final assembly in the United States
are eligible to be included in this calculation.  The manufacturer’s
import adjustment offset amount may only be used by importers of record
authorized by that manufacturer, and the amount may only be used to
offset tariff liability related to that manufacturer’s automobile parts
tariff liability under Proclamation 10908.  Should a manufacturer’s
import adjustment offset amount exceed the total amount attributable to
that manufacturer’s automobile parts tariff liability under Proclamation
10908, the relief is capped at the total amount of that manufacturer’s
automobile parts tariff liability under Proclamation 10908, and the
manufacturer may not use the additional amount above that cap to offset
any other tariff liability.  A manufacturer with an approved import
adjustment offset amount may determine the importers of record eligible
to decrement against that manufacturer’s import adjustment offset
amount, and that list of importers of record may include suppliers in
that manufacturer’s supply chain for automobiles assembled in the United
States if the manufacturer so chooses.  
(2)  (a)  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall
establish a process by which manufacturers seeking an import adjustment
offset amount shall submit to the Secretary:  
(i)    documentation certifying the number of automobiles the
manufacturer projects it will assemble in the United States, as well as
a list of all plant locations where the projected automobiles will
undergo final production;  
(ii)   documentation certifying the manufacturer’s projected cost of
tariffs due to imported automobile parts subject to Proclamation 10908,
broken down by tariff costs the manufacturer will incur directly and
tariff costs the manufacturer will incur from its suppliers;  
(iii)  documentation detailing the total import adjustment offset amount
requested within the schedule determined by the Secretary in accordance
with this proclamation;  
(iv)   documentation identifying the importer(s) of record, including
importer of record numbers, eligible to use that manufacturer’s import
adjustment offset amount, as well as the amount of the manufacturer’s
offset amount allotted to each importer of record; and  
(v)    a certification, signed by a senior officer of the manufacturer,
attesting under penalty of perjury that the information submitted under
subsections (i) through (iv) is true, complete, and accurate to the best
of the manufacturer’s knowledge, and that the manufacturer has conducted
reasonable due diligence to verify the accuracy of the assertions and
facts contained in its submissions.  
(b)  Upon verification of the completeness and accuracy of a
manufacturer’s submission and the manufacturer’s eligibility, the
Secretary shall approve the application and notify U.S. Customs and
Border Protection (CBP) with the information necessary for CBP to
administer and implement the manufacturer’s import adjustment offset
amount, including importer of record number(s) for the importer(s)
eligible to use each offset amount and the approved import adjustment
offset amount.  CBP shall confer the approved offset amount to the
approved importer(s) of record using processes and mechanisms consistent
with CBP’s operational framework and tariff administration procedures,
including offset against current tariff obligations due at the time of
entry, or other lawful methods.  
(3)  The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury
and the Commissioner of CBP, shall issue such regulations, guidance, and
procedures as necessary to carry out the provisions of this proclamation
and Proclamation 10908, and may establish standards for determining
United States content and for validating manufacturer certifications.  
(4)  The Secretary, in consultation with the United States International
Trade Commission and CBP, shall determine whether modifications to the
HTSUS are necessary to effectuate this proclamation and may make such
modifications through notice in the *Federal Register*if needed.  
(5)  CBP shall begin providing approved importers with an import
adjustment offset amount as soon as practicable and may request
information from importers of record as necessary to implement a
particular manufacturer’s import adjustment offset amount.   
(6)  Should an importer claim and receive any import adjustment offset
amount from CBP in excess of the amount approved by the Secretary, CBP
may assess monetary penalties in the maximum amount permitted by law.  
(7)  The Secretary shall continue to monitor imports of automobiles and
automobile parts.  The Secretary also shall, from time to time, in
consultation with any senior executive branch officials the Secretary
deems appropriate, review the status of such imports with respect to
national security.  The Secretary shall inform the President of any
circumstances that, in the Secretary’s opinion, might indicate the need
for further action by the President under section 232.  The Secretary
shall also inform the President of any circumstance that, in the
Secretary’s opinion, might indicate that the duty rate provided for in
Proclamation 10908, or any proclamation issued pursuant thereto, is no
longer necessary.  
(8)  Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that
is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.  This proclamation shall
apply in accordance with the Executive Order of April 29, 2025
(Addressing Certain Tariffs on Imported Articles).  
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
twenty-ninth day of April, in the year of our Lord
two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States
of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.  
  
  
                               DONALD J. TRUMP
