MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES

SUBJECT:       DIRECTING THE REPEAL OF UNLAWFUL REGULATIONS

Promoting economic growth and American innovation are top priorities of
this Administration.  Unlawful, unnecessary, and onerous regulations
impede these objectives and impose massive costs on American consumers
and American businesses.  In recent years, the Supreme Court has issued
a series of decisions that recognize appropriate constitutional
boundaries on the power of unelected bureaucrats and that restore checks
on unlawful agency actions.  Yet, despite these critical course
corrections, unlawful regulations — often promulgated in reliance on
now-superseded Supreme Court decisions — remain on the books.

Consistent with these priorities and with my commitment to restore
fidelity to the Constitution, on February 19, 2025, I issued Executive
Order 14219 (Ensuring Lawful Governance and Implementing the President’s
“Department of Government Efficiency” Deregulatory Initiative*)*.  It
directed the heads of all executive departments and agencies to identify
certain categories of unlawful and potentially unlawful regulations
within 60 days and begin plans to repeal them.  This review-and-repeal
effort shall prioritize, in particular, evaluating each existing
regulation’s lawfulness under the following United States Supreme Court
decisions: 

1.  *Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo*, 603 U.S. 369 (2024);
2.  *West Virginia v. EPA*, 597 U.S. 697 (2022);
3.  *SEC v. Jarkesy*, 603 U.S. 109 (2024);
4.  *Michigan v. EPA*, 576 U.S. 743 (2015);
5.  *Sackett v. EPA*, 598 U.S. 651 (2023);
6.  *Ohio v. EPA*, 603 U.S. 279 (2024);
7.  *Cedar Point Nursery v. Hassid*, 594 U.S. 139 (2021);
8.  *Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard*, 600 U.S. 181 (2023);
9.  *Carson v. Makin*, 596 U.S. 767 (2022); and
10. *Roman Cath. Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo*, 592 U.S. 14 (2020).

In effectuating repeals of facially unlawful regulations, agency heads
shall finalize rules without notice and comment, where doing so is
consistent with the “good cause” exception in the Administrative
Procedure Act.  That exception allows agencies to dispense with
notice-and-comment rulemaking when that process would be “impracticable,
unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.”  Retaining and
enforcing facially unlawful regulations is clearly contrary to the
public interest.  Furthermore, notice-and-comment proceedings are
“unnecessary” where repeal is required as a matter of law to ensure
consistency with a ruling of the United States Supreme Court.  Agencies
thus have ample cause and the legal authority to immediately repeal
unlawful regulations.

Accordingly, I hereby direct:

1.  Following the 60-day review period ordered in Executive Order 14219
    to identify unlawful and potentially unlawful regulations, agencies
    shall immediately take steps to effectuate the repeal of any
    regulation, or the portion of any regulation, that clearly exceeds
    the agency’s statutory authority or is otherwise unlawful.  Agencies
    should give priority to the regulations in conflict with the
    United States Supreme Court decisions listed earlier in this
    memorandum.  The repeal of each unlawful regulation shall be
    accompanied by a brief statement of the reasons that the “good
    cause” exception applies.
2.  Within 30 days of the conclusion of the review period directed in
    Executive Order 14219 to identify unlawful and potentially unlawful
    regulations, agencies shall submit to the Office of Information and
    Regulatory Affairs a one-page summary of each regulation that was
    initially identified as falling within one of the categories
    specified in section 2(a) of that Executive Order, but which has not
    been targeted for repeal, explaining the basis for the decision not
    to repeal that regulation.
