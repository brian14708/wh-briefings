title: 418TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FIRST LANDING AND THE RAISING OF THE CAPE HENRY CROSS
---
 
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  
  
A PROCLAMATION

Four hundred and eighteen years ago, more than 100 men completed a
grueling 144-day voyage from the countryside of England to the mouth of
the Chesapeake Bay in search of opportunity in the New World.  
Commissioned by King James I and the Virginia Company of London, these
intrepid settlers charted three small ships — the Susan Constant, the
Godspeed, and the Discovery — to set sail on a perilous journey across
the Atlantic to expand the reach of the English Crown into unknown
lands, create a better future for their families, and further the “Glory
of His Divine Majesty.”  
Known as the “First Landing,” the seeds of America’s destiny were sown
when this courageous band of Christians erected a towering wooden cross
at the crest of Cape Henry, Virginia.  Under the First Charter of
Virginia, which commissioned the voyage, they consecrated the New World,
gave thanks to God for their safe passage, and dedicated the land to His
glory.  The raising of the Cape Henry Cross was a visible symbol of the
covenant the settlers made on their first day in the New World — for
themselves and their posterity — to obey God, seek His blessing, and
place their trust in Him.  
Within weeks, the men traveled inland to establish Jamestown — the first
permanent English settlement in the New World.  “We hope to plant a
nation where none before hath stood,” one early settler sang in a
ballad.  In the months and years that followed, the settlers at
Jamestown would face grave dangers and extraordinary challenges,
including a severe drought, starvation, and disease.  By the first
year’s end, only 38 of the original 104 men had survived.  Yet, by the
grace of God, Jamestown endured and the American spirit of courage,
strength, and determination was born.  
Today, a majestic granite cross stands on those same hallowed shores as
a testament to the steadfast Christian belief of the Jamestown settlers
that God’s grace abides, His mercy is abundant, and His glory is
everlasting.  Our Nation honors the heroic souls whose faithful devotion
and uncommon courage more than 400 years ago foreshadowed the birth of
the greatest Republic in the history of the world — and it is in their
memory that we pledge to forge a future that always celebrates our
history, honors our heritage, and glorifies our God Almighty.   
More than four centuries after the First Landing, we prayerfully renew
our covenant to always be one Nation under God and to always seek His
blessing and protection.  
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 29, 2025, as a
day in celebration of the 418th anniversary of the First Landing and the
Raising of the Cross at Cape Henry, Virginia, by the Jamestown
settlers.  
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-ninth.  
   
   
   
                               DONALD J. TRUMP
