title: Advancing Artificial Intelligence Education for American Youth
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.  Artificial
intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the modern world, driving
innovation across industries, enhancing productivity, and reshaping the
way we live and work.  To ensure the United States remains a global
leader in this technological revolution, we must provide our Nation’s
youth with opportunities to cultivate the skills and understanding
necessary to use and create the next generation of AI technology.  By
fostering AI competency, we will equip our students with the
foundational knowledge and skills necessary to adapt to and thrive in an
increasingly digital society.  Early learning and exposure to AI
concepts not only demystifies this powerful technology but also sparks
curiosity and creativity, preparing students to become active and
responsible participants in the workforce of the future and nurturing
the next generation of American AI innovators to propel our Nation to
new heights of scientific and economic achievement.  
To achieve this vision, we must also invest in our educators and equip
them with the tools and knowledge to not only train students about AI,
but also to utilize AI in their classrooms to improve educational
outcomes.  Professional development programs focused on AI education
will empower educators to confidently guide students through this
complex and evolving field.  Educators, industry leaders, and employers
who rely on an AI-skilled workforce should partner to create educational
programs that equip students with essential AI skills and competencies
across all learning pathways.  While AI education in kindergarten
through twelfth grade (K-12) is critical, our Nation must also make
resources available for lifelong learners to develop new skills for a
changing workforce.  By establishing a strong framework that integrates
early student exposure with comprehensive teacher training and other
resources for workforce development, we can ensure that every American
has the opportunity to learn about AI from the earliest stages of their
educational journey through postsecondary education, fostering a culture
of innovation and critical thinking that will solidify our Nation’s
leadership in the AI-driven future.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of the United States to promote AI literacy and proficiency among
Americans by promoting the appropriate integration of AI into education,
providing comprehensive AI training for educators, and fostering early
exposure to AI concepts and technology to develop an AI-ready workforce
and the next generation of American AI innovators.
