title: Transparency Regarding Foreign Influence at American Universities
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose and Policy</span>. 
Section 117 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, 20 U.S.C. 1011f,
requires institutions of higher education to report significant sources
of foreign funding.  But, because section 117 has not been robustly
enforced, the true amounts, sources, and purposes of foreign money
flowing to American campuses are unknown.  From 2010 to 2016, according
to one study, universities failed to disclose more than half of
reportable foreign gifts.  Even when foreign funding is reported, its
true sources are often hidden. 

Protecting American educational, cultural, and national security
interests requires transparency regarding foreign funds flowing to
American higher education and research institutions.  During my first
term, the Department of Education opened investigations on 19 campuses
from 2019-2021, which led universities to report $6.5 billion in
previously undisclosed foreign funds.  Yet the prior administration
undid this work, moving the Department of Education’s specialized
investigatory work on foreign funds to a unit ill-equipped to perform
it, undermining investigations, and hindering public access to
information on foreign gifts and contracts.

It is the policy of my Administration to end the secrecy surrounding
foreign funds in American educational institutions, protect the
marketplace of ideas from propaganda sponsored by foreign governments,
and safeguard America’s students and research from foreign exploitation.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Robust Enforcement to Prevent
Harm to American Interests</span>.  The Secretary of Education
(Secretary) shall take all appropriate actions to enforce the
requirements of section 1011f of title 20, United States Code, including
by working with the Attorney General and the heads of other executive
departments, agencies, and offices, where appropriate, to require
complete and timely disclosure by higher education institutions of
foreign funding.  These actions shall include the following:  

\(a\)  the Secretary shall take appropriate steps to reverse or rescind
any actions by the prior administration that permit higher education
institutions to maintain improper secrecy regarding their foreign
funding;

\(b\)  the Secretary shall take appropriate steps to require
universities to more specifically disclose details about foreign
funding, including the true source and purpose of the funds;

\(c\)  the Secretary shall provide the American people with greater
access to information about foreign funding to higher education
institutions; and

\(d\)  the Secretary and the Attorney General shall hold accountable
higher education institutions that fail to comply with the law
concerning disclosure of foreign funding.  In furtherance of this
directive, the Secretary shall work with the heads of other executive
departments, agencies, and offices, where appropriate, to conduct audits
and investigations as appropriate and where necessary to ensure
compliance with the law concerning disclosure of foreign funding and
shall seek enforcement through appropriate action by the Attorney
General.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Compliance by Federal Funding
Recipients</span>.  The Secretary of Education and the heads of other
appropriate executive departments and agencies shall take appropriate
action, as consistent with applicable law, to prospectively ensure that
certification of compliance by higher education institutions with 20
U.S.C. 1011f and any other applicable foreign funding disclosure
requirements is material for purposes of 31 U.S.C. 3729 and for receipt
of appropriate Federal grant funds, which shall not be provided in cases
of noncompliance with 20 U.S.C. 1011f and any other applicable foreign
funding disclosure requirements.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. 
(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

\(c\)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

\(d\)  If any provision of this order, or the application of any
provision to any agency, person or circumstance, is held to be invalid,
the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any
other agencies, persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

THE WHITE HOUSE,
