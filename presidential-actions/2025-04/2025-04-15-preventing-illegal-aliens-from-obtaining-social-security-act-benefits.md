MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL  
THE SECRETARY OF LABOR  
THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES  
THE SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY  
THE COMMISSIONER OF SOCIAL SECURITY  
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY  
ADMINISTRATION

SUBJECT:       Preventing Illegal Aliens from Obtaining Social Security
Act Benefits

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Responsibility for Determining
Eligibility for Public Benefits</span>.  (a)  As set forth in Executive
Order 14218 of February 19, 2025 (Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open
Borders), both Federal law (title IV of the Personal Responsibility and
Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193)) and
principles of sound administration demand that taxpayer-funded benefits
be provided only to eligible persons and not encourage or reward illegal
immigration to the United States.  This interest is especially
compelling with respect to Social Security Act benefits, which demand
strict policing of fraud, waste, and abuse to ensure future eligible
individuals receive the benefits to which they are entitled. 
Consequently, this memorandum gives additional direction for
implementing Executive Order 14218 with regard to Social Security Act
programs.

(b)  The Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Health and Human Services,
and the Commissioner of Social Security, in consultation with the
Secretary of Homeland Security as necessary, shall take all reasonable
measures, consistent with applicable law, to ensure ineligible aliens
are not receiving funds from Social Security Act programs.  Such
measures shall include promulgating any necessary guidance or
regulations regarding Social Security Act funds and, to the extent
appropriate and consistent with law, prioritizing civil or
administrative enforcement actions against States, localities, or other
similar grantees or subgrantees that do not take adequate measures to
verify eligibility, stop payments to deceased or otherwise ineligible
payees, or otherwise prevent ineligible aliens from receiving funds from
Social Security Act programs.

(c)  The Attorney General and the Commissioner of Social Security shall
cooperate to detail and credential such Special Assistant United States
Attorneys as are necessary to expand the Social Security
Administration’s (SSA) full-time fraud prosecutor program to at least 50
United States Attorney Offices by October 1, 2025.  Likewise, the
Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall
cooperate to establish a similar fraud-prosecutor program utilizing
Special Assistant United States Attorneys with regard to programs
administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which
shall operate in at least 15 United States Attorney Offices by October
1, 2025.  Detailees in both programs shall emphasize prosecutions of
identity theft and beneficiary-side fraud.  To the extent feasible, the
Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services or the
Commissioner of Social Security, as applicable, shall prioritize
assigning new detailees in both programs to the 10 United States
Attorney Offices whose jurisdictions encompass the largest known
populations of illegal aliens, as determined by the Secretary of
Homeland Security.

(d)  The risk of beneficiary- or recipient-side fraud and abuse by
illegal aliens shall also be reduced through other program-integrity
measures.

(i)    The Inspector General of the SSA noted in a July 2023 audit that
death information regarding millions of deceased number holders is
missing from the agency’s files, which obstructs efforts to prevent and
detect fraud and improper payments across the Government with respect to
executive departments and agencies that rely on SSA’s information.  The
Commissioner of Social Security shall fully implement the
recommendations in the Inspector General of the SSA’s Audit Report
A-06-21-51022.  The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall
cooperate fully with such implementation.

(ii)   The same audit report revealed that the SSA does not investigate
or attempt to resolve reports of earnings received by individuals age
100 or older if the SSA has not recorded death information for such
individuals, even when the reported wage-earner does not match the name
or other personally identifiable information in SSA records, which may
indicate identity theft, illegal work, tax evasion, or other unlawful
activity.  The Commissioner of Social Security shall refer promptly to
the Inspector General of the SSA all earnings reports for persons age
100 or older when the purported wage-earner’s name does not match SSA’s
files.  The Inspector General of the SSA shall investigate such matters
as appropriate and refer matters to the Department of Justice, other
executive departments and agencies, or local prosecutors as warranted.

(iii)  Finally, within 60 days of the date of this memorandum, the
Commissioner of Social Security shall review whether, and under what
conditions, SSA should resume pursuing civil monetary penalties under
section 1129 of the Social Security Act.  If the Commissioner of Social
Security determines that resumption is warranted, he shall either resume
such program immediately or pursue regulatory or policy changes that
would allow its resumption in a timely manner.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.  (a)
 Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\)  This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable
law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c)  This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(d)  The Commissioner of Social Security is authorized and directed to
publish this memorandum in the *Federal Register*.
