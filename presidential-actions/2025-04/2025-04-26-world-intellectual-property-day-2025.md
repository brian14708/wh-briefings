title: World Intellectual Property Day, 2025

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  
   
A PROCLAMATION

  
       More than 200 years ago, our Founding Fathers recognized the
profound importance of intellectual property, enshrining
government-granted legal protections in the Constitution to safeguard
American innovation.  On World Intellectual Property Day, we renew our
resolve to protect and secure the creative triumphs of American
inventors and artists as they work to pull the future into the present
and turn their dreams into our reality.  
     Americans have always been leaders in the realms of technology and
ideas — and under my Administration, we are driving innovation in every
sector, including emerging digital technologies like artificial
intelligence.  I recently signed an Executive Order on Removing Barriers
to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence to slash red tape and
ensure our continued leadership in this and other critical industries
like automation, blockchain, data analytics, and cybersecurity.  
     For this reason, I established the Council of Advisors on Science
and Technology, which is bringing together the best and brightest to
shape the United States’ innovation policy and ensure our continued
technological leadership.  My Administration will not waver in
protecting and securing emerging, next-generation technologies that will
drive progress and growth in the 21st century.  
     My Administration is taking strong action to protect the promise of
American innovation.  For too long, our adversaries and allies alike
have sapped our strength and exploited American advancements.  Through
the strategic use of tariffs, we are recentering our trade policy and
securing stronger intellectual property protections in new and existing
trade deals.  Just as we protect our physical property, we will not
tolerate the theft of our intellectual property, and we will defend our
businesses and people from those who are seeking to steal American jobs
and wealth.  
     As President Calvin Coolidge once said in an immortal maxim that
remains true to this day, “The business of America is business.”  Our
economy is the greatest in the world because we, more than any other
country, incentivize individuals to dream big, take risks, and make the
impossible possible.  Through our promotion and protection of
intellectual property, we are empowering musicians, writers, authors,
scientists, and inventors to focus on what they do best.  
     The future of our great Nation depends on the continued
safeguarding of our intellectual property, which fuels economic growth,
technological progress, and global competitiveness.  This World
Intellectual Property Day, we reaffirm our unwavering commitment to
protecting and promoting the innovative spirit that continues to make
America great.  
     NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States
of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 26, 2025, as
World Intellectual Property Day.  I encourage Americans to celebrate the
extraordinary achievements of our creators and inventors and the
contributions they have made and will continue making to our country.  
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth
day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-ninth.  
  
  
DONALD J. TRUMP
