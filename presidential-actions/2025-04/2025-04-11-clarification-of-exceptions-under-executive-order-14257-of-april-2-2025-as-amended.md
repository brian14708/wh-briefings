MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE

THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY

THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE

THE SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY

THE UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE

THE ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT FOR ECONOMIC POLICY

THE ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT FOR NATIONAL SECURITY AFFAIRS

THE SENIOR COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT FOR TRADE AND MANUFACTURING

THE CHAIR OF THE UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION  
 

SUBJECT:       Clarification of Exceptions Under Executive

Order 14257 of April 2, 2025, as Amended  
 

In Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a
Reciprocal Tariff to Rectify Trade Practices that Contribute to Large
and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), I declared a
national emergency arising from conditions reflected in large and
persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits, and imposed additional *ad
valorem* duties that I deemed necessary and appropriate to deal with
that unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or
substantial part outside the United States, to the national security and
economy of the United States.

In Executive Order 14257, I stated that certain goods are not subject to
the *ad valorem* rates of duty under that order.  One of those excepted
products is “semiconductors.”  The subsequent orders issued in
connection with Executive Order 14257 — i.e.,  Executive Order 14259 of
April 8, 2025 (Amendment to Reciprocal Tariffs and Updated Duties as
Applied to Low-Value Imports from the People’s Republic of China), and
the Executive Order of April 9, 2025 (Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates
to Reflect Trading Partner Retaliation and Alignment), (Subsequent
Orders) — incorporate the exceptions in Executive Order 14257, including
for “semiconductors.”

That term’s meaning includes the products classified in the following
headings and subheadings of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United
States (HTSUS):

·       8471

·       847330

·       8486

·       85171300

·       85176200

·       85235100

·       8524

·       85285200

·       85411000

·       85412100

·       85412900

·       85413000

·       85414910

·       85414970

·       85414980

·       85414995

·       85415100

·       85415900

·       85419000

·       8542

To the extent that the HTSUS does not currently fully reflect the
products listed above as excepted from the *ad valorem* duties imposed
under Executive Order 14257 and the Subsequent Orders, the HTSUS shall
be modified by inserting in numerical order the headings and subheadings
listed above into subdivision (v)(iii) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter III
of chapter 99, effective as of 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April
5, 2025.  Any duties that were collected at or after 12:01 a.m. eastern
daylight time on April 5, 2025, pursuant to Executive Order 14257 and
the Subsequent Orders, on imports that are excepted under Executive
Order 14257 and the Subsequent Orders because they are “semiconductors,”
as explained in this memorandum, shall be refunded in accordance with
U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s standard procedures for such
refunds.

As explained in Executive Order 14257 and the Subsequent Orders, the
Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative, in
consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury,
the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Assistant to the President for
Economic Policy, the Assistant to the President for National Security
Affairs, the Senior Counselor to the President for Trade and
Manufacturing, and the Chair of the United States International Trade
Commission, are authorized to employ all powers granted to the President
by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et
seq*.) as may be necessary to implement Executive Order 14257 and the
Subsequent Orders.  Measures taken to implement Executive Order 14257
and the Subsequent Orders shall be done in accordance with this
memorandum.
