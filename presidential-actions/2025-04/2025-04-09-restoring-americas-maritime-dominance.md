title: "Restoring America\u2019s Maritime Dominance"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  The
commercial shipbuilding capacity and maritime workforce of the United
States has been weakened by decades of Government neglect, leading to
the decline of a once strong industrial base while simultaneously
empowering our adversaries and eroding United States national security. 
Both our allies and our strategic competitors produce ships for a
fraction of the cost needed in the United States.  Recent data shows
that the United States constructs less than one percent of commercial
ships globally, while the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is
responsible for producing approximately half.  
Rectifying these issues requires a comprehensive approach that includes
securing consistent, predictable, and durable Federal funding, making
United States-flagged and built vessels commercially competitive in
international commerce, rebuilding America’s maritime manufacturing
capabilities (the Maritime Industrial Base), and expanding and
strengthening the recruitment, training, and retention of the relevant
workforce.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of the United States to revitalize and rebuild domestic maritime
industries and workforce to promote national security and economic
prosperity.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Maritime Action Plan</span>. 
(a)  Within 210 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the
President for National Security Affairs (APNSA), in coordination with
the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of
Commerce, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Transportation, the
Secretary of Homeland Security, the United States Trade Representative
(USTR), and the heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies)
the APNSA deems appropriate, shall submit a Maritime Action Plan (MAP)
to the President, through the APNSA and the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB Director) to achieve the policy set forth in
this order.  
(b)  The OMB Director, in coordination with the APNSA, shall be
responsible for all legislative, regulatory, and fiscal assessments
related to the MAP.    
(c)  The MAP shall, to the extent permissible and consistent with
applicable law, including the Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 8301–8305),
reflect actions taken pursuant to sections 4 through 21 of this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Ensure the Security and
Resilience of the Maritime Industrial Base</span>.  Within 180 days of
the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with
the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Transportation, and the
Secretary of Homeland Security, shall provide to the APNSA and the OMB
Director for inclusion in the MAP an assessment of options both for the
use of available authorities and resources, such as Defense Production
Act Title III authorities, and for the use of private capital to the
maximum extent possible to invest in and expand the Maritime Industrial
Base including, but not limited to, investment and expansion of
commercial and defense shipbuilding capabilities, component supply
chains, ship repair and marine transportation capabilities, port
infrastructure, and the adjacent workforce.  The Secretary of Defense
shall pursue using the Office of Strategic Capital loan program to
improve the shipbuilding industrial base.  As part of their assessment,
the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Transportation, and the
Secretary of Homeland Security shall:  
(a)  identify key maritime components in the supply chain that are
essential for rebuilding and expanding the Maritime Industrial Base and
that should be prioritized for investment;  
(b)  ensure that their recommendations of public and private investments
are made according to a clear metric, derived in consultation with the
Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, of return on invested
capital for the United States taxpayer and to the economic and national
security of the United States; and  
(c)  ensure that their recommendations take into consideration the
projected increases to commercial and defense capabilities, the
projected growth in economic activity, and the projected benefits for
taxpayers and the workforce.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Actions
in the Investigation of the PRC’s Unfair Targeting of Maritime,
Logistics, and Shipbuilding Sectors</span>. (a)  With respect to the
actions, if any, that the USTR determines to take consistent with the
USTR’s notice of public hearing entitled Proposed Action in Section 301
Investigation of the PRC’s Targeting of the Maritime, Logistics, and
Shipbuilding Sectors for Dominance, 90 *Fed*. *Reg*. 10843 (February 27,
2025), the USTR shall:  
(i)   coordinate with appropriate agencies to collect additional
information, as appropriate and to the extent permitted by law, in
support of administering such actions; and   
(ii)  coordinate with the Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland
Security to take appropriate steps to enforce any restriction, fee,
penalty, or duty imposed pursuant to such actions.  
(b)  Based on the USTR’s determinations arising out of its Section 301
investigation into the PRC’s targeting of the maritime, logistics, and
shipbuilding sectors, the USTR shall also consider taking all necessary
steps permitted by law to propose the following actions:  
(i)   tariffs on ship-to-shore cranes manufactured, assembled, or made
using components of PRC origin, or manufactured anywhere in the world by
a company owned, controlled, or substantially influenced by a PRC
national; and  
(ii)  tariffs on other cargo handling equipment.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Enforce Collection of Harbor
Maintenance Fee and Other Charges</span>.  In order to prevent cargo
carriers from circumventing the Harbor Maintenance Fee (HMF) on imported
goods through the practice of making port in Canada or Mexico and
sending their cargo into the United States through land borders, and to
ensure the collection of other charges as applicable, the Secretary of
Homeland Security shall take all necessary steps, including proposing
new legislation, as permitted by law to:  
(a)  require all foreign-origin cargo arriving by vessel to clear the
Customs and Border Protection (CBP) entry process at a United States
port of entry for security and collection of all applicable duties,
customs, taxes, fees, interest, and other charges; and  
(b)  ensure any foreign-origin cargo first arriving by vessel to North
America clearing the CBP process at an inland location from the country
of land transit (Canada or Mexico) is assessed applicable customs,
duties, taxes, fees (including the HMF), interest, and other charges
plus a 10 percent service fee for additional costs to the CBP, so long
as the cargo being shipped into the United States is not substantially
transformed from its condition at the time of arrival into the country
of land transit (with the discretion for such decisions to be determined
by CBP).

consultation with the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy,
shall recommend to the APNSA and the OMB Director for inclusion in the
MAP all available incentives to help shipbuilders domiciled in allied
nations partner to undertake capital investment in the United States to
help strengthen the shipbuilding capacity of the United States.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">9</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Launch a Maritime Security
Trust Fund</span>.  In conjunction with the formulation of the
President’s Budget, the OMB Director shall, in coordination with the
Secretary of Transportation, develop a legislative proposal, which shall
be described in detail in the MAP, to establish a Maritime Security
Trust Fund that can serve as a reliable funding source to deliver
consistent support for MAP programs.  This proposal shall consider how
new or existing tariff revenue, fines, fees, or tax revenue could
further the goal of establishing a more reliable, dedicated funding
source for programs support by the MAP.
