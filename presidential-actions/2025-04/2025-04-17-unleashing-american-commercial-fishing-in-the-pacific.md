title: Unleashing American Commercial Fishing in the Pacific
---
 
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  
  
A PROCLAMATION

The Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument (PRIMNM) was
established by Proclamation 8336 of January 6, 2009 (Establishment of
the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument), and then further
expanded by Proclamation 9173 of September 25, 2014 (Pacific Remote
Islands Marine National Monument Expansion).  Under these monument
proclamations, over 400,000 square miles in the Pacific Ocean were
appropriated and withdrawn from all forms of entry, location, selection,
sale, leasing, or other disposition under the public land laws for care
and management by the Federal Government.  
The PRIMNM was established to protect and preserve the lands and marine
environment around Wake, Baker, Howland, and Jarvis Islands; Johnston
and Palmyra Atolls; Kingman Reef; and the historic and scientific
objects therein.  These objects include fish, birds, marine mammals,
coral, and the general biodiversity of the ecosystems encompassed by the
PRIMNM.  
As part of the management of the PRIMNM, commercial fishing is currently
prohibited within its boundaries.  As explained herein, following
further consideration of the nature of the objects identified in
Proclamations 8336 and 9173 and the protection of those objects already
provided by relevant law, I find that appropriately managed commercial
fishing would not put the objects of scientific and historic interest
that the PRIMNM protects at risk.  
With respect to fish in particular, fisheries in the region are
effectively managed by the National Marine Fisheries Service and the
Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council.  Management of the
PRIMNM is doing little to guard fish populations against overfishing as
tunas and other pelagic species found within the boundaries of the
PRIMNM are migratory in nature, and do not permanently reside within the
PRIMNM.  
As a result of the prohibitions on commercial fishing, American fishing
fleets have lost access to nearly half of the United States’ Exclusive
Economic Zone in the Pacific Islands.  This has driven American
fishermen to fish further offshore in international waters to compete
against poorly regulated and highly subsidized foreign fleets.  This
disadvantages honest United States commercial fishermen and is
detrimental for United States territories like American Samoa, whose
private sector economy is over 80 percent dependent on the fishing
industry.  
Proclamations 8336 and 9173 do not list recreational fishing as a threat
to local fish populations within the PRIMNM.  A host of Federal
protections exist under current laws and agency management designations
to protect the area’s natural resources, vulnerable marine species, and
unique habitats, such as coral and seamount ecosystems.These laws
include the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16
U.S.C. 1801 *et seq.*), the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Endangered
Species Act) (16 U.S.C. 1531 *et seq.*), the Migratory Bird Treaty Act
(16 U.S.C. 703-712), the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration
Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668dd-668ee), the Refuge Recreation Act (16
U.S.C. 460k *et seq.*), the Marine Mammal Protection Act (16 U.S.C.
1361 *et seq.*), the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 *et seq.*), the Oil
Pollution Act of 1990 (Oil Pollution Act) (33 U.S.C. 2701*et seq.*), and
Title I of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (Ocean
Dumping Act), 33 U.S.C. 1401 *et seq.*  For example, the Endangered
Species Act generally prohibits the taking of listed fish and wildlife
species, and also generally ensures that Federal actions, including
fisheries management, are not likely to jeopardize the continued
existence of any such species nor adversely modify designated critical
habitats.  Numerous other statutes, including the Clean Water Act, the
Oil Pollution Act, and the Ocean Dumping Act, address both land-based
and ocean-based sources of pollution and help ensure that water quality
conditions support the conservation values of the Pacific Remote Island
ecosystems.  
Therefore, I find that appropriately managed commercial fishing would
not put objects of scientific and historic interest within the PRIMNM at
risk.  
After further consideration of the nature of the objects identified in
Proclamations 8336 and 9173 and the protection of those objects already
provided by the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act
and other relevant laws, I find that a prohibition on commercial fishing
is not, at this time, necessary for the proper care and management of
the PRIMNM or the objects of historic or scientific interest therein.  
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws
of the United States, including section 320301 of title 54,
United States Code (Antiquities Act), hereby proclaim that:  
(a)  All language under the section entitled “Management of the Marine
National Monument” in Proclamation 9173 is deleted and replaced with the
following:  
“Nothing in this proclamation shall change the management of the Pacific
Remote Islands Marine National Monument as specified in Proclamation
8336.  The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary
of Commerce, shall have primary responsibility for management of the
Monument Expansion pursuant to applicable legal authorities.  The
Secretary of Commerce, through the Administrator of the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration, and in consultation with the Secretary
of the Interior, shall within the Monument Expansion have primary
responsibility with respect to fishery-related activities regulated
pursuant to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act
(16 U.S.C. 1801 *et seq.*), and any other applicable legal authorities.
 The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior shall not
allow or permit any appropriation, injury, destruction, or removal of
any object of the Monument Expansion except as provided for by this
proclamation as modified by the Proclamation of April 17, 2025
(Unleashing American Commercial Fishing in the Pacific).  
Between 50 to 200 nautical miles from the landward boundaries of the
Monument, the Secretary of Commerce shall not prohibit commercial
fishing within the boundaries of the Monument and the Monument Expansion
in those areas where the Monument and Monument Expansion is coterminous
with the Exclusive Economic Zone of the United States.  The
implementation of any regulation of commercial fishing within the
Monument and the Monument Expansion shall be done in coordination with
the Secretary of Defense.  Only United States flagged vessels shall be
allowed to commercially fish within the boundaries of the Monument and
the Monument Expansion, except that permits may be issued to foreign
flagged vessels to transship fish harvested by United States
fishermen.  
The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior shall take
appropriate action pursuant to their respective authorities under the
Antiquities Act; the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and
Management Act; and such other authorities as may be available to
implement this proclamation, to regulate fisheries, and to ensure proper
care and management of the Monument Expansion.  
The United States shall continue to preserve the freedom of the seas
(i.e., all of the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea
recognized in international law and enjoyed by all nations, including
the conduct of military activities, exercises, and surveys in or over
the Exclusive Economic Zone of the United States), and to protect the
training, readiness, and global mobility of the United States Armed
Forces as United States national interests that are essential to the
peace and prosperity of civilized nations.  
The Secretary of Defense shall continue to manage Wake Island and
Johnston Atoll as specified in Proclamation 8336.”.  
(b)  The Secretary of Commerce, through the Administrator of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, shall expeditiously
publish new proposed rules in the *Federal Register* to amend or repeal
all burdensome regulations that restrict commercial fishing in the
PRIMNM.  
Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to revoke, modify, or
affect any withdrawal, reservation, or appropriation, other than the one
created by Proclamations 8336 and 9173.  
Nothing in this proclamation shall change the management of the areas
designated and reserved by Proclamations 8336 and 9173, except as
explicitly provided in this proclamation.  
If any provision of this proclamation, including its application to a
particular parcel of land, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this
proclamation and its application to other parcels of land shall not be
affected thereby.  
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
seventeenth day of April, in the year of our Lord
two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States
of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.  
  
  
  
                              DONALD J. TRUMP
