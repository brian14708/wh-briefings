title: "Strengthening and Unleashing America\u2019s Law Enforcement to Pursue Criminals\
  \ and Protect Innocent Citizens"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose
and Policy</span>.  Safe communities rely on the backbone and heroism of
a tough and well-equipped police force.  My Administration is
steadfastly committed to empowering State and local law enforcement to
firmly police dangerous criminal behavior and protect innocent
citizens.   
When local leaders demonize law enforcement and impose legal and
political handcuffs that make aggressively enforcing the law impossible,
crime thrives and innocent citizens and small business owners suffer. 
My Administration will therefore:  establish best practices at the State
and local level for cities to unleash high-impact local police forces;
protect and defend law enforcement officers wrongly accused and abused
by State or local officials; and surge resources to officers in need. 
My Administration will work to ensure that law enforcement officers
across America focus on ending crime, not pursuing harmful, illegal
race- and sex-based “equity” policies.   
The result will be a law-abiding society in which tenacious law
enforcement officers protect the innocent, violations of law are not
tolerated, and American communities are safely enjoyed by all their
citizens again.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Legal Defense of Law
Enforcement Officers</span>*.*  The Attorney General shall take all
appropriate action to create a mechanism to provide legal resources and
indemnification to law enforcement officers who unjustly incur expenses
and liabilities for actions taken during the performance of their
official duties to enforce the law.  This mechanism shall include the
use of private-sector pro bono assistance for such law enforcement
officers.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Empowering State and Local Law
Enforcement</span>*.*  (a) The Attorney General and other appropriate
heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall take all
appropriate action to maximize the use of Federal resources to:

State and local law enforcement;  
(iii)  increase pay and benefits for law enforcement officers;  
(iv)   strengthen and expand legal protections for law enforcement

(vii)  increase the investment in and collection, distribution, and
uniformity of crime data across jurisdictions.  
(b)  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Attorney General
shall review all ongoing Federal consent decrees, out-of-court
agreements, and post-judgment orders to which a State or local law
enforcement agency is a party and modify, rescind, or move to conclude
such measures that unduly impede the performance of law enforcement
functions.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Using
National Security Assets for Law and Order</span>.  (a)  Within 90 days
of the date of this order, the Attorney General and the Secretary of
Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the
heads of agencies as appropriate, shall increase the provision of excess
military and national security assets in local jurisdictions to assist
State and local law enforcement.  
(b)  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense,
in coordination with the Attorney General, shall determine how military
and national security assets, training, non-lethal capabilities, and
personnel can most effectively be utilized to prevent crime.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Holding State and Local
Officials Accountable</span>. The Attorney General shall pursue all
necessary legal remedies and enforcement measures to enforce the rights
of Americans impacted by crime and shall prioritize prosecution of any
applicable violations of Federal criminal law with respect to State and
local jurisdictions whose officials:  
(a)  willfully and unlawfully direct the obstruction of criminal law,
including by directly and unlawfully prohibiting law enforcement
officers from carrying out duties necessary for public safety and law
enforcement; or      
(b)  unlawfully engage in discrimination or civil-rights violations
under the guise of “diversity, equity, and inclusion” initiatives that
restrict law enforcement activity or endanger citizens.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Use of Homeland Security Task
Forces</span>*.*  The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland
Security shall utilize the Homeland Security Task Forces (HSTFs) formed
in accordance with Executive Order 14159 of January 20, 2025 (Protecting
the American People Against Invasion) to coordinate and advance the
objectives of this order.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">7</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">General
Provisions</span>.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to
impair or otherwise affect:

i\. the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

ii\. the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.  
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.  
(d)  The Department of Justice shall provide funding for this order’s
publication in the *Federal Register*.
