title: "Unleashing America\u2019s Offshore Critical Minerals and Resources"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.  The United
States has a core national security and economic interest in maintaining
leadership in deep sea science and technology and seabed mineral
resources.  The United States faces unprecedented economic and national
security challenges in securing reliable supplies of critical minerals
independent of foreign adversary control.  Vast offshore seabed areas
hold critical minerals and energy resources.  These resources are key to
strengthening our economy, securing our energy future, and reducing
dependence on foreign suppliers for critical minerals.  The United
States also controls seabed mineral resources in one of the largest
ocean areas of the world.  Our Nation can, through the exercise of
existing authorities and by establishing international partnerships,
access potentially vast resources in seabed polymetallic nodules; other
subsea geologic structures; and coastal deposits containing strategic
minerals such as nickel, cobalt, copper, manganese, titanium, and rare
earth elements, which are vital to our national security and economic
prosperity.  
Our Nation must take immediate action to accelerate the responsible
development of seabed mineral resources, quantify the Nation’s endowment
of seabed minerals, reinvigorate American leadership in associated
extraction and processing technologies, and ensure secure supply chains
for our defense, infrastructure, and energy sectors.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of the United States to advance United States leadership in
seabed mineral development by:  
(a)  rapidly developing domestic capabilities for the exploration,
characterization, collection, and processing of seabed mineral resources
through streamlined permitting without compromising environmental and
transparency standards;  
(b)  supporting investment in deep sea science, mapping, and
technology;  
(c)  enhancing coordination among executive departments and agencies
(agencies) with respect to seabed mineral development activities
described in this order;  
(d)  establishing the United States as a global leader in responsible
seabed mineral exploration, development technologies, and practices, and
as a partner for countries developing seabed mineral resources in areas
within their national jurisdictions, including their Exclusive Economic
Zones (EEZ);  
(e)  creating a robust domestic supply chain for critical minerals
derived from seabed resources to support economic growth,
reindustrialization, and military preparedness, including through new
processing capabilities; and  
(f)  strengthening partnerships with allies and industry to counter
China’s growing influence over seabed mineral resources and to ensure
United States companies are well-positioned to support allies and
partners interested in developing seabed minerals responsibly in areas
within their national jurisdictions, including their EEZs.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Strategic Seabed Critical
Mineral Access</span>.  Within 60 days of the date of this order:  
(a)  The Secretary of Commerce shall:  
(i)    acting through the Administrator of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, and in consultation with the Secretary of
State and the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of
the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, expedite the process for
reviewing and issuing seabed mineral exploration licenses and commercial
recovery permits in areas beyond national jurisdiction under the Deep
Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act (30 U.S.C. 1401 *et seq*.), consistent
with applicable law.  The expedited process, consistent with applicable
law, should ensure efficiency, predictability, and competitiveness for
American companies;  
(ii)   in coordination with the Secretary of the Interior and the
Secretary of Energy, and in consultation with the heads of other
relevant agencies, provide a report to the Assistant to the President
for Economic Policy, the Chair of the National Energy Dominance Council,
and the Vice Chair of the National Energy Dominance Council that
identifies:  
(A)  private sector interest and opportunities for seabed mineral
resource exploration, mining, and environmental monitoring in the United
States Outer Continental Shelf; in areas beyond national jurisdiction;
and in areas within the national jurisdictions of certain other nations
that express interest in partnering with United States companies on
seabed mineral development; and  
(B)  private sector interest and opportunities for polymetallic nodule
and other seabed mineral resource processing capacity in the United
States or on United States-flagged vessels; and  
(iii)  in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the
Interior, and the heads of other relevant agencies, and in cooperation
with commercial and other non-governmental organizations, develop a plan
to map priority areas of the seabed, such as those with abundant or
accessible undersea resources, in order to accelerate data collection
and characterization, prioritizing areas within the United States Outer
Continental Shelf.  
(b)  The Secretary of the Interior shall:  
(i)   establish an expedited process for reviewing and approving permits
for prospecting and granting leases for exploration, development, and
production of seabed mineral resources within the United States Outer
Continental Shelf under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C.
1331 *et seq.*), consistent with applicable law.  The expedited process,
consistent with applicable law, should ensure efficiency,
predictability, and competitiveness for American companies; and  
(ii)  identify which critical minerals may be derived from seabed
resources and coordinate with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary
of Energy to indicate which critical minerals are essential for
applications such as defense infrastructure, manufacturing, and
energy.  
(c)  The Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with the Secretary of
State, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Secretary of Energy,
shall:  
(i)   engage with key partners and allies to offer support for seabed
mineral resource exploration, extraction, processing, and environmental
monitoring in areas within the national jurisdictions of those partners
and allies, including by seeking scientific collaboration and commercial
development opportunities for United States companies, and by developing
a prioritized list of countries for engagement; and  
(ii)  provide a joint report to the Assistant to the President for
Economic Policy, the Chair of the National Energy Dominance Council, and
the Vice Chair of the National Energy Dominance Council on the
feasibility of an international benefit-sharing mechanism for seabed
mineral resource extraction and development that occurs in areas beyond
