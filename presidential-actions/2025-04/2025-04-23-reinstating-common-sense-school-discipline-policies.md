title: Reinstating Common Sense School Discipline Policies
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, and to ensure safety and order in
American classrooms, it is hereby ordered:  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline"> Purpose and Policy</span>.
 The Federal Government will no longer tolerate known risks to
children’s safety and well-being in the classroom that result from the
application of school discipline based on discriminatory and unlawful
“equity” ideology.  
  
 In January 2014, the Department of Education and the Department of
Justice jointly issued a “Dear Colleague” letter regarding school
discipline.  In that letter, the Department of Education and the
Department of Justice explained that schools could be found to violate
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 — and therefore could lose
Federal funding — if their disciplinary decisions ran afoul of a newly
imposed disparate-impact framework under which race-neutral disciplinary
policies, applied in an even-handed manner, may be improper if members
of any racial groups are suspended, expelled, or referred to law
enforcement at higher rates than others.  The letter effectively
required schools to discriminate on the basis of race by imposing
discipline based on racial characteristics, rather than on objective
behavior alone.   
  
The consequences harmed students and schools.  A 2018 report from the
Federal Commission on School Safety (Commission) noted evidence that,
because of the 2014 letter, “schools ignored or covered up — rather than
disciplined — student misconduct in order to avoid any purported racial
disparity in discipline numbers that might catch the eye of the federal
government.”  As a result, students who should have been suspended or
expelled for dangerous behavior remained in the classroom, making all
students less safe.   
  
As the Commission found:  “When school leaders focus on aggregate school
discipline numbers rather than the specific circumstances and conduct
that underlie each matter, schools become less safe,” and “\[r\]esearch
clearly indicates that the failure of schools to appropriately
discipline disruptive students has consequences for overall student
achievement.”  The Commission’s seemingly obvious conclusion was that
“disciplinary decisions are best left in the hands of classroom teachers
and administrators” and should be based on student behavior, rather than
racial statistics.  
  
Following the Commission’s report on December 18, 2018, the 2014 Dear
Colleague letter was rescinded.  In 2023, however, the previous
administration’s Department of Education and Department of Justice
issued new guidance noting that statistical racial disparities in
student discipline may indicate violations of law, and encouraging
schools to collect, analyze, and adjust their disciplinary policies in
light of racial disciplinary data.  The 2023 guidance thus effectively
reinstated the practice of weaponizing Title VI to promote an approach
to school discipline based on discriminatory equity ideology.  As a
consequence of these policies, teachers and students are suffering
increased levels of classroom disorder and school violence.
