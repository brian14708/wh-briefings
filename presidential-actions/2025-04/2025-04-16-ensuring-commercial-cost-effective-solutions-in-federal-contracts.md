title: Ensuring Commercial, Cost-Effective Solutions in Federal Contracts
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President, by the Constitution and laws
of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  A major goal
of my Administration is to eliminate unnecessary and imprudent
expenditures of taxpayer dollars.  Previous administrations evaded
statutory preferences and abused the Federal contracting framework by
procuring custom products and services where a suitable or superior
commercial solution would have fulfilled the Government’s needs.  Doing
so simultaneously stifled the integration of commercially available
innovations in Government procurement while increasing Government
spending, resulting in avoidable waste and costly delays to the
detriment of American taxpayers.  My Administration will enforce
existing laws directing the Federal Government to utilize, to the
maximum extent practicable, the competitive marketplace and the
innovations of private enterprise to provide better, more cost-effective
services to taxpayers.   
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of my Administration that agencies shall procure commercially
available products and services, including those that can be modified to
fill agencies’ needs, to the maximum extent practicable, including
pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Public Law
103-355, as amended) (FASA).  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Definitions</span>.  For
purposes of this order:   
     (a)  “Agency” means an executive department, a military department,
or any independent establishment within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 101,
102, and 104(1), respectively, and any wholly owned Government
corporation within the meaning of 31 U.S.C. 9101(c).  
     (b)  “Approval authority” means the senior procurement executive,
designated pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 1702(c), who is responsible for
management direction of the acquisition system of an agency, including
implementation of the unique acquisition policies, regulations, and
standards of the agency.  
     (c)  “Contracting officer” has the meaning given in 48 C.F.R.
2.101.   
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Review of Pending
Actions</span>.  (a)  Within 60 days of the date of this order, each
agency’s approval authority shall direct the agency’s contracting
officers to conduct a review of all open agency solicitations,
pre-solicitation notices, solicitation notices, award notices, and sole
source notices for non-commercial products or services, such as highly
specialized, Government-unique systems, custom-developed products or
services, or research and development requirements where the agency has
not identified a satisfactory commercial option.  Each contracting
officer shall consolidate each such agency solicitation,
pre-solicitation notice, solicitation notice, award notice, and sole
source notice into a proposed application requesting approval for the
purchase of the non‑commercial products or services, which shall be
submitted to the agency’s approval authority.  The proposed applications
shall contain the market research and price analysis used to determine
the availability of commercial products and services to meet the
Government’s needs and to justify the procurement of a non-commercial
product or service, as required by 41 U.S.C. 3307(d) and 10
U.S.C. 3453(c) and 3453(d), as applicable, and the rationale for
pursuing a Government-unique, custom-developed or otherwise
non-commercial product or service.  
     (b)  Within 30 days of the date of the receipt of the proposed
applications for solicitation of non-commercial products or services
under subsection (a) of this section, each approval authority shall:  
             (i)   assess each proposed application’s compliance with
FASA, including the sufficiency of the market research and price
analysis provided in support of the procurement of non‑commercial
products or services, and take appropriate action with respect to any
deficiencies in the proposed application, including returning the
application or any portion of the application to the contracting officer
for additional research or action with respect to potential commercial
products or services; and  
             (ii)  make appropriate recommendations to advance the
solicitation of commercial products or services where those products or
services would be sufficient to serve the applicable procurement
needs.  
     (c)  Within 120 days of the date of this order and annually
thereafter, each agency’s approval authority shall provide a report to
the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) detailing the
agency’s compliance with FASA and its progress toward implementing the
policies of this order.  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Oversight of Non-Commercial
Procurements</span>.  (a)  Whenever an agency proposes to solicit a
non-commercial product or service, the applicable contracting officer
shall provide the agency’s approval authority with a description of the
proposed procurement, which shall include the specific reasons a
non‑commercial product or service is required, including all market
research and price analysis in support of the proposed solicitation for
such product or service.  The approval authority shall review and
approve or deny the proposal in writing.   
     (b)  In conducting the review under subsection (a) of this section,
the approval authority may seek input regarding the proposal from the
Director of OMB.  In such cases, the Director of OMB, in consultation
with the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, shall review and
assess the validity of the proposal, including the thoroughness of the
market research and price analysis, and shall notify the approval
authority in writing whether the Director of OMB recommends that the
proposal be approved or denied.   
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.  (a)
 Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:  
             (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive
department or agency, or the head thereof; or  
             (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.  
     (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
