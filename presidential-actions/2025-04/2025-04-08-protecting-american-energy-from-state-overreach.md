title: Protecting American Energy From State Overreach
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.
 My Administration is committed to unleashing American energy,
especially through the removal of all illegitimate impediments to the
identification, development, siting, production, investment in, or use
of domestic energy resources — particularly oil, natural gas, coal,
hydropower, geothermal, biofuel, critical mineral, and nuclear energy
resources.  An affordable and reliable domestic energy supply is
essential to the national and economic security of the United States, as
well as our foreign policy.  Simply put, Americans are better off when
the United States is energy dominant.   
American energy dominance is threatened when State and local governments
seek to regulate energy beyond their constitutional or statutory
authorities.  For example, when States target or discriminate against
out-of-State energy producers by imposing significant barriers to
interstate and international trade, American energy suffers, and the
equality of each State enshrined by the Constitution is undermined. 
Similarly, when States subject energy producers to arbitrary or
excessive fines through retroactive penalties or seek to control energy
development, siting, or production activities on Federal land, American
energy suffers.  
Many States have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, burdensome
and ideologically motivated “climate change” or energy policies that
threaten American energy dominance and our economic and national
security.  New York, for example, enacted a “climate change” extortion
law that seeks to retroactively impose billions in fines (erroneously
labelled “compensatory payments”) on traditional energy producers for
their purported past contributions to greenhouse gas emissions not only
in New York but also anywhere in the United States and the world.
 Vermont similarly extorts energy producers for alleged past
contributions to greenhouse gas emissions anywhere in the United States
or the globe.  
Other States have taken different approaches in an effort to dictate
national energy policy.  California, for example, punishes carbon use by
adopting impossible caps on the amount of carbon businesses may use, all
but forcing businesses to pay large sums to “trade” carbon credits to
meet California’s radical requirements.  Some States delay review of
permit applications to produce energy, creating de facto barriers to
entry in the energy market.  States have also sued energy companies for
supposed “climate change” harm under nuisance or other tort regimes that
could result in crippling damages.  
These State laws and policies weaken our national security and devastate
Americans by driving up energy costs for families coast-to-coast,
despite some of these families not living or voting in States with these
crippling policies.  These laws and policies also undermine Federalism
by projecting the regulatory preferences of a few States into all
States.  Americans must be permitted to heat their homes, fuel their
cars, and have peace of mind — free from policies that make energy more
expensive and inevitably degrade quality of life.  
These State laws and policies try to dictate interstate and
international disputes over air, water, and natural resources; unduly
discriminate against out-of-State businesses; contravene the equality of
States; and retroactively impose arbitrary and excessive fines without
legitimate justification.  
These State laws and policies are fundamentally irreconcilable with my
Administration’s objective to unleash American energy.  They should not
stand.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">State Laws and Causes of
Action</span>.  (a)  The Attorney General, in consultation with the
heads of appropriate executive departments and agencies, shall identify
all State and local laws, regulations, causes of action, policies, and
practices (collectively, State laws) burdening the identification,
development, siting, production, or use of domestic energy resources
that are or may be unconstitutional, preempted by Federal law, or
otherwise unenforceable.  The Attorney General shall prioritize the
identification of any such State laws purporting to address “climate
change” or involving “environmental, social, and governance”
initiatives, “environmental justice,” carbon or “greenhouse gas”
emissions, and funds to collect carbon penalties or carbon taxes.  
(b)  The Attorney General shall expeditiously take all appropriate
action to stop the enforcement of State laws and continuation of civil
actions identified in subsection (a) of this section that the Attorney
General determines to be illegal.  
(c)  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Attorney General
shall submit a report to the President, through the Counsel to the
President, regarding actions taken under subsection (b) of this
section.  The Attorney General shall also recommend any additional
Presidential or legislative action necessary to stop the enforcement of
State laws identified in subsection (a) of this section that the
Attorney General determines to be illegal or otherwise fulfill the
purpose of this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">General
Provisions</span>.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to
impair or otherwise affect:   
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency,
or the head thereof; or   
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.   
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.   
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
