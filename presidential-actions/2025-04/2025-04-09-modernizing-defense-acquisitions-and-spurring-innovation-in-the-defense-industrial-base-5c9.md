title: Addressing Risks from Susman Godfrey
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.  Lawyers
and law firms that engage in activities detrimental to critical American
interests should not have access to our Nation’s secrets, nor should
their conduct be subsidized by Federal taxpayer funds or contracts.  My
Administration must also take appropriate and necessary measures to
guard against the actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest
that arise when the Government funds, engages with, or otherwise devotes
resources to law firms and their clients that engage in conduct
undermining critical American interests and priorities.  
I have determined that action is necessary to address the significant
risks, egregious conduct, and conflicts of interest associated with
Susman Godfrey LLP (Susman).  Susman spearheads efforts to weaponize the
American legal system and degrade the quality of American elections.
 Susman also funds groups that engage in dangerous efforts to undermine
the effectiveness of the United States military through the injection of
political and radical ideology, and it supports efforts to discriminate
on the basis of race.  
Susman itself engages in unlawful discrimination, including
discrimination on the basis of race.  For example, Susman administers a
program where it offers financial awards and employment opportunities
only to “students of color.” My Administration is committed to ending
such unlawful discrimination perpetrated in the name of “diversity,
equity, and inclusion” policies and ensuring that Federal benefits
support the laws and policies of the United States, including those laws
and policies promoting our national security and respecting the
democratic process.  Those who engage in blatant discrimination and
other activities inconsistent with the interests of the United States
should not have access to our Nation’s secrets nor be deemed responsible
stewards of any Federal funds.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Security Clearance
Review</span>.  (a)  The Attorney General, the Director of National
Intelligence, and all other relevant heads of executive departments and
agencies (agencies) shall immediately take steps consistent with
applicable law to suspend any active security clearances held by
individuals at Susman, pending a review of whether such clearances are
consistent with the national interest.   
(b)  The Office of Management and Budget shall identify all Government
goods, property, material, and services, including Sensitive
Compartmented Information Facilities, provided for the benefit of
Susman.  The heads of agencies providing such material or services
shall, to the extent permitted by law, expeditiously cease such
provision. 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Contracting</span>.  (a)  To
prevent the transfer of taxpayer dollars to Federal contractors whose
earnings subsidize, among other things, activities that are not aligned
with American interests, including racial discrimination, Government
contracting agencies shall, to the extent permissible by law, require
Government contractors to disclose any business they do with Susman and
whether that business is related to the subject of the Government
contract.   
(b)  The heads of agencies shall review all contracts with Susman or
with entities that disclose doing business with Susman under subsection
(a) of this section.  To the extent permitted by law, the heads of
agencies shall:  
(i)   take appropriate steps to terminate any contract, to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable law, including the Federal Acquisition
Regulation, for which Susman has been hired to perform any service;
and  
(ii)  otherwise align their agency funding decisions with the interests
of the citizens of the United States; with the goals and priorities of
my Administration as expressed in executive actions, especially
Executive Order 14147 of January 20, 2025 (Ending the Weaponization of
the Federal Government); and as heads of agencies deem appropriate.
 Within 30 days of the date of this order, agencies shall submit to the
Director of the Office of Management and Budget an assessment of
contracts with Susman or with entities that do business with Susman
effective as of the date of this order and any actions taken with
respect to those contracts in accordance with this order. 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Racial Discrimination</span>.
 Nothing in this order shall be construed to limit the action authorized
by section 4 of Executive Order 14230 of March 6, 2025 (Addressing Risks
from Perkins Coie LLP).  

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Personnel</span>.  (a)  The
heads of agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide
guidance limiting official access from Federal Government buildings to
employees of Susman when such access would threaten the national
security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the
United States.  In addition, the heads of agencies shall provide
guidance limiting Government employees acting in their official capacity
from engaging with Susman employees to ensure consistency with the
national security and other interests of the United States.  
(b)  Agency officials shall, to the extent permitted by law, refrain
from hiring employees of Susman, absent a waiver from the head of the
agency, made in consultation with the Director of the Office of
Personnel Management, that such hire will not threaten the national
security of the United States. 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.
 (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:  
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or  
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.  
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
