title: Maintaining Acceptable Water Pressure in Showerheads
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>. 
Overregulation chokes the American economy and stifles personal
freedom.  A small but meaningful example is the Obama-Biden war on
showers:  Twice in the last 12 years, those administrations promulgated
multi-thousand-word regulations defining the word “showerhead.”  See
Energy Conservation Program:  Definition of Showerhead, 86 *Fed.
Reg.* 71797 (December 20, 2021); Energy Conservation Program for
Consumer Products and Certain Commercial and Industrial Equipment:  Test
Procedures for Showerheads, Faucets, Water Closets, Urinals, and
Commercial Prerinse Spray Valves, 78 *Fed. Reg.* 62970 (October 23,
2013).  To the extent any definition is necessary for this common piece
of hardware, the Oxford English Dictionary defines “showerhead” in one
short sentence. 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Ordering the Repeal of the
13,000-Word Regulation Defining “Showerhead”</span>.  I hereby direct
the Secretary of Energy to publish in the *Federal Register* a notice
rescinding Energy Conservation Program:  Definition of Showerhead,
86 *Fed. Reg.* 71797 (December 20, 2021), including the definition of
“showerhead” codified at 10 C.F.R. 430.2.  Notice and comment is
unnecessary because I am ordering the repeal.  The rescission shall be
effective 30 days from the date of publication of the notice.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. 
(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.  
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
    April 9, 2025.
