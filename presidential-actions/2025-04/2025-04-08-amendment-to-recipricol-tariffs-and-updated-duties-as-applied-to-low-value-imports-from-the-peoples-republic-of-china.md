AMENDMENT TO RECIPROCAL TARIFFS AND UPDATED DUTIES AS APPLIED TO
LOW-VALUE IMPORTS FROM THE PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), section 604 of the
Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title
3, United States Code, I hereby determine and order:  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.  In
Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports with a
Reciprocal Tariff to Rectify Trade Practices that Contribute to Large
and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), I declared a
national emergency arising from conditions reflected in large and
persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits, and imposed additional ad
valorem duties that I deemed necessary and appropriate to deal with that
unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or
substantial part outside the United States, to the national security and
economy of the United States.  Section 4(b) of Executive Order 14257
provided that “\[s\]hould any trading partner retaliate against the
United States in response to this action through import duties on U.S.
exports or other measures, I may further modify the \[Harmonized Tariff
Schedule of the United States\] to increase or expand in scope the
duties imposed under this order to ensure the efficacy of this action.”
 I further declared pursuant to Executive Order 14256 of April 2, 2025
(Further Amendment to Duties Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply
Chain in the People’s Republic of China as Applied to Low-Value Imports)
that duty-free de minimis treatment on articles described in section
2(a) of Executive Order 14195 is no longer available effective at 12:01
a.m. eastern daylight time on May 2, 2025.  
  
On April 4, 2025, the State Council Tariff Commission of the People’s
Republic of China (PRC) announced that in response to Executive Order
14257, effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 10, 2025,
a 34 percent tariff would be imposed on all goods imported into the PRC
originating from the United States.  Pursuant to section 4(b) of
Executive Order 14257, I am ordering modification of the Harmonized
Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) and taking other actions to
increase the duties imposed on the PRC in response to this retaliation.
 In my judgment, this modification is necessary and appropriate to
effectively address the threat to the national security and economy of
the United States.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Tariff Increase</span>.  In
recognition of the fact that the PRC has announced that it will
retaliate against the United States in response to Executive Order
14257, the HTSUS shall be modified as follows.  Effective with respect
to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for
consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 9,
2025:    
(a)  heading 9903.01.63 of the HTSUS shall be amended by deleting “34%”
each place that it appears and by inserting “84%” in lieu thereof; and  
(b)  subdivision (v)(xiii)(10) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of
chapter 99 of the HTSUS shall be amended by deleting “34%”, and
inserting “84%” in lieu thereof.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">De Minimis Tariff
Increase</span>.  To ensure that the imposition of tariffs pursuant to
section 2 of this order is not circumvented and that the purpose of
Executive Order 14257 and this action is not undermined, I also deem it
necessary and appropriate to:    
(a)  increase the ad valorem rate of duty set forth in section 2(c)(i)
of Executive Order 14256 from 30 percent to 90 percent;  
(b)  increase the per postal item containing goods duty in section
2(c)(ii) of Executive Order 14256 that is in effect on or after 12:01
a.m. eastern daylight time on May 2, 2025, and before 12:01 a.m. eastern
daylight time on June 1, 2025, from 25 dollars to 75 dollars; and  
(c)  increase the per postal item containing goods duty in section
2(c)(ii) of Executive Order 14256 that is in effect on or after 12:01
a.m. eastern daylight time on June 1, 2025, from 50 dollars to 150
dollars.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Implementation</span>.  The
Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the
United States Trade Representative, as applicable, in consultation with
the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Assistant to
the President for Economic Policy, the Senior Counselor for Trade and
Manufacturing, the Assistant to the President for National Security
Affairs, and the Chair of the International Trade Commission, are
directed to take all necessary actions to implement and effectuate this
order, consistent with applicable law, including through temporary
suspension or amendment of regulations or notices in the Federal
Register and adopting rules and regulations, and are authorized to take
such actions, and to employ all powers granted to the President by
IEEPA, as may be necessary to implement this order.  Each executive
department and agency shall take all appropriate measures within its
authority to implement this order.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.
 (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:  
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency,
or the head     thereof; or  
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.  
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
