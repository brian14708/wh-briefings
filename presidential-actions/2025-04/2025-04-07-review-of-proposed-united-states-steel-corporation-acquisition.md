SUBJECT:       Review of Proposed United States Steel

Corporation Acquisition

On January 3, 2025, President Biden issued an order prohibiting the
acquisition of United States Steel Corporation (U.S. Steel) by Nippon
Steel Corporation, Nippon Steel North America, Inc., and 2023 Merger
Subsidiary, Inc. (collectively, the Purchasers, and collectively with
U.S. Steel, the Parties).  In that order, President Biden reserved the
right of the President “to issue further orders with respect to the
Purchasers or U.S. Steel as shall in my judgment be necessary to protect
the national security of the United States.”

the United States, including section 721 of the Defense Production Act
of 1950 (section 721), as amended, 50 U.S.C. 4565, I direct the
Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to conduct
a review of the acquisition of U.S. Steel by the Purchasers to assist me
in determining whether further action in this matter may be appropriate.

(b)  CFIUS’s review shall be conducted de novo, confidentially, and
consistent with the procedures set forth for national security reviews
under section 721, including, but not limited to, identifying potential
national security risks associated with the proposed transaction and
providing adequate opportunity to the parties to respond to such
concerns.

me describing whether any measures proposed by the parties are
sufficient to mitigate any national security risks identified by CFIUS.

agency’s position, including the reasons for such position.
