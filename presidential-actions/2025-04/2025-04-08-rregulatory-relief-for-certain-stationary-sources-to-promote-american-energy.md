title: Regulatory Relief for Certain Stationary Sources to Promote American Energy
---
 
 1.  Coal-fired electricity generation is essential to ensuring that our
Nation’s grid is reliable and that electricity is affordable for the
American people, and to promoting our Nation’s energy security.  The
Federal Government plays a pivotal role in ensuring that the Nation’s
power supply remains secure and reliable.  Forcing energy producers to
comply with unattainable emissions controls jeopardizes this mission. 

  
2.  On May 7, 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency published a
final rule titled *National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air
Pollutants:  Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units
Review of the Residual Risk and Technology Review*, 89 FR 38508 (Rule),
which amended the preexisting Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS)
rule to make it more stringent.  The Rule’s effective date was July 8,
2024.  *Id.*  Its compliance date is July 8, 2027, 3 years after its
effective date.  *See *89 FR 38519.

  
3.  The Rule places severe burdens on coal-fired power plants and,
through its indirect effects, on the viability of our Nation’s coal
sector.  Specifically, the Rule requires compliance with standards
premised on the application of emissions-control technologies that do
not yet exist in a commercially viable form.  The current compliance
timeline of the Rule therefore raises the unacceptable risk of the
shutdown of many coal-fired power plants, eliminating thousands of jobs,
placing our electrical grid at risk, and threatening broader, harmful
economic and energy security effects.  This in turn would undermine our
national security, as these effects would leave America vulnerable to
electricity demand shortages, increased dependence on foreign energy
sources, and potential disruptions of our electricity and energy
supplies, particularly in times of crisis.  
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws
of the United States of America, including section 112(i)(4) of the
Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7412(i)(4), do hereby proclaim that certain
stationary sources subject to the Rule, as identified in Annex I of this
proclamation, are exempt from compliance with the Rule for a period of 2
years beyond the Rule’s compliance date — *i.e.*, for the period
beginning July 8, 2027, and concluding July 8, 2029 (Exemption).  The
effect of this Exemption is that, during this 2-year period, these
stationary sources are subject to the compliance obligations that they
are currently subject to under the MATS as the MATS existed prior to the
Rule.  In support of this Exemption, I hereby make the following
determinations:  
a.  The technology to implement the Rule is not available.  Such
technology does not exist in a commercially viable form sufficient to
allow implementation of and compliance with the Rule by its compliance
date of July 8, 2027.  
b. It is in the national security interests of the United States to
issue this Exemption for the reasons stated in paragraph 3 of this
proclamation.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
eighth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five,
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred
and forty-ninth.  
   
   
                               DONALD J. TRUMP
