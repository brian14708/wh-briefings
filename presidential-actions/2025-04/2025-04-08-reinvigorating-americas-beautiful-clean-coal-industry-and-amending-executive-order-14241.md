title: "Reinvigorating America\u2019s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry and Amending Executive\
  \ Order 14241"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>. In order to
secure America’s economic prosperity and national security, lower the
cost of living, and provide for increases in electrical demand from
emerging technologies, we must increase domestic energy production,
including coal. Coal is abundant and cost effective, and can be used in
any weather condition. Moreover, the industry has historically employed
hundreds of thousands of Americans. America’s coal resources are vast,
with a current estimated value in the trillions of dollars, and are more
than capable of substantially contributing to American energy
independence with excess to export to support allies and our economic
competitiveness. Our Nation’s beautiful clean coal resources will be
critical to meeting the rise in electricity demand due to the resurgence
of domestic manufacturing and the construction of artificial
intelligence data processing centers. We must encourage and support our
Nation’s coal industry to increase our energy supply, lower electricity
costs, stabilize our grid, create high-paying jobs, support burgeoning
industries, and assist our allies.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>. It is the policy
of the United States that coal is essential to our national and economic
security. It is a national priority to support the domestic coal
industry by removing Federal regulatory barriers that undermine coal
production, encouraging the utilization of coal to meet growing domestic
energy demands, increasing American coal exports, and ensuring that
Federal policy does not discriminate against coal production or
coal-fired electricity generation.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Strengthening Our National
Energy Security</span>. The Chair of the National Energy Dominance
Council (NEDC) shall designate coal as a “mineral” as defined in section
2 of Executive Order 14241 of March 20, 2025 (Immediate Measures to
Increase American Mineral Production), thereby entitling coal to all the
benefits of a “mineral” under that order. Further, Executive Order 14241
is hereby amended by deleting the reference to “4332(d)(1)(B)” in
section 6(d) of that order and replacing it with a reference to
“4532(d)(1)(B)”.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Assessing Coal Resources and
Accessibility on Federal Lands</span>. (a) Within 60 days of the date of
this order, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture,
and the Secretary of Energy shall submit a consolidated report to the
President through the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy
that identifies coal resources and reserves on Federal lands, assesses
impediments to mining such coal resources, and proposes policies to
address such impediments and ultimately enable the mining of such coal
resources by either private or public actors.

  
(b) The Secretary of Energy shall include in the report described in
subsection (a) of this section an analysis of the impact that the
availability of the coal resources identified could have on electricity
costs and grid reliability.

  
Sec. 5. Lifting Barriers to Coal Mining on Federal Lands. (a) The
Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall
prioritize coal leasing and related activities, consistent with
applicable law, as the primary land use for the public lands with coal
resources identified in the report described in section 4(a) of this
order and expedite coal leasing in these areas, including by utilizing
such emergency authorities as are available to them and identifying
opportunities to provide for expedited environmental reviews, consistent
with applicable law.

\(b\) The Secretary of the Interior, pursuant to the authorities in the
Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended and supplemented (30 U.S.C. 181
et seq.), the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands of 1947, as amended
(30 U.S.C. 351-359), and the Multiple Mineral Development Act of 1954
(30 U.S.C. 521-531 et seq.), shall acknowledge the end of the Jewell
Moratorium by ordering the publication of a notice in the Federal
Register terminating the “Environmental Impact Statement Analyzing the
Potential Environmental Effects from Maintaining Secretary Jewell’s Coal
Leasing Moratorium”, and process royalty rate reduction applications
from Federal coal lessees in as expeditious a manner as permitted by
applicable law.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Supporting American Coal as an
Energy Source</span>. (a) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Secretary of
Transportation, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Energy,
the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of the Treasury shall identify
any guidance, regulations, programs, and policies within their
respective executive department or agency that seek to transition the
Nation away from coal production and electricity generation.

\(b\) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the heads of all
relevant executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall consider
revising or rescinding Federal actions identified in subsection (a) of
this section consistent with applicable law.

\(c\) Agencies that are empowered to make loans, loan guarantees,
grants, equity investments, or to conclude offtake agreements, both
domestically and abroad, shall, to the extent permitted by law, take
steps to rescind any policies or regulations seeking to or that actually
discourage investment in coal production and coal-fired electricity
generation, such as the 2021 U.S. Treasury Fossil Fuel Energy Guidance
for Multilateral Development Banks rescinded by the Department of the
Treasury and similar policies or regulations.

\(d\) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State,
the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary
of Energy, the Chief Executive Officer of the International Development

discretionary programs that provide, facilitate, or advocate for
financing of energy projects shall review their charters, regulations,
guidance, policies, international agreements, analytical models and
internal bureaucratic processes to ensure that such materials do not
discourage the agency from financing coal mining projects and
electricity generation projects. Consistent with law, and subject to the
applicable agency head’s discretion, where appropriate, any identified
preferences against coal use shall immediately be eliminated except as
explicitly provided for in statute.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">8</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Expanding Use of Categorical
Exclusions for Coal Under the National Environmental Policy Act</span>.
Within 30 days of the date of this order, each agency shall identify to
the Council on Environmental Quality any existing and potential
categorical exclusions pursuant to the National Environmental Policy
Act, increased reliance on and adoption of which by other agencies
pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 4336c could further the production and export of
coal.

Act, shall determine whether metallurgical coal used in the production
of steel meets the criteria to be designated as a “critical mineral”
under the Act and, if so, shall take steps to place coal on the
Department of the Interior Critical Minerals List.
