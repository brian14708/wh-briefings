title: Restoring Common Sense to Federal Office Space Management
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  The American
people are spread across more than 3.8 million square miles in urban,
suburban, and rural areas.  To provide the highest quality services in
an efficient and cost-effective manner, executive departments and
agencies (agencies) must be where the people are.  
President Carter signed Executive Order 12072 of August 16, 1978
(Federal Space Management), ordering the Federal Government to
prioritize central business districts when siting Federal facilities in
urban areas.  Intended to improve these districts, President Carter’s
order has instead prevented agencies from relocating to lower-cost
facilities.  
Building on Executive Order 12072, President Clinton signed Executive
Order 13006 of May 21, 1996 (Locating Federal Facilities on Historic
Properties in Our Nation’s Central Cities), to encourage agencies to
locate their facilities in historic properties and districts, especially
when located in central business areas.  Much like President Carter’s
order, President Clinton’s order failed to adequately prioritize
efficient and effective Government service.  
Revoking these orders will restore common sense to Federal office space
management by freeing agencies to select cost-effective facilities and
focus on successfully carrying out their missions for American
taxpayers.

management policy with this order.  
(d) Agencies that acquire or utilize federally owned or leased space
under authority other than the Federal Property and Administrative
Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 101 *et seq.*), as amended, shall
conform to the provisions of this order to the extent consistent with
applicable law.

 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.

benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
