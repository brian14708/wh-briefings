title: "Enforcing Commonsense Rules of the Road for America\u2019s Truck Drivers"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1.</span> 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  America’s
truck drivers are essential to the strength of our economy, the security
of our Nation, and the livelihoods of the American people.  Every day,
truckers perform the demanding and dangerous work of transporting the
Nation’s goods to businesses, customers, and communities safely,
reliably, and efficiently.

Proficiency in English, which I designated as our official national
language in Executive Order 14224 of March 1, 2025 (Designating English
as the Official Language of the United States), should be a
non-negotiable safety requirement for professional drivers.  They should
be able to read and understand traffic signs, communicate with traffic
safety, border patrol, agricultural checkpoints, and cargo weight-limit
station officers.  Drivers need to provide feedback to their employers
and customers and receive related directions in English.  This is common
sense.

That is why Federal law requires that, to operate a commercial vehicle,
a driver must “read and speak the English language sufficiently to
converse with the general public, to understand highway traffic signs
and signals in the English language, to respond to official inquiries,
and to make entries on reports and records.”  Yet this requirement has
not been enforced in years, and America’s roadways have become less
safe.

My Administration will enforce the law to protect the safety of American
truckers, drivers, passengers, and others, including by upholding the
safety enforcement regulations that ensure that anyone behind the wheel
of a commercial vehicle is properly qualified and proficient in our
national language, English.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of my Administration to support America’s truckers and safeguard
our roadways by enforcing the commonsense English-language requirement
for commercial motor vehicle drivers and removing needless regulatory
burdens that undermine the working conditions of America’s truck
drivers.  This order will help ensure a safe, secure, and efficient
motor carrier industry.

<u>Sec</u>. <u>3</u>.  <u>Upholding English Proficiency Requirements for
Commercial Motor Vehicle Operators</u>. ** (a)  **The Secretary of
Transportation, acting through the Administrator of the Federal Motor
Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), shall, within 60 days of the date
of this order, rescind the guidance document titled, “English Language
Proficiency Testing and Enforcement Policy MC-ECE-2016-006,” issued on
June 15, 2016, and issue new guidance to FMCSA and enforcement personnel
outlining revised inspection procedures necessary to ensure compliance
with the requirements of 49 C.F.R. 391.11(b)(2).

     (b)  In carrying out subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary
of Transportation, through the Administrator of the FMCSA, shall take
all necessary and appropriate actions, consistent with applicable law,
to ensure that the out-of-service criteria are revised such that a
violation of the English language proficiency requirement results in the
driver being placed out-of-service, including by working with the
relevant entities responsible for establishing the out-of-service
criteria.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Strengthening Commercial
Driver’s License Security for Safer Commercial Motor Vehicle
Operations</span>.  The Secretary of Transportation, through the
Administrator of the FMCSA, shall:

\(a\)  review non-domiciled commercial driver’s licenses (CDLs) issued
by relevant State agencies to identify any unusual patterns or numbers
or other irregularities with respect to non-domiciled CDL issuance; and

(b)  evaluate and take appropriate actions to improve the effectiveness
of current protocols for verifying the authenticity and validity of both
domestic and international commercial driving credentials.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Supporting America’s Truck
Drivers</span>.  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary
of Transportation shall identify and begin carrying out additional
administrative, regulatory, or enforcement actions to improve the
working conditions of America’s truck drivers.

<u>Sec</u>. <u>6</u>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">General
Provisions</span>.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to
impair or otherwise affect:

(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
 

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

\(c\)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

\(d\)  The Department of Transportation shall provide funding for this
order’s publication in the *Federal Register*.

THE WHITE HOUSE,
