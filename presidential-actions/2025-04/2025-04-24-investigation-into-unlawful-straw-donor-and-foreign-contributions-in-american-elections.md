MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY  
               THE ATTORNEY GENERAL  
               THE COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT  
   
SUBJECT:       Investigation into Unlawful “Straw Donor” and Foreign
Contributions in American Elections  
  
   
Federal law (52 U.S.C. 30121 and 30122) strictly prohibits making
political contributions in the name of another person, as well as
contributions by foreign nationals.  
   
Notwithstanding these laws designed to protect American democracy, press
reports and investigations by congressional committees have generated
extremely troubling evidence that online fundraising platforms have been
willing participants in schemes to launder excessive and prohibited
contributions to political candidates and committees.   
   
Specifically, these reports raise concerns that malign actors are
seeking to evade Federal source and amount limitations on political
contributions by breaking down large contributions from one source into
many smaller contributions, nominally attributed to numerous other
individuals, potentially without the consent or even knowledge of the
putative contributors.  The reports also raise concerns that such “straw
donations” are being made through “dummy” accounts, potentially using
gift cards or prepaid credit cards to evade detection.  
   
Further, there is evidence to suggest that foreign nationals are seeking
to misuse online fundraising platforms to improperly influence American
elections.  A recent House of Representatives investigation revealed
that a platform named ActBlue had in recent years detected at least 22
“significant fraud campaigns”, nearly half of which had a foreign
nexus.  During a 30-day window during the 2024 campaign, the platform
detected 237 donations from foreign IP addresses using prepaid cards,
indicating that this activity remains a pressing concern.   
These activities undermine the integrity of our electoral process. 
Therefore, I direct the Attorney General, in consultation with the
Secretary of the Treasury, to use all lawful authority, as necessary, to
investigate allegations regarding the unlawful use of online fundraising
platforms to make “straw” or “dummy” contributions or foreign
contributions to political candidates and committees, and to take all
appropriate actions to enforce the law.  
   
I further direct the Attorney General to report back to me through the
Counsel to the President within 180 days of the date of this memorandum
on the results of the investigation.  
   
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.  
   
   
   
                              DONALD J. TRUMP
