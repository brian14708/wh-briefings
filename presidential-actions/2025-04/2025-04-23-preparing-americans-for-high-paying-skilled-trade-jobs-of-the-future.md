title: Preparing Americans for High-Paying Skilled Trade Jobs of the Future
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  To maximize
my Administration’s historic investments in America’s
reindustrialization and economic growth, my Administration will fully
equip the American worker to produce world-class products and implement
world-leading technologies.  My Administration will also consolidate and
streamline fragmented Federal workforce development programs that are
too disconnected from propelling workers into secure, well-paying, and
high-need American jobs.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. 2.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of the United States to optimize and target Federal investments
in workforce development to align with our country’s reindustrialization
needs and equip American workers to fill the growing demand for skilled
trades and other occupations.  My Administration will further protect
and strengthen Registered Apprenticeships and build on their successes
to seize new opportunities and unlock the limitless potential of the
American worker.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Comprehensive Worker
Investment and Development Strategy</span>.  Within 90 days of the date
of this order, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Commerce, and
the Secretary of Education shall review all Federal workforce
development programs and submit to the Assistant to the President for
Domestic Policy and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget
a report setting forth strategies to help the American worker.  That
report shall identify the following:

\(a\)  Opportunities to integrate systems and realign resources to
address critical workforce needs and in-demand skills of emerging
industries and companies investing in the United States as determined,
to the extent permissible by law, by prospective employers.  The report
shall include:

\(i\)    administrative reforms to agency policies and programmatic
requirements;

\(ii\)   process improvements to better the experience for program
participants; and

\(iii\)  recommendations to further restructure and consolidate
programs.

\(b\)  Federal workforce development and education programs, or related
spending within these programs, that are ineffective or otherwise fail
to achieve their desired outcomes.  Each identified program should be
accompanied by a proposal to reform the program, redirect its funding,
or eliminate it.

\(c\)  Available statutory authorities to promote innovation and system
integration in pursuit of better employment and earnings outcomes for
program participants.

\(d\)  Opportunities to invest in the upskilling of incumbent workers to
meet rapidly evolving skill demands of their industries, including the
use of Artificial Intelligence in the workplace.

\(e\)  Strategies to identify alternative credentials and assessments to
the 4-year college degree that can be mapped to the specific skill needs
of prospective employers.

\(f\)  Efficiencies to streamline information collection, including
through:

\(i\)    harmonizing performance measures;

\(ii\)   reducing the burden on grantees; and

\(iii\)  ensuring that performance outcomes are measured using the most
reliable data sources.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Expanding Registered
Apprenticeships</span>.  Within 120 days of the date of this order, the
Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Secretary of
Education shall submit to the Assistant to the President for Domestic
Policy and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget a plan to
reach and surpass 1 million new active apprentices.  That plan shall
identify the following:

\(a\)  Avenues to expand Registered Apprenticeships to new industries
and occupations, including high-growth and emerging sectors.

\(b\)  Measures to scale this proven model across the country, improve
its efficiency, and provide consistent support to program participants.

\(c\)  Opportunities, including through the Carl D. Perkins Career and
Technical Education (Perkins V) Act and Federal student aid, to enhance
connections between the education system and Registered Apprenticeships.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Delivering Unprecedented
Transparency and Accountability</span>.  The Secretary of Labor, the
Secretary of Commerce, and the Secretary of Education shall improve
transparency on the performance outcomes of workforce development
programs and credentials supported through Federal investments,
including earnings and employment data, for all Federal workforce
development programs.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. 
(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
