title: Strengthening the Reliability and Security of the United States Electric Grid
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  The United
States is experiencing an unprecedented surge in electricity demand
driven by rapid technological advancements, including the expansion of
artificial intelligence data centers and an increase in domestic
manufacturing.  This increase in demand, coupled with existing capacity
challenges, places a significant strain on our Nation’s electric grid. 
Lack of reliability in the electric grid puts the national and economic
security of the American people at risk.  The United States’ ability to
remain at the forefront of technological innovation depends on a
reliable supply of energy from all available electric generation sources
and the integrity of our Nation’s electric grid.  

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of the United States to ensure the reliability, resilience, and
security of the electric power grid.  It is further the policy of the
United States that in order to ensure adequate and reliable electric
generation in America, to meet growing electricity demand, and to
address the national emergency declared pursuant to Executive Order
14156 of January 20, 2025 (Declaring a National Energy Emergency), our
electric grid must utilize all available power generation resources,
particularly those secure, redundant fuel supplies that are capable of
extended operations

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Addressing Energy Reliability
and Security with Emergency Authority.</span>  (a)  To safeguard the
reliability and security of the United States’ electric grid during
periods when the relevant grid operator forecasts a temporary
interruption of electricity supply is necessary to prevent a complete
grid failure, the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with such
executive department and agency heads as the Secretary of Energy deems
appropriate, shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, streamline,
systemize, and expedite the Department of Energy’s processes for issuing
orders under section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act during the periods
of grid operations described above, including the review and approval of
applications by electric generation resources seeking to operate at
maximum capacity.    
(b)  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Energy
shall develop a uniform methodology for analyzing current and
anticipated reserve margins for all regions of the bulk power system
regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and shall utilize
this methodology to identify current and anticipated regions with
reserve margins below acceptable thresholds as identified by the
Secretary of Energy. This methodology shall:  
(i)    analyze sufficiently varied grid conditions and operating
scenarios based on historic events to adequately inform the
methodology;  
(ii)   accredit generation resources in such conditions and scenarios
based on historical performance of each specific generation resource
type in the real time conditions and operating scenarios of each grid
scenario; and  
(iii)  be published, along with any analysis it produces, on the
Department of Energy’s website within 90 days of the date of this
order.  
(c)  The Secretary of Energy shall establish a process by which the
methodology described in subsection (b) of this section, and any
analysis and results it produces, are assessed on a regular basis, and a
protocol to identify which generation resources within a region are
critical to system reliability.  This protocol shall additionally:  
(i)   include all mechanisms available under applicable law, including
section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, to ensure any generation
resource identified as critical within an at-risk region is
appropriately retained as an available generation resource within the
at-risk region; and  
(ii)  prevent, as the Secretary of Energy deems appropriate and
consistent with applicable law, including section 202 of the Federal
Power Act, an identified generation resource in excess of 50 megawatts
of nameplate capacity from leaving the bulk-power system or converting
the source of fuel of such generation resource if such conversion would
result in a net reduction in accredited generating capacity, as
determined by the reserve margin methodology developed under subsection
(b) of this section. 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General
Provisions</span>*.*  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to
impair or otherwise affect:  
(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or  
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.  
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
