A Proclamation

Every day, countless volunteers strengthen and enrich communities across
the country through their selfless service. This National Volunteer
Week, we offer our gratitude to every individual who generously
volunteers their time, talent, and resources to influence and impact the
lives of their neighbors, their communities, and the Nation as a whole.

Volunteerism is central to the American way of life, exemplifying the
spirit that makes America great. In soup kitchens, shelters, schools,
hospitals, and religious organizations across the country, volunteers
encompass a spirit of kindness and compassion to help those in need.
These exemplary citizens are role models for their communities and
inspire us all with their commitment to selfless service.

During National Volunteer Week, we pay tribute to every American who
gives their time and talents in service to our Nation. We celebrate
their selfless spirit â€” the driving force that inspires them to uplift
others and serve a purpose greater than their own. In times of need, the
American people emerge stronger than ever.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 20 through April
26, 2025, as National Volunteer Week. I call upon all Americans to
observe this week by volunteering in service projects across our country
and pledging to make service a part of their daily lives.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
twenty-third day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand
twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the
two hundred and forty-ninth.

Donald J. Trump
