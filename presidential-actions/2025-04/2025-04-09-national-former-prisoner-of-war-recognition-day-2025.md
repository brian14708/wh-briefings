title: National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, 2025

 BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION 

On this National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, we remember
every American service member who carries the memory of being captured
in war as a consequence of defending American freedom.  Since the
battlefields of the Revolutionary War, millions of selfless patriots
have sacrificed their lives, safety, and security to protect our
homeland and preserve our inheritance of liberty.  These noble men and
women embody the best of our Nation’s spirit.  Tragically, far too many
have been taken by the enemy and forced to endure captivity and
sometimes torture.  
My Administration is steadfastly committed to taking care of our great
veterans — especially every former American prisoner of war (POW).  For
4 long years under the previous administration, illegal aliens were
living in luxury hotels while our homeless veterans were shivering on
the sidewalks — a disgrace of the highest order.  Today, more than
30,000 veterans are homeless.  To that end, I am committed to
eradicating all veteran homelessness in our country.  Under my
leadership, if you served our Nation in uniform, your Government will
never betray you — and we will never stop fighting for the brave men and
women who devoted their lives to protect our sovereignty.  
To protect our brave service members and uphold our Nation’s interests
both at home and abroad, my Administration remains committed to
restoring peace through strength and ending the years of endless foreign
wars.  As I stated during my Inaugural Address, we will measure our
success not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars we end —
and my proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier.  
We are approaching the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United
States Army later this year, and I pledge to every POW, POW family, and
member of our Armed Forces that you have our Nation’s full support and
unending gratitude.  Today and every day, we pay tribute to those who
have lost their lives in service to our Nation.  We ask Almighty God to
preserve America’s peace, prosperity, security, and freedom for
generations to come.  
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 9, 2025, as
National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day.  I call upon Americans
to observe this day by honoring the service and sacrifice of all former
prisoners of war and to express our Nation’s eternal gratitude for their
sacrifice.  I also call upon Federal, State, and local government
officials and organizations to observe this day with appropriate
ceremonies and activities.  
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
ninth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five,
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred
and forty-ninth.
