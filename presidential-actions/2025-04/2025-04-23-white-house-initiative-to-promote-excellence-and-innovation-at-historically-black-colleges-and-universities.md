  Black Colleges and Universities

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  Historically
Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) remain integral to American
students’ pursuit of prosperity and wellbeing, providing the pathway to
a career and a better life.  This order will continue the work begun
during my first Administration to elevate the value and impact of our
Nation’s HBCUs as beacons of educational excellence and economic
opportunity that serve as some of the best cultivators of tomorrow’s
leaders in business, government, academia, and the military.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of my Administration to support HBCUs in:  advancing America’s
full potential; fostering more and better opportunities in higher
education; providing the highest-quality education; obtaining equal
opportunities for participation in Federal programs; ensuring
college-educated Americans are empowered to advance the common good at
home and abroad; and making our Nation more globally competitive.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">White House Initiative on
HBCUs</span>.  (a)  There is hereby established the White House
Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities (Initiative),
housed in the Executive Office of the President and led by an Executive
Director designated by the President.

(b)  The Initiative shall work with executive departments and agencies
(agencies), the President’s Board of Advisors on Historically Black
Colleges and Universities established in section 4 of this order,
private-sector employers, educational associations, philanthropic
organizations, and other partners to increase the capacity of HBCUs to
provide the highest-quality education to an increasing number of
students.  The Initiative shall have two primary missions:

(i)  increasing the private-sector role, including the role of private
foundations, in:

(A)  strengthening HBCUs through enhanced institutional planning and
development, fiscal stability, and financial management;

(B)  upgrading institutional infrastructure, including the use of
technology, to ensure the long-term viability of these institutions; and

\(C\)  providing professional development opportunities for HBCU
students to help build America’s workforce in technology, healthcare,
manufacturing, finance, and other high-growth industries; and

(ii)  enhancing HBCUs’ capabilities to serve our Nation’s young adults
by:

\(A\)  supporting implementation of the HBCU PARTNERS Act (Public Law
116-270), including facilitating the Federal agency plan process
required by section 4 of that Act (20 U.S.C. 1063d);

(B)  working to advance my Administration’s key priorities related to
promoting innovation and excellence throughout HBCUs in consultation
with HBCU leaders, representatives, students, and alumni;

\(C\)  fostering private-sector initiatives and public-private and
philanthropic partnerships to promote centers of academic research and
program excellence at HBCUs;

HBCUs in the public policy sphere;

governments to establish a framework for addressing barriers to
accessing Federal funding to ensure that HBCUs receive the maximum
funding to which they may be entitled;

\(J\)  collaborating with agencies to improve the competitiveness of
HBCUs for other sources of Federal research and development funding; and

\(K\)  convening an annual White House Summit on HBCUs to address
matters related to the Initiative’s missions and functions.

Act, shall be performed by the Secretary of Education, in accordance
