title: Lowering Drug Prices by Once Again Putting Americans First
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.
 My first term included numerous significant actions, including some of
the most aggressive in recent history, to deliver lower prescription
drug prices to American patients.  The message was clear:  no longer
would the executive branch sit idly by as pharmaceutical manufacturers
charged patients in our Nation more than those in other countries for
the exact same prescription drugs, often made in the exact same places.

These actions included encouraging the development of generic and
biosimilar alternatives to higher cost brand name prescription drugs and
biologics to harness competitive forces and increase access to
affordable medicines.  The United States also, for the first time,
established a pathway to expand access to lower cost drugs imported from
outside of the country.  Reform efforts ensured that Government-mandated
discounts were passed through to patients instead of being retained by
middlemen.  New price transparency rules were promulgated to allow
patients, doctors, and employers to see the actual cost of prescription
drugs before purchase.  Insulin copayments were capped for Medicare
beneficiaries, and manufacturers, instead of patients and taxpayers,
were forced to foot the bill through the provision of larger discounts.
 I also called on the Congress to come to the table to help craft
sustainable solutions that would promote innovation and affordable
access for the long-term.  When the Congress refused, I proposed the
test of an innovative new payment mechanism that would prevent drug
manufacturers from charging our patients much higher prices than those
found abroad.  
Combined, these bold actions were delivering real savings for American
patients and set the foundation to dramatically narrow the price
disparity between the United States and foreign nations over time.  
Unsurprisingly, the Biden Administration reversed, walked back, or
neglected many of these initiatives, undoing the progress made for
American patients.  The Biden Administration then signed into law the
misnamed Inflation Reduction Act, which included the Medicare
Prescription Drug Negotiation Program.  While this program has the
commendable goal of reducing the drug prices Medicare and its
beneficiaries pay, its administratively complex and expensive regime has
thus far produced much lower savings than projected.  Further,
accompanying changes to the Medicare Part D program led to inflated
premiums and diminished coverage choices for seniors, prompting a
taxpayer-funded bailout of insurance companies offering Part D plans. 
Finally, the program imposes price controls on small molecule
prescription drugs, usually in tablet or capsule form, 4 years earlier
than on large molecule biological products.  Known as the “pill
penalty,” this discrepancy threatens to distort innovation by pushing
investment towards expensive biological products, which are often
indicated to treat rarer diseases, and away from small molecule
prescription drugs, which are generally cheaper and treat larger patient
populations.  
The American people deserve better.  It is time to restore the progress
our Nation made in my first term to deliver lower prescription drug
prices by putting Americans first and making America healthy again.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of the United States that Federal health care programs,
intellectual property protections, and safety regulations are optimized
to provide access to prescription drugs at lower costs to American
patients and taxpayers.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Improving upon the Inflation
Reduction Act</span>.  (a)  Within 60 days of the date of this order,
the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary), consistent with
sections 1191 to 1198 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.
1320f-1320f-7) and other applicable law, shall propose and seek comment
on guidance for the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program for initial
price applicability year 2028 and manufacturer effectuation of maximum
fair price under such program in 2026, 2027, and 2028.  The guidance
shall improve the transparency of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation
Program, prioritize the selection of prescription drugs with high costs
to the Medicare program, and minimize any negative impacts of the
maximum fair price on pharmaceutical innovation within the United
States.  
(b)  Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the
President for Domestic Policy, in coordination with the Secretary, the
Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Director), and the
Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, shall provide
recommendations to the President on how best to stabilize and reduce
Medicare Part D premiums.  
(c)  The Secretary shall work with the Congress to modify the Medicare
Drug Price Negotiation Program to align the treatment of small molecule
prescription drugs with that of biological products, ending the
distortion that undermines relative investment in small molecule
prescription drugs, coupled with other reforms to prevent any increase
in overall costs to Medicare and its beneficiaries.

 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Reducing the Prices of
High-Cost Drugs for Seniors</span>.  Within 1 year of the date of this
order, the Secretary shall take appropriate steps to develop and
implement a rulemaking plan and select for testing, consistent with
42 U.S.C. 1315a(b)(2), a payment model to improve the ability of the
Medicare program to obtain better value for high-cost prescription drugs
and biological products covered by Medicare, including those not subject
to the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Appropriately

applicable law, the Secretary shall publish in the*Federal Register* a
plan to conduct a survey under section 1833(t)(14)(D)(ii) of the Social
Security Act to determine the hospital acquisition cost for covered
outpatient drugs at hospital outpatient departments.  Following the
conclusion of this survey, the Secretary shall consider and propose any
appropriate adjustments that would align Medicare payment with the cost
of acquisition, consistent with the budget neutrality requirement in
section 1833(t)(9)(B) of the Social Security Act and other legal
requirements.

conditioned upon health centers establishing practices to make insulin
and injectable epinephrine available at or below the discounted price
paid by the health center grantee or sub-grantee under the 340B

injectable epinephrine;

Middlemen</span>.  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the
Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, in coordination with the
