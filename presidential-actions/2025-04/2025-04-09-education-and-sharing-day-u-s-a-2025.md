title: Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A., 2025
---
 
 BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION 

This Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A, we draw inspiration from the
life, legacy, and blessed memory of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson,
the Lubavitcher Rebbe and leader of the Chabad-Lubavitch community,
whose Hebrew birthday corresponds to this day.  He was a
transformational teacher and a spiritual force who — from the ashes of
the Holocaust — established one of the most vibrant, joyous, and
significant religious movements of the modern era.  In the wake of
unimaginable destruction, he embarked on a global campaign of spiritual
outreach to bring the light of faith and Yiddishkeit to countless
members of the Jewish community.  All Americans can learn from his
tireless devotion to teaching, good deeds, and charity.  
From 770 Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights, the modest home that
continues to serve as Chabad headquarters, he reinvigorated the
Chabad-Lubavitch movement and led a religious revival — one that would
touch all four corners of the globe.  Today, Chabad and its shluchim,
emissaries dedicated to spreading Jewish awareness, education, and
kindness in communities around the world, still serve as beacons of the
Rebbe’s teachings and boundless love for all humanity.  Their community
centers stand as living testaments to his message, legacy, and
unwavering commitment to outreach and support.  They are spread across
the United States and around the world, within big cities, small towns,
and on college campuses, more than doubling in number since his death.  
On the first anniversary of the brutal October 7, 2023, attacks, I
visited the Ohel of Rabbi Schneerson and drew spiritual guidance and
replenishment from his voice and message.  There, praying with the
family members of American hostage Edan Alexander and Auschwitz survivor
Jerry Wartski, I was personally reminded of the horrors of antisemitism
— whether perpetuated by the Nazis or Hamas.  My commitment to combating
it is unwavering.  My Administration has made great strides in bringing
home all hostages captured during the murderous and criminal Hamas
attacks of October 7, 2023, and to securing peace and stability for the
Jewish people in their homeland and around the world.  
The First Lady and I encourage all Americans to reflect upon the Rebbe’s
teachings.  His inestimable dedication and unwavering example have
become woven into the very fabric of our Nation and its character.  His
memory remains a blessing to the world.  
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the laws of the
United States, do hereby proclaim April 9, 2025, as “Education and
Sharing Day, U.S.A.”  I call upon all government officials, educators,
volunteers, and all the people of the United States to observe this day
with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.  
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
ninth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five,
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred
and forty-ninth.
