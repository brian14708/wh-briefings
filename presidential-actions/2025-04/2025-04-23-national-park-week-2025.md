A Proclamation

During National Park Week, we celebrate the majestic beauty and rich
history preserved within our national parks.  The week’s events will
begin with a commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the Battles of
Lexington and Concord, the opening battles of the American Revolutionary
War at Minute Man National Historical Park in Middlesex County,
Massachusetts.  There, ceremonies and tactical demonstrations will
recall the bravery of the patriots who stood their ground against
tyranny and launched a movement that secured the blessing of freedom and
forever changed the course of history.

As President, I have taken action to restore names to our parks that
honor American greatness — including returning Mount McKinley to its
rightful name.  I was also proud to announce the creation of the
National Garden of American Heroes — a new monument honoring 250
American patriots who embodied the virtues of courage, love of country,
and devotion to our Nation’s highest ideals.  My Administration is
promoting education that teaches our children to love our country and
honor our history, including through the work of the White House Task
Force on Celebrating America’s 250th Birthday.

Our national parks are magnificent sources of inspiration, education,
and recreation — representing our customs and culture.  In 1872,
Yellowstone National Park was established as the world’s first-ever
national park, commencing a proud American tradition that has led to the
designation of more than 400 park sites of national significance.  From
prehistoric dwellings and architectural masterpieces to historic
battlefields where our forefathers fought for independence, our national
parks draw hundreds of millions of visitors each year. 

This National Park Week, we renew our pledge to cherish and protect our
magnificent symbols of American greatness, and we vow to ensure that
they remain breathtaking for our children and grandchildren.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 19 through April
27, 2025, as National Park Week.  I encourage all Americans to celebrate
our national parks by learning more about the natural and historical
heritage that belongs to each and every citizen of the United States of
America.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-ninth.

DONALD J. TRUMP
