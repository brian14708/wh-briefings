title: Protecting American Communities from Criminal Aliens
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose and Policy</span>.
Federal supremacy with respect to immigration, national security, and
foreign policy is axiomatic. The Constitution provides the Federal
Government with plenary authority regarding immigration to protect the
sovereignty of our Nation and to conduct relations with other nations,
who must be able to deal with one national Government on such matters.
This power is sometimes contained in specific constitutional provisions:
Article II of the Constitution vests the power to protect national
security and conduct foreign policy in the President of the United
States, and Article IV, Section 4, requires the Federal Government to
“protect each of \[the States\] against Invasion.” This Federal power
over immigration is also an inherent element of national sovereignty.

The prior administration allowed unchecked millions of aliens to
illegally enter the United States. The resulting public safety and
national security risks are exacerbated by the presence of, and control
of territory by, international cartels and other transnational criminal
organizations along the southern border, as well as terrorists and other
malign actors who intend to harm the United States and the American
people. This invasion at the southern border requires the Federal
Government to take measures to fulfill its obligation to the States.

Yet some State and local officials nevertheless continue to use their
authority to violate, obstruct, and defy the enforcement of Federal
immigration laws. This is a lawless insurrection against the supremacy
of Federal law and the Federal Government’s obligation to defend the
territorial sovereignty of the United States. Beyond the intolerable
national security risks, such nullification efforts often violate
Federal criminal laws, including those prohibiting obstruction of
justice (18 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.), unlawfully harboring or hiring illegal
aliens (8 U.S.C. 1324), conspiracy against the United States (18 U.S.C.
371), and conspiracy to impede Federal law enforcement (18 U.S.C. 372).
Assisting aliens in violating Federal immigration law could also violate
the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (18 U.S.C. 1961
et seq.). Some measures to assist illegal aliens also necessarily
violate Federal laws prohibiting discrimination against Americans in
favor of illegal aliens and protecting Americans’ civil rights.

It is imperative that the Federal Government restore the enforcement of
United States law.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Designation of “Sanctuary”
Jurisdictions</span>. (a) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the
Attorney General, in coordination with the Secretary of Homeland
Security, shall publish a list of States and local jurisdictions that
obstruct the enforcement of Federal immigration laws (sanctuary
jurisdictions). After this initial publication, the Attorney General and
the Secretary of Homeland Security shall update this list as necessary.

\(b\) Immediately following each publication under subsection (a) of
this section, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland
Security shall notify each sanctuary jurisdiction regarding its defiance
of Federal immigration law enforcement and any potential violations of
Federal criminal law.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Consequences for Sanctuary
Jurisdiction Status</span>. (a) With respect to sanctuary jurisdictions
that are designated under section 2(a) of this order, the head of each
executive department or agency (agency), in coordination with the
Director of the Office of Management and Budget and as permitted by law,
shall identify appropriate Federal funds to sanctuary jurisdictions,
including grants and contracts, for suspension or termination, as
appropriate.

\(b\) With respect to jurisdictions that remain sanctuary jurisdictions
after State or local officials are provided notice of such status under
section 2(b) of this order and yet remain in defiance of Federal law,
the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall pursue
all necessary legal remedies and enforcement measures to end these
violations and bring such jurisdictions into compliance with the laws of
the United States.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Preventing Federal Benefits for
Aliens in Sanctuary Jurisdictions</span>. The Secretary of Homeland
Security, in coordination with the Attorney General, shall develop
guidance, rules, or other appropriate mechanisms to ensure appropriate
eligibility verification is conducted for individuals receiving Federal
public benefits within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. 1611(c) from private
entities in a sanctuary jurisdiction, whether such verification is
conducted by the private entity or by a governmental entity on its
behalf.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Equal Treatment of
Americans</span>. The Attorney General, in consultation with the
Secretary of Homeland Security and appropriate agency heads, shall
identify and take appropriate action to stop the enforcement of State
and local laws, regulations, policies, and practices favoring aliens
over any groups of American citizens that are unlawful, preempted by
Federal law, or otherwise unenforceable, including State laws that
provide in-State higher education tuition to aliens but not to
out-of-State American citizens that may violate 8 U.S.C. 1623 or that
favor aliens in criminal charges or sentencing.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. (a)
Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:

\(i\) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

\(ii\) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.

\(c\) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

\(d\) The Department of Justice shall provide funding for this order’s
publication in the Federal Register.
