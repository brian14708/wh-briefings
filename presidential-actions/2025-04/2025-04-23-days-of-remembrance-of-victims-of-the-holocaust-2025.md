title: Days of Remembrance of Victims of the Holocaust, 2025

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On Yom HaShoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day, and during this week of
solemn remembrance, we honor the blessed memories of the six million
Jewish men, women, and children who were viciously slaughtered by the
genocidal Nazi regime and their collaborators — one of the bleakest
hours in human history.  We also remember the Roma and Sinti, peoples of
Slavic and Polish ancestry, persons with disabilities, Soviet prisoners
of war, Jehovah’s Witnesses, persons targeted based on their sexual
orientation, and countless other innocent victims of this tragedy.  
Earlier this year, our Nation solemnly commemorated the 80th anniversary
of the liberation of Auschwitz, during which we memorialized the lives
of the mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, daughters, sons,
grandmothers, and grandfathers whose futures were barbarically ripped
away in Nazi-occupied Europe.  During these Days of Remembrance of
Victims of the Holocaust, we once again honor every Holocaust survivor
who has imparted their wisdom to younger generations.  Today and every
day, we commit to preserving their stories.  
The price to humanity of the lives lost during the Shoah can never be
fully grasped or understood.  Yet, even in the wake of the Holocaust, a
self-determined Jewish homeland rose from the ashes as the modern State
of Israel.  
Sadly, our Nation has borne witness to the worst outbreak of
anti-Semitism on American soil in generations.  Nearly every day
following the deadly October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, Jewish Americans
were threatened on our streets and in our public square — a reminder
that the poison of anti-Semitism tragically still exists.  
For that reason, my Administration is proudly upholding the basic truth
that anti-Semitism has no place in a civilized society.  As President, I
signed an Executive Order directing the Federal Government to use all
available and appropriate legal tools to combat the explosion of
anti-Semitic harassment in our schools and on college campuses —
including through the removal of resident aliens who violate our laws. 
We are also steadfastly committed to investigating and swiftly punishing
all anti-Semitic discrimination in leftist, anti-American colleges and
universities.  
During these Days of Remembrance of Victims of the Holocaust, we reflect
upon the dark affront to human dignity posed by Nazis.  We cherish the
eternal memories of all those whose lives were lost to the deadly
scourge of anti-Semitism.  Above all, we vow to never forget the
atrocities of the Holocaust.  We declare that never again means now.  
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, do hereby ask the people of the United States to observe the
Days of Remembrance of Victims of the Holocaust from April 20 through
April 27, 2025, and the solemn anniversary of the liberation of Nazi
death camps with appropriate study, prayers, and commemoration and to
honor the memory of the victims of the Holocaust and Nazi persecution by
remembering the lessons of this atrocity so that it is never repeated.  
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
twenty-third day of April, in the year of our Lord
two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States
of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.  
   
 

                               DONALD J. TRUMP
