title: Zero-Based Regulatory Budgeting to Unleash American Energy
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  In our
country, laws are supposed to provide the certainty and order necessary
to foster liberty and innovation.  Instead, our vast regulatory
structure often serves to constrict ordered liberty, not promote it.
 The United States Code itself is more than 60,000 pages.  But unelected
agency officials write most of the complex, legally binding rules on top
of that, often stretching these statutory provisions beyond what the
Congress enacted. 

In particular, the previous administration added more pages to the
Federal Register than any other in history, with the result that the
Code of Federal Regulations now approaches a staggering 200,000 pages.
 These regulations linger in such volume that serious reexamination
seldom occurs.  
This regime of governance-by-regulator has imposed particularly severe
costs on energy production, where innovation is critical.  The net
result is an energy landscape perpetually trapped in the 1970s.  By
rescinding outdated regulations that serve as a drag on progress, we can
stimulate innovation and deliver prosperity to everyday Americans. 

This order directs certain agencies to incorporate a sunset provision
into their regulations governing energy production to the extent
permitted by law, thus compelling those agencies to reexamine their
regulations periodically to ensure that those rules serve the public
good. 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Definitions</span>.  For the
purposes of this order:  
(a)  “Conditional Sunset Date” means the date a regulation will cease to
be effective and be removed from the Code of Federal Regulations, if the
agency does not extend the Sunset Date pursuant to section 4(d) of this
order.  
(b)  “Covered Agency” means one of the agencies listed in section 3(a)
of this order.  
(c)  “Covered Regulation” means a regulation issued in whole or in part
pursuant to a statutory authority listed in sections 3(b)-(j) of this
order.   
(d)  “DOGE Team Lead” means the leader of the DOGE Team at each agency
as described in Executive Order 14158.  
(e)  “Regulation” means each part, subpart, or individual provision of
the Code of Federal Regulations promulgated under an agency rule as
defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(4).

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.

(OMB Director), a list of statutes vesting EPA and ACE with regulatory
authority that shall be subject to this order.   

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Zero-Based Regulating</span>.
 (a)  To the extent consistent with applicable law, each of the Covered
Agencies shall issue a sunset rule, effective not later than September
30, 2025, that inserts a Conditional Sunset Date into each of their
Covered Regulations.  
(b)  The sunset rule shall provide that each Covered Regulation in
effect on the date of this order shall have a Conditional Sunset Date of
1 year after the effective date of the sunset rule, subject to the
process set forth in subsection (d) of this section.  Unless the
extension condition specified in subsection (d) of this section is
satisfied, agencies will treat Covered Regulations as ceasing to be
effective on that date for all purposes.  An agency shall not take any
action to enforce such an ineffective regulation and, to the maximum
extent permitted by law, shall remove it from the Code of Federal
Regulations.   
(c)  In any new Covered Regulation, to the maximum extent consistent
with law, the relevant Covered Agency shall include a Conditional Sunset
Date that is not more than 5 years in the future.  Amendments to any
Covered Regulation shall provide that they do not reset that
regulation’s Conditional Sunset Date and shall be subject to the same
Conditional Sunset Date as the amended regulation.  The OMB Director may
exempt a new regulation or amendment from the requirements of this
paragraph if he determines that the new regulation or amendment has a
net deregulatory effect.  
(d)  The sunset provision added to existing and new Covered Regulations
shall provide that the agency will offer the public an opportunity to
comment on the costs and benefits of each regulation, such as through a
request for information, prior to a rule’s expiration, and following
such opportunity the Conditional Sunset Date for that Covered Regulation
may be extended if the agency finds an extension is warranted.  A
request for information shall not automatically extend the Conditional
Sunset Date.  A Covered Agency may extend the Conditional Sunset Date
for a particular Covered Regulation as many times as is appropriate, but
never to a date more than 5 years in the future.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Implementation</span>.  (a)
 Neither a determination to extend the Conditional Sunset Date of a
particular regulation, nor a regulation that expires as a result this
order, shall count towards the ten-for-one regulatory requirement in
Executive Order 14192 of January 31, 2025 (Unleashing Prosperity Through
Deregulation).  
(b)  Agency heads shall coordinate with their DOGE Team Leads and the
Office of Management and Budget to implement this order.  
(c)  This order shall not apply to regulatory permitting regimes
authorized by statute.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Severability</span>.  If any
provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any
agency, person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of
this order and the application of its provisions to any other agencies,
persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">7</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.
 (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:  
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or  
(ii)  the functions of the OMB Director relating to budgetary,
administrative, or legislative proposals.  
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.  
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
