title: Restoring Common Sense to Federal Procurement
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:   
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.
 The Federal Government is the largest buyer of goods and services in
the world –- yet conducting business with the Federal Government is
often prohibitively inefficient and costly.  More than 40 years ago, the
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) was implemented to establish
uniform procedures for acquisitions across executive departments and
agencies (agencies).  The “vision” of the Federal Acquisition System,
codified at section 1.102 of the FAR, is to “deliver on a timely basis
the best value product or service to the customer, while maintaining the
public’s trust and fulfilling public policy objectives\[,\]” but since
its inception, the FAR has swelled to more than 2,000 pages of
regulations, evolving into an excessive and overcomplicated regulatory
framework and resulting in an onerous bureaucracy.   
Federal procurement under the FAR receives consistently negative
assessments regarding its efficiency.  Comprehensive studies such as the
2024 Senate committee report entitled “Restoring Freedom’s Forge” and
the 2019 report by the Advisory Panel on Streamlining and Codifying
Acquisition Regulations, created by the National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (Public Law 114-92) and made up of experts in
acquisition and procurement policy, conclude that the FAR is a barrier
to, rather than a prudent vehicle for, doing business with the Federal
Government.  Its harmful effects permeate various items paid for by
American taxpayers, from commercial products like laptops and office
supplies to major defense weapons systems.  The management and
expenditure of nearly $1 trillion annually in procurements cannot
continue on this trajectory.  Fortunately, its inadequacies are
self-inflicted and can be remedied through a comprehensive reform of the
FAR.    
Executive Order 14192 of January 31, 2025 (Unleashing Prosperity Through
Deregulation), established that the policy of the executive branch is to
be prudent and financially responsible in the expenditure of funds and
to alleviate unnecessary regulatory burdens placed on the American
people.  Reforming the FAR will advance this objective.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.
 It is the policy of the United States to create the most agile,
effective, and efficient procurement system possible.  Removing undue
barriers, such as unnecessary regulations, while simultaneously allowing
for the expansion of the national and defense industrial bases is
paramount.  Accordingly, the FAR should contain only provisions required
by statute or essential to sound procurement, and any FAR provisions
that do not advance these objectives should be removed.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Definitions</span>.  (a)
 “FAR” means the Federal Acquisition Regulation codified at title 48 of
the Code of Federal Regulations.   
(b)  “Administrator” refers to the Administrator of the Office of
Federal Public Procurement Policy.  
(c)  “Agency” means an executive department, a military department, or
any independent establishment within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 101, 102,
and 104(1), respectively, and any wholly owned Government corporation
within the meaning of 31 U.S.C. 9101.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Reforming
the Federal Acquisition Regulation</span>.  Within 180 days of the date
of this order, the Administrator, in coordination with the other members
of the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council), the heads
of agencies, and appropriate senior acquisition and procurement
officials from agencies, shall take appropriate actions to amend the FAR
to ensure that it contains only provisions that are required by statute
or that are otherwise necessary to support simplicity and usability,
strengthen the efficacy of the procurement system, or protect economic
or national security interests.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Aligning
Agency Supplements to the FAR</span>.  
(a)  Within 15 days of the date of this order, each agency exercising
procurement authority pursuant to the FAR shall designate a senior
acquisition or procurement official to work with the Administrator and
the FAR Council to ensure agency alignment with FAR reform and to
provide recommendations regarding any agency-specific supplemental
regulations to the FAR.  The Administrator, the FAR Council, and each
agency designee under this subsection shall collaborate to identify and
appropriately address FAR provisions that are inconsistent with the
policy objectives described in section 2 of this order.     
(b)  Within 20 days of the date of this order, the Director of the
Office of Management and Budget, in consultation with the Administrator,
shall issue a memorandum to agencies that provides guidance regarding
implementation of this order.  That memorandum shall ensure consistency
and alignment of policy objectives and implementation regarding changes
to the FAR and agencies’ supplemental regulations to the FAR.    
(c)  The memorandum issued pursuant to subsection (b) of this section
shall propose new agency supplemental regulations and internal guidance
that promote expedited and streamlined acquisitions.  With respect to
such proposals, the Administrator shall direct the appropriate agency
and its subordinate agencies to adhere to the ten-for-one requirement
described in Executive Order 14192.   
(d)  The Administrator and the FAR Council shall issue deviation and
interim guidance, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law,
until final rules reforming the FAR are published.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Regulatory
Sunset</span>.  In amending the FAR under section 4 of this order, the
Administrator, in coordination with the FAR Council, shall:  
(a)  identify all FAR provisions not required by statute that will
remain in the FAR;  
(b)  consider amending the FAR such that any provisions identified in
accordance with subsection (a) of this section will expire 4 years after
the effective date of the final rule promulgated in accordance with
section 4 of this order unless renewed by the FAR Council; and  
(c)  consider whether any new FAR provision not required by statute that
is promulgated after the effective date of the final rule promulgated in
accordance with subsection (b) of this section should include a
provision stating that it will expire 4 years after its effective date
unless renewed by the FAR Council.

(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.  
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
