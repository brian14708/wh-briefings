title: Reforming Foreign Defense Sales to Improve Speed and Accountability
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  To serve the
interests of the American people, the United States must maintain the
world’s strongest and most technologically advanced military through a
dynamic defense industrial base, coupled with a robust network of
capable partners and allies.  A rapid and transparent foreign defense
sales system that enables effective defense cooperation between the
United States and our chosen partners is foundational to these
objectives.  Reforming this system would simultaneously strengthen the
security capabilities of our allies and invigorate our own defense
industrial base.  This mutually reinforcing approach would enhance
United States warfighting capabilities by fostering healthy American
supply chains, domestic production levels, and technological
development.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of my Administration to:  
(a) Improve accountability and transparency throughout the foreign
defense sales system to ensure predictable and reliable delivery of
American products to foreign partners in support of United States
foreign policy objectives.

(b) Consolidate parallel decision-making when determining which military
capabilities the United States will choose to provide, and to which
countries.

\(c\) Reduce rules and regulations involved in the development,
execution, and monitoring of foreign defense sales and of transfer cases
to ensure alignment with United States foreign policy objectives. 

\(d\) Increase government-industry collaboration to achieve cost and
schedule efficiencies in the execution of the Foreign Military Sales
(FMS) program.

\(e\) Advance United States competitiveness abroad, revitalize the
defense industrial base, and lower unit costs for the United States and
our allies and partners by integrating exportability features in the
design phase, improving financing options for partners, and increasing
contract flexibility overall.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Phased Implementation</span>.
 (a)  The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense shall
promptly:

\(i\)    Implement National Security Presidential Memorandum 10 of April
19, 2018 (United States Conventional Arms Transfer Policy), or any
successor policy directive.

\(ii\)   Reevaluate restrictions imposed by the Missile Technology
Control Regime on Category I items and consider supplying certain
partners with specific Category I items, in consultation with the
Secretary of Commerce.

\(iii\)  Submit a joint letter to the Congress proposing an update to
statutory congressional certification (also known as congressional
notification) thresholds of proposed sales under the FMS and Direct
Commercial Sales (DCS) programs in the Arms Export Control Act (22
U.S.C. 2751 et seq.).  The Secretary of State shall also work with the
Congress to review congressional notification processes to ensure the
timely adjudication of notified FMS and DCS cases. 

(b)  Within 60 days of the date of this order:

(i)   The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of
Defense, shall develop a list of priority partners for conventional arms
transfers and issue updated guidance to Chiefs of the United States
Diplomatic Missions regarding this list. 

\(ii\)  The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of
State, shall:

\(A\)  develop a list of priority end-items for potential transfer to
priority partners identified by the Secretary of State in the list
required by this subsection;

\(B\)  ensure the transfer of priority end-items to priority partners
would not cause significant harm to United States force readiness; and

\(C\)  ensure the transfer of priority end-items to priority partners
would advance my Administration’s goal of strengthening allied
burden-sharing, both by sharing the cost of end-item production and by
increasing our allies’ capacity to meet capability targets
independently, without sustained support from the United States.

(c)(i)  The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense shall
review, update, and reissue the lists of priority partners and military
end-items on an annual basis.  
the United States Munitions List, 22 C.F.R. part 121, to focus
protections solely on our most sensitive and sophisticated technologies,
and shall establish clear criteria for including an item on the FMS-Only
List.

\(ii\) The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense shall review
and update the list of defense items that can only be purchased through
the FMS process (the FMS-Only List) and

(d)  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State
and the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of
Commerce, shall submit a plan to the President, through the Assistant to
the President for National Security Affairs (APNSA), to:  improve the
transparency of United States defense sales to foreign partners by
developing metrics for accountability; secure exportability as a
requirement in the early stages of the acquisition process; and
consolidate technology security and foreign disclosure approvals.

(e)  Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of
Defense, with the assistance of the Secretary of State and the Secretary
of Commerce, shall submit a plan to the APNSA to develop a single
electronic system to track all DCS export license requests and ongoing
FMS efforts throughout the case life-cycle.

 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Definitions</span>.  For
purposes of this order:      (a)  “Parallel decision-making” refers to

for other agencies to make decisions before taking action.

(b)  “Exportability” means the process to identify, develop, and
integrate technology protection features into United States defense
systems early in the acquisition process to protect critical
technologies, capabilities, and program information and thus enable
export to partners.

through the FMS process as opposed to the DCS process, as authorized in
the Arms Export Control Act and described in the Security Assistance

Chapter 4.

(d)  “End-item” means the final product when assembled and ready for
issue or deployment.

\(e\)  “Foreign defense sales system” means the enterprise devoted to
the transfer of defense articles, services, and training by the United
States Government and United States companies to international partners
