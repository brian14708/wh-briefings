title: Reforming Foreign Defense Sales to Improve Speed and Accountability
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>. 
Federal regulations should not predetermine economic winners and
losers.  Yet some regulations operate to exclude new market entrants. 
Regulations that reduce competition, entrepreneurship, and innovation —
as well as the benefits they create for American consumers — should be
eliminated.  This order commences the process for eliminating
anti-competitive regulations to revitalize the American economy.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Definitions</span>. 
(a)  “Agency” has the meaning given to it in section 3502 of title 44,
United States Code, except that it does not include the Executive Office
of the President or any components thereof.  
(b)  “Agency head” means the highest-ranking official of an agency, such
as the Secretary, Administrator, Chairman, or Director, unless otherwise
specified in this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Rescinding
Anti-Competitive Regulations</span>.  (a)  Agency heads shall, in
consultation with the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission
(Chairman) and the Attorney General, complete a review of all
regulations subject to their rulemaking authority and identify those
that:  
(i)    create, or facilitate the creation of, de facto or de jure
monopolies;  
(ii)   create unnecessary barriers to entry for new market
participants;  
(iii)  limit competition between competing entities or have the effect
of limiting competition between competing entities;  
(iv)   create or facilitate licensure or accreditation requirements that
unduly limit competition;  
(v)    unnecessarily burden the agency’s procurement processes, thereby
limiting companies’ ability to compete for procurements; or  
(vi)   otherwise impose anti-competitive restraints or distortions on
the operation of the free market.  
(b)  Within 70 days of the date of this order, agency heads shall each
provide to the Chairman and the Attorney General a list of regulations
identified by the categories specified in subsection (a) of this
section.  Agency heads shall also include a recommendation as to whether
each of the listed regulations warrants rescission or modification in
light of its anti-competitive effects.  For recommended modifications,
agency heads shall briefly specify what modification is appropriate. 
For regulations that are anti-competitive by design, agency heads shall
provide a justification for their anti-competitive effects if the agency
head is not proposing rescission or modification.  
(c)  In conducting the review required by subsection (a) of this
section, agency heads shall prioritize review of those rules that
satisfy the definition of “significant regulatory action” in Executive
Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 (Regulatory Planning and Review), as
amended.  
(d)  Within 10 days of the date of this order, the Chairman shall issue
a request for information (RFI) that seeks public input on the
identification of regulations that fall within the categories specified
in subsection (a) of this section, as well as comments explaining the
proposed classifications.  The request shall remain open for 40 days. 
Upon the close of the RFI period, the Chairman shall convey any relevant
responses to the agency with rulemaking authority over the identified
regulation.  
(e)  Within 90 days of receipt of the agency lists specified in
subsection (b) of this section, the Chairman, in consultation with the
Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy,
and the relevant agency heads, shall provide to the Director of the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB Director) a consolidated list of
regulations that warrant rescission or modification in light of their
anti-competitive effects, along with recommended modifications.  The
Chairman may include on the consolidated list regulations not originally
included on an agency list if such regulations fall within at least one
of the categories outlined in subsections (a)(i)-(vi) of this section.  
(f)  Upon receipt of the consolidated list described in subsection (e)
of this section, the OMB Director, through the Administrator of the
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, shall consult with the
Chairman, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for
Economic Policy, and the relevant agency heads to decide whether to
incorporate the proposed rescissions or modifications into the Unified
Regulatory Agenda developed pursuant to Executive Order 14219 of
February 19, 2025 (Ensuring Lawful Governance and Implementing the
President’s “Department of Government Efficiency” Deregulatory
Initiative).

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">General
Provisions</span>.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to
impair or otherwise affect:  
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or  
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.  
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
