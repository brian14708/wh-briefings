title: Addressing Certain Tariffs on Imported Articles
---
 
  
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq*.), the National
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq*.), section 604 of the Trade Act
of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), section 232 of the Trade Expansion
Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862), and section 301 of title 3,
United States Code, it is hereby ordered:  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  The United
States has imposed tariffs under various statutory authorities and
through a number of Executive Orders and proclamations to protect
national security and address unusual and extraordinary threats to the
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.
 Although each of these actions, as listed in section 2 of this order,
serves separate and distinct policy purposes, I have now determined
that, to the extent these tariffs apply to the same article, these
tariffs should not all have a cumulative effect (or “stack” on top of
one another) because the rate of duty resulting from such stacking
exceeds what is necessary to achieve the intended policy goals.  To
avoid the cumulative effect of overlapping tariffs on certain articles,
this order sets out the procedure for determining which of multiple
tariffs shall apply to an article when that article is subject to more
than one of the actions listed in section 2 of this order.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Applicability</span>.  This
order shall apply only to the administration of tariffs imposed through
the following actions and subsequent amendments to those tariffs:  
(a)  Proclamation 10908 of March 26, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of
Automobiles and Automobile Parts Into the United States);  
(b)  Executive Order 14193 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties To
Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Northern Border), as
amended by Executive Order 14197 of February 3, 2025 (Progress on the
Situation at Our Northern Border), Executive Order 14226 of March 2,
2025 (Amendment to Duties To Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across
Our Northern Border), and Executive Order 14231 of March 6, 2025
(Amendment to Duties to Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our
Northern Border);  
(c)  Executive Order 14194 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties To
Address the Situation at Our Southern Border), as amended by Executive
Order 14198 of February 3, 2025 (Progress on the Situation at Our
Southern Border), Executive Order 14227 of March 2, 2025 (Amendment to
Duties To Address the Situation at Our Southern Border), and Executive
Order 14232 of March 6, 2025 (Amendment to Duties to Address the Flow of
Illicit Drugs Across Our Southern Border);  
(d)  Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum
Into the United States), as amended by Proclamation 9980 of January 24,
2020 (Adjusting Imports of Derivative Aluminum Articles and Derivative
Steel Articles Into the United States), and Proclamation 10895 of
February 10, 2025 Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States);
and  
(e)  Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into
the United States), as amended by Proclamation 9980 of January 24, 2020
(Adjusting Imports of Derivative Aluminum Articles and Derivative Steel
Articles Into the United States), and Proclamation 10896 of February 10,
2025 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States).

<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Non-Stacking of Tariff
Measures</span>.  (a)  Notwithstanding any provision of any action
listed in section 2 of this order, tariffs for articles subject to
tariffs under the actions listed in section 2 of this order shall apply
as follows:   
          (i)    An article subject to tariffs pursuant to the action
listed in section (2)(a) of this order shall not be subject to
additional tariffs on that article pursuant to the actions listed in
sections 2(b) through 2(e) of this order.  
         (ii)   An article subject to tariffs pursuant to the actions
listed in section 2(b) or 2(c) of this order shall not be subject to
additional tariffs on that article pursuant to the actions listed in
section 2(d) or 2(e) of this order.   
         (iii)  An article subject to tariffs pursuant to the actions
listed in section 2(d) of this order shall be subject to additional
tariffs on that article pursuant to the actions listed in section 2(e)
of this order, provided the article otherwise satisfies all conditions
necessary for application of those additional tariffs; likewise, an
article subject to tariffs pursuant to the actions listed in section
2(e) of this order shall be subject to additional tariffs on that
article pursuant to the actions listed in section 2(d) of this order,
provided the article otherwise satisfies all conditions necessary for
application of those additional tariffs.  
     (b)  Subsection (a) of this section shall not be construed to
diminish the validity of any action listed in section 2 of this order.
 Each action listed in section 2 of this order remains independently
valid and enforceable, except that the duty rates provided by these
actions shall not be cumulative when the conditions outlined in
subsection (a) of this section are met.  
     (c)  If an imported article is subject to both a tariff imposed
pursuant to subsection (a) of this section and one or more tariffs
imposed pursuant to an action or actions not listed in section 2 of this
order, then the tariff imposed on the article pursuant to subsection (a)
of this section shall be cumulative with the tariff or tariffs imposed
pursuant to the action or actions not listed in section 2 of this
order.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Non-applicability to Other
Tariff Measures</span>.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be interpreted
to alter or limit the application of any duties, taxes, fees, or
exactions other than those imposed pursuant to the actions listed in
section 2 of this order.  
(b)  Accordingly, an article that is subject to duties pursuant to an
action listed in section 2 of this order may still be subject to other
applicable duties, taxes, fees, exactions, and charges, such as, but not
limited to, those set forth in column 1 of the Harmonized Tariff
Schedule of the United States (HTSUS); duties imposed pursuant to
section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended; duties imposed

order, to reflect the policy set forth in this order.  
(b)  The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Homeland Security,

<span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.  (a)
