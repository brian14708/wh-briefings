title: Modernizing Defense Acquisitions and Spurring Innovation in the Defense Industrial
  Base
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  As Chief
Executive and Commander in Chief, I am committed to ensuring that the
United States military possesses the most lethal warfighting
capabilities in the world.  America’s defense industrial base is central
to this effort.  Similarly, the defense acquisition workforce is a
national strategic asset that will be decisive in any conflict, where
the factory floor can be just as significant as the battlefield.  
Unfortunately, after years of misplaced priorities and poor management,
our defense acquisition system does not provide the speed and
flexibility our Armed Forces need to have decisive advantages in the
future.  In order to strengthen our military edge, America must deliver
state‐of‐the‐art capabilities at speed and scale through a comprehensive
overhaul of this system.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of the United States Government to accelerate defense procurement
and revitalize the defense industrial base to restore peace through
strength.  To achieve this, the United States will rapidly reform our
antiquated defense acquisition processes with an emphasis on speed,
flexibility, and execution.  We will also modernize the duties and
composition of the defense acquisition workforce, as well as incentivize
and reward risk-taking and innovation from these personnel.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Acquisition Process
Reform</span>.  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary
of Defense shall submit to the President a plan to reform the Department
of Defense’s acquisition processes that, to the maximum extent possible,
incorporates the following:  
(a)  Utilization of existing authorities to expedite acquisitions
throughout the Department of Defense, including a first preference for
commercial solutions and a general preference for Other Transactions
Authority, application of Rapid Capabilities Office policies, or any
other authorities or pathways to promote streamlined acquisitions under
the Adaptative Acquisition Framework.  Starting upon issuance of this
order, and during the formation of the plan, the Secretary of Defense
shall prioritize use of these authorities in all pending Department of
Defense contracting actions and require their application, where
appropriate and consistent with applicable law, for all Department of
Defense contracting actions pursued while the plan directed by this
section is under consideration.   
(b)  A detailed process review of each functional support role within
the acquisition workforce to eliminate unnecessary tasks, reduce
duplicative approvals, and centralize decision-making.  These reviews
should also include evaluations of program managers, contracting
officers, engineering authorities, financial managers, cost estimators,
and logisticians.  
(c)  A detailed process by which the Under Secretary of Defense for
Acquisition and Sustainment, Service Acquisition Executives, and
Component Acquisition Executives can effectively manage risk for all
acquisition programs through a formal steering board known as a
Configuration Steering Board. 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Internal Regulations
Review</span>.  The Secretary of Defense shall oversee the review of
and, as appropriate, propose revisions to relevant Department of Defense
instructions, implementation guides, manuals, and regulations relating
to acquisition to:   
(a)  Eliminate or revise any unnecessary supplemental regulations or any
other internal guidance, such as relevant parts of the Financial
Management Regulation and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation
Supplement.  
(b)  Promote expedited and streamlined acquisitions.  Where new
supplemental regulations or internal guidance is proposed, the Secretary
of Defense shall apply the ten-for-one rule as described in Executive
Order 14192 of January 31, 2025 (Unleashing Prosperity Through
Deregulation).

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Acquisition Workforce
Reform</span>.  Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary
of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of the Army, the
Secretary of the Navy, the Secretary of the Air Force, and Component
Acquisition Executives, shall develop and submit to the President a plan
for consideration to reform, right-size, and train the acquisition
workforce that includes the following components:  
(a)  The restructuring of performance evaluation metrics for acquisition
workforce members to include the ability to demonstrate and apply a
first consideration of commercial solutions, adaptive acquisition
pathways through the Adaptive Acquisition Framework, and iterative
requirements based on the perspective of the end user.  
(b)  An analysis of acquisition workforce staff levels required to
develop, deliver, and sustain warfighting capabilities.     
(c)  The establishment of field training teams by the Under Secretary of
Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, led by senior acquisition
executives or managers with expertise in innovative acquisition
authorities and commercial solutions, and modeled after field training
teams authorized by section 832 of Public Law 118-159 (10 U.S.C. 1749).
 These teams should provide hands-on guidance, deliver templates and
case studies of successful approaches for implementing innovative
acquisition authorities, and should assist integrated functional program
teams in completing acquisition and sustainment tasks.  
(d)  The development and implementation of policies, procedures, and
tools to incentivize acquisition officials to, in good faith, utilize
innovative acquisition authorities and take measured and calculated
risks.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Major Defense Acquisition
Program Review</span>.  (a)  Within 90 days of the date of this order,
the Secretary of Defense, acting through the Deputy Secretary of
Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary
of the Navy, the Secretary of the Air Force, the Under Secretary of
Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, and Component Acquisition
Executives, shall complete a comprehensive review of all major defense
acquisition programs (MDAPs), as defined in section 4201 of title 10,
United States Code, to determine if any such programs are inconsistent
with the policy objectives set forth in section 2 of this order.  As
part of the review of all MDAPs:  
(i)   any program more than 15 percent behind schedule based on the
current Acquisition Program Baseline (APB), 15 percent over cost based
on the current APB, unable to meet any key performance parameters, or
unaligned with the Secretary of Defense’s mission priorities, will be
considered for potential cancellation.  The Secretary of Defense shall
submit the potential cancellation list to the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) for future budget determinations.  
(ii)  the Secretary of Defense shall provide a listing of all MDAPs
contracts, along with performance against original and approved
Government cost estimates to the Director of OMB for review within 90
days from the date of this order.  
(b)  Following this comprehensive review of MDAPs, the Secretary of
Defense shall provide the Director of OMB with a plan for reviewing all
remaining major systems, as defined in section 3041 of title 10, United
States Code, that are not MDAPs.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">7</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Requirements</span>.  The
Secretary of Defense, acting through the Deputy Secretary of Defense, in

the Secretary of the Air Force, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, shall
complete a comprehensive review of the Joint Capabilities Integration
and Development System within 180 days of the date of this order, with
the goal of streamlining and accelerating acquisition.
