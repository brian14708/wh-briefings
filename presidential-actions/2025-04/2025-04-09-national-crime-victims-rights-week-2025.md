 BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION 

All Americans should be able to thrive in their communities, raise their
families, and lead long and fulfilling lives without fear of being
victimized by crime.  Tragically, in recent years, soft-on-crime
policies have emboldened vicious criminals, murderers, and gang members
to wage war on our public safety, endanger our public spaces, and break
down the rule of law.  This National Crime Victims’ Rights Week, we
offer our unending support to every victim of crime, and we recognize
that freedom in America cannot survive without safety in America.  
Under the previous administration, violent crime skyrocketed in
virtually every city of our great Nation, with 12 major cities breaking
all-time high murder records in 2021.  Over the last 4 years, radical
left-wing policies empowered some of the most depraved criminals on the
planet and made it harder for police officers to do their jobs.  Earlier
this year, President Biden commuted the sentences of 37 death row
criminals guilty of the most heinous acts imaginable — including rape,
child molestation, and murder.  These commutations stand as a
devastating betrayal of innocent victims and their families.   
During the Biden Administration, the United States Border Patrol
recorded over 10.8 million encounters of illegal aliens nationwide,
along with over 2 million known “got aways” — a number that could be
underreported by as much as 20 percent.  Millions of illegal aliens have
entered or evaded capture, with countless criminals and potential
national security threats now at large in our Country.  That is why
within hours of taking the oath of office, I declared a national
emergency on our southern border.  We have also begun the largest
deportation operation in the history of our country — and as your 47th
President, the first bill I signed into law was the Laken Riley Act,
which mandates the detention of all dangerous criminal aliens who
threaten public safety.  
To aid the righteous mission of the men and women in blue, my
Administration is committed to enhancing legal protections for law
enforcement officers.  I am also asking the Congress for a new crime
bill that will get tough on repeat offenders while enhancing protection
for our law enforcement officials, so they can do their jobs without
fear of their lives being destroyed.   
Under my leadership, America will soon, once again, be a country where
the blessings of life and peace exist freely in our homes, at places of
work and worship, and throughout our cities, streets, and neighborhoods.
 Our citizens will be able to live without the threat of getting robbed,
assaulted, or shot.  This week, as we honor the lives of victims and
their families, I reaffirm my solemn pledge to build a safer, stronger,
and more secure Nation for citizens of every race, religion, color, and
creed.  
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 6 through April
12, 2025, as National Crime Victims’ Rights Week.  I urge all Americans,
families, law enforcement, community and faith-based organizations, and
private organizations to work together to support victims of crime and
protect their rights.  
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
ninth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five,
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred
and forty-ninth.
