title: Ensuring National Security and Economic Resilience Through Section 232 Actions
  on Processed Critical Minerals and Derivative Products
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the Trade Expansion Act
of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862) (the “Act”), it is hereby
ordered:  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  A strong
national defense depends on a robust economy and price stability, a
resilient manufacturing and defense industrial base, and secure domestic
supply chains.  Critical minerals, including rare earth elements, in the
form of processed minerals are essential raw materials and critical
production inputs required for economic and national security.  Critical
mineral oxides, oxalates, salts, and metals (processed critical
minerals), as well as their derivative products — the manufactured goods
incorporating them — are similarly foundational to United States
national security and defense.  
  
     But processed critical minerals and their derivative products face
significant global supply chain vulnerabilities and market distortions
due to reliance on a small number of foreign suppliers.  These
vulnerabilities and distortions have led to significant United States
import dependencies.  The dependence of the United States on imports and
the vulnerability of our supply chains raises the potential for risks to
national security, defense readiness, price stability, and economic
prosperity and resilience.  
  
     Processed critical minerals and their derivative products are
essential for economic security and resilience because they underpin key
industries, drive technological innovation, and support critical
infrastructure vital for a modern American economy.  They are key
building blocks of our manufacturing base and foundational to sectors
ranging from transportation and energy to telecommunications and
advanced manufacturing.  These economic sectors are, moreover,
foundational to America’s national security.  
  
     Processed critical minerals and their derivative products are
essential for national security because they are foundational to
military infrastructure, energy infrastructure, and advanced defense
systems and technologies.  They are key building blocks of our defense
industrial base and integral to applications such as jet engines,
missile guidance systems, advanced computing, radar systems, advanced
optics, and secure communications equipment.  
  
     The United States manufacturing and defense industrial bases remain
dependent on foreign sources for processed critical mineral products. 
Many of these foreign sources are at risk of serious, sustained, and
long-term supply chain shocks.  Should the United States lose access to
processed critical minerals from foreign sources, the United States
commercial and defense manufacturing base for derivative products could
face significant shortages and an inability to meet demand.   
  
     Associated risks arise from a variety of factors.  First, global
supply chains are prone to disruption from geopolitical tensions, wars,
natural disasters, pandemics, and trade conflicts.  
  
     Second, major global foreign producers of processed critical
minerals have engaged in widespread price manipulation, overcapacity,
arbitrary export restrictions, and the exploitation of their supply
chain dominance to distort world markets and thereby gain geopolitical
and economic leverage over the United States and other competitors that
depend on processed critical minerals to manufacture derivative products
essential to their economic and national security and national defense.
Therefore, the import dependence of the United States on processed
critical minerals from foreign sources may pose a serious national
security risk to the United States economy and defense preparedness.  
  
     Third, the risks arising from America’s import dependence on
processed critical minerals also extend to derivative products that are
integral to the United States economy and economic and national
security.   
  
     For the United States to manufacture derivative products, it must
have ready access to an affordable, resilient, and sustainable supply of
processed critical minerals.  Simultaneously, a resilient and
sustainable manufacturing base for derivative products is vital to
creating a stable demand base for processed critical minerals.  Both
must coexist to ensure economic stability and national security.  
  
     Finally, overreliance on a small number of geographic regions
amplifies the risks posed by geopolitical instability and regional
disruptions.  
  
     In light of the above risks and realities, an investigation under
section 232 of the Act (section 232) is necessary to determine whether
imports of processed critical minerals and their derivative products
threaten to impair national security.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Definitions</span>.  As used in
this order:  
        (a)  The term “critical minerals” means those minerals included
in the “Critical Minerals List” published by the United States
Geological Survey (USGS) pursuant to section 7002(c) of the Energy Act
of 2020 (30 U.S.C. 1606) at 87 FR 10381, or any subsequent such list. 
The term “critical minerals” also includes uranium.  
        (b)  The term “rare earth elements” means the 17 elements
identified as rare earth elements by the Department of Energy (DOE) in
the April 2020 publication titled “Critical Materials Rare Earths Supply
Chain.”  The term also includes any additional elements that either the
USGS or DOE determines in any subsequent official report or publication
should be considered rare earth elements.  
        (c)  The term “processed critical minerals” refers to critical
minerals that have undergone the activities that occur after critical
mineral ore is extracted from a mine up through its conversion into a
metal, metal powder or a master alloy.  These activities specifically
occur beginning from the point at which ores are converted into oxide
concentrates; separated into oxides; and converted into metals, metal
powders, and master alloys.   
        (d)  The term “derivative products” includes all goods that
incorporate processed critical minerals as inputs.  These goods include
semi-finished goods (such as semiconductor wafers, anodes, and cathodes)
as well as final products (such as permanent magnets, motors, electric
vehicles, batteries, smartphones, microprocessors, radar systems, wind
turbines and their components, and advanced optical devices).

<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline"> Section 232
Investigation</span>.  (a)  The Secretary of Commerce shall initiate an
investigation under section 232 to determine the effects on national
security of imports of processed critical minerals and their derivative
products.  
     (b)  In conducting the investigation described in subsection (a) of
this section, the Secretary of Commerce shall assess the factors set
forth in 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), labeled “Domestic production for national
defense; impact of foreign competition on economic welfare of domestic
industries,” as well as other relevant factors, including:  
             (i)    identification of United States imports of all
processed critical minerals and derivative products incorporating such
processed critical minerals;  
             (ii)   the foreign sources by percent and volume of all
processed critical mineral imports and derivative product imports, the
specific types of risks that may be associated with each source by
country, and those source countries deemed to be of significant risk;  
            (iii)  an analysis of the distortive effects of the
predatory economic, pricing, and market manipulation strategies and
practices used by countries that process critical minerals that are
exported to the United States, including the distortive effects on
domestic investment and the viability of United States production, as
well as an assessment of how such strategies and practices permit such
countries to maintain their control over the critical minerals
processing sector and distort United States market prices for derivative
products;  
             (iv)   an analysis of the demand for processed critical
minerals by manufacturers of derivative products in the United States
and globally, including an assessment of the extent to which such
manufacturers’ demand for processed critical minerals originates from
countries identified under subsections (b)(ii) and (b)(iii) of this
section;  
             (v)    a review and risk assessment of global supply chains
for processed critical minerals and their derivative products;  
             (vi)   an analysis of the current and potential
capabilities of the United States to process critical minerals and their
derivative products; and  
             (vii)  the dollar value of the current level of imports of
all processed critical minerals and derivative products by total value
and country of export.  
     (c) ** **The Secretary of Commerce shall, consistent with
applicable law, proceed expeditiously in conducting the investigation as
follows:  
             (i)    Within 90 days of the date of this order, the
Secretary of Commerce shall submit for internal review and comment a

for Trade and Manufacturing.  
             (ii)   Comments to the Secretary of Commerce from the
officials identified in subsection (c)(i) of this section shall be
provided within 15 days of submission of the draft interim report
described in subsection (c)(i) of this section.  
             (iii)  The Secretary of Commerce shall submit a final
report and recommendations to the President within 180 days of the
investigation’s commencement.  
     (d)  In considering whether to make recommendations for action or
inaction pursuant to section 232(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1862(b)), the
Secretary of Commerce shall consider:  
             (i)    the imposition of tariffs as well as other import
restrictions and their appropriate levels;  
             (ii) **  **safeguards to avoid circumvention and any
weakening of the section 232 measures;  
             (iii) ** **policies to incentivize domestic production,
processing, and recycling; and  
             (iv) **  **any additional measures that may be warranted to
