In honor of the National Peace Officers’ Memorial Service being held in
Washington, D.C., to remember and pay respect to law enforcement
officers who died in the line of duty and their families, by the
authority vested in me as President of the United States by
the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby
order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at
the White House and upon all public buildings and grounds, at all
military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the
Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the
United States and its Territories and possessions on Saturday, October
16, 2021.  I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for
the same length of time at all United States embassies, legations,
consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military
facilities and naval vessels and stations.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-sixth.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
