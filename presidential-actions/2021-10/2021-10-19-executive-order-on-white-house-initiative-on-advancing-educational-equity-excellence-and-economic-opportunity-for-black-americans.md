title: Executive Order on White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity,
  Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Black Americans
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:  
  
Section 1.  Policy.  Educational opportunity is a fundamental element of
the American promise.  The United States Supreme Court recognized in
1954 in Brown v. Board of Education that education “is a right which
must be made available to all on equal terms.”  In the decades since,
our Nation has made progress in advancing equality and fairness in our
schools, and the achievements, talents, and tenacity of Black students,
educators, families, and scholars make our Nation’s schools and
communities stronger for all Americans.  Black students are thriving in
schools across the country, inside the classroom — as valedictorians and
award-winning scientists — and outside of it, including in debate,
athletics, student government, and national spelling bees, among many
other areas.  
  
Over the course of America’s history, Black Americans have helped to
build, strengthen, and lead our Nation towards becoming a more perfect
Union.  Although for far too long, Black Americans were denied even the
most basic access to education, the vital contributions of Black
Americans in the fields of science, academia, business, and public
service, among others, are a testament to the resilience of Black
Americans and the steps our Nation has taken to expand access to
education and opportunity.  
  
In spite of this progress, entrenched disparities continue to plague
America’s education system, holding far too many Black students back
from achieving their full potential.  Because of persistent racial and
systemic injustices in our Nation, Black students remain more likely to
attend high-poverty and racially segregated schools than White students.
 Black students are inequitably disciplined and suspended from school at
disproportionately higher rates than White students for similar
offenses.  In addition, Black students too often face limited access to
advanced and college-preparatory courses.  Systemic racial disparities
in education negatively impact learning outcomes for Black students and
many face persistent gaps in reading and mathematics achievement.
 Studies show that school districts with high concentrations of Black
students are much more likely to be underfunded than districts where a
majority of students are White, and face much wider funding gaps, with
an average deficit of more than $5,000 per student.  Black students are
still below the national average for educational attainment in high
school, and that gap is even higher for college attainment rates, as 26
percent of Black Americans ages 25 and older have attained a bachelor’s
degree, while the national average is 36 percent.  Black students also
face unique challenges at the intersection of race and gender.  Barriers
to equity in education can compound for Black students who are also
LGBTQ+ students, English-language learners, Dreamers, or students with
disabilities.   
  
These disparities result in long-standing college and postsecondary
educational attainment gaps that affect life outcomes and access to
opportunities.  Although student populations are becoming increasingly
diverse, Black teachers remain significantly underrepresented in our
Nation’s classrooms.  Educational inequities have only widened
throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, as Black students are more likely to
experience remote learning challenges and greater learning loss as
compared to their White peers.  The persistent digital divide faced by
some Black students has contributed to this disparity.  It is a priority
of my Administration to ensure an equitable recovery from COVID-19, and
to provide all students with a successful return to the classroom.  
  
In the face of these historic and present-day inequities in our Nation’s
schools, Black students continue to persevere.  Black students and
scholars today are breaking the barriers confronted by generations who
came before.  Our Nation’s schools and communities are irrefutably
strengthened by the success, scholarship, and tenacity of Black students
of all ages.  But our Nation must go further to finally root out
systemic barriers in our schools.   
  
Additionally, these barriers are present not just in the classroom, but
also in the workplace.  Black Americans face systemic obstacles to
getting good jobs, gaps in wages and promotion, and higher incidences of
reported workplace discrimination than White workers.  Eliminating these
inequities requires expanding access to work-based learning and
leadership opportunities, including mentorships, sponsorships,
internships, and registered apprenticeships that provide not only career
guidance, but also the experience needed to navigate and excel in
successful careers.  In order for our Nation to equitably recover from
the COVID-19 crisis, and to ensure that every Black person in America
has a fair shot at the American dream, we must advance equity and
excellence in public education and access to economic opportunities.  
  
It is the policy of my Administration to advance educational equity,
excellence, and economic opportunity for Black Americans and communities
from early childhood until their chosen career.  
  
Sec. 2.  White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity,
Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Black Americans.  (a)  To
advance equity in our Nation’s schools and to promote the economic
opportunity that follows it, there is established in the Department of
Education (Department) the White House Initiative on Advancing
Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Black
Americans (Initiative), of which the Secretary of Education (Secretary)
shall serve as Chair.  The Secretary shall designate an Executive
Director for the Initiative (Executive Director).  
     (b)  The Initiative shall advance educational equity and economic
opportunity for Black students, families, and communities by focusing on
the following policy goals:   
          (i)     increasing general understanding of systemic causes of
educational challenges faced by many Black students, whether these
students are in urban, suburban, rural, or migrant learning
environments, and working across executive departments and agencies
(agencies) to address these challenges;  
          (ii)    increasing Black children’s and families’ access to
and participation in high-quality early childhood programs and services
that promote children’s healthy development and learning, prepare them
for success in school, and affirm their cultural identity;  
          (iii)   addressing the inequitable treatment of Black
children, such as eradicating discriminatory referrals to special
education and excessive disciplinary actions;  
          (iv)    supporting and improving data collection related to
Black students and the implementation of evidence-based strategies to
increase the participation and success of Black students in all levels
of education and prepare them for careers and civic engagement;   
          (v)     ensuring that all Black students have access to
excellent teachers, school leaders, and other professionals, including
by supporting efforts to improve the recruitment, preparation,
development, and retention of qualified, diverse teachers and school
leaders and other professionals who understand students’ lived
experiences and can effectively meet their learning, social, and
emotional needs;  
          (vi)    enhancing student support services and fostering
positive engagement among schools, families, community leaders, and
community-based organizations to increase the high school graduation and
post-secondary attendance rates and decrease the high school dropout
rate for Black students;    
          (vii)   promoting a positive school climate that supports
equitable access to and participation in college-readiness, advanced
placement courses, and internship opportunities, as well as innovative
dropout prevention and recovery strategies that better engage Black
youth in their learning, help them progress academically as needed, and
provide those who have left the educational system with pathways to
reentry;  
          (viii)  eliminating discriminatory enrollment, housing,
transportation, and other policies that lead to racial and socioeconomic
segregation among and within schools;   
          (ix)    ensuring equitable access to educational resources,
professionals, and technology, including by addressing racial
disparities in school funding and expenditures;  
          (x)     breaking down barriers that impede the access of
higher education institutions that serve Black students, such as
Predominantly Black Institutions (PBIs) and Historically Black Colleges
and Universities (HBCUs), to Federal funding, and strengthening the
capacity of those institutions to participate in Federal programs and
partnerships;   
          (xi)    advancing racial equity and economic opportunity by
connecting education to labor market needs through programs such as dual
enrollment, career and technical education, registered apprenticeships,
work-based learning, and career advancement, particularly in the fields
of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; and  
          (xii)   ensuring that Black communities have access to
resources for economic success, such as in the areas of financial
education, small business development, entrepreneurship, arts, science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics.  
     (c)  In working to fulfill its mission and objectives, the
Initiative shall, consistent with applicable law:  
          (i)    identify and promote evidence-based best practices that
can provide Black students with a rigorous and well-rounded education in
safe and healthy environments, as well as access to support services,
that will improve their educational, professional, economic, and civic
opportunities;  
          (ii)   advance and coordinate efforts to ensure equitable
opportunities for Black students in the re-opening process for schools
across the country, and take steps to ensure that Black students, from
early childhood to post-secondary education, can equitably recover from
learning losses and other challenges faced during the COVID-19
pandemic;  
          (iii)  encourage and develop partnerships with a national
network of early childhood and early intervention providers, schools,
institutions of higher education, and other public, private,
philanthropic, and nonprofit stakeholders to improve access to
educational equity and economic opportunities for Black Americans;  
          (iv)   monitor and support the development, implementation,
and coordination of Federal Government educational, workforce, research,
and business development policies, programs, and technical assistance
designed to improve outcomes for historically underserved communities,
including Black Americans;  
          (v)    work closely with the Executive Office of the President
on key Administration priorities related to education, equity, and
economic opportunity for Black Americans; and  
          (vi)   advise the Secretary on issues of importance to Black
Americans and policies relating to educational equity, excellence, and
economic opportunity for Black Americans.  
     (d)  There is established a Federal Interagency Working Group,
which shall be convened by the Executive Director and shall support the
efforts of the Initiative.  The Interagency Working Group shall
collaborate regarding resources and opportunities available across the
Federal Government to increase educational and economic opportunities
for Black Americans.
