the application of the prohibition in section 404(a) of the CSPA with

application of the prohibition in section 404(a) of the CSPA with

the extent that the CSPA would restrict such assistance or support; to
waive in part the application of the prohibition in section 404(a) of
the CSPA with respect to South Sudan to allow for the provision of PKO

Certify that the governments of the above countries are taking effective
and continuing steps to address the problem of child soldiers.   
  
Accordingly, I hereby waive such applications of section 404(a) of the
