title: "Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to Significant\
  \ Narcotics Traffickers Centered in\_Colombia"
---
 
On October 21, 1995, by Executive Order 12978, the President declared a
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq*.) to deal with the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and
economy of the United States constituted by the actions of significant
narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia and the extreme level of
violence, corruption, and harm such actions cause in the United States
and abroad. 

The actions of significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia
continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national
security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States and cause an
extreme level of violence, corruption, and harm in the United States and
abroad.  For this reason, the national emergency declared in Executive
Order 12978 of October 21, 1995, must continue in effect beyond
October 21, 2021.  Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year
the national emergency with respect to significant narcotics traffickers
centered in Colombia declared in Executive Order 12978.

This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and transmitted
to the Congress.  
                            

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR. 

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
October 12, 2021.
