  \ Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Native Americans and Strengthening Tribal\
  \ Colleges and\_Universities"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:

Section 1.  Policy.  The United States has a unique political and legal
relationship with federally recognized Tribal Nations, as set forth in
the Constitution of the United States, statutes, treaties, Executive
Orders, and court decisions.  The Federal Government is committed to
protecting the rights and ensuring the well-being of Tribal Nations
while respecting Tribal sovereignty and inherent rights of
self-determination.  In recognition of that commitment and to fulfill
the solemn obligations it entails, executive departments and agencies
(agencies) must help advance educational equity, excellence, and
economic opportunity for Native American students, whether they attend
public schools in urban, suburban, or rural communities; are
homeschooled; attend primary and secondary schools operated or funded by
the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) of the Department of the Interior;
or attend postsecondary educational institutions, including Tribal
Colleges and Universities (TCUs).

For more than a century, the United States imposed educational policies
designed to assimilate Native peoples into predominant United States
culture that devastated Native American students and their families.
Beginning with the Indian Civilization Act of 1819, the United States
enacted laws and implemented policies establishing and supporting Indian
boarding schools across the Nation. From 1871 onward, federally run
Indian boarding schools were used to culturally assimilate Native
American children who were forcibly removed from their families and
communities and relocated to distant residential facilities where their
Native identities, languages, traditions, and beliefs were forcibly
suppressed.  The conditions in these schools were usually harsh, and
sometimes abusive and deadly. Although these policies have ended, their
effects and resulting trauma reverberate in Native American communities
even today, creating specific challenges that merit Federal attention
and response.

During the global COVID-19 pandemic, Tribal Nations raced to protect
Tribal members and their way of life.  Tribal elders are often the
keepers of Tribal culture and are critical for the preservation of
Native languages, as the vitality of Native culture is inseparably tied
to Native languages.  Accordingly, my Administration is committed to
supporting preservation and revitalization of Native languages.  This
includes honoring the vibrancy, importance, and strength of Native
languages and the traditions, values, and cultural practices that
accompany them.

In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified long-standing
educational inequities that disproportionally affect Native American
communities and burden Native American students.  In particular, Native
American children face significant learning disruption as the digital
divide and lack of educational resources put remote learning out of
reach for too many.  Native American students experienced the greatest
decline in undergraduate enrollment in higher education from 2020 to
2021 compared to other student groups.  These inequities compound the
effects of other disparities faced by Native American women and girls in
particular.  The spike in gender-based violence during the COVID-19
pandemic has intensified safety concerns for Native American women and
girls, who were already victimized at higher rates than other women in
the United States. 

The Federal Government must put strong focus on early childhood and K-12
educational opportunities. These are important to developing and
strengthening Native American communities, and they set the stage for
educational advancement and career development, including opportunities
to attend TCUs.  

TCUs also merit focused attention, as these institutions are integral
and essential to Tribal communities. Their foundation, tradition, and
mission are unique, and their cultural grounding is invaluable to
providing high-quality education and successful outcomes for Native
American students.  TCUs fulfill a vital role in maintaining and
preserving irreplaceable Native languages and cultural traditions; in
promoting excellence in Native American education from early childhood
through primary and secondary education, into postsecondary education,
and throughout graduates’ careers; in offering an entry point for a
career in academia, strong technical and trade school opportunities, job
training, and other career-building programs to Native Americans; and in
supporting Tribal economic development efforts by building and
strengthening a highly skilled Native American workforce.  Often, they
are the only postsecondary institutions within some of our Nation’s most
economically disadvantaged and rural areas.  As a result, TCUs provide
crucial employment opportunities and services in communities that
continue to suffer high rates of unemployment and resulting social and
economic distress.  The Federal Government therefore reaffirms and
strengthens our commitment to Native American communities by investing
in TCUs to support their continued growth and success.

It is the policy of my Administration to advance equity, excellence, and
justice in our Nation’s education system and to further Tribal
self-governance, including by supporting activities that expand
educational opportunities and improve educational outcomes for all
Native American students.  My Administration will help expand
opportunities for Native American students to learn their Native
languages, histories, and cultural practices; promote indigenous
learning through the use of traditional ecological knowledge; and
enhance access to complete and competitive educations that prepare
Native American students for college, careers, and productive and
satisfying lives.  This includes supporting educational opportunities
for students attending TCUs, given the unique advantages those
institutions provide.  My Administration is further committed to
ensuring all Native American students have the ability to pursue careers
that provide economic security for themselves and their families,
including Native American women, who currently, on average, earn just 60
cents to every dollar earned by White men.  To these ends, my
Administration will collaborate with Tribal Nations to collect better
data on educational attainment gaps faced by Native American students to
help deepen understanding of these gaps, including barriers to workforce
participation, and inform solutions.

Sec. 2.  White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity,
Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Native Americans and
Strengthening Tribal Colleges and Universities.  (a)  To advance equity
in our Nation’s schools, to promote the economic opportunity that
follows it, and to fulfill our commitment to furthering Tribal
sovereignty, there is established in the Department of Education the
White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and
Economic Opportunity for Native Americans and Strengthening Tribal
Colleges and Universities (Initiative), of which the Secretary of
Education, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Secretary of Labor
shall serve as Co-Chairs.  The Secretary of Education shall, in
consultation with the other Co-Chairs of the Initiative, designate an
Executive Director for the Initiative (Executive Director).  The
Executive Director shall co-chair the Education Committee of the White
House Council on Native American Affairs (WHCNAA), established by
Executive Order 13647 of June 26, 2013 (Establishing the White House
Council on Native American Affairs).  
     (b)  The Initiative shall consult and collaborate with Tribal
Nations; Alaska Native Entities; TCUs; and State, Tribal, and local
educational departments and agencies to advance educational equity,

students’ lived experiences and can effectively meet their students’
academic, social, and emotional needs, particularly in partnership with
TCUs;  
          (v)     breaking down barriers that impede the access of
higher education institutions that serve Native American students, such
as TCUs, to Federal funding, and strengthening the capacity of those
institutions to participate in Federal programs and partnerships;  
          (vi)    ensuring that the unique indigenous, cultural,
educational, traditional ecological knowledge, and Native language needs
of Native American students are met;  
          (vii)   exploring policies to expand and support career and
technical education, job training, and other career-building programs
for Native American students and workers; and

career development — brought on or exacerbated by the COVID-19
pandemic;  
          (iv)    encourage and develop Federal partnerships with
public, private, philanthropic, and nonprofit entities to improve access
