title: "A Proclamation on National Character Counts Week,\_2021"
---
 
Every day, each of us makes countless decisions that ultimately define
our character and who we are as people.  Life’s daily choices may not
always seem consequential, but they have tremendous potential to
transform our communities, our country, and our world.  Our words have
the power to lift up or tear down, to inspire or discourage,
and to comfort or torment.  Our actions have the power to create
or destroy, to heal or to hurt, and to unify or divide. 

As Americans, our individual character — the sum of qualities that
defines who we are and how we treat one another — shapes the character
of our Nation and shapes the world we leave for our children.  Our
character is defined and revealed by the choices we make over a lifetime
and, in the case of our Nation, from generation to generation.  As we
celebrate National Character Counts Week, I encourage all Americans to
examine and embody the highest ideals that define our Nation and that
have helped us overcome our greatest challenges. 

I have long said that the story of America is the story of ordinary
people doing extraordinary things.  It is a story of strength and
resilience, courage and character.  Today, our Nation faces tests like
very few before — from fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and addressing
longstanding inequities and injustices, to confronting the ravages of
climate change, and responding to threats to our very democracy.
 Despite these trials, it is the character of the American people —
courageous, selfless, and community-minded — that is pulling us through.
 As we see in our first responders on the frontlines of the pandemic
helping their communities with selfless compassion, in our service
members bravely serving around the globe, in our scientists pursuing
knowledge with integrity, in our firefighters combating wildfires, and
in our teachers and parents and students adapting to new learning
environments with patience and determination — Americans are meeting the
moment by working to see that we overcome our challenges together.

Character is also revealed by our choices.  We must choose to uphold the
dignity of all Americans by protecting their health and security,
investing in their education and development, helping the needy and the
vulnerable, and erasing the stain of hate and discrimination from our
society.  On this and so many other tasks, I firmly believe that the
American people are up to the challenge. 

NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States
of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 17 through
October 23, 2021, as National Character Counts Week.  I encourage all
Americans to set aside differences and join in efforts of service that
contribute to their communities.  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
fifteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord
two thousand twenty-one, and of the Independence of the United States
of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
