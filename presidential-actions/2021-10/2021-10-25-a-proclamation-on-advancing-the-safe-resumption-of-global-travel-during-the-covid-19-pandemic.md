title: "A Proclamation on Advancing the Safe Resumption of Global Travel During the\
  \ COVID- \u2060 19 Pandemic"
---
 
The continued spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global threat to our health and
safety.  COVID-19 has resulted in more than 733,000 deaths in the United
States and more than 4,932,000 deaths worldwide.  New variants of
SARS-CoV-2 have also emerged globally, and variants that are more
transmissible or cause more severe disease than the original virus
strain are identified by the United States Government SARS-CoV-2
Interagency Group as variants of concern.  Globally, as of October 20,
2021, 166 countries have reported cases of the B.1.617.2 (Delta)
variant, a variant of concern that spreads more easily than previously
discovered variants of SARS-CoV-2.  The potential emergence of a variant
of high consequence — one that significantly reduces the effectiveness
of prevention measures or medical countermeasures — is also a primary
public health concern.

It is the policy of my Administration to implement science-based public
health measures, across all areas of the Federal Government, to prevent
further introduction, transmission, and spread of COVID-19 into and
throughout the United States, including from international air
travelers.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) within
the Department of Health and Human Services has determined that the best
way to slow the spread of COVID-19, including preventing infection by
the Delta variant, is for individuals to get vaccinated.  According to
the CDC, vaccinated individuals are 5 times less likely to be infected
and 10 times less likely to experience hospitalization or death due to
COVID-19 than unvaccinated individuals.  Other mitigation measures are
also critical to slowing the spread of COVID-19.  These measures include
testing and mask-wearing, which are particularly important strategies to
limit the spread of COVID-19 from asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic
individuals, as well as self-quarantining and self-isolating.  But
vaccination is the most important measure for reducing the risk of
COVID-19 transmission and for avoiding severe illness, hospitalization,
and death.

Substantial efforts are being made to increase vaccination rates across
the globe.  The availability of COVID-19 vaccines is rising, and over 6
billion doses have been administered globally.  As of October 24, 2021,
29 countries have a COVID-19 vaccination rate higher than 70 percent,
many countries are making efforts to encourage COVID-19 vaccination for
their populations, and some countries are considering or adding proof of
vaccination requirements as conditions for entry.  Many low-income
countries continue to have limited vaccine availability, but the United
States is leading a global effort to donate hundreds of millions of
vaccine doses where they are needed the most.

In light of these facts and circumstances, I have determined that it is
in the interests of the United States to move away from the
country-by-country restrictions previously applied during the COVID-19
pandemic and to adopt an air travel policy that relies primarily on
vaccination to advance the safe resumption of international air travel
to the United States.  This proclamation governs the entry into the
United States of noncitizen nonimmigrants — that is, noncitizens who are
visiting the United States or otherwise being admitted temporarily —
traveling to the United States by air.  It suspends the entry of
unvaccinated noncitizen nonimmigrants, except in limited circumstances,
and it ensures that the entry of unvaccinated noncitizen nonimmigrants
is consistent with applicable health and safety determinations made by
the Director of the CDC, including a requirement that, where
appropriate, such individuals agree and arrange to become fully
vaccinated against COVID-19 upon their arrival.  My Administration has
also taken action, apart from this proclamation, to ensure that
noncitizen immigrants are vaccinated prior to air travel to the United
States.  
  
Together, these policies aim to limit the risk that COVID-19, including
variants of the virus that causes COVID-19, is introduced, transmitted,
and spread into and throughout the United States, potentially
overwhelming United States healthcare and public health resources,
endangering the health and safety of the American people, and
threatening the security of our civil aviation system.  Given the
resumption of air travel as worldwide restrictions due to the COVID-19
pandemic begin to ease, these policies will, consistent with the
measures required by Executive Order 13998 of January 21, 2021
(Promoting COVID-19 Safety in Domestic and International Travel),
advance the safety and security of the air traveling public, the
government personnel responsible for ensuring the security of air
travel, and the millions of individuals employed by the United States
air travel industry, as well as their families and communities, while
also allowing the domestic and global economy to continue its recovery
from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States,
by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the
United States of America, including sections 1182(f) and 1185(a) of
title 8, United States Code, and section 301 of title 3, United States
Code, hereby find that it is in the interests of the United States to
advance the resumption of international travel to the United States,
provided necessary health and safety protocols are in place to protect
against the further introduction, transmission, and spread of COVID-19
into and throughout the United States.  I further find that vaccination
requirements are essential to advance the safe resumption of
international travel to the United States and that the unrestricted
entry of persons described in section 2 of this proclamation would,
except as provided for in section 3(a) of this proclamation, be
detrimental to the interests of the United States, and that their entry
should be subject to certain restrictions, limitations, and exceptions. 
I therefore hereby proclaim the following:

Section 1.  Revocation of Country-Specific Suspensions and Limitations
on Entry.  Proclamation 9984 of January 31, 2020 (Suspension of Entry as
Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons Who Pose a Risk of Transmitting
2019 Novel Coronavirus and Other Appropriate Measures To Address This
Risk), Proclamation 9992 of February 29, 2020 (Suspension of Entry as
Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Certain Additional Persons Who Pose a
Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus), Proclamation 10143 of
January 25, 2021 (Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of
Certain Additional Persons Who Pose a Risk of Transmitting Coronavirus
Disease 2019), and Proclamation 10199 of April 30, 2021 (Suspension of
Entry as Nonimmigrants of Certain Additional Persons Who Pose a Risk of
Transmitting Coronavirus Disease 2019), are revoked.

Sec. 2.  Global Suspension and Limitation on Entry of Certain
Individuals Who Are Not Fully Vaccinated Against COVID-19.  (a)  The
entry into the United States by air travel of noncitizens who are
nonimmigrants and who are not fully vaccinated against COVID-19 is
suspended and limited, except as provided in section 3 of this
proclamation.  This suspension and limitation on entry applies only to
air travelers to the United States and does not affect visa issuance.  
     (b)  Any noncitizen who is a nonimmigrant, who is not fully
vaccinated against COVID-19, and who, notwithstanding section 2(a) of
this proclamation, is permitted to enter the United States by air travel
pursuant to section 3(b) of this proclamation must agree to comply with
applicable public health precautions established by the Director of the
CDC to protect against the public health risk posed by travelers
entering into the United States.  Such precautions may be related to
vaccination, testing, mask-wearing, self-quarantine, and self-isolation,
as determined by the Director of the CDC, and may include requirements
that individuals:  
          (i)    provide proof of pre-departure testing for COVID-19, as
determined by the Director of the CDC;  
          (ii)   take precautions during air travel to protect against
the further introduction, transmission, and spread of COVID-19,
including by wearing a face mask, as determined by the Director of the
CDC;  
          (iii)  provide proof of having arranged for post-arrival
testing for COVID-19, as determined by the Director of the CDC; and  
          (iv)   provide proof of having arranged to self-quarantine or
self-isolate after arriving in the United States, as determined by the
Director of the CDC.  
     (c)  Any noncitizen who is a nonimmigrant, who is not fully
vaccinated against COVID-19, and who, notwithstanding section 2(a) of
this proclamation, is permitted to enter the United States by air travel
pursuant to section 3(b) of this proclamation must agree to become fully
vaccinated against COVID-19 within 60 days of arriving in the United
States, within some other timeframe as determined by the Director of the
CDC, or as soon as medically appropriate as determined by the Director
of the CDC, and must provide proof of having arranged to become fully
vaccinated against COVID-19 after arriving in the United States,
unless:  
          (i)    the noncitizen’s intended stay is sufficiently brief,
as determined by the Director of the CDC;  
          (ii)   the noncitizen is one for whom, given their age,
requiring vaccination would be inappropriate, as determined by the
Director of the CDC;  
          (iii)  the noncitizen has participated or is participating in
certain clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccination, as determined by the
Director of the CDC;  
          (iv)   COVID-19 vaccination is medically contraindicated for
the noncitizen, as determined by the Director of the CDC;  
          (v)    the noncitizen is described in section 3(b)(i) or
3(b)(ii) of this proclamation and has previously received a COVID-19
vaccine that is authorized or approved by the noncitizen’s country of
nationality, as determined by the Director of the CDC, in consultation
with the Secretary of State; or  
(vi)   the Director of the CDC otherwise determines that COVID-19
vaccination is not warranted for the noncitizen.

Sec. 3.  Scope of Suspension and Limitation on Entry.  (a)  The
suspension and limitations on entry in section 2 of this proclamation
shall not apply to any noncitizen seeking entry as a crew member of an
airline or other aircraft operator if such crew member or operator
adheres to all industry standard protocols for the prevention of
COVID-19, as set forth in relevant guidance for crew member health
issued by the CDC or by the Federal Aviation Administration in
coordination with the CDC.  
     (b)  The suspension and limitations on entry in section 2(a) of
this proclamation shall not apply to:  
          (i)     any noncitizen seeking entry into or transiting the
United States pursuant to one of the following nonimmigrant visa
classifications:  A-1, A-2, C-2, C-3 (as a foreign government official
or immediate family member of an official), E-1 (as an employee of TECRO
or TECO or the employee’s immediate family members), G-1, G-2, G-3, G-4,
NATO-1 through NATO-4, or NATO-6 (or seeking to enter as a nonimmigrant
in one of those NATO classifications);  
          (ii)    any noncitizen whose travel falls within the scope of
section 11 of the United Nations Headquarters Agreement or who is
traveling pursuant to United States legal obligation (as evidenced by a
letter of invitation from the United Nations or other documentation
showing the purpose of such travel);  
          (iii)   any noncitizen for whom, given their age, requiring
vaccination would be inappropriate, as determined by the Director of the
CDC, taking into account global vaccine availability for individuals in
that age group;  
          (iv)    any noncitizen who has participated or is
participating in certain clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccination, as
determined by the Director of the CDC;  
          (v)     any noncitizen for whom accepted COVID-19 vaccination

pursuant to section 4(a)(v) of this proclamation, and who seeks to enter
the United States pursuant to a nonimmigrant visa, except for a B-1 or
B-2 visa;  
          (viii) any noncitizen who is a member of the United States
Armed Forces or who is a spouse or child of a member of the United
States Armed Forces;

the CDC; or(x)     any noncitizen or group of noncitizens whose entry
would be in the national interest, as determined by the Secretary of
State, the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Homeland
Security, or their designees.     

Sec. 4.  Implementation and Enforcement.  (a)  The Secretary of Health
and Human Services, through the Director of the CDC, shall implement

availability of COVID-19 vaccination is limited; and  
          (vi)   establishing other public health measures consistent
with this proclamation to protect against the further introduction,
transmission, and spread of COVID-19 into and throughout the United
States by persons described in section 2 of this proclamation.  
                    (b)  The Secretary of Transportation and the
