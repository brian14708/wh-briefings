By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the Strategic and
Critical Materials Stock Piling Act, as amended (50 U.S.C. 98 *et
seq.*), section 1413 of the National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2013 (Public Law 112-239), and section 301 of title 3,
United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:  
     Section 1.  Policy and Purpose.  The United States needs resilient,
diverse, and secure supply chains to ensure our economic prosperity,
national security, and national competitiveness.  In Executive Order
14017 of February 24, 2021 (America’s Supply Chains), I directed a
comprehensive review of America’s supply chains to ensure that they are
resilient in the face of a range of risks.  One critical component of
safeguarding supply chain resilience and industrial base health is
ensuring that both the Federal Government and the private sector
maintain adequate quantities of supplies, equipment, or raw materials on
hand to create a buffer against potential shortages and import
dependencies.  Some of the Federal Government’s key tools to maintain
adequate quantities of supplies to guard against such shortages and
dependencies are the United States national stockpiles, including the
National Defense Stockpile.  By strengthening the National Defense
Stockpile, the Federal Government will both ensure that it is keeping
adequate quantities of goods on hand and provide a model for the private
sector, while recognizing that private sector stockpiles and reserves
can differ from government ones.  This order confers authority related
to the release of strategic and critical materials from the National
Defense Stockpile to improve Federal Government efforts around
stockpiling for national defense purposes.   
     Sec. 2.  Designation.  In accordance with section 98f of title 50,
United States Code, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and
Sustainment (Under Secretary) is designated to have authority to release
strategic and critical materials from the National Defense Stockpile.  
     Sec. 3.  Execution and Consultation.  In executing the authority
conferred by this order, the Under Secretary may release strategic and
critical materials from the National Defense Stockpile for use, sale, or
other disposition only when required for use, manufacture, or production
for purposes of national defense.  No release is authorized for economic
or budgetary purposes.  Prior to ordering the release of strategic and
critical materials from the National Defense Stockpile, the Under
Secretary shall consult with the heads of relevant executive departments
and agencies.  
     Sec. 4.  Authority.  (a)  All previously issued orders,
regulations, rulings, certificates, directives, and other actions
relating to any function affected by this order shall remain in effect
except to the extent that they are inconsistent with this order or are
subsequently amended or revoked under proper authority.  Nothing in this
order shall affect the validity or force of anything done under previous
delegations or another assignment of authority under the Strategic and
Critical Materials Stock Piling Act.  
     (b)  Nothing in this order shall affect the authorities assigned
under Executive Order 13603 of March 16, 2012 (National Defense
Resources Preparedness).  
     Sec. 5.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be
construed to impair or otherwise affect:  
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or  
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
     (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
