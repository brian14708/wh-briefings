  \ Respect to the Global Illicit Drug\_Trade"

TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:

Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to global illicit drug
trafficking declared in Executive Order 14059 of December 15, 2021, is
to continue in effect beyond December 15, 2024.

The trafficking into the United States of illicit drugs, including
fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, is causing the deaths of tens of
thousands of Americans annually, as well as countless more non-fatal
overdoses with their own tragic human toll.  Drug cartels, transnational
criminal organizations, and their facilitators are the primary sources
of illicit drugs and precursor chemicals that fuel the current opioid
epidemic, as well as drug-related violence that harms our communities. 
International drug trafficking –- including the illicit production,
global sale, and widespread distribution of illegal drugs; the rise of
extremely potent drugs such as fentanyl and other synthetic opioids; as
well as the growing role of Internet-based drug sales — continues to
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security,
foreign policy, and economy of the United States.  Therefore, I have
determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 14059 with respect to global illicit drug
trafficking.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

    December 11, 2024.
