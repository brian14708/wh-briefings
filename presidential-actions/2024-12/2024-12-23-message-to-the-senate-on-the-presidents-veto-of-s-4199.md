title: "Message to the Senate on the President\u2019s Veto of S.\_4199"
---
 
     I am returning herewith without my approval S. 4199, the “Judicial
Understaffing Delays Getting Emergencies Solved Act of 2024” or the
“JUDGES Act of 2024.”

     S. 4199 seeks to hastily add judgeships with just a few weeks left
in the 118th Congress.  The House of Representative’s hurried action
fails to resolve key questions in the legislation, especially regarding
how the new judgeships are allocated, and neither the House of
Representatives nor the Senate explored fully how the work of senior
status judges and magistrate judges affects the need for new judgeships.
 The efficient and effective administration of justice requires that
these questions about need and allocation be further studied and
answered before we create permanent judgeships for life-tenured judges.

     S. 4199 would create new judgeships in States where Senators have
sought to hold open existing judicial vacancies.  Those efforts to hold
open vacancies suggest that concerns about judicial economy and caseload
are not the true motivating force behind passage of this bill now.  
       
     Therefore, I am vetoing this bill.  
   
   
   
                              JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.  
   
   
   
THE WHITE HOUSE,  
    December 23, 2024.
