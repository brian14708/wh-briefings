By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:

     Section 1.  All executive departments and agencies of the Federal
Government shall be closed and their employees excused from duty on
Tuesday, December 24, 2024, the day before Christmas Day.

     Sec. 2.  The heads of executive departments and agencies may
determine that certain offices and installations of their organizations,
or parts thereof, must remain open and that certain employees must
report for duty on December 24, 2024, for reasons of national security,
defense, or other public need.

     Sec. 3.  December 24, 2024, shall be considered as falling within
the scope of Executive Order 11582 of February 11, 1971, and of 5 U.S.C.
5546 and 6103(b) and other similar statutes insofar as they relate to
the pay and leave of employees of the United States.

     Sec. 4.  The Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall
take such actions as may be necessary to implement this order.

     Sec. 5.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be
construed to impair or otherwise affect:

\(i\)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or
agency, or the head thereof; or

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

     (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
