title: "A Proclamation on International Day of Persons with Disabilities ,\_2024"
---
 
     The over one billion disabled people around the world have made
incredible contributions — propelling us all forward in the pursuit of
progress.  This International Day of Persons with Disabilities, we
recommit to ensuring that people with disabilities are treated with
dignity and respect and have every opportunity to reach their full
potential.  
     I remain proud that one of my earliest acts as a United States
Senator was co-sponsoring the Rehabilitation Act, banning discrimination
on the basis of disability by any entity funded by the Federal
Government.  And later, I co-sponsored the Americans with Disabilities
Act, which banned discrimination against disabled people in workplaces,
schools, public transit, and more — finally making a commitment to build
an America for all Americans.  Together, these laws declared what we
have always known to be true:  that Americans with disabilities deserve
dignity, respect, and an equal chance at the American Dream.   
     Over 180 nations have passed similar laws in the years since,
codifying their commitment to equal justice and opportunities for people
with disabilities.  Still, these laws have not brought an end to the
work we need to do.  Around the world, people with disabilities are
subject to shameful discrimination, harassment, exploitation, abuse, and
violence.  And too often, they struggle to get by — whether it is
finding an accommodating job, enjoying public spaces, receiving quality
education, or getting to and from school or work.  
     That is why my Administration has worked to uplift people with
disabilities in everything we do.  My American Rescue Plan provided $37
billion to strengthen home-based services so that more people with
disabilities have the option to live independently at home.  My
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes historic investments in making
transit, rail, and airports more accessible, so that people with
disabilities can commute and travel with dignity.  The Department of
Justice issued a rule that ensures State and local governments make
their web content and mobile apps more accessible to Americans with
disabilities so they can more easily access local government services,
emergency services, voting information, and publicly funded education. 
And today, the Department of Labor announced a proposed rule that would
gradually phase out certificates that permit employers to pay workers
with disabilities less than the full minimum wage.  
     My Administration has also worked with partners around the world to
secure the rights of people with disabilities.  I released the
first-ever Memorandum on Advancing Worker Empowerment, Rights, and High
Labor Standards Globally, which is working to ensure that people with
disabilities are represented in our work to promote labor rights.  And I
re-established the role of Special Advisor on International Disability
Rights at the Department of State to ensure our foreign policy reflects
our commitment to this community.  In October, my Administration
participated in the first-ever G7 Ministerial on Inclusion and
Disability, joining leaders around the world to advance disability
rights.  Together with leaders from Central Asia, I launched a joint
disability rights initiative to help make education and infrastructure
more accessible. And as a co-chair of the Global Action on Disability
Network, the United States is continuing to advocate for disability
rights on the world stage.  
     Today, I am thinking of a quote from disability rights activist
Judy Heumann, who once wrote:  “Change never happens at the pace we
think it should.  It happens over years of people joining together,
strategizing, sharing, and pulling all the levers they possibly can.” 
On International Day of Persons with Disabilities, we show our gratitude
for all the leaders and activists who have advocated and worked to make
real our Nation’s founding promise — that every American has a right to
be recognized and respected for who they are.  And we recommit to
building a world where we support disability pride and give everyone an
equitable chance at achieving their highest aspirations.  
     NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United
States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the
Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim
December 3, 2024, as International Day of Persons with Disabilities.  I
call on all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies,
activities, and programs.  
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
third day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four,
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred
and forty-ninth.  
   
   
                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
