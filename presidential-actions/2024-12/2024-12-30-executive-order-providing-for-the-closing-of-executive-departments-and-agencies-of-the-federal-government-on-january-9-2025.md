By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:

Section 1.  All executive departments and agencies of the Federal
Government shall be closed on January 9, 2025, as a mark of respect for
James Earl Carter, Jr., the thirty-ninth President of the United
States. 

Sec. 2.  The heads of executive departments and agencies may determine
that certain offices and installations of their organizations, or parts
thereof, must remain open and that certain employees must report for
duty on January 9, 2025, for reasons of national security, defense, or
other public need.

Sec. 3.  January 9, 2025, shall be considered as falling within the
scope of Executive Order 11582 of February 11, 1971, and of 5 U.S.C.
5546 and 6103(b) and other similar statutes insofar as they relate to
the pay and leave of employees of the United States. 

Sec. 4.  The Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall take
such actions as may be necessary to implement this order.

Sec. 5.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be
construed to impair or otherwise affect:

(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

     (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
