title: "A Proclamation on National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day,\_2024"
---
 
     On National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, we honor the 2,403
service members and civilians who were killed on that tragic December
morning 83 years ago.  And we recognize the absolute courage of the
service members who, in the wake of this painful and unprovoked attack,
stood up to defend democracy and stand up to fascism abroad in World War
II.  
     As we reflect on the honors and triumphs of the Greatest
Generation, we must remember that they risked all, dared all, and gave
all not for a person or a place — but for the idea of America.  They
recognized that freedom is never guaranteed:  Every generation has had
to earn and defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy. 
This service and sacrifice helped deliver a world grounded in peace and
security.  And together, these brave women and men proved that no force
— not destruction, death, or the darkness of hate — is a match for the
flame of liberty that ignites the hearts of free people everywhere.   
     Today, we must be keepers of their mission and bearers of the flame
of freedom they kept burning bright.  That begins by honoring our sacred
obligation to care for our service members and veterans and their
families, caregivers, and survivors — especially our World War II
veterans whose actions ensured that democracy endured.  That is why my
Administration began enrolling all World War II veterans, regardless of
length of service or financial status, in Veterans Affairs health care
services.  And we also expanded access to benefits for those who
participated in testing and clean-up activities related to World War II
weapons programs, helping address radiation related illnesses for
veterans and civilians.   
     During National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, may we remember the
brave patriots whose lives were cut short on this day 83 years ago.  May
we honor all the service members who gave their last full measure of
devotion to defend democracy in the years that followed.  And may we all
recommit to fulfilling the future they fought for — one grounded in
freedom, democracy, equality, and opportunity for all.  
     The Congress, by Public Law 103-308, as amended, has designated
December 7 of each year as “National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.” 
Today, let us commemorate the patriots who perished and who were wounded
on December 7, 1941, and continue to fulfill our sacred obligation to
care for our service members; our veterans; and their families,
caregivers, and survivors.  
     NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United
States of America, do hereby proclaim December 7, 2024, as National
Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.  I encourage all Americans to reflect on
the courage shown by our brave service members that day and remember
their sacrifices.  I ask us all to give sincere thanks and appreciation
to the survivors of that unthinkable day.  I urge all Federal agencies,
interested organizations, groups, and individuals to fly the flag of the
United States at half-staff on December 7, 2024, in honor of those
American patriots who died as a result of their service at Pearl
Harbor.  
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-ninth.  
   
   
                              JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
