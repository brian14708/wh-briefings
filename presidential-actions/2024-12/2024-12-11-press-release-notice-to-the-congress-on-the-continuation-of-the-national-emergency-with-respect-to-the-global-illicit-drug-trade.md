title: "Press Release: Notice to the Congress on the Continuation of the National\
  \ Emergency With Respect to the Global Illicit Drug\_Trade"
---
 
On December 15, 2021, by Executive Order 14059, I declared a national
emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act
(50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary
threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the
United States constituted by global illicit drug trafficking.  

The trafficking into the United States of illicit drugs, including
fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, is causing the deaths of tens of
thousands of Americans annually, as well as countless more non-fatal
overdoses with their own tragic human toll.  Drug cartels, transnational
criminal organizations, and their facilitators are the primary sources
of illicit drugs and precursor chemicals that fuel the current opioid
epidemic, as well as drug-related violence that harms our communities.
 International drug trafficking — including the illicit production,
global sale, and widespread distribution of illegal drugs; the rise of
extremely potent drugs such as fentanyl and other synthetic opioids; as
well as the growing role of Internet-based drug sales — continues to
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security,
foreign policy, and economy of the United States.  For this reason, the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 14059 of
December 15, 2021, must continue in effect beyond December 15, 2024.
 Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 14059 with respect to
global illicit drug trafficking.

This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and transmitted
to the Congress.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

    December 11, 2024.
