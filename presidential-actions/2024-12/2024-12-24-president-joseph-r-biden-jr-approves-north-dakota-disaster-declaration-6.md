---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of North Dakota and ordered Federal assistance to
supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas
affected by wildfires and straight-line winds from October 5 to October
6, 2024.

Federal funding is available to state, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the wildfires and straight-line winds in the
counties of McKenzie and Williams.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Mr. Robert Little III of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas. 

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
