By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq*.) (IEEPA), the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq*.) (NEA), section
212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C.
1182(f)), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,  
  
I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America,
hereby expand the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive
Order 13660 of March 6, 2014, and expanded by Executive Order 13661 of
March 16, 2014, and Executive Order 13662 of March 20, 2014, and relied
on for additional steps taken in Executive Order 13685 of December 19,
2014, and Executive Order 13849 of September 20, 2018, finding that the
Russian Federation’s purported recognition of the so-called Donetsk
People’s Republic (DNR) or Luhansk People’s Republic (LNR) regions of
Ukraine contradicts Russia’s commitments under the Minsk agreements and
further threatens the peace, stability, sovereignty, and territorial
integrity of Ukraine, and thereby constitutes an unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the
United States.  Accordingly, I hereby order:  
  
Section 1.  (a)  The following are prohibited:  
          (i)    new investment in the so-called DNR or LNR regions of
Ukraine or such other regions of Ukraine as may be determined by the
Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State
(collectively, the “Covered Regions”), by a United States person,
wherever located;  
          (ii)   the importation into the United States, directly or
indirectly, of any goods, services, or technology from the Covered
Regions;  
          (iii)  the exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply,
directly or indirectly, from the United States, or by a United States
person, wherever located, of any goods, services, or technology
to the Covered Regions; and  
          (iv)   any approval, financing, facilitation, or guarantee by
a United States person, wherever located, of a transaction by a foreign
person where the transaction by that foreign person would be prohibited
by this section if performed by a United States person or within the
United States.  
     (b)  The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply
except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders,
directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and
notwithstanding any contract entered into or license or permit granted
prior to the date of this order.  
      
Sec. 2.  (a)  All property and interests in property that are in the
United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are
or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States
person (including any foreign branch) of the following persons are
blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or
otherwise dealt in: any person determined by the Secretary of the
Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State:  
          (i)    to operate or have operated since the date of this
order in the Covered Regions;  
          (ii)   to be or have been since the date of this order a
leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of
directors of an entity operating in the Covered Regions;  
          (iii)  to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or
purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person
whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this
order; or  
          (iv)   to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided
financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services
to or in support of, any person whose property and interests in property
are blocked pursuant to this order.  
     (b)  The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply
except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders,
directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and
notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit
granted prior to the date of this order.  
  
Sec. 3.  The prohibitions in section 2 of this order include but are not
limited to:  
     (a)  the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods,
or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and
interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and  
     (b)  the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods,
or services from any such person.  
  
Sec. 4.  (a)  Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of
evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any
of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.  
     (b)  Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set
forth in this order is prohibited.  
  
Sec. 5.  Nothing in this order shall prohibit transactions for the
conduct of the official business of the Federal Government by employees,
grantees, or contractors thereof.  
  
Sec. 6.  (a)  The unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the
United States of noncitizens determined to meet one or more of the
criteria in section 2 of this order would be detrimental to the
interests of the United States, and the entry of such persons into the
United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, is hereby suspended,
except where the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland
Security, as appropriate, determines that the person’s entry would not
be contrary to the interests of the United States, including when the
Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security, as
appropriate, so determines, based on a recommendation of the Attorney
General, that the person’s entry would further important United States
law enforcement objectives.  
     (b)  The Secretary of State shall implement this authority as it
applies to visas pursuant to such procedures as the Secretary of State,
in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, may
establish.  
     (c)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall implement this order
as it applies to the entry of noncitizens pursuant to such procedures as
the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary
of State, may establish.  
     (d)  Such persons shall be treated by this section in the same
manner as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24,
2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security
Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act
Sanctions).  
  
Sec. 7.  I hereby determine that the making of donations of the types of
articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2))
by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in
property are blocked pursuant to this order would seriously impair my
ability to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order
13660, expanded in Executive Orders 13661 and 13662, and further
expanded by this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided
by section 2 of this order.  
  
Sec. 8.  For the purposes of this order:  
     (a)  the term “entity” means a partnership, association, trust,
joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;  
    (b)  the term “person” means an individual or entity;  
    (c)  the term “United States person” means any United States
citizen, lawful permanent resident, entity organized under the laws of
the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States
(including foreign branches), or any person in the United States;   
    (d)  the term “noncitizen” means any person who is not a citizen or
noncitizen national of the United States; and  
    (e)  the term “region of Ukraine” includes the land territory in
that region as well as any maritime area over which sovereignty,
sovereign rights, or jurisdiction is claimed based on purported
sovereignty over that land territory or area.  
  
Sec. 9**.**  For those persons whose property and interests in property
are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional
presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to
transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such
persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render
those measures ineffectual.  I therefore determine that for these
measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared
in Executive Order 13660, expanded in Executive Orders 13661 and 13662,
and further expanded by this order, there need be no prior notice of a
listing or determination made pursuant to section 2 of this order.  
  
Sec. 10**.**  The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including
the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers
granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to carry out the
purposes of this order.  The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent
with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the
Department of the Treasury.  All executive departments and agencies of
the United States shall take all appropriate measures within their
authority to implement this order.  
  
Sec. 11.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or
otherwise affect:  
          (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department
or agency, or the head thereof; or  
          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office
of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.  
     (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
