title: "Executive Order on Use of Project Labor Agreements For Federal Construction\_\
  Projects"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and
Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 101 *et seq.*, and in order to
promote economy and efficiency in the administration and completion of
Federal construction projects, it is hereby ordered that:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 1.  Policy.</span>  (a)
 Large-scale construction projects pose special challenges to efficient
and timely procurement by the Federal Government.  Construction
employers typically do not have a permanent workforce, which makes it
difficult to predict labor costs when bidding on contracts and to ensure
a steady supply of labor on contracts being performed.  Challenges also
arise because construction projects typically involve multiple employers
at a single location, and a labor dispute involving one employer can
delay the entire project.  A lack of coordination among various
employers, or uncertainty about the terms and conditions of employment
of various groups of workers, can create friction and disputes in the
absence of an agreed-upon resolution mechanism.  These problems threaten
the efficient and timely completion of construction projects undertaken
by Federal contractors.  On large-scale projects, which are generally
more complex and of longer duration, these problems tend to be more
pronounced.  
     (b)  Project labor agreements are often effective in preventing
these problems from developing because they provide structure and
stability to large-scale construction projects.  Such agreements avoid
labor-related disruptions on projects by using dispute-resolution
processes to resolve worksite disputes and by prohibiting work
stoppages, including strikes and lockouts.  They secure the commitment
of all stakeholders on a construction site that the project will proceed
efficiently without unnecessary interruptions.  They also advance the
interests of project owners, contractors, and subcontractors, including
small businesses.  For these reasons, owners and contractors in both the
public and private sector routinely use project labor agreements,
thereby reducing uncertainties in large-scale construction projects. 
The use of project labor agreements is fully consistent with the
promotion of small business interests.  
     (c)  Accordingly, it is the policy of the Federal Government for
agencies to use project labor agreements in connection with large-scale
construction projects to promote economy and efficiency in Federal
procurement. 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 2.  Definitions.</span>
 For purposes of this order:  
     (a)  “Labor organization” means a labor organization as defined in
29 U.S.C. 152(5) of which building and construction employees are
members, as described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).  
     (b)  “Construction” means construction, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, modernization, alteration, conversion, extension,
repair, or improvement of buildings, structures, highways, or other real
property.  
     (c)  “Large-scale construction project” means a Federal
construction project within the United States for which the total
estimated cost of the construction contract to the Federal Government is
$35 million or more.  The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR
Council), in consultation with the Council of Economic Advisers, may
adjust this threshold based on inflation using the process at 41 U.S.C.
1908.  
     (d)  “Agency” means an executive department or agency, including an
independent establishment subject to the Federal Property and
Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 102(4)(A).   
     (e)  “Project labor agreement” means a pre-hire collective
bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that
establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific
construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 3.  Project Labor
Agreement Presumption.</span> Subject to sections 5 and 6 of this
order, in awarding any contract in connection with a large-scale
construction project, or obligating funds pursuant to such a contract,
agencies shall require every contractor or subcontractor engaged in
construction on the project to agree, for that project, to negotiate or
become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more appropriate
labor organizations.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 4.  Requirements of
Project Labor Agreements.</span> Any project labor agreement reached
pursuant to this order shall:  
     (a)  bind all contractors and subcontractors on the construction
project through the inclusion of appropriate specifications in all
relevant solicitation provisions and contract documents;  
     (b)  allow all contractors and subcontractors on the construction
project to compete for contracts and subcontracts without regard to
whether they are otherwise parties to collective bargaining
agreements;  
     (c)  contain guarantees against strikes, lockouts, and similar job
disruptions;  
     (d)  set forth effective, prompt, and mutually binding procedures
for resolving labor disputes arising during the term of the project
labor agreement;  
     (e)  provide other mechanisms for labor-management cooperation on
matters of mutual interest and concern, including productivity, quality
of work, safety, and health; and  
     (f)  fully conform to all statutes, regulations, Executive Orders,
and Presidential Memoranda.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 5.  Exceptions Authorized
by Agencies.</span> A senior official within an agency may grant an
exception from the requirements of section 3 of this order for a
particular contract by, no later than the solicitation date, providing a
specific written explanation of why at least one of the following
circumstances exists with respect to that contract:  
     (a)  Requiring a project labor agreement on the project would not
advance the Federal Government’s interests in achieving economy and
efficiency in Federal procurement. Such a finding shall be based on the
following factors:  
          (i)    The project is of short duration and lacks operational
complexity;  
          (ii)   The project will involve only one craft or trade;  
          (iii) The project will involve specialized construction work
that is available from only a limited number of contractors or
subcontractors;  
          (iv)   The agency’s need for the project is of such an unusual
and compelling urgency that a project labor agreement would be
impracticable; or  
          (v)    The project implicates other similar factors deemed
appropriate in regulations or guidance issued pursuant to section 8 of
this order.  
     (b)  Based on an inclusive market analysis, requiring a project
labor agreement on the project would substantially reduce the number of
potential bidders so as to frustrate full and open competition.  
     (c)  Requiring a project labor agreement on the project would
otherwise be inconsistent with statutes, regulations, Executive Orders,
or Presidential Memoranda.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 6.  Reporting.</span> (a)
 To the extent permitted by law and consistent with national security
and executive branch confidentiality interests, agencies shall publish,
on a centralized public website, data showing the use of project labor
agreements on large-scale construction projects, as well as descriptions
of the exceptions granted under section 5 of this order.  
     (b)  On a quarterly basis, agencies shall report to the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) on their use of project labor agreements on
large-scale construction projects and on the exceptions granted under
section 5 of this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 7.</span> Nothing in this
order precludes an agency from requiring the use of a project labor
agreement in circumstances not covered by this order, including projects
where the total cost to the Federal Government is less than that for a
large-scale construction project, or projects receiving any form of
Federal financial assistance (including loans, loan guarantees,
revolving funds, tax credits, tax credit bonds, and cooperative
agreements).  This order also does not require contractors or
subcontractors to enter into a project labor agreement with any
particular labor organization.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 8.  Regulations and
Implementation.</span> (a)  Within 120 days of the date of this order,
the FAR Council, to the extent permitted by law, shall propose
regulations implementing the provisions of this order.  The FAR Council
shall consider and evaluate public comments on the proposed regulations
and shall promptly issue a final rule, to the extent permitted by law.  
     (b)  The Director of OMB shall, to the extent permitted by law,
issue guidance to implement the requirements of sections 5 and 6 of this
order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 9.  Contracting Officer
Training.</span> Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary
of Defense, the Secretary of Labor, and the Director of OMB shall
coordinate in designing a training strategy for agency contracting
officers to enable those officers to effectively implement this order.
Within 180 days of the date of the publication of proposed regulations,
the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Labor, and the Director of
OMB shall provide a report to the Assistant to the President for
Economic Policy and Director of the National Economic Council on the
contents of the training strategy.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 10. Revocation of Prior
Orders, Rules, and Regulations*.*</span>  Executive Order 13502 of
February 6, 2009 (Use of Project Labor Agreements for Federal
Construction Projects), is revoked as of the effective date of the final
regulations issued by the FAR Council under section 8(a) of this order.
Upon Executive Order 13502’s revocation, the heads of agencies shall
consider, to the extent permitted by law, revoking any orders, rules, or
regulations implementing Executive Order 13502.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 11.  Severability.</span>
 If any provision of this order, or the application of such provision to
any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this
order and its application to any other person or circumstance shall not
be affected thereby.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 12. Effective
Date*.*</span>  This order shall be effective immediately and shall
apply to all solicitations for contracts issued on or after the
effective date of the final regulations issued by the FAR Council under
section 8(a) of this order.  For solicitations issued between the date
of this order and the effective date of the final regulations issued by
the FAR Council under section 8(a) of this order, or solicitations that
have already been issued and are outstanding as of the date of this
order, agencies are strongly encouraged, to the extent permitted by law,
to comply with this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 13. General
Provisions*.*</span>  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to
impair or otherwise affect:  
          (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department
or agency, or the head thereof; or  
          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.  
     (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
