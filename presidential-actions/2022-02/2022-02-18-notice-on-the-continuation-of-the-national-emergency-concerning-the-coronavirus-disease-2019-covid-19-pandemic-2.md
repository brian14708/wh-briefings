On March 13, 2020, by Proclamation 9994, the President declared a
national emergency concerning the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic.  The COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause significant risk to
the public health and safety of the Nation.  For this reason, the
national emergency declared on March 13, 2020, and beginning March 1,
2020, must continue in effect beyond March 1, 2022.  Therefore, in
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency declared in
Proclamation 9994 concerning the COVID-19 pandemic.

This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and transmitted
to the Congress.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
