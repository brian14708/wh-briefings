title: "A Proclamation to Continue Facilitating Positive Adjustment to Competition\
  \ From Imports of Certain Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells (Whether or Not\
  \ Partially or Fully Assembled Into Other\_Products)"
---
 
     1.  On January 23, 2018, pursuant to section 203 of the Trade Act
of 1974, as amended (the “Trade Act”) (19 U.S.C. 2253), the President
issued Proclamation 9693, imposing a safeguard measure for a period of 4
years that included both a tariff-rate quota (TRQ) on imports of certain
crystalline silicon photovoltaic (CSPV) cells, not partially or fully
assembled into other products, provided for in subheading 8541.40.6025
of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), and an
increase in duties (safeguard tariff) on imports of CSPV cells exceeding
the TRQ and all imports of other CSPV products, including modules
provided for in subheading 8541.40.6015 of the HTS.  Proclamation 9693
exempted imports from certain designated beneficiary countries under the
Generalized System of Preferences from the application of the safeguard
measure.  
  
     2.  Clause (4) and Annex I of Proclamation 9693 directed the United
States Trade Representative (USTR) to establish procedures for
interested persons to request the exclusion of particular products from
the safeguard measure.  These provisions also authorized the USTR, in
consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Energy,
to determine whether a particular product should be excluded, and, upon
publication of a determination in the *Federal Register*, to modify the
HTS to implement such determination.  Furthermore, they authorized the
USTR to modify or to terminate such determinations.  Effective June 13,
2019, the USTR excluded bifacial solar panels that absorb light and
generate electricity on each side of the panel and that consist of only
bifacial solar cells that absorb light and generate electricity on both
sides of the cells (bifacial modules).  Exclusion of Particular Products
From the Solar Products Safeguard Measure, 84 FR 27684 (June 13,
2019).  
  
     3.  On February 7, 2020, the United States International Trade
Commission (USITC) issued its report, pursuant to section 204(a)(2) of
the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(a)(2)), on the results of its monitoring
of developments with respect to the domestic solar industry (USITC,
Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells, Whether or Not Partially or
Fully Assembled Into Other Products:  Monitoring Developments in the
Domestic Industry, No. TA-201-075 (Monitoring)).  In its report, the
USITC found that, following imposition of the safeguard measure, prices
for CSPV cells and modules declined in a manner consistent with
historical trends, but that prices were higher than they would have been
without the safeguard measure.  
  
     4.  On March 6, 2020, the USITC issued an additional
report pursuant to a request from the USTR under section 204(a)(4) of
the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(a)(4)), regarding the probable economic
effect on the domestic CSPV cell and module manufacturing industry of
modifying the safeguard measure to increase the level of the TRQ on CSPV
cells from the current 2.5 gigawatts (GW) to 4.0, 5.0, or 6.0 GW (USITC,
Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells, Whether or Not Partially or
Fully Assembled Into Other Products:  Advice on the Probable Economic
Effect of Certain Modifications to the Safeguard Measure, No. TA-201-075
(Modification)).  In its report, the USITC advised that increasing the
TRQ would help to continue growth in solar module production, but that
expanded access to imported cells not subject to safeguard duties would
put downward pressure on prices for cells made in the United States.  
  
     5.  After taking into account the information provided in the
USITC’s reports, and after receiving a petition from a majority of the
representatives of the domestic industry with respect to each of the
following modifications, and under section 204(b)(1)(B) of the Trade Act
(19 U.S.C. 2254(b)(1)(B)), the President issued Proclamation 10101 on
October 10, 2020, in which he determined that the domestic industry has
begun to make a positive adjustment to import competition, as shown by
the increases in domestic module production capacity, production, and
market share.  Proclamation 10101 also:  
     (a)  revoked the exclusion of bifacial modules from application of
the safeguard measure on the basis that it had impaired and was
likely to continue to impair the effectiveness of the safeguard action;
and  
     (b)  adjusted the safeguard tariff for the fourth year of the
safeguard measure from 15 percent to 18 percent on the basis that the
exclusion of bifacial modules from application of the safeguard tariffs
had impaired the remedial effectiveness of the 4-year action proclaimed
in Proclamation 9693, and to achieve the full remedial effect envisaged
in that action.  
  
     6.  On November 16, 2021, the United States Court of International
Trade held in Solar Energy Industries Association et al. v. United
States (SEIA) that the President acted outside of his statutory
authority in issuing Proclamation 10101, and enjoined the Government
from enforcing that proclamation.  This injunction had the effect of
reinstating the exclusion of bifacial modules from the safeguard tariffs
and lowering the fourth year safeguard tariff to 15 percent.  On January
14, 2022, the Government filed a notice of appeal of SEIA to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  
  
     7.  On December 8, 2021, in response to petitions by
representatives of the domestic industry, the USITC issued its
determination and report pursuant to section 204(c) of the Trade Act (19
U.S.C. 2254(c)), finding that safeguard action continues to be necessary
to prevent or remedy the serious injury to the domestic industry, and
that there is evidence that the domestic industry is making a positive
adjustment to import competition (USITC, Crystalline Silicon
Photovoltaic Cells, Whether or Not Partially or Fully Assembled Into
Other Products, Investigation No. TA-201-75 (Extension)).  
  
     8.  Section 203(e)(1)(B) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(e)(1)(B))
authorizes the President, after receiving an affirmative determination
from the USITC pursuant to section 204(c) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C.
2254(c)), to extend the effective period of any action taken under
section 203 of the Trade Act if the President determines that the action
continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury, and
there is evidence that the domestic industry is making a positive
adjustment to import competition.  
  
     9.  After taking into account the information provided in the
USITC’s report and the information received from the public through the
process published in the *Federal Register *on September 30, 2021 (86 FR
54279), pursuant to section 203(e)(1)(B) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C.
2253(e)(1)(B)), I have determined that the safeguard action on imports
of CSPV cells, whether or not partially or fully assembled into other
products, continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious
injury to the domestic industry, and that there is evidence that the
domestic industry is making a positive adjustment to import
competition.  I have further determined to extend the safeguard measure
proclaimed in Proclamation 9693, as modified by Proclamation 10101 (to
the extent permitted by law), as follows:  
(a)  continuation of the TRQ on imports of solar cells not partially or
fully assembled into other products described in paragraph 1 of this
proclamation for an additional period of 4 years, with unchanging
within-quota quantities of 5.0 GW for each year and annual reductions in
the rates of duty applicable to goods entered in excess of those
quantities of cells in the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth years, as
described in Annex I to this proclamation;  
(b)  continuation of the increase in duties on imports of modules
described in paragraph 1 of this proclamation for an additional period
of 4 years, with annual reductions in the fifth, sixth, seventh, and
eighth years, as described in Annex I to this proclamation; and  
(c)  exclusion of bifacial panels from the extension of duties
proclaimed in this paragraph.  
  
     10.  I have determined that an extension of this safeguard measure
will provide greater economic and social benefits than costs.  
  
     11.  As provided in Proclamation 9693, this safeguard measure shall
continue to apply to imports from all countries, except as provided in
clause (4) of this proclamation and paragraph 10 of Proclamation 9693.  
  
     12.  Section 204(a)(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(a)(2))
requires the USITC to issue a report on its monitoring of developments
with respect to the domestic industry, including the progress and
specific efforts made by workers and firms in the domestic industry to
make a positive adjustment to import competition, no later than the
midpoint of the period of the extension.  After I receive that report, I
will evaluate whether to reduce, modify, or terminate the safeguard
measure pursuant to section 204(b)(1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C.
2254(b)(1)).  
  
     13.  As proclaimed in Proclamation 9693, the in-quota quantity in
each year of the TRQ described in paragraph 9 of this proclamation shall
be allocated among all countries except those countries the products of
which are excluded from such TRQ pursuant to clause (4) of this
proclamation or paragraph 10 of Proclamation 9693.  
  
     14.  In order to address certain technical errors in the HTS, the
HTS is modified as set forth in Annex II to this proclamation.  
     15.  Section 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the
President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions
of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions
thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or
imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.  
  
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States
of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States, including sections 203, 204, and 604 of
the Trade Act, do proclaim that:  
     (1)  In order to extend the measure applicable to imports of CSPV
cells, not partially or fully assembled into other products, described
in paragraph 1 of this proclamation, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the
HTS is modified as set forth in Annex I to this proclamation, subject to
clauses (3) and (4) below.  Any merchandise subject to the safeguard
measure that is admitted into United States foreign trade zones on or
after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on February 7, 2022, must be
admitted as “privileged foreign status” as defined in 19 CFR 146.41, and
will be subject upon entry for consumption to any tariffs or
quantitative restrictions related to the classification under the
applicable HTS subheading.  
     (2)  Except as provided in clause (3) below, imports of CSPV
products of World Trade Organization Member countries, as listed in
subdivision (b) of Note 18 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTS
(Note 18), shall continue to be excluded from the safeguard measure
extended by this proclamation, and such imports shall not be counted
toward the TRQ limits that trigger the over-quota rates of duties.  
     (3)  If, after the extension proclaimed herein is in effect, the
USTR determines that:  
     (a)  the share of total imports of a country listed in subdivision
(b) of Note 18 exceeds 3 percent;  
     (b)  imports of the product from all listed countries with less
than 3 percent import share collectively account for more than 9 percent
of total imports of the product; or  
     (c)  a country listed in subdivision (b) of Note 18 is no longer a
developing country for purposes of this proclamation;  
the USTR is authorized, upon publication of a notice in the *Federal
Register*, to revise subdivision (b) of Note 18 to remove the relevant
country from the list or suspend operation of that subdivision, as
appropriate.  
     (4)  I instruct the USTR to enter into negotiations pursuant to
section 203(f) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(f)) with Canada and
Mexico.  In the event that the USTR concludes an agreement that the
USTR, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary
of Energy, determines will ensure that imports of Canada or Mexico do
not undermine the effectiveness of the action extended through clause
(1) of this proclamation, the USTR is authorized, upon publication of a
notice in the *Federal Register*, to revise Note 18 to suspend
application of that subdivision, in whole or in part, as appropriate,
with respect to imports of Canada or Mexico.  If the USTR subsequently
determines, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the
Secretary of Energy, that such an agreement is not effective, the USTR
is authorized, pursuant to section 203(f) of the Trade Act, by
publication of a notice in the *Federal Register*, to revise Note 18 to
terminate any previous suspension of the action with respect to imports
of Canada or Mexico.  
     (5)  One year after the termination of the safeguard measure
established in this proclamation, the U.S. note and tariff provisions
established in Annex I to this proclamation shall be deleted from the
HTS.  
     (6)  Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders
that is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.  
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
fourth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two,
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred
and forty-sixth.  
 

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
