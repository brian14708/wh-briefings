title: "Statement from President\_Biden on House Passage of the America COMPETES\_\
  Act"
---
 
The House took a critical vote today for stronger supply chains and
lower prices, for more manufacturing – and good manufacturing jobs –
right here in America, and for outcompeting China and the rest of the
world in the 21st century. I applaud Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader
Hoyer, Whip Clyburn, and Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson for their
leadership in getting this done.

Business and labor alike have praised this legislation as vital for
continuing the economic momentum we’ve seen over the last year, and
national security leaders from both parties have said that the
investments in this bill are needed if we want to maintain our
competitive edge globally. This bill was built on numerous bipartisan
elements and on shared bipartisan agreement on the need to act. If House
Republicans are serious about lowering prices, making our economy
stronger, and competing with China from a position of strength, then
they should come to the table and support this legislation, which does
just that. 

I look forward to the House and Senate quickly coming together to find a
path forward and putting a bill on my desk as soon as possible for my
signature. America can’t afford to wait.
