title: "Executive Order on Protecting Certain Property of Da Afghanistan Bank for\
  \ the Benefit of the People of\_Afghanistan"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq*.) (IEEPA), the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq*.) (NEA), and section
301 of title 3, United States Code,

I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, find
that the widespread humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan — including the
urgent needs of the people of Afghanistan for food security, livelihoods
support, water, sanitation, health, hygiene, shelter and settlement
assistance, and COVID-19-related assistance, among other basic human
needs — and the potential for a deepening economic collapse in
Afghanistan constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the
national security and foreign policy of the United States.  I hereby
declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.  In addition, I
find that the preservation of certain property of Da Afghanistan Bank
(DAB) held in the United States by United States financial institutions
is of the utmost importance to addressing this national emergency and
the welfare of the people of Afghanistan.  I also understand that
various parties, including representatives of victims of terrorism, have
asserted legal claims against certain property of DAB or indicated in
public court filings an intent to make such claims.  This property is
blocked under this order.

Accordingly, I hereby order:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 1.</span>  (a)  All
property and interests in property of DAB that are held, as of the date
of this order, in the United States by any United States financial
institution, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, are blocked
and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise
dealt in, except as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this
section.  
     (b)  United States financial institutions shall promptly transfer
the blocked property described in subsection (a) of this section into a
consolidated account held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  
     (c)  The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply
except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders,
directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and
notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit
granted before the date of this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 2.</span>  This order and
actions taken pursuant to this order shall apply notwithstanding any
previously issued Executive Order to the extent such order blocks,
regulates, or otherwise affects the property and interests in property
identified in section 1(a) of this order.  This order and actions taken
pursuant to this order shall supersede any previously issued Executive
Order to the extent such order blocks, regulates, or otherwise affects
the property and interests in property identified in section 1(a) of
this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 3.</span>  (a)  Any
transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or
avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the
prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.  
     (b)  Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set
forth in this order is prohibited.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 4.</span>  For the
purposes of this order:  
     (a)  the term “Da Afghanistan Bank” or “DAB” means the Central Bank
of Afghanistan;  
     (b)  the term “entity” means a partnership, association, trust,
joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;
and  
     (c)  the term “person” means an individual or entity.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 5.</span> For those
persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to
this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United
States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds and other
assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to
be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures
ineffectual.  I therefore determine that for these measures to be
effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order,
there need be no prior notice of the blocking of property and interests
in property set forth in section 1(a) of this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 6.</span>  The Secretary
of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the
Attorney General, is authorized to take such actions, including the
promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted
to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes
of this order.  The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with
applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department
of the Treasury.  All executive departments and agencies of the
United States shall take all appropriate measures within their authority
to implement this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 7.</span>  Nothing in this
order shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official
business of the Federal Government by employees, grantees, and
contractors thereof.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 8.</span>  The Secretary
of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is
authorized to submit recurring and final reports to the Congress on the
national emergency declared in this order, consistent with section
401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA
(50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 9.</span>  (a)  Nothing in
this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:  
          (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department
or agency, or the head thereof; or  
          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.  
     (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
