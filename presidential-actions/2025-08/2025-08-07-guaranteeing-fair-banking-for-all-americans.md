title: Guaranteeing Fair Banking For All Americans
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
** **<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  Financial
institutions have engaged in unacceptable practices to restrict
law-abiding individuals’ and businesses’ access to financial services on
the basis of political or religious beliefs or lawful business
activities.  Some financial institutions participated in
Government-directed surveillance programs targeting persons
participating in activities and causes commonly associated with
conservatism and the political right following the events that occurred
at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021.  The Federal
Government suggested that such institutions flag individuals who made
transactions related to companies like “Cabela’s” and “Bass Pro Shop” or
who made peer-to-peer payments that involved terms like “Trump” or
“MAGA,” even though there was no specific evidence tying those
individuals to criminal conduct.

Bank regulators have used supervisory scrutiny and other influence over
regulated banks to direct or otherwise encourage politicized or unlawful
debanking activities.  “Operation Chokepoint,” for example, was a
well-documented and systemic means by which Federal regulators pushed
banks to minimize their involvement with individuals and companies
engaged in lawful activities and industries disfavored by regulators
based on factors other than individualized, objective, risk-based
standards.

As a result, individuals, their businesses, and their families have been
subjected to debanking on the basis of their political affiliations,
religious beliefs or lawful business activities, and have suffered
frozen payrolls, debt and crushing interest, and other significant harms
to their livelihoods, reputations, and financial well-being.  Such
practices are incompatible with a free society and the principle that
the provision of banking services should be based on material,
measurable, and justifiable risks.  Such practices, when wielded to
discriminate against customers and businesses in credit transactions due
to their religion, are also unlawful under the Equal Credit Opportunity
Act (15 U.S.C. 1691 *et seq*.).  They further undermine public trust in
banking institutions and their regulators, discriminate against
political beliefs and free expression of those beliefs, and weaponize a
politicized regulatory state. 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of the United States that no American should be denied access to
financial services because of their constitutionally or statutorily
protected beliefs, affiliations, or political views, and to ensure that
politicized or unlawful debanking is not used as a tool to inhibit such
beliefs, affiliations, or political views.  Banking decisions must
instead be made on the basis of individualized, objective, and
risk-based analyses.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Definitions</span>.  (a)  The
term “politicized or unlawful debanking” refers to an act by a bank,
savings association, credit union, or other financial services provider
to directly or indirectly adversely restrict access to, or adversely
modify the conditions of, accounts, loans, or other banking products or
financial services of any customer or potential customer on the basis of
the customer’s or potential customer’s political or religious beliefs,
or on the basis of the customer’s or potential customer’s lawful
business activities that the financial service provider disagrees with
or disfavors for political reasons.

\(b\)  The term “Federal banking regulators” refers to the Small
Business Administration (SBA) and the Federal member agencies of the
Financial Stability Oversight Council with supervisory and regulatory
authority over banks, savings associations, or credit unions.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Removing Reputation Risk and
Politicized or Unlawful Debanking</span>.  (a)  Within 180 days of the
date of this order, each appropriate Federal banking regulator shall, to
the greatest extent permitted by law, remove the use of reputation risk
or equivalent concepts that could result in politicized or unlawful
debanking, as well as any other considerations that could be used to
engage in such debanking, from their guidance documents, manuals, and
other materials (other than existing regulations or other materials
requiring notice-and-comment rulemaking) used to regulate or examine
financial institutions over which they have jurisdiction.  The removal
of such concepts shall be made clear by each appropriate Federal banking
regulator through formal guidance to their examiners.  The Federal
banking regulators shall also consider rescinding or amending existing
regulations, consistent with applicable law, to eliminate or amend any
regulations that could result in politicized or unlawful debanking and
to ensure that any regulated firm’s or individual’s reputation is
considered for regulatory, supervisory, banking, or enforcement purposes
solely to the extent necessary to reach a reasonable and apolitical
risk-based assessment.

\(b\)  The SBA shall, within 60 days of the date of this order, give
notice to all financial institutions with which it guarantees loans
under its lending programs, requiring that each financial institution
that is subject to the SBA’s jurisdiction and supervision:

\(i\)    within 120 days of the date of this order, makes reasonable
efforts to identify and reinstate any previous clients of the
institution or any subsidiaries denied service through a politicized or
unlawful debanking action in violation of a statutory or regulatory
requirement under section 7(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636)
or any requirement in a Standard Operating Procedures Manual or Policy
Notice related to a program or function of the Office of Capital Access,
with notice of the reinstatement sent to the victim;

\(ii\)   within 120 days of the date of this order, identifies all
potential clients denied access to financial services provided by the
financial institution or any subsidiaries through a politicized or
unlawful debanking action in violation of a statutory or regulatory
requirement under section 7(a) of the Small Business Act or any
requirement in a Standard Operating Procedures Manual or Policy Notice
related to a program or function of the Office of Capital Access, and
provides notice to each victim advising of the denied access and the
renewed option to engage in such services previously denied; and

\(iii\)  within 120 days of the date of this order, identifies all
potential clients denied access to payment processing services provided
by the financial institution or any subsidiaries through a politicized
or unlawful debanking action in violation of a statutory or regulatory
requirement under section 7(a) of the Small Business Act or any
requirement in a Standard Operating Procedures Manual or Policy Notice
related to a program or function of the Office of Capital Access, and
provides notice to each victim advising of the denied access and the
renewed option to engage in such services previously denied.

 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Scrutinizing Politicized or
Unlawful Debanking</span>.  (a)  Within 180 days of the date of this
order, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Assistant
to the President for Economic Policy, shall develop a comprehensive
strategy for further measures to combat politicized or unlawful
debanking activities of financial regulators and financial institutions
across the Federal Government, including consideration of legislative or
regulatory options to eliminate such debanking.

\(b\)  Within 120 days of the date of this order, each Federal banking
regulator shall conduct a review to identify financial institutions
subject to its jurisdiction that have had any past or current, formal or
informal, policies or practices that require, encourage, or otherwise
influence such financial institution to engage in politicized or
unlawful debanking and to take appropriate remedial action, to the
extent authorized and consistent with applicable law, including levying
fines, issuing consent decrees, or imposing other disciplinary measures
against any financial institution subject to the jurisdiction of such
Federal banking regulator that such Federal banking regulator finds has
engaged in politicized or unlawful debanking that violates applicable
law (including section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C.
45), section 1031 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act (12 U.S.C.
5531), and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act).

\(c\)  Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Federal banking
regulators shall review their current supervisory and complaint data to
identify any financial institution that has engaged in unlawful
debanking on the basis of religion and, if such financial institution is
unable to obtain compliance within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. 1691 and
1691e(g), refer such matters to the Attorney General for an appropriate
civil action, as appropriate.
