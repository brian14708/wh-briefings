title: Ensuring American Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Resilience by Filling the Strategic
  Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Reserve
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  During my
first term, my Administration acted to protect the health and security
of the American people by restoring capacity for domestic production of
essential pharmaceutical products.  Executive Order 13944 of August 6,
2020 (Combatting Public Health Emergencies and Strengthening National
Security by Ensuring Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and
Critical Inputs Are Made in the United States), directed certain
executive departments and agencies (agencies) to consider a variety of
actions to increase their domestic procurement of Essential Medicines,
Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs, as defined in section 7 of
that order, and to identify supply chain vulnerabilities.  The Food and
Drug Administration published a list of Essential Medicines, Medical
Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs in October 2020.  The Office of the
Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) within the
Department of Health and Human Services later reduced the list to 86
essential medicines.

Nearly two in five prescription finished drug products are made in the
United States, including many of the essential medicines.  However, when
it comes to Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), the biologically
active components of finished drug products, only about 10 percent of
the APIs by volume for the finished drug products used in the United
States are made here.

During my first term, my first Administration created a Strategic Active
Pharmaceutical Ingredients Reserve (SAPIR) to stockpile APIs.
 Stockpiling APIs is advantageous as APIs are generally lower-cost and
have longer shelf lives than the finished drug products they make.
 Filling the SAPIR will also insulate the United States from the
concentration of foreign, sometimes adversary, nations in the world-wide
supply of the Key Starting Materials used to make APIs.  Moreover,
Government purchases of APIs to fill the SAPIR can encourage more
domestic production of APIs.

Unfortunately, the Biden Administration failed to advance the goal of
ensuring domestic sources for essential medicines and their precursors
despite spending billions of dollars on efforts to secure supply chains.
 Domestic production and procurement did not increase and the SAPIR is
nearly empty.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Filling the SAPIR with APIs for
the Most Critical Medicines</span>.  (a)  Within 30 days of the date of
this order, the ASPR shall develop a list, in consultation with agencies
with scientific expertise, the Assistant to the President for Economic
Policy (APEP), and the Assistant to the President and Homeland Security
Advisor (APHSA), of approximately 26 drugs that are especially critical
to the health and security interests of the Nation (the critical drugs)
and an accounting of existing, available funds that can be utilized,
consistent with statutory authorities, to finance the preparation and
opening of the SAPIR repository and to obtain and maintain the 6-month
supply of APIs for the critical drugs referenced in subsection (c) of
this section shall be provided to the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB).  The OMB shall provide assistance to the
Secretary of Health and Human Services to facilitate the repurposing of
available funds, consistent with law.

\(b\)  Within 120 days of the date of this order and subject to the
availability of funds identified pursuant to subsection (a) of this
section, the ASPR shall, in coordination with such other agencies as are
necessary, take all measures to ready the existing SAPIR repository so
that it can begin receiving and maintaining APIs.

\(c\)  Subject to the availability of funds identified pursuant to
subsection (a) of this section, the ASPR shall obtain a 6-month supply
of the APIs needed to make the critical drugs to fill the SAPIR, with a
preference for obtaining domestically manufactured APIs if possible. 
The ASPR shall place such APIs within the SAPIR repository no later than
30 days after the repository is certified by the ASPR as ready to
receive and maintain APIs.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Ensuring SAPIR
Resilience</span>.  (a)  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the
ASPR shall provide the APHSA, the APEP, and the OMB with an update to
the ASPR’s 2022 list of 86 essential medicines and medical
countermeasures, along with a plan to:

(i)    obtain from domestic manufacturers, where possible;

(ii)   store; and

(iii)  maintain a 6-month supply of APIs for drugs on the updated
essential medicines list if they have not already been addressed in the
list of critical drugs identified pursuant to section 2(a) of this
order.  

(b)  The plan provided pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall
include a proposal and cost estimate for opening a second SAPIR
repository in the United States within 1 year of the date of this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. 
(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

\(i\)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or
agency, or the head thereof; or

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

\(c\)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(d)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Department of Health and Human Services.
