title: Additional Measures to Address the Crime Emergency in the District of Columbia
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Crime Emergency</span>.  Two
weeks ago, I declared a crime emergency in the District of Columbia to
address the rampant violence and disorder that have undermined the
proper and safe functioning of the Federal Government, and therefore,
the Nation, and that have led to disgraceful conditions in our Nation’s
capital.  In furtherance of Executive Order 14333 of August 11, 2025
(Declaring a Crime Emergency in the District of Columbia), I am now
ordering further actions to address the conditions described in that
Executive Order. 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Operational Actions</span>.
 (a)  The Director of the National Park Service shall, subject to the
availability of appropriations and applicable law, hire additional
members of the United States Park Police in the District of Columbia to
support the policy goals described in Executive Order 14333.  The United
States Park Police shall ensure enforcement of all applicable laws
within their jurisdiction, including the Code of the District of
Columbia, to help maintain public safety and proper order.

\(b\)  The United States Attorney for the District of Columbia shall,
subject to the availability of appropriations and applicable law, hire
additional prosecutors to focus on prosecuting violent and property
crimes.

\(c\)  The D.C. Safe and Beautiful Task Force established in Executive
Order 14252 of March 27, 2025 (Making the District of Columbia Safe and
Beautiful), shall establish an online portal for Americans with law
enforcement or other relevant backgrounds and experience to apply to
join Federal law enforcement entities to support the policy goals
described in Executive Order 14333.  Each law enforcement agency that is
a member of the D.C. Safe and Beautiful Task Force, as well as other
relevant components of the Department of Justice as the Attorney General
determines, shall further, subject to the availability of appropriations
and applicable law, immediately create and begin training, manning,
hiring, and equipping a specialized unit that is dedicated to ensuring
public safety and order in the Nation’s capital that can be deployed
whenever the circumstances necessitate, and that could be deployed,
subject to applicable law, in other cities where public safety and order
has been lost.

(d)(i)  The Secretary of Defense shall, subject to the availability of
appropriations and applicable law, immediately create and begin
training, manning, hiring, and equipping a specialized unit within the
District of Columbia National Guard, subject to activation under Title
32 of the United States Code, that is dedicated to ensuring public
safety and order in the Nation’s capital.  As appropriate and consistent
with applicable law, the Attorney General, the Secretary of the
Interior, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with
the Secretary of Defense, shall each deputize the members of this unit
to enforce Federal law.

(ii)  The Secretary of Defense shall immediately begin ensuring that
each State’s Army National Guard and Air National Guard are resourced,
trained, organized, and available to assist Federal, State, and local
law enforcement in quelling civil disturbances and ensuring the public
safety and order whenever the circumstances necessitate, as appropriate
under law.  In coordination with the respective adjutants general, the
Secretary of Defense shall designate an appropriate number of each
State’s trained National Guard members to be reasonably available for
rapid mobilization for such purposes.  In addition, the Secretary of
Defense shall ensure the availability of a standing National Guard quick
reaction force that shall be resourced, trained, and available for rapid
nationwide deployment. 

\(e\)  The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) shall
investigate any non-compliance with the crime-prevention and safety
requirements of HUD agreements by the District of Columbia Housing
Authority or any landlord in the District of Columbia.  These
investigations shall include consideration of the provisions of such
agreements that require housing providers to maintain safe, decent, and
sanitary conditions or to restrict tenants who engage in criminal
activity that threatens health, safety, and the right to peaceful
enjoyment for other tenants, including engaging in drug distribution,
violent criminal activity, and domestic violence.  The Secretary of HUD
shall refer any findings of non-compliance to the Attorney General,
Federal law enforcement authorities, the District of Columbia Housing
Authority Police Department, and the Metropolitan Police Department, as
appropriate.

\(f\)  The Secretary of Transportation shall conduct additional
inspections, audits, and examinations to determine whether conditions
exist in federally-funded transit services in the District of Columbia
that endanger transit workers, and take appropriate remedial action that
is within the Department of Transportation’s authority.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Potential Amendments to
Metropolitan Police Department General Orders</span>.  (a)  The Attorney
General shall review the Metropolitan Police Department General Orders
and shall request that the Mayor of the District of Columbia make such
updates and modifications to such orders as the Attorney General
determines are necessary to address the crime emergency and ensure
public order and safety.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Severability</span>.  If any
provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any
individual or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this
order and the application of its other provisions to any other
individuals or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.  (a)
 Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:

(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees or agents, or any other person.

(d)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Department of Justice.
