Memorandum for THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

SUBJECT:       Restoring Law and Order in the District of Columbia

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.  As
President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the District of
Columbia National Guard, it is my solemn duty to protect law-abiding
citizens from the destructive forces of criminal activity.  That
obligation applies with special force in our Nation’s capital, where, as
Commander in Chief of the District of Columbia National Guard, I must
also ensure that all citizens can avail themselves of the right to
interact with their elected representatives, and that the Federal
Government can properly function, without fear of being subjected to
violent, menacing street crime.

The local government of the District of Columbia has lost control of
public order and safety in the city, as evidenced by the two embassy
staffers who were murdered in May, the Congressional intern who was
fatally shot a short distance from the White House in June, and the
Administration staffer who was mercilessly beaten by a violent mob days
ago.  Citizens, tourists, and staff alike are unable to live peacefully
in the Nation’s capital, which is under siege from violent crime.  It is
a point of national disgrace that Washington, D.C., has a violent crime
rate that is higher than some of the most dangerous places in the world.
 It is my duty to our citizens and Federal workers to secure the safety
and the peaceful functioning of our Nation, the Federal Government, and
our city.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Mobilizing the District of
Columbia National Guard</span>.  Pursuant to my authority under the
Constitution and laws of the United States and the District of Columbia,
I direct the Secretary of Defense to mobilize the District of Columbia
National Guard and order members to active service, in such numbers as
he deems necessary, to address the epidemic of crime in our Nation’s
capital.  The mobilization and duration of duty shall remain in effect
until I determine that conditions of law and order have been restored in
the District of Columbia.  Further, I direct the Secretary of Defense to
coordinate with State Governors and authorize the orders of any
additional members of the National Guard to active service, as he deems
necessary and appropriate, to augment this mission.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. 
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
