title: Improving Our Nation Through Better Design
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose and Policy</span>.
 America has long led the world in innovation, technological
advancement, and design.  But with a sprawling ecosystem of digital
services offered to Americans, the Government has lagged behind in
usability and aesthetics.  There is a high financial cost to maintaining
legacy systems, to say nothing of the cost in time lost by the American
public trying to navigate them.  It is time to fill the digital potholes
across our Nation.

With this order, I am announcing “America by Design,” a national
initiative to improve experiences for Americans, starting by breathing
new life into the design of sites where people interface with their
Government.  It is time to update the Government’s design language to be
both usable and beautiful.  This effort will be facilitated by a new
National Design Studio and by a new Chief Design Officer.  The Chief
Design Officer will help recruit top creative talent, coordinate with
executive departments and agencies (agencies), and devise innovative
solutions.

It is the policy of my Administration to deliver digital and physical
experiences that are both beautiful and efficient, improving the quality
of life for our Nation.  Towards that end, the National Design Studio
will advise agencies on how to reduce duplicative design costs, use
standardized design to enhance the public’s trust in high-impact service
providers, and dramatically improve the quality of experiences offered
to the American public.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Establishing America by Design
and the National Design Studio</span>.  (a)  There is established a
national initiative, America by Design, to improve comprehensively the
visual presentation and usability of Federal services provided to the
public in both digital and physical spaces, creating first-class online
and offline experiences for Americans.

\(b\)  To help facilitate the America by Design initiative, there is
established within the White House Office of the Executive Office of the
President the National Design Studio (NDS) and, within the NDS, a new
position entitled the Chief Design Officer.  The NDS shall be led by an
Administrator, who shall report to the Office of the White House Chief
of Staff.  There is further established within the NDS, in accordance
with section 3161 of title 5, United States Code, a temporary
organization headed by the NDS Administrator and dedicated to helping
advance the America by Design initiative.  The temporary organization
shall terminate 3 years from the date of this order, but that
termination shall not be interpreted to imply the termination,
attenuation, or amendment of any other authority or provision of this
order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Implementing America by
Design</span>.  (a)  Heads of agencies shall consult with the Chief
Design Officer to implement the America by Design initiative at their
respective agencies and shall produce initial results by July 4, 2026. 

\(i\)    Heads of agencies shall prioritize improving websites and
physical sites that have a major impact on Americans’ everyday lives. 

\(ii\)   The Administrator of General Services shall consult with the
Chief Design Officer to update the United States Web Design System
consistent with the policies set forth in this order.

\(iii\)  Heads of agencies shall consult with the Chief Design Officer
to ensure Government-wide compliance with the 21st Century Integrated
Digital Experience Act, Public Law 115-336.

\(b\)  The Chief Design Officer shall consult with thought leaders and
research and design firms on how best to implement the America by Design
initiative.  In order to employ the most talented designers of our
generation to serve their country, the Chief Design Officer shall help
recruit designers and other experts from the private sector as well as
other sources of expertise.  Heads of agencies shall use all relevant
hiring authorities to facilitate this effort, including title IV of the
Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970, Public Law 91-648, 5 U.S.C.
3371 *et seq.*

(c)  The Chief Design Officer shall consult with the Director of the
Office of Management and Budget, as appropriate, in carrying out his or
her obligations under this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.
 (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

\(c\)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
