By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

From the earliest days of our American story, our Nation’s future has
been molded by the skill, determination, and unwavering resilience of
the American worker.  From the earliest settlers, who laid the
foundations of a new Nation to the innovators who built our railroads,
steel mills, and skyscrapers, America’s greatness has always rested in
the strength of its workforce.  This Labor Day, we honor the proud
legacy of America’s workforce — and we pay tribute to the unbreakable
spirit that keeps it strong nearly 250 years later.

The American worker is the beating heart of our economy, the foundation
of our strength, and the living embodiment of the American Dream.  In
every honest citizen lives the instinct to work, build, and create — an
instinct seen in the welder, the nurse, the trucker, the farmer, and the
machinist.  Every job, every shift, every hour worked by millions of
talented patriots today adds another stone to the foundation of our
prosperity.

Tragically, in recent decades, a corrupt political class allowed our
manufacturing base to decline.  Our jobs were shipped to distant shores,
our industries decimated, and our communities weakened, all while
building up foreign competitors at the expense of American workers and
families.

Those days ended on January 20, 2025.  Every day, my Administration is
restoring the dignity of labor and putting the American worker first. 
We are making it easier to buy American and hire American, breathing new
life into our manufacturing cities, and securing fair trade deals that
protect our jobs and reward our productivity.  We are amassing hundreds
of billions of dollars in tariff revenue and ensuring that every product
of American craftsmanship is appreciated for its true value in overseas
markets.  Under my leadership, we are bringing jobs back to America —
and those jobs are going to American-born workers.

From our heartland to our great coastal cities, once-forgotten
communities are stirring with new opportunity.  Workers are keeping more
of what they earn, and new jobs are being created at a record pace.  As
President, I will always defend the interests of every citizen who works
with integrity, honors the rule of law, and strives to secure a brighter
future for themselves, their families, and future generations of
Americans.

This Labor Day, we renew our pledge to protect American jobs and defend
the dignity of American labor — and we proudly acknowledge the vital
role that our workers play in our past, present, and glorious American
future.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 1, 2025, as
Labor Day.  I call upon all public officials and people of the United
States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and
activities that honor the contributions and resilience of working
Americans.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day
of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
fiftieth.

                              DONALD J. TRUMP
