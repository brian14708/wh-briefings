title: "Further Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates to Reflect Ongoing Discussions with\
  \ The People\u2019s Republic of China"

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) (IEEPA), the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq.*), section 604 of the
Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title
3, United States Code, I hereby determine and order:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.  In
Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a
Reciprocal Tariff to Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large
and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), I found that
conditions reflected in large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade
deficits, including the consequences of those exploding trade deficits,
constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security
and economy of the United States that has its source in whole or
substantial part outside the United States.  I declared a national
emergency with respect to that threat, and to deal with that threat, I
imposed certain *ad valorem* duties that I deemed necessary and
appropriate.

In Executive Order 14259 of April 8, 2025 (Amendment to Reciprocal
Tariffs and Updated Duties as Applied to Low-Value Imports From the
People’s Republic of China), and Executive Order 14266 of April 9, 2025
(Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates to Reflect Trading Partner
Retaliation and Alignment), I ordered modifications of the Harmonized
Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) to raise the applicable *ad
valorem* duty rate for imports from the People’s Republic of China (PRC)
established in Executive Order 14257, in recognition of the fact that
the State Council Tariff Commission of the PRC announced that it would
retaliate against the United States in response to Executive Order 14257
and Executive Order 14259.

Subsequently, the United States entered into discussions with the PRC to
address the lack of trade reciprocity in our economic relationship and
our resulting national and economic security concerns.  Therefore, in
Executive Order 14298 of May 12, 2025 (Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates
to Reflect Discussions With the People’s Republic of China), I
determined that it was necessary and appropriate to address the national
emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 by modifying the HTSUS to
suspend for a period of 90 days application of the additional *ad
valorem* duties imposed on the PRC listed in Annex I to Executive Order
14257, as amended, and to instead impose on articles of the PRC an
additional *ad valorem* rate of duty as set forth in Executive Order
14298, pursuant to the terms of, and except as otherwise provided in,
Executive Order 14257, as amended.  This 90-day suspension expires at
12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 12, 2025.

The United States continues to have discussions with the PRC to address
the lack of trade reciprocity in our economic relationship and our
resulting national and economic security concerns.  Through these
discussions, the PRC continues to take significant steps toward
remedying non-reciprocal trade arrangements and addressing the concerns
of the United States relating to economic and national security matters.
 Based on this additional information and recommendations from various
senior officials, among other things, I have determined that it is
necessary and appropriate to continue the suspension effectuated by
Executive Order 14298 until 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on November
10, 2025.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Continued Suspension of
Country-Specific *Ad Valorem* Rate of Duty</span>.  Heading 9903.01.63
and subdivision (v)(xiv)(10) of U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of chapter
99 of the HTSUS shall continue to be suspended until 12:01 a.m. eastern
standard time on November 10, 2025.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Implementation</span>.  The
Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the
United States Trade Representative, as applicable, in consultation with
the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Assistant to
the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the
President for Economic Policy, the Senior Counselor to the President for
Trade and Manufacturing, the Chair of the United States International
Trade Commission, and the Postmaster General, are directed to take all
necessary actions to implement and effectuate this order, consistent
with applicable law, including through temporary suspension or amendment
of regulations or notices in the *Federal Register* and adopting rules
and regulations, and are authorized to take such actions, and to employ
all powers granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to
implement this order.  Each executive department and agency shall take
all appropriate measures within its authority to implement this order.

(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
