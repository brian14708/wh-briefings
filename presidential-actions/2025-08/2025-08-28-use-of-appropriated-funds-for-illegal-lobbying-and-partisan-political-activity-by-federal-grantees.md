MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

SUBJECT:       Use of Appropriated Funds for Illegal Lobbying and
Partisan Political Activity by   Federal Grantees

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Investigations Into Use of
Federal Grant Funds</span>.  Federal funding reviews by my
Administration have revealed that taxpayer funds are being spent on
grants with highly political overtones.

In addition to being a wasteful, abusive, and potentially fraudulent use
of the American people’s money, the possible use of Federal grants as
slush funds for political and legislative advocacy raises serious legal
concerns.  Federal law places strict limitations on the use of Federal
grant funds, and in many instances prohibits grantees from lobbying with
appropriated funds or supporting political candidates or parties with
grant funds.

Therefore, consistent with my duty to take care that the laws are
faithfully executed, I hereby direct the Attorney General, in
consultation with the heads of executive departments and agencies, to
investigate whether Federal grant funds are being used to illegally
support lobbying activities (See, 31 U.S.C. 1352) and to take
appropriate enforcement action.  The Attorney General shall report to
the President within 180 days of the date of this memorandum on the
progress of the investigation.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.  (a)
 Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\)  This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable
law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

\(c\)  This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in
equity by any party against the United States, its departments,
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other
person.

\(d\)  You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in
the *Federal Register*.
