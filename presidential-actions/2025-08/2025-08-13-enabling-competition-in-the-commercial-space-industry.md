title: Enabling Competition in the Commercial Space Industry
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.
 In 1969, the United States landed the first humans on the Moon.  In the
years since, premier space companies from around the world have been
drawn to launch rockets and satellites from the United States,
incentivized by its infrastructure and support for commercial space
activities.  Americans are more prosperous because of the space research
and development occurring here.    

It is imperative that we build on the far-reaching actions taken by my
Administration during my first term to ensure that new space-based
industries, space exploration capabilities, and cutting-edge defense
systems are pioneered in America rather than by our adversaries.
 Ensuring that United States operators can efficiently launch, conduct
missions in space, and reenter United States airspace is critical to
economic growth, national security, and accomplishing Federal
space objectives.  

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of the United States to enhance American greatness in space by
enabling a competitive launch marketplace and substantially increasing
commercial space launch cadence and novel space activities by 2030.  To
accomplish this, the Federal Government will streamline commercial
license and permit approvals for United States-based operators.  

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Reforming Regulatory Barriers
to Commercial Launch and Reentry</span>.  (a)  The Secretary of
Transportation, in consultation with the Chair of the Council on
Environmental Quality, shall, consistent with applicable law, use all
available authorities to eliminate or expedite the Department of
Transportation’s environmental reviews for, and other obstacles to the
granting of, launch and reentry licenses and permits.  Such measures
shall include the exercise of authority by the Secretary of
Transportation under 51 U.S.C. 50905(b)(2)(C) as applicable; determining
which Department of Transportation functions are not subject to the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); and, as appropriate,
establishing categorical exclusions under NEPA (or relying on existing
categorical exclusions) for launch and reentry licenses and permits
within certain parameters.   

\(b\)  The Secretary of Transportation shall reevaluate, amend, or
rescind, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, the
regulations at Part 450 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations. The
Secretary’s evaluation, amendment, or rescission shall specifically
address:  

\(i\)    what regulatory requirements should be inapplicable for a
launch or reentry vehicle that possesses a flight termination system or
automated flight safety system;  

\(ii\)   what regulatory requirements should be inapplicable or waived
for hybrid launch or reentry vehicles that hold valid Federal Aviation
Administration airworthiness certificates;  

\(iii\)  whether to expand the conditions that demonstrate reliability
for a reentry vehicle, sufficient to protect against a high-consequence
event on reentry; and  

\(iv\)   whether other existing requirements are too attenuated to a
vehicle’s actual launch or reentry to warrant retention in Part 450.    

(c)  Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of
Transportation shall report to the Assistant to the President for
Economic Policy a description of the actions that have been or will be
taken pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.   

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Reforming Regulatory Barriers
to Next Generation Spaceport Infrastructure</span>.  (a)  The Secretary
of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the
Secretary of Transportation, and the Administrator of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), shall, within 180 days of
the date of this order, conduct an evaluation of relevant States’
compliance under the Coastal Zone Management Act pursuant to 16 U.S.C.
1458, the effect of any lack of compliance on the development of
spaceport infrastructure, and whether State approvals under that Act
should be revoked.  The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Commerce,
the Secretary of Transportation, and the Administrator of NASA shall
also notify the Department of Justice of any State or local limitations
on spaceport development on Federal lands that may be inconsistent with
Federal law.  

\(b\)  Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of
Defense, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Administrator of NASA
shall execute a memorandum of understanding that aligns review processes
for spaceport development across agencies, eliminates those that are
duplicative, and preserves required Federal space-exploration and
National Security Space Launch capacity.  

\(c\)  The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, the
Secretary of Transportation, and the Administrator of NASA shall,
consistent with applicable law, use all available authorities to
expedite their respective environmental and administrative reviews for
authorizations, permits, approval, real property leases, and any other
activity relevant to spaceport infrastructure development.  The Chair of
the Council on Environmental Quality shall coordinate with relevant
executive departments and agencies (agencies) on the establishment of
new categorical exclusions under NEPA for actions related to spaceport
development that normally do not have a significant effect on the
quality of the human environment.  Agencies shall, for purposes of
establishing these categorical exclusions, rely on any sufficient basis
to do so as each such agency determines.  

\(d\)  The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Transportation, and
the Administrator of NASA shall, mindful of the significant national
security imperatives inherent in commercial space advancement, consider
for all spaceport development projects whether to submit an application
to the Endangered Species Committee pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 1536(e).   

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Reforming Novel Space Activity
Authorization</span>. Within 150 days of the date of this order, the
Secretary of Commerce shall propose a process for individualized mission
authorizations for activities that are covered by Article VI of the
Outer Space Treaty of 1967, but not clearly or straightforwardly
governed by existing regulatory frameworks, with the goal of expediting
and streamlining authorizations to enable American space competitiveness
and superiority.  This proposal must solicit and consider affected
agencies’ feedback on the authorization process, contain a definitive
timeline for the grant or denial of authorization for proposed
activities, and include clear and consistent requirements for
applicants.  The Secretary of Commerce shall transmit the proposal to
the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, the Assistant to the
President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the
President for Science and Technology.  Nothing in this section shall be
construed to apply to human spaceflight.  

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Reforming
Regulatory Leadership and Accountability</span>.          (a)  Within 60
days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Transportation shall
establish a position in the Office of the Secretary with the
responsibility of advising the Secretary of Transportation on fostering
innovation and deregulation in the commercial space transportation
industry.  The Secretary of Transportation shall further direct the
Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to take all
necessary steps to appoint a senior executive noncareer employee to be
the Associate Administrator for Commercial Space Transportation.  

\(b\)  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of
Commerce shall elevate the Office of Space Commerce into the Office of
the Secretary.  

Sec. 7.  Administrative Note.  Where applicable, the functions assigned
to the Secretary of Transportation in sections 1 through 5 of this order
shall be carried out by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation
Administration under the direction of the Secretary of Transportation.  

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">8</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">General
Provisions</span>.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to
impair or otherwise affect:

  
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or  

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.  

\(c\)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.  

\(d\)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Department of Transportation.
