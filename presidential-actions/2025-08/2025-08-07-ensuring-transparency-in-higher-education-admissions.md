Memorandum for THE SECRETARY OF EDUCATION

SUBJECT:       Ensuring Transparency in Higher Education Admissions

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.  Although
the Supreme Court of the United States has definitively held that
consideration of race in higher education admissions violates students’
civil rights, the persistent lack of available data — paired with the
rampant use of “diversity statements” and other overt and hidden racial
proxies — continues to raise concerns about whether race is actually
used in practice.  Greater transparency is essential to exposing
unlawful practices and ultimately ridding society of shameful, dangerous
racial hierarchies.

The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), managed by
the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), plays a critical
role in promoting transparency in American higher education.  However,
IPEDS requires long-overdue technological upgrades to expand its data
collection and fulfill its mission effectively.

American students and taxpayers deserve confidence in the fairness and
integrity of our Nation’s institutions of higher education, including
confidence that they are recruiting and training capable future doctors,
engineers, scientists, and other critical workers vital to the next
generations of American prosperity.  Race-based admissions practices are
not only unfair, but also threaten our national security and
well-being.  It is therefore the policy of my Administration to ensure
institutions of higher education receiving Federal financial assistance
are transparent in their admissions practices.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Technological
Improvements</span>.  (a)  The Secretary of Education, in consultation
with the heads of other executive departments and agencies (agencies) as
necessary, shall revamp the online presentation of IPEDS data, such that
it is easily accessible and intelligibly presented for parents and
students.

\(b\)  The Secretary of Education, in consultation with the heads of
other agencies as necessary, shall revise and, if necessary, overhaul
the IPEDS data collection portal to remove inefficiencies and better
streamline the process to more efficiently organize and utilize the data
received from the institutions.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Enhanced Reporting
Requirements</span>.  (a)  Within 120 days of the date of this
memorandum, and to be initiated this 2025-2026 school year, the
Secretary of Education, in coordination with NCES, shall expand the
scope of required reporting to provide adequate transparency into
admissions, as determined by the Secretary of Education, consistent with
applicable law.  The Secretary of Education shall make public the
enhanced reporting requirements. 

(b)  The Secretary of Education shall increase accuracy checks of
submitted data to ensure the validity of IPEDS data.

(c)  The Secretary of Education shall take remedial action, consistent
with Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 and other applicable
laws, if institutions fail to submit data in a timely manner or are
found to have submitted incomplete or inaccurate data.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.
 This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
