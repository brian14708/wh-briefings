title: Measures To End Cashless Bail And Enforce The Law In The District Of Columbia
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose and Policy</span>.  As
stated in Executive Order 14333 of August 11, 2025 (Declaring a Crime
Emergency in the District of Columbia), there is a crime emergency in
Washington, D.C., that is impeding the operations and responsibilities
of the Federal Government.  The District of Columbia government’s
pretrial release policies, which include prohibiting cash bail,
contribute to the disgraceful conditions referenced in the
aforementioned Executive Order, as law enforcement must arrest the same
individuals multiple times, and dangerous criminals are sometimes
rapidly released.  This leaves such criminals free to endanger American
citizens visiting our Nation’s capital, Federal workers discharging
their duties to our Nation, and citizens of the District of Columbia
trying to live their lives safely.  It is therefore the policy of my
Administration that all necessary and lawful measures be taken to end
cashless bail policies and ensure the pretrial detention of any criminal
suspect who threatens public safety.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Ending Unwarranted Pretrial
Release in the District of Columbia</span>.  (a)  To prevent the release
of dangerous suspects based on cashless bail policies, relevant Federal
law enforcement agencies and officials who are members of the D.C. Safe
and Beautiful Task Force established in Executive Order 14252 of March
27, 2025 (Making the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful), shall
work to ensure that arrestees in the District of Columbia are held in
Federal custody to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law,
and shall pursue Federal charges and pretrial detention for such
arrestees whenever possible, consistent with applicable law, to ensure
that criminal defendants who pose a threat to public safety are not
released from custody prior to trial.

(b)  Further, the Attorney General shall review the Metropolitan Police
Department (MPD) General Orders and other policies and practices of the
MPD to identify those that may result in pretrial release of criminal
defendants who pose a threat to public safety and, consistent with
section 740 of the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental
Reorganization Act (Public Law 93-198), shall request that the Mayor of
the District of Columbia make such updates and modifications to such
orders and policies as the Attorney General determines would be
necessary to address the crime emergency and help to ensure public order
and safety.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Measures to End Cashless Bail
in the District of Columbia</span>.  (a)  The Attorney General shall
determine whether the District of Columbia continues to maintain a
policy or practice of prohibiting cash bail as a potential condition of
pretrial release from jail for crimes prosecuted under the Code of the
District of Columbia in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia
where the arrestee poses a clear threat to public safety and order. 
Such cases include violent or sexual offenses such as rape, murder,
carjacking, and assault, as well as property offenses such as burglary,
looting, and vandalism.  The Attorney General shall update her
determination if the District of Columbia changes its cashless bail
policies or practices.

\(b\)  If the Attorney General determines that the District of Columbia
continues to maintain a policy or practice of prohibiting cash bail, the
head of each executive department or agency (agency), in coordination
with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, shall identify
appropriate actions to press the District of Columbia to change its
policies with respect to cashless bail.  Such actions may include
Federal funding decisions or the provision of Federal services or
approvals by agency heads, as well as actions the Attorney General
identifies as necessary and appropriate because of the emergency
conditions based upon which section 740 of the District of Columbia Home
Rule Act has been invoked.  The head of each agency shall undertake any
such actions he or she deems appropriate, consistent with applicable
law.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. 
(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(d)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Department of Justice.

THE WHITE HOUSE,
