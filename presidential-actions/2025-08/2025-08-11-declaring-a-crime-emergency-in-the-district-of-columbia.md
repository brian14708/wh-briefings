title: Declaring a Crime Emergency in the District of Columbia
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including section 740 of the
District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act
(Public Law 93-198), as amended (section 740 of the Home Rule Act), and
section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Crime is out of control in the
District of Columbia</span>.  Washington, District of Columbia, is our
Nation’s capital and home to the central institutions of American
governance.  Yet rising violence in the capital now urgently endangers
public servants, citizens, and tourists, disrupts safe and secure
transportation and the proper functioning of the Federal Government, and
forces the diversion of critical public resources toward emergency
response and security measures.  The city government’s failure to
maintain public order and safety has had a dire impact on the Federal
Government’s ability to operate efficiently to address the Nation’s
broader interests without fear of our workers being subjected to rampant
violence.

The increase in violent crime in the heart of our Republic has
consequences beyond the individual tragedies that have dominated media
coverage.  Such lawlessness also poses intolerable risks to the vital
Federal functions that take place in the District of Columbia.  Violence
and crime hamper the recruitment and retention of essential Federal
employees, undermine critical functions of Government and thus the
well-being of the entire Nation, and erode confidence in the strength of
the United States.  These conditions are disgraceful anywhere, but
particularly in the capital of our Nation and the seat of the Federal
Government.  Citizens, tourists, and Federal workers deserve peace and
security, not fear and violence.  The smooth functioning of executive
departments and agencies, courts, diplomatic missions, and the Federal
Government demands an effective law-enforcement mechanism capable of
halting the precipitous rise in violent crime, not one that permits
Government workers to be violently attacked by mobs or fatally shot
close to the Federal buildings where they work.

The magnitude of the violent crime crisis places the District of
Columbia among the most violent jurisdictions in the United States.  In
2024, the District of Columbia averaged one of the highest robbery and
murder rates of large cities nationwide.  Indeed, the District of
Columbia now has a higher violent crime, murder, and robbery rate than
all 50 States, recording a homicide rate in 2024 of 27.54 per 100,000
residents.  It also experienced the Nation’s highest vehicle theft rate
with 842.4 thefts per 100,000 residents — over three times the national
average of 250.2 thefts per 100,000 residents.  The District of Columbia
is, by some measures, among the top 20 percent of the most dangerous
cities in the world.

As President, I have a solemn duty to take care that our laws are
faithfully executed, and a sacred responsibility to protect the safety
and security of United States citizens who live in and visit our
Nation’s capital, including Federal workers who live or commute into the
District of Columbia.  These conditions cannot persist.  We will make
the District of Columbia one of the safest cities in the world, not the
most dangerous.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Services of the Metropolitan
Police Department of the District of Columbia</span>.  I determine that
special conditions of an emergency nature exist that require the use of
the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia
(Metropolitan Police force) for Federal purposes, including maintaining
law and order in the Nation’s seat of Government; protecting Federal
buildings, national monuments, and other Federal property; and ensuring
conditions necessary for the orderly functioning of the Federal
Government.  Effective immediately, the Mayor of the District of
Columbia (Mayor) shall provide the services of the Metropolitan Police
force for Federal purposes for the maximum period permitted under
section 740 of the Home Rule Act.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Monitoring and

regularly consult with any senior official the Attorney General deems
appropriate on the special conditions of an emergency nature that exist
in the District of Columbia that require the use of the Metropolitan
Police force for Federal purposes.

(b)  The Attorney General shall regularly update me on the status of the
special conditions of an emergency nature that exist in the District of
Columbia that require the use of the Metropolitan Police force for
Federal purposes.

(c)  The Attorney General shall inform me of any circumstances that, in
the Attorney General’s opinion, might indicate the need for further
action by the President or that the action in this order is no longer
necessary.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Severability</span>.  If any

order and the application of its other provisions to any other
individuals or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.
 (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

\(i\)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or
agency, or the head thereof; or

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

\(d\)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Department of Justice.
