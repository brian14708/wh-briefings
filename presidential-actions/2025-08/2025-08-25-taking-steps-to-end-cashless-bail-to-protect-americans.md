title: Taking Steps to End Cashless Bail to Protect Americans
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose and Policy</span>. 
Maintaining order and public safety requires incarcerating individuals
whose pending criminal charges or criminal history demonstrate a clear
ongoing risk to society.  When these individuals are released without
bail under city or State policies, they are permitted — even encouraged
— to further endanger law-abiding, hard-working Americans because they
know our laws will not be enforced.  Our great law enforcement officers
risk their lives to arrest potentially violent criminals, only to be
forced to arrest the same individuals, sometimes for the same crimes,
while they await trial on the previous charges.  This is a waste of
public resources and a threat to public safety.

As President, I will require commonsense policies that protect
Americans’ safety and well-being by incarcerating individuals who are
known threats.  It is therefore the policy of my Administration that
Federal policies and resources should not be used to support
jurisdictions with cashless bail policies, to the maximum extent
permitted by law.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Consequences for Cashless Bail
Jurisdictions</span>.  (a)  Within 30 days of the date of this order,
the Attorney General shall submit to the President, through the
Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, a list of States and
local jurisdictions that have, in the Attorney General’s opinion,
substantially eliminated cash bail as a potential condition of pretrial
release from custody for crimes that pose a clear threat to public
safety and order, including offenses involving violent, sexual, or
indecent acts, or burglary, looting, or vandalism.  The Attorney General
shall update this list as necessary.

\(b\)  The head of each executive department and agency, in coordination
with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, shall identify
Federal funds, including grants and contracts, currently provided to
cashless bail jurisdictions identified pursuant to subsection (a) of
this section that may be suspended or terminated, as appropriate and
consistent with applicable law.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. 
(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

\(i\)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or
agency, or the head thereof; or

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(d)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Department of Justice.

THE WHITE HOUSE,
