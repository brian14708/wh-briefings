title: Addressing Threats to The United States by the Government of the Russian Federation
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) (IEEPA), the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq.*), section 604 of the
Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title
3, United States Code, I hereby determine and order:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.  Executive
Order 14066 of March 8, 2022 (Prohibiting Certain Imports and New
Investments With Respect to Continued Russian Federation Efforts To
Undermine the Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity of Ukraine),
expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive
Order 14024 of April 15, 2021 (Blocking Property With Respect To
Specified Harmful Foreign Activities of the Government of the Russian
Federation), to include the actions taken against Ukraine by the
Government of the Russian Federation.  To address that unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the
United States, Executive Order 14066 prohibited, among other things, the
importation into the United States of certain products of Russian
Federation origin, including crude oil; petroleum; and petroleum fuels,
oils, and products of their distillation.

I have received additional information from various senior officials on,
among other things, the actions of the Government of the Russian
Federation with respect to the situation in Ukraine.  After considering
this additional information, among other things, I find that the
national emergency described in Executive Order 14066 continues and that
the actions and policies of the Government of the Russian Federation
continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national
security and foreign policy of the United States.

To deal with the national emergency described in Executive Order 14066,
I determine that it is necessary and appropriate to impose an additional
*ad valorem* duty on imports of articles of India, which is directly or
indirectly importing Russian Federation oil.  In my judgment, imposing
tariffs, as described below, in addition to maintaining the other
measures taken to address the national emergency described in Executive
Order 14066, will more effectively deal with the national emergency
described in Executive Order 14066. 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Imposition of Tariffs</span>. 
(a)  I find that the Government of India is currently directly or
indirectly importing Russian Federation oil. 

(b)  Accordingly, and as consistent with applicable law, articles of
India imported into the customs territory of the United States shall be
subject to an additional *ad valorem *rate of duty of 25 percent. 
Subject to section 3 of this order, this rate of duty shall be effective
with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from
warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time
21 days after the date of this order, except for goods that (1) were
loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading and in transit on the final
mode of transit prior to entry into the United States before 12:01 a.m.
eastern daylight time 21 days after the date of this order; and (2) are
entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption,
before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 17, 2025.

Sec. 3.  Scope of Duties and Stacking.  (a)  The *ad valorem* duty
imposed in section 2 of this order shall be in addition to any other
duties, fees, taxes, exactions, and charges applicable to such imports,
unless subject to existing or future actions under section 232 of the
Trade Expansion Act of 1962, in which case the *ad valorem *duty imposed
in this order shall not apply.

(b)  The *ad valorem* duty imposed in section 2 of this order shall not
apply to articles that are excepted by 50 U.S.C. 1702(b).

\(c\)  The *ad valorem* duty imposed in section 2 of this order shall
not apply to articles that are set forth in Annex II to Executive Order
14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff To
Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual
United States Goods Trade Deficits), as amended.

(d)  The *ad valorem* duty imposed in Executive Order 14257 of April 2,
2025, as amended, shall apply in addition to the *ad valorem* duty
imposed in section 2 of this order, when applicable pursuant to the
terms of Executive Order 14257.

\(e\)  Except for those articles that are eligible for admission under
“domestic status” as defined in 19 CFR 146.43, articles that are subject
to the duty imposed in section 2 of this order and are admitted into a
foreign trade zone on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 21 days
after the date of this order must be admitted as “privileged foreign
status” as defined in 19 CFR 146.41.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Modification Authority</span>. 
(a)  To ensure that the emergency described in section 1 of this order
is dealt with, I may modify this order, including in light of additional
information, recommendations from senior officials, or changed
circumstances.

(b)  Should a foreign country retaliate against the United States in
response to this action, I may modify this order to ensure the efficacy
of the actions herein ordered. 

(c)  Should the Government of the Russian Federation or a foreign
country impacted by this order take significant steps to address the
national emergency described in section 1 of this order and align
sufficiently with the United States on national security, foreign
policy, and economic matters, I may further modify this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Monitoring and
Recommendations</span>.  (a)  The Secretary of Commerce, in coordination
with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, and any
other senior official the Secretary of Commerce deems appropriate, shall
determine whether any other country is directly or indirectly importing
Russian Federation oil.  If the Secretary of Commerce finds that a
country is directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil, the
Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury,
the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the
United States Trade Representative, the Assistant to the President for
National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic
Policy, and the Assistant to the President and Senior Counselor for
Trade and Manufacturing, shall recommend whether and to what extent I
should take action as to that country, including whether I should impose
an additional *ad valorem *rate of duty of 25 percent on imports of
articles of that country.

(b)  The Secretary of State shall monitor and regularly consult with any
senior official the Secretary of State deems appropriate on the
emergency described in section 1 of this order.

Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security,
the United States Trade Representative, the Assistant to the President
for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for
Economic Policy, and the Assistant to the President and Senior Counselor
for Trade and Manufacturing, shall recommend to me additional action, if
necessary, if the actions in this order are not effective in resolving
the emergency described in section 1 of this order or should the
Government of the Russian Federation or another foreign country
retaliate against the United States in response to the actions taken in
this order or any subsequent order issued to address the emergency
described in section 1 of this order.
