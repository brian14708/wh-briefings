title: Prosecuting Burning of The American Flag
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  Our great
American Flag is the most sacred and cherished symbol of the United
States of America, and of American freedom, identity, and strength. 
Over nearly two-and-a-half centuries, many thousands of American
patriots have fought, bled, and died to keep the Stars and Stripes
waving proudly.  The American Flag is a special symbol in our national
life that should unite and represent all Americans of every background
and walk of life.  Desecrating it is uniquely offensive and provocative.
 It is a statement of contempt, hostility, and violence against our
Nation — the clearest possible expression of opposition to the political
union that preserves our rights, liberty, and security.  Burning this
representation of America may incite violence and riot.  American Flag
burning is also used by groups of foreign nationals as a calculated act
to intimidate and threaten violence against Americans because of their
nationality and place of birth.

Notwithstanding the Supreme Court’s rulings on First Amendment
protections, the Court has never held that American Flag desecration
conducted in a manner that is likely to incite imminent lawless action
or that is an action amounting to “fighting words” is constitutionally
protected.  See *Texas v. Johnson*, 491 U.S. 397, 408-10 (1989).

My Administration will act to restore respect and sanctity to the
American Flag and prosecute those who incite violence or otherwise
violate our laws while desecrating this symbol of our country, to the
fullest extent permissible under any available authority.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Measures to Combat Desecration
of the American Flag</span>.  (a)  The Attorney General shall prioritize
the enforcement to the fullest extent possible of our Nation’s criminal
and civil laws against acts of American Flag desecration that violate
applicable, content-neutral laws, while causing harm unrelated to
expression, consistent with the First Amendment.  This may include, but
is not limited to, violent crimes; hate crimes, illegal discrimination
against American citizens, or other violations of Americans’ civil
rights; and crimes against property and the peace, as well as
conspiracies and attempts to violate, and aiding and abetting others to
violate, such laws.

(b)  In cases where the Department of Justice or another executive
department or agency (agency) determines that an instance of American
Flag desecration may violate an applicable State or local law, such as
open burning restrictions, disorderly conduct laws, or destruction of
property laws, the agency shall refer the matter to the appropriate
State or local authority for potential action.

(c)  To the maximum extent permitted by the Constitution, the Attorney
General shall vigorously prosecute those who violate our laws in ways
that involve desecrating the American Flag, and may pursue litigation to
clarify the scope of the First Amendment exceptions in this area.

(d)  The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of
Homeland Security, acting within their respective authorities, shall
deny, prohibit, terminate, or revoke visas, residence permits,
naturalization proceedings, and other immigration benefits, or seek
removal from the United States, pursuant to Federal law, including 8
U.S.C. 1182(a), 8 U.S.C. 1424, 8 U.S.C. 1427, 8 U.S.C. 1451(c), and 8
U.S.C. 1227(a), whenever there has been an appropriate determination
that foreign nationals have engaged in American Flag-desecration
activity under circumstances that permit the exercise of such remedies
pursuant to Federal law.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Severability</span>.  If any
provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any
person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this
order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or
circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. 
(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(d)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Department of Justice.
