title: Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(K) Investors
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  Many wealthy
Americans, and Government workers who participate in public pension
plans, can invest in, or are the beneficiaries of investment in, a
number of alternative assets.  Yet, while more than 90 million Americans
participate in employer-sponsored defined-contribution plans, the vast
majority of these investors do not have the opportunity to participate,
either directly or through their retirement plans, in the potential
growth and diversification opportunities associated with alternative
asset investments. 

Fiduciaries of 401(k) and other defined-contribution retirement plans
must carefully vet and consider all aspects of private offerings,
including investment managers’ capabilities, experiences, and
effectiveness managing alternative asset investments.  They do so to
protect the Americans whose retirement accounts they administer and for
whom they have fiduciary duties to invest safely and prudently.   

During my first term, my Administration issued a 2020 information
letter, recognizing that prudent Federal action could encourage the
proliferation of investment strategies under which a portion of
retirement plan participants’ interests are allocated to alternative
assets, as is the case for institutional investors.  

Burdensome lawsuits that seek to challenge reasonable decisions by
loyal, regulated fiduciaries, and stifling Department of Labor guidance
issued since my first term, however, have denied millions of Americans
opportunities to benefit from investment in alternative assets.  Such
assets are an increasingly large portion of the portfolios of public
pension and defined-benefit retirement plans and offer competitive
returns along with diversification opportunities.  

A combination of regulatory overreach and encouragement of lawsuits
filed by opportunistic trial lawyers has stifled investment innovation
and largely relegated 401(k) and other defined-contribution retirement
plan participants to asset classes whose returns lack the very same
long-term net benefits allowed for and achieved by public pension plans
and other institutional investors. 

My Administration will relieve the regulatory burdens and litigation
risk that impede American workers’ retirement accounts from achieving
the competitive returns and asset diversification necessary to secure a
dignified, comfortable retirement.  

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>*.  *It is the
policy of the United States that every American preparing for retirement
should have access to funds that include investments in alternative
assets when the relevant plan fiduciary determines that such access
provides an appropriate opportunity for plan participants and
beneficiaries to enhance the net risk-adjusted returns on their
retirement assets.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Democratizing Access to
Alternative Assets</span>.  (a)  For purposes of this order, the term
“alternative assets” means:

(i)    private market investments, including direct and indirect
interests in equity, debt, or other financial instruments that are not
traded on public exchanges, including those where the managers of such
investments, if applicable, seek to take an active role in the
management of such companies;

(ii)   direct and indirect interests in real estate, including debt
instruments secured by direct or indirect interests in real estate;

\(iii\)  holdings in actively managed investment vehicles that are
investing in digital assets;

\(iv\)   direct and indirect investments in commodities;

(v)    direct and indirect interests in projects financing
infrastructure development; and

(vi)   lifetime income investment strategies including longevity
risk-sharing pools.

(b)  Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Labor
(Secretary) shall reexamine the Department of Labor’s past and present
guidance regarding a fiduciary’s duties under the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) (29 U.S.C. 1104), in
connection with making available to participants an asset allocation
fund that includes investments in alternative assets.  When conducting
this reexamination, the Secretary shall consider whether to rescind the
Department of Labor’s December 21, 2021, Supplemental Private Equity
Statement.

(c)  Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall
further, as the Secretary deems appropriate and consistent with
applicable law, seek to clarify the Department of Labor’s position on
alternative assets and the appropriate fiduciary process associated with
offering asset allocation funds containing investments in alternative
assets under ERISA.  Such clarification must aim to identify the
criteria that fiduciaries should use to prudently balance potentially
higher expenses against the objectives of seeking greater long-term net
returns and broader diversification of investments.  The Secretary shall
also propose rules, regulations, or guidance, as the Secretary deems
appropriate, that clarify the duties that a fiduciary owes to plan
participants under ERISA when deciding whether to make available to plan
participants an asset allocation fund that includes investments in
alternative assets, which rules, regulations, and guidance may include
appropriately calibrated safe harbors.  In carrying out the directives
in this section to further the policy set forth in this order, the
Secretary shall prioritize actions that may curb ERISA litigation that
constrains fiduciaries’ ability to apply their best judgment in offering
investment opportunities to relevant plan participants. 

\(d\)  In carrying out the directives in this section, the Secretary
shall, as appropriate, consult with the Secretary of the Treasury, the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and other Federal regulators
as necessary to carry out the policy objectives of this order, including
as to parallel regulatory changes that may be incorporated by such other
Federal regulators.

\(e\)  The SEC shall, in consultation with the Secretary, consider ways
to facilitate access to investments in alternative assets by
participants in participant-directed defined-contribution retirement
savings plans.  Such facilitation may include, but not be limited to,
consideration of revisions to existing SEC regulations and guidance
relating to accredited investor and qualified purchaser status, to
accomplish the policy objectives of this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>*.*
 (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

\(i\)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or
agency, or the head thereof; or

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

\(c\)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(d)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Department of Labor.
