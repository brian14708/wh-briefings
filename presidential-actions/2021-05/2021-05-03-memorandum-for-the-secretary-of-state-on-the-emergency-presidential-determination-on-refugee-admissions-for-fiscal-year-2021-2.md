title: "Memorandum for the Secretary of State on the Emergency Presidential Determination\
  \ on Refugee Admissions for Fiscal Year\_2021"
---
 
In Executive Order 14013 of February 4, 2021 (Rebuilding and Enhancing
Programs to Resettle Refugees and Planning for the Impact of Climate
Change on Migration), I directed numerous actions to rebuild, expand,
and improve the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP).  On
February 12, 2021, the Department of State submitted a report to certain
congressional committees and, with the Department of Homeland Security
and the Department of Health and Human Services, consulted with the
Congress regarding a proposal to re-allocate admissions among refugees
of humanitarian concern and to increase Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 refugee
admissions from 15,000 refugees to 62,500 refugees due to an unforeseen
emergency refugee situation in countries around the globe since the
signing of Presidential Determination 2021-02 on October 27, 2020
(Presidential Determination on Refugee Admissions for Fiscal Year 2021)
(PD 2021-02).   
  
In Presidential Determination 2021-05 of April 16, 2021 (Emergency
Presidential Determination on Refugee Admissions for Fiscal Year 2021)
(PD 2021-05), I changed the allocation of admissions in PD 2021-02 based
on a determination that new allocations were necessary to respond to the
unforeseen emergency refugee situation.  Based on this change, USRAP
partners are beginning travel preparations for more than 2,000 refugees
who were excluded under PD 2021-02, but who can now be admitted to the
United States.    
  
In PD 2021-05, I did not change the pre-existing number of refugee
admissions permitted for FY 2021, which remained at 15,000.  I also
stated that I would consider raising the worldwide refugee admissions
ceiling before the end of FY 2021, should the pre-existing level be
reached and the emergency refugee situation persist.  When I signed PD
2021-05, my intent was to adjust only the allocation of admissions and
to address the appropriate number of refugees in a separate
determination.  Upon additional briefing and a more comprehensive
presentation regarding the capacity of the executive departments and
agencies charged with administering USRAP to increase refugee admissions
while responding to other demands, and given the ongoing unforeseen
emergency refugee situation, I now determine, consistent with my
Administration’s prior consultation with the Congress, that raising the
number of admissions permissible for FY 2021 to 62,500 is justified by
grave humanitarian concerns and is otherwise in the national interest.  
  
The number of refugee admissions authorized by this determination under
section 207(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1157(b))
sends the important message that the United States remains a safe harbor
for some of the most vulnerable people in the world.  This number also
sets a goal for USRAP and the non-governmental and international
organizations with whom USRAP partners to resettle refugees.  Given the
gravity of the global refugee crisis, the number of authorized refugee
admissions must be ambitious enough to challenge the United States
Government and its partners to build their capacity to serve more
refugees.  In my judgment, a refugee admissions determination of 62,500
reflects these values, is justified by grave humanitarian concerns, and
is otherwise in the national interest of the United States.    
  
The FY 2021 allocations set forth in section (b) of PD 2021-05 are
adjusted as follows:  
  
Africa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  22,000  
East Asia . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  6,000  
Europe and Central Asia . . . . . . . . . . . .  4,000  
Latin America and the Caribbean . . . . . . . .  5,000  
Near East and South Asia . . . . . . . . . . .  13,000  
Unallocated Reserve . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12,500

The provisions of PD 2021-05 are retained, except to the extent
superseded by this determination.  
  
You are authorized and directed to publish this determination in
the *Federal Register*.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
