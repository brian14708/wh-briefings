title: "Executive Order on Climate-Related Financial\_Risk"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:

Section 1.  Policy.  The intensifying impacts of climate change present
physical risk to assets, publicly traded securities, private
investments, and companies — such as increased extreme weather risk
leading to supply chain disruptions.  In addition, the global shift away
from carbon-intensive energy sources and industrial processes presents
transition risk to many companies, communities, and workers.  At the
same time, this global shift presents generational opportunities to
enhance U.S. competitiveness and economic growth, while also creating
well-paying job opportunities for workers. The failure of financial
institutions to appropriately and adequately account for and measure
these physical and transition risks threatens the competitiveness of
U.S. companies and markets, the life savings and pensions of U.S.
workers and families, and the ability of U.S. financial institutions to
serve communities.  In this effort, the Federal Government should lead
by example by appropriately prioritizing Federal investments and
conducting prudent fiscal management.  
      It is therefore the policy of my Administration to advance
consistent, clear, intelligible, comparable, and accurate disclosure of
climate-related financial risk (consistent with Executive Order 13707 of
September 15, 2015 (Using Behavioral Science Insights to Better Serve
the American People)), including both physical and transition risks; act
to mitigate that risk and its drivers, while accounting for and
addressing disparate impacts on disadvantaged communities and
communities of color (consistent with Executive Order 13985 of January
20, 2021 (Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved
Communities Through the Federal Government)) and spurring the creation
of well-paying jobs; and achieve our target of a net-zero emissions
economy by no later than 2050.  This policy will marshal the creativity,
courage, and capital of the United States necessary to bolster the
resilience of our rural and urban communities, States, Tribes,
territories, and financial institutions in the face of the climate
crisis, rather than exacerbate its causes, and position the United
States to lead the global economy to a more prosperous and sustainable
future.

Sec. 2.  Climate-Related Financial Risk Strategy.  The Assistant to the
President for Economic Policy and Director of the National Economic
Council (Director of the National Economic Council) and the Assistant to
the President and National Climate Advisor (National Climate Advisor),
in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Director of
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), shall develop, within 120
days of the date of this order, a comprehensive, Government-wide
strategy regarding:  
      (a)  the measurement, assessment, mitigation, and disclosure of
climate-related financial risk to Federal Government programs, assets,
and liabilities in order to increase the long-term stability of Federal
operations;  
      (b)  financing needs associated with achieving net-zero greenhouse
gas emissions for the U.S. economy by no later than 2050, limiting
global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and adapting to
the acute and chronic impacts of climate change; and  
      (c)  areas in which private and public investments can play
complementary roles in meeting these financing needs — while advancing
economic opportunity, worker empowerment, and environmental mitigation,
especially in disadvantaged communities and communities of color.

Sec. 3.  Assessment of Climate-Related Financial Risk by Financial
Regulators*.*  In furtherance of the policy set forth in section 1 of
this order and consistent with applicable law and subject to the
availability of appropriations:  
      (a)  The Secretary of the Treasury, as the Chair of the Financial
Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), shall engage with FSOC members to
consider the following actions by the FSOC:   
            (i)    assessing, in a detailed and comprehensive manner,
the climate-related financial risk, including both physical and
transition risks, to the financial stability of the Federal Government
and the stability of the U.S. financial system;  
            (ii)   facilitating the sharing of climate-related financial
risk data and information among FSOC member agencies and other executive
departments and agencies (agencies) as appropriate;  
            (iii)  issuing a report to the President within 180 days of
the date of this order on any efforts by FSOC member agencies to
integrate consideration of climate-related financial risk in their
policies and programs, including a discussion of:   
                  (A)  the necessity of any actions to enhance
climate-related disclosures by regulated entities to mitigate
climate-related financial risk to the financial system or assets and a
recommended implementation plan for taking those actions;  
                  (B)  any current approaches to incorporating the
consideration of climate-related financial risk into their respective
regulatory and supervisory activities and any impediments they faced in
adopting those approaches;  
                  (C)  recommended processes to identify climate-related
financial risk to the financial stability of the United States; and  
                  (D)  any other recommendations on how identified
climate-related financial risk can be mitigated, including through new
or revised regulatory standards as appropriate; and  
            (iv)   including an assessment of climate-related financial
risk in the FSOC’s annual report to the Congress.  
      (b)  The Secretary of the Treasury shall:  
            (i)   direct the Federal Insurance Office to assess
climate-related issues or gaps in the supervision and regulation of
insurers, including as part of the FSOC’s analysis of financial
stability, and to further assess, in consultation with States, the
potential for major disruptions of private insurance coverage in regions
of the country particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts; and  
            (ii)  direct the Office of Financial Research to assist the
Secretary of the Treasury and the FSOC in assessing and identifying
climate-related financial risk to financial stability, including the
collection of data, as appropriate, and the development of research on
climate-related financial risk to the U.S. financial system.

Sec. 4.  Resilience of Life Savings and Pensions*.*  In furtherance of
the policy set forth in section 1 of this order and consistent with
applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations, the
Secretary of Labor shall:  
      (a)  identify agency actions that can be taken under the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-406), the Federal
Employees’ Retirement System Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-335), and any
other relevant laws to protect the life savings and pensions of United
States workers and families from the threats of climate-related
financial risk;  
      (b)  consider publishing, by September 2021, for notice and
comment a proposed rule to suspend, revise, or rescind “Financial
Factors in Selecting Plan Investments,” 85 Fed. Reg. 72846 (November 13,
2020), and “Fiduciary Duties Regarding Proxy Voting and Shareholder
Rights,” 85 Fed. Reg. 81658 (December 16, 2020);  
      (c)  assess — consistent with the Secretary of Labor’s oversight
responsibilities under the Federal Employees’ Retirement System Act of
1986 and in consultation with the Director of the National Economic
Council and the National Climate Advisor — how the Federal Retirement
Thrift Investment Board has taken environmental, social, and governance
factors, including climate-related financial risk, into account; and  
      (d)  within 180 days of the date of this order, submit to the
President, through the Director of the National Economic Council and the
National Climate Advisor, a report on the actions taken pursuant to
subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section.

Sec. 5.  Federal Lending, Underwriting, and Procurement*.*  In
furtherance of the policy set forth in section 1 of this order and
consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of
appropriations:  
      (a)  The Director of OMB and the Director of the National Economic
Council, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, shall
develop recommendations for the National Climate Task Force on
approaches related to the integration of climate-related financial risk
into Federal financial management and financial reporting, especially as
that risk relates to Federal lending programs.  The recommendations
should evaluate options to enhance accounting standards for Federal
financial reporting where appropriate and should identify any
opportunities to further encourage market adoption of such standards.  
      (b) The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, in consultation
with the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality and the heads of
other agencies as appropriate, shall consider amending the Federal
Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to:  
            (i)   require major Federal suppliers to publicly disclose
greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related financial risk and to set
science-based reduction targets; and  
            (ii)  ensure that major Federal agency procurements minimize
the risk of climate change, including requiring the social cost of
greenhouse gas emissions to be considered in procurement decisions and,
where appropriate and feasible, give preference to bids and proposals
from suppliers with a lower social cost of greenhouse gas emissions.  
      (c)  The Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Housing and
Urban Development, and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall consider
approaches to better integrate climate-related financial risk into
underwriting standards, loan terms and conditions, and asset management
and servicing procedures, as related to their Federal lending policies
and programs.  
      (d)  As part of the agency Climate Action Plans required by
section 211 of Executive Order 14008 of January 27, 2021 (Tackling the
Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad), and consistent with the interim
instructions for the Climate Action Plans issued by the Federal Chief
Sustainability Officer, heads of agencies must submit to the Director of
OMB, the National Climate Task Force, and the Federal Chief
Sustainability Officer actions to integrate climate-related financial
risk into their respective agency’s procurement process (subject to any
changes to the FAR arising out of the Federal Acquisition Regulatory
Council’s review pursuant to subsection (b) of this section).  The
Director of OMB and the Federal Chief Sustainability Officer shall
provide guidance to agencies on existing voluntary standards for use in
agencies’ plans.  
      (e)  In Executive Order 13690 of January 30, 2015 (Establishing a
Federal Flood Risk Management Standard and a Process for Further
Soliciting and Considering Stakeholder Input), a Federal Flood Risk
Management Standard (FFRMS) was established to address current and
future flood risk and ensure that projects funded with taxpayer dollars
last as long as intended.  Subsequently, the order was revoked by
Executive Order 13807 of August 15, 2017 (Establishing Discipline and
Accountability in the Environmental Review and Permitting Process for
Infrastructure Projects).  Executive Order 13690 is hereby reinstated,
thereby reestablishing the FFRMS.  The “Guidelines for Implementing
Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management, and Executive Order 13690,
Establishing a Federal Flood Risk Management Standard and a Process for
Further Soliciting and Considering Stakeholder Input” of October 8,
2015, were never revoked and thus remain in effect.

Sec. 6.  Long-Term Budget Outlook*.*  The Federal Government has broad
exposure to increased costs and lost revenue as a result of the impacts
of unmitigated climate change.  In furtherance of the policy set forth
in section 1 of this order and consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations:  
      (a)  The Director of OMB, in consultation with the Secretary of
the Treasury, the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, the
Director of the National Economic Council, and the National Climate
Advisor, shall identify the primary sources of Federal climate-related
financial risk exposure and develop methodologies to quantify climate
risk within the economic assumptions and the long-term budget
projections of the President’s Budget;  
      (b)  The Director of OMB and the Chair of the Council of Economic
Advisers, in consultation with the Director of the National Economic
Council, the National Climate Advisor, and the heads of other agencies
as appropriate, shall develop and publish annually, within the
President’s Budget, an assessment of the Federal Government’s climate
risk exposure; and  
      (c)  The Director of OMB shall improve the accounting of
climate-related Federal expenditures, where appropriate, and reduce the
Federal Government’s long-term fiscal exposure to climate-related
financial risk through formulation of the President’s Budget and
oversight of budget execution.

Sec. 7.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be
construed to impair or otherwise affect:  
            (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive
department or agency, or the head thereof; or  
            (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.  
            (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with
applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
            (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in
equity by any party against the United States, its departments,
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other
person.
