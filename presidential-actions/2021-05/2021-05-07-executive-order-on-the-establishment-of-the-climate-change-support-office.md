this order, the CCSO shall:

international fora, increasing international climate ambition, and
ensuring that climate change is integrated into all elements of United
States foreign policy-making decision processes;    
          (ii)   support efforts that go beyond the climate
work currently carried out by the Department of State across a wide
range of international fora that address clean energy, aviation,
shipping, the Artic, the ocean, sustainable development, and migration;
and  
          (iii)  perform such other functions related to the specific
project set forth in subsection 1(c) of this order as the Secretary may
assign.  
     (e)  The CCSO shall terminate at the end of the maximum period
permitted by section 3161(a)(1) of title 5, United States Code, unless
sooner terminated by the Secretary.
