title: "Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to\_Yemen"
---
 
On May 16, 2012, by Executive Order 13611, the President declared a
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the
United States constituted by the actions and policies of certain members
of the Government of Yemen and others that threatened Yemen’s peace,
security, and stability.  These actions include obstructing the
political process in Yemen and blocking implementation of the agreement
of November 23, 2011, between the Government of Yemen and those in
opposition to it, which provide for a peaceful transition of power that
meets the legitimate demands and aspirations of the Yemeni people.

The actions and policies of certain former members of the Government of
Yemen and others in threatening Yemen’s peace, security, and stability
continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national
security and foreign policy of the United States.  For this reason, the
national emergency declared on May 16, 2012, to deal with that threat
must continue in effect beyond May 16, 2021.  Therefore, in accordance
with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)),
I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive
Order 13611 with respect to Yemen.

This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and transmitted
to Congress.

                                    JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

   
THE WHITE HOUSE,  
May 11, 2021.
