title: Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to the Central
  African Republic
---
 
On May 12, 2014, by Executive Order 13667, the President declared a
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the
United States constituted by the situation in and in relation to the
Central African Republic, which has been marked by a breakdown of law
and order, intersectarian tension, widespread violence and atrocities,
and the pervasive, often forced recruitment and use of child soldiers,
which threatens the peace, security, or stability of the Central African
Republic and neighboring states.

The situation in and in relation to the Central African Republic
continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national
security and foreign policy of the United States.  For this reason, the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13667 on May 12, 2014, to
deal with that threat must continue in effect beyond May 12, 2021. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies
Act (50 U.S.C. 1662(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national
emergency declared with respect to the Central African Republic.

This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register *and transmitted
to the Congress.  
                                    

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.   

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
May 6, 2021.
