title: "Executive Order on the Revocation of Certain Presidential Actions and Technical\_\
  Amendment"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including sections 3301 and 3302
of title 5, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:

Section 1.  Revocation of Presidential Actions.  The following
Presidential actions are revoked:  Executive Order 13925 of May 28, 2020
(Preventing Online Censorship), Executive Order 13933 of June 26, 2020
(Protecting American Monuments, Memorials, and Statues and Combating
Recent Criminal Violence), Executive Order 13934 of July 3, 2020
(Building and Rebuilding Monuments to American Heroes), Executive
Order 13964 of December 10, 2020 (Rebranding United States Foreign
Assistance To Advance American Influence), Executive Order 13978 of
January 18, 2021 (Building the National Garden of American Heroes), and
Executive Order 13980 of January 18, 2021 (Protecting Americans From
Overcriminalization Through Regulatory Reform).

Sec. 2.  Implementation.  The Director of the Office of Management and
Budget and the heads of executive departments and agencies shall
promptly consider taking steps to rescind any orders, rules,
regulations, guidelines, or policies, or portions thereof, implementing
or enforcing the Presidential actions identified in section 1 of this
order, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, including the
Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 551 *et seq.*  In addition, any
personnel positions, committees, task forces, or other entities
established pursuant to the Presidential actions identified in section 1
of this order shall be abolished, as appropriate and consistent with
applicable law.

Sec. 3.  Technical Amendment.  To enhance the efficiency of the civil
service and to promote good administration and systematic application of
merit system principles, Executive Order 14003 of January 22, 2021
(Protecting the Federal Workforce), revoked Executive Order 13957 of
October 21, 2020 (Creating Schedule F in the Excepted Service), thereby
eliminating Schedule F in the excepted service.  In order to update the
civil service rules to reflect the action taken in Executive Order
14003, Civil Service Rule VI is amended as follows:  
     (a)   5 CFR 6.2 is amended to read:  
“OPM shall list positions that it excepts from the competitive service
in Schedules A, B, C, and D, and it shall list the position of
administrative law judge in Schedule E, which schedules shall constitute
parts of this rule, as follows:  
          Schedule A.  Positions other than those of a confidential or
policy-determining character for which it is not practicable to examine
shall be listed in Schedule A.  
          Schedule B.  Positions other than those of a confidential or
policy-determining character for which it is not practicable to hold a
competitive examination shall be listed in Schedule B.  Appointments to
these positions shall be subject to such noncompetitive examination as
may be prescribed by OPM.  
          Schedule C.  Positions of a confidential or policy-determining
character shall be listed in Schedule C.  
          Schedule D.  Positions other than those of a confidential or
policy-determining character for which the competitive service
requirements make impracticable the adequate recruitment of sufficient
numbers of students attending qualifying educational institutions or
individuals who have recently completed qualifying educational programs
shall be listed in Schedule D.  These positions are temporarily placed
in the excepted service to enable more effective recruitment from all
segments of society by using means of recruiting and assessing
candidates that diverge from the rules generally applicable to the
competitive service.  
          Schedule E.  Positions of administrative law judge appointed
under 5 U.S.C. 3105 shall be listed in Schedule E.  Conditions of good
administration warrant placing the position of administrative law judge
in the excepted service and exempting appointment to this position from
the requirements of 5 CFR, part 302, including examination and rating
requirements, though each agency shall follow the principle of veteran
preference as far as administratively feasible.”  
     (b)  5 CFR 6.4 is amended to read:  
     “Except as required by statute, the Civil Service Rules
and Regulations shall not apply to removals from positions listed in
Schedules A, C, D, or E, or from positions excepted from the competitive
service by statute.  The Civil Service Rules and Regulations shall apply
to removals from positions listed in Schedule B of persons who have
competitive status.”

Sec. 4.  General Provisions.   
     (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or
otherwise affect:  
          (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department
or agency, or the head thereof; or  
          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office
of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.  
     (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
