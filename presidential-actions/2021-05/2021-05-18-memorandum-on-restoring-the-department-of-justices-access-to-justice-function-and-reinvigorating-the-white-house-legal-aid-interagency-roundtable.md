title: "Memorandum on Restoring the Department of Justice\u2019s Access-to-Justice\
  \ Function and Reinvigorating the White House Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, and in order to increase
meaningful access to our legal system and an array of Federal programs,
it is hereby ordered as follows:  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 1.  Policy.</span> 
This Nation was founded on the ideal of equal justice under the law. 
Everyone in this country should be able to vindicate their rights and
avail themselves of the protections that our laws afford on equal
footing.  Whether we realize this ideal hinges on the extent to which
everyone in the United States has meaningful access to our legal
system.  Legal services are crucial to the fair and effective
administration of our laws and public programs, and the stability of our
society.  
  
Recognizing the importance of access to justice and the power of legal
aid, the Department of Justice (DOJ) in 2010 launched an
access-to-justice initiative.  In 2016, DOJ formally established the
Office for Access to Justice. This office worked in partnership with
other DOJ components to coordinate policy initiatives on topics
including criminal indigent defense, enforcement of fines and fees,
language barriers in access to the courts, and civil legal aid.  The DOJ
and the White House Domestic Policy Council also launched the Legal Aid
Interagency Roundtable (LAIR) in 2012 to work with civil legal aid
partners to advance Federal programs; create and disseminate tools to
provide information about civil legal aid and Federal funding
opportunities; and generate research to inform policy that improves
access to justice.    
  
The LAIR’s successes prompted President Obama to issue the memorandum of
September 24, 2015 (Establishment of the White House Legal Aid
Interagency Roundtable), which formally established LAIR as a White
House initiative.  Using the White House’s convening power, LAIR
examined innovative and evidence-based solutions for access to justice,
from medical-legal partnerships to improve health outcomes and decrease
health costs to better procedures in court hearings for individuals
representing themselves.  
  
But there is much more for the Federal Government to do.  According to a
2017 study by the Legal Services Corporation, low-income Americans
receive inadequate or no professional legal assistance with regard to
over 80 percent of the civil legal problems they face in a given year. 
All too often, unaddressed legal issues push people into poverty.  At
the same time, in the criminal legal system, those who cannot afford
private counsel often receive a lower-quality defense because public
defender caseloads are overburdened.  
  
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has further exposed and
exacerbated inequities in our justice system, as courts and legal
service providers have been forced to curtail in-person operations,
often without the resources or technology to offer remote-access or
other safe alternatives.  These access limitations have compounded the
effects of other harms wrought by the pandemic.  These problems have
touched the lives of many persons in this country, particularly
low-income people and people of color.  
  
With these immense and urgent challenges comes the opportunity to
strengthen access to justice in the 21st century.  Through funding,
interagency collaboration, and strategic partnerships, the Federal
Government can drive development of new approaches and best practices
that provide meaningful access to justice today, and into the future,
consistent with our foundational ideal of equal justice under the law.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 2.</span>  The Department
of Justice’s Access-to-Justice Function.   
     (a)  My Administration is committed to promoting equal access to
justice and addressing access limitations throughout the criminal and
civil legal systems.  The DOJ has a critical role to play in improving
the justice delivery systems that serve people who cannot afford
lawyers, and I am committed to reinvigorating that work.     
     (b)  The Attorney General shall consider expanding DOJ’s planning,
development, and coordination of access-to-justice policy initiatives,
including in the areas of criminal indigent defense, civil legal aid,
and pro bono legal services.  As soon as practicable, and no later than
120 days from the date of this memorandum, the Attorney General shall —
in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget
— submit a report to the President describing the Department’s plan
to expand its access-to-justice function, including the organizational
placement of this function within the Department, expected staffing and
budget, and, if necessary, the timeline for notifying the Congress of
any reorganization.   
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 3.</span>  Reinvigorating
the White House Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable.  My Administration is
committed to ensuring that all persons in this country enjoy the
protections and benefits of our legal system.  Reinvigorating LAIR as a
White House initiative is a key step in this direction.  Accordingly, I
direct as follows:  
  
     (a)  The LAIR is hereby reconvened as a White House initiative in
furtherance of the vision set forth in the memorandum of September 24,
2015, by which it was established and in light of today’s most pressing
challenges.  The September 2015 memorandum is superseded to the extent
that it is inconsistent with this memorandum.    
     (b)  The LAIR shall work across executive departments, agencies,
and offices to fulfill its mission, including to:  
          (i)    improve coordination among Federal programs, so that
programs are more efficient and produce better outcomes by including,
where appropriate, legal services among the range of supportive services
provided;  
          (ii)   increase the availability of meaningful access to
justice for individuals and families, regardless of wealth or status;  
          (iii)  develop policy recommendations that improve access to
justice in Federal, State, local, Tribal, and international
jurisdictions;  
          (iv)   assist the United States with implementation of Goal 16
of the United Nation’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to
promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development,
provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable, and
inclusive institutions at all levels; and  
          (v)    advance relevant evidence-based research,
data collection, and analysis of civil legal aid and indigent defense,
and promulgate best practices.  
     (c)  The Attorney General and the Counsel to the President, or
their designees, shall serve as the Co-Chairs of LAIR, which shall also
include a representative or designee from each of the following
executive departments, agencies, and offices:  
  
          (i)      the Department of State;  
          (ii)     the Department of the Treasury;

          (xiii)   the Department of Homeland Security;  
          (xiv)    the Environmental Protection Agency;  
          (xv)     the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission;

          (xviii)  the United States Agency for International
Development;  
          (xix)    the Administrative Conference of the United States;  
          (xx)     the National Science Foundation;  
          (xxi)    the United States Digital Service;  
          (xxii)   the Domestic Policy Council;  
          (xxiii)  the Office of the Vice President; and  
          (xxiv)   such other executive departments, agencies, and
offices as the Co-Chairs may, from time to time, invite to
participate.  
     (d)  The Co-Chairs shall invite the participation of the Bureau of
Consumer Financial Protection, the Federal Communications Commission,
the Federal Trade Commission, the Legal Services Corporation, and the
Social Security Administration, to the extent consistent with their
respective statutory authorities and legal obligations.  
     (e)  The LAIR shall report annually to the President on its
progress in fulfilling its mission.  The report shall include data from
participating members on the deployment of Federal resources to foster
this mission.  The LAIR’s 2021 report shall be due no later than 120
days from the date of this memorandum.  
     (f)  In light of the mission and function set forth in section 3(b)
of this memorandum, LAIR shall focus its first annual report on the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on access to justice in both the
criminal and civil legal systems.  Moreover, the first convening of LAIR
shall, at a minimum, address access-to-justice challenges the pandemic
has raised and work towards identifying technological and other
solutions that both meet these challenges and fortify the justice
system’s capacity to serve the public and be inclusive of all
communities.  
     (g)  The Attorney General shall designate an Executive Director of
LAIR who shall, as directed by the Co-Chairs, convene regular meetings
of LAIR and supervise its work.  The DOJ staff designated to support the
Department’s access-to-justice function under section 2 of this
memorandum shall serve as the staff of LAIR.  
     (h)  The DOJ shall, to the extent permitted by law and subject to
the availability of appropriations, provide administrative services,
funds, facilities, staff, equipment, and other support services as may
be necessary for LAIR to carry out its mission.  
     (i)  The LAIR shall hold meetings at least three times per year. 
In the course of its work, LAIR should conduct outreach to Federal,
State, local, Tribal, and international officials, technical advisors,
and nongovernmental organizations, among others, as necessary to carry
out its mission (including public defender organizations and offices and
legal aid organizations and providers).  
     (j)  The LAIR members are encouraged to provide support, including
by detailing personnel, to LAIR.  Members of LAIR shall serve without
any additional compensation for their work.

otherwise affect:

applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
