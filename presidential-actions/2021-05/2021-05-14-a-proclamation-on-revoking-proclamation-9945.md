title: "A Proclamation on Revoking Proclamation\_9945"
---
 
The suspension of entry imposed in Proclamation 9945 of October 4, 2019
(Suspension of Entry of Immigrants Who Will Financially Burden the
United States Healthcare System, in Order To Protect the Availability of
Healthcare Benefits for Americans), does not advance the interests of
the United States.  My Administration is committed to expanding access
to quality, affordable healthcare.  We can achieve that objective,
however, without barring the entry of noncitizens who seek to immigrate
lawfully to this country but who lack significant financial means or
have not purchased health insurance coverage from a restrictive list of
qualifying plans.  The suspension of entry imposed in Proclamation 9945
is also in tension with the policy set forth in section 1 of Executive
Order 14012 of February 2, 2021 (Restoring Faith in Our Legal
Immigration Systems and Strengthening Integration and Inclusion Efforts
for New Americans).

NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States,
by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the
United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the
Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), hereby
find that the unrestricted entry into the United States of noncitizen
immigrants based solely on the reasons articulated in Proclamation 9945
is not detrimental to the interests of the United States.  I therefore
hereby proclaim the following: 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 1.  Revocation.</span> 
Proclamation 9945 is revoked. 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 2.  Review of Agency
Actions.</span>  The Secretary of State, the Secretary of Health and
Human Services, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall review any
regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, and any other similar
agency actions developed pursuant to Proclamation 9945 and, as
appropriate, issue revised guidance consistent with the policy set forth
in this proclamation.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 3.  General
Provisions.</span>  
     (a)  Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to impair or
otherwise affect:   
          (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department
or agency, or the head thereof; or  
          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office
of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.  
     (b)  This proclamation shall be implemented consistent
with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
     (c)  This proclamation is not intended to, and does not, create any
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in
equity by any party against the United States, its departments,
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other
person.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-fifth.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
