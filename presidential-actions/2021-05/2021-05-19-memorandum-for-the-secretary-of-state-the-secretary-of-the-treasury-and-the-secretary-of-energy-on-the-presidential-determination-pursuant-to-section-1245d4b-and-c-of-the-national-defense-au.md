By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States, after carefully considering the reports
submitted to the Congress by the Energy Information Administration,
including the report submitted in February 2021, and other relevant
factors, including global economic conditions, increased oil production
by certain countries, the level of spare capacity, and the availability
of strategic reserves, I determine, pursuant to section 1245(d)(4)(B)
and (C) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012,
Public Law 112-81, and consistent with prior determinations, that there
is a sufficient supply of petroleum and petroleum products from
countries other than Iran to permit a significant reduction in the
volume of petroleum and petroleum products purchased from Iran by or
through foreign financial institutions.  
  
I will continue to monitor this situation closely.  
  
The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this
determination in the *Federal Register*.

  
                                JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
