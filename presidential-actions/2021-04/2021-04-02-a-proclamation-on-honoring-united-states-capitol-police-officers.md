title: A Proclamation on Honoring United States Capitol Police Officers
---
 
As a sign of respect for the service and sacrifice of the victims of the
attack at the United States Capitol on Friday, April 2, by the authority
vested in me as President of the United States by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order that the flag
of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and
upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval
stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the
District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its
Territories and possessions until sunset, April 6, 2021. I also direct
that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same length of time
at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other
facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels
and stations.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-fifth.  
                             

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
