CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO SOMALIA

On April 12, 2010, by Executive Order 13536, the President declared a
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the
United States constituted by the deterioration of the security situation
and the persistence of violence in Somalia, and acts of piracy and armed
robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, which have been the subject of
United Nations Security Council resolutions, and violations of the arms
embargo imposed by the United Nations Security Council.

On July 20, 2012, the President issued Executive Order 13620 to take
additional steps to deal with the national emergency declared in
Executive Order 13536 in view of United Nations Security Council
Resolution 2036 of February 22, 2012, and Resolution 2002 of July 29,
2011, and to address:  exports of charcoal from Somalia, which generate
significant revenue for al-Shabaab; the misappropriation of Somali
public assets; and certain acts of violence committed against civilians
in Somalia, all of which contribute to the deterioration of the security
situation and the persistence of violence in Somalia.

The situation with respect to Somalia continues to pose an unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the
United States.  For this reason, the national emergency declared on
April 12, 2010, and the measures adopted on that date and on July 20,
2012, to deal with that threat, must continue in effect beyond April 12,
2021.  Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13536.

This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and transmitted
to the Congress.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

April 1, 2021.
