title: "A Proclamation on National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day,\_2021"
---
 
Throughout our Nation’s history, those who have served in our Armed
Forces have steadfastly stood in defense of the United States and of
freedom throughout the world.  Although countless courageous service
members and civilians have given their lives for our Nation, more than
half a million others have sacrificed their own freedom as prisoners of
war so the cause of liberty always prevails.

Enduring with limitless dignity and determination, these former
prisoners of war are a powerful reminder that their indomitable spirit
could not be broken, even by brutal treatment in contravention of
international law and morality.  Despite the terrible suffering
inflicted upon them by their captors in harsh prisons and camps in
Europe and Asia, American prisoners of war steadfastly demonstrated
their devotion to duty, honor, and country.

On this day and every day, let us honor all who have borne the hardships
of captivity in service to our Nation, remember the brave men and women
who were held as prisoners in foreign lands during our Nation’s past
conflicts, and recognize those at home who anxiously awaited their loved
ones’ return.  Their faith in God, love of family, and trust in our
Nation are an inspiration to all Americans, and we will always remember
their sacrifices. 

NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States
of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 9, 2021, as
National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day.  I call upon all
Americans to observe this day by honoring the service and sacrifice of
all former prisoners of war as our Nation expresses its eternal
gratitude for their sacrifice.  I also call upon Federal, State, and
local government officials and organizations to observe this day with
appropriate ceremonies and activities.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of April,
in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the Independence
of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fifth.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
