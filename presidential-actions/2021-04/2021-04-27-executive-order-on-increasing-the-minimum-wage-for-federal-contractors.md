title: "Executive Order on Increasing the Minimum Wage for Federal\_Contractors"
---
 
 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and
Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 101 *et seq.*, and in order to
promote economy and efficiency in procurement by contracting with
sources that adequately compensate their workers, it is hereby ordered
as follows: 

     Section 1.  Policy.  This order promotes economy and efficiency in
Federal procurement by increasing the hourly minimum wage paid by the
parties that contract with the Federal Government to $15.00 for those
workers working on or in connection with a Federal Government contract
as described in section 8 of this order.  Raising the minimum wage
enhances worker productivity and generates higher-quality work by
boosting workers’ health, morale, and effort; reducing absenteeism and
turnover; and lowering supervisory and training costs.  Accordingly,
ensuring that Federal contractors pay their workers an hourly wage of at
least $15.00 will bolster economy and efficiency in Federal procurement.

     Sec. 2.  Increasing the Minimum Wage for Federal Contractors and
Subcontractors*.*  (a)  Executive departments and agencies, including
independent establishments subject to the Federal Property and
Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 102(4)(A), (5) (agencies), shall,
to the extent permitted by law, ensure that contracts and contract-like
instruments (as defined in regulations issued pursuant to section 4(a)
of this order and as described in section 8(a) of this order) include a
clause that the contractor and any covered subcontractors (as defined in
regulations issued pursuant to section 4(a) of this order) shall
incorporate into lower-tier subcontracts.  This clause shall specify
that, as a condition of payment, the minimum wage to be paid to workers
employed in the performance of the contract or any covered subcontract
thereunder, including workers whose wages are calculated pursuant to
special certificates issued under section 14(c) of the Fair Labor
Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 214(c)), shall be at least:    
          (i) $15.00 per hour, beginning January 30, 2022; and  
(ii) beginning January 1, 2023, and annually thereafter, an amount
determined by the Secretary of Labor (Secretary).The amount shall be
published by the Secretary at least 90 days before such new minimum wage
is to take effect and shall be:  
          (A)  not less than the amount in effect on the date of such
determination;  
          (B)  increased from such amount by the annual percentage
increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical
Workers (United States city average, all items, not seasonally
adjusted), or its successor publication, as determined by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics; and  
          (C)  rounded to the nearest multiple of $0.05.  
(b)  In calculating the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price
Index for purposes of subsection (a)(ii)(B) of this section, the
Secretary shall compare such Consumer Price Index for the most recent
month, quarter, or year available (as selected by the Secretary prior to
the first year for which a minimum wage is in effect pursuant to
subsection (a)(ii)(B) of this section) with the Consumer Price Index for
the same month in the preceding year, the same quarter in the preceding
year, or the preceding year, respectively.  
(c)  Nothing in this order shall excuse noncompliance with any
applicable Federal or State prevailing wage law, or any applicable law
or municipal ordinance establishing a minimum wage higher than the
minimum wage established under this order.

     Sec. 3.  Application to Tipped Workers.  (a)  For workers covered
under section 2 of this order who are tipped employees pursuant to
section 3(t) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 203(t)),
the cash wage that must be paid by an employer to such workers shall be
at least:   
          (i)    $10.50 per hour, beginning January 30, 2022;  
          (ii)   beginning January 1, 2023, 85 percent of the wage in
effect under section 2 of this order, rounded to the nearest multiple of
$0.05; and  
          (iii)  beginning January 1, 2024, and for each subsequent
year, 100 percent of the wage in effect under section 2 of this order.  
     (b)  Where workers do not receive a sufficient additional amount on
account of tips, when combined with the hourly cash wage paid by the
employer, such that their wages are equal to the minimum wage under
section 2 of this order, the cash wage paid by the employer, as set
forth in this section for those workers, shall be increased such that
their wages equal the minimum wage under section 2 of this order. 
Consistent with applicable law, if the wage required to be paid under
the Service Contract Act, 41 U.S.C. 6701 *et seq.*, or any other
applicable law or regulation is higher than the wage required under
section 2 of this order, the employer shall pay additional cash wages
sufficient to meet the highest wage required to be paid.

     Sec. 4.  Regulations and Implementation.  (a)  The Secretary shall,
consistent with applicable law, issue regulations by November 24, 2021,
to implement the requirements of this order.  Such regulations shall
include both definitions of relevant terms and, as appropriate,
exclusions from the requirements of this order.  Within 60 days of the
Secretary issuing such regulations, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory
Council, to the extent permitted by law, shall amend the
Federal Acquisition Regulation to provide for inclusion in Federal
procurement solicitations, contracts, and contract-like instruments
subject to this order the clause described in section 2(a) of this
order.  
     (b)  Within 60 days of the Secretary issuing regulations pursuant
to subsection (a) of this section, agencies shall take steps, to the
extent permitted by law, to exercise any applicable authority to ensure
that contracts and contract-like instruments as described in sections
8(a)(i)(C) and (D) of this order, entered into on or after January 30,
2022, consistent with the effective date of such agency action, comply
with the requirements set forth in sections 2 and 3 of this order.   
     (c)  Any regulations issued pursuant to this section should, to the
extent practicable, incorporate existing definitions, principles,
procedures, remedies, and enforcement processes under the Fair Labor
Standards Act of 1938. 29 U.S.C. 201 *et seq.*; the Service Contract
Act, 41 U.S.C. 6701 *et seq.*; the Davis-Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C. 3141 *et
seq.*; Executive Order 13658 of February 12, 2014 (Establishing a
Minimum Wage for Contractors); and regulations issued to implement that
order.

     Sec. 5.  Enforcement.  (a)  The Secretary shall have the authority
for investigating potential violations of and obtaining compliance with
this order.  
     (b)  This order creates no rights under the Contract Disputes Act,
41 U.S.C. 7101 *et seq.*, and disputes regarding whether a contractor
has paid the wages prescribed by this order, as appropriate and
consistent with applicable law, shall be disposed of only as provided by
the Secretary in regulations issued pursuant to this order.

     Sec. 6.  Revocation of Certain Presidential Actions.  Executive
Order 13838 of May 25, 2018 (Exemption From Executive Order 13658 for
Recreational Services on Federal Lands), is revoked as of January 30,
2022.  Executive Order 13658 of February 12, 2014 (Establishing a
Minimum Wage for Contractors), is superseded, as of January 30, 2022, to
the extent it is inconsistent with this order.     
  
     Sec. 7.  Severability*.*  If any provision of this order, or the
application of any provision of this order to any person or
circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and its
application to any other person or circumstance shall not be affected
thereby. 

     Sec. 8.  Applicability*.*  (a)  This order shall apply to any new
contract; new contract-like instrument; new solicitation; extension or
renewal of an existing contract or contract-like instrument; and
exercise of an option on an existing contract or contract-like
instrument, if (i):    
          (A)  it is a procurement contract or contract-like instrument
for services or construction;  
          (B)  it is a contract or contract-like instrument for services
covered by the Service Contract Act;  
          (C)  it is a contract or contract-like instrument for
concessions, including any concessions contract excluded by Department
of Labor regulations at 29 C.F.R. 4.133(b); or  
          (D)  it is a contract or contract-like instrument entered into
with the Federal Government in connection with Federal property or lands
and related to offering services for Federal employees, their
dependents, or the general public; and  
     (ii)  the wages of workers under such contract or contract-like
instrument are governed by the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Service
Contract Act, or the Davis-Bacon Act.  
     (b)  For contracts or contract-like instruments covered by the
Service Contract Act or the Davis-Bacon Act, this order shall apply only
to contracts or contract-like instruments at the thresholds specified in
those statutes.  Where workers’ wages are governed by the Fair Labor

section 4 of this order.  
     (c)  This order shall not apply to grants; contracts, contract-like
instruments, or agreements with Indian Tribes under the Indian

amended; or any contracts or contract-like instruments expressly
excluded by the regulations issued pursuant to section 4(a) of this
order.

     Sec. 9.  Effective Date*.*  (a)  This order is effective
immediately and shall apply to new contracts; new contract-like
instruments; new solicitations; extensions or renewals of existing
contracts or contract-like instruments; and exercises of options on
existing contracts or contract-like instruments, as described in section
8(a) in this order, where the relevant contract or contract-like
instrument will be entered into, the relevant contract or contract-like
instrument will be extended or renewed, or the relevant option will be
exercised, on or after:   
          (i)   January 30, 2022, consistent with the effective date for
the action taken by the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council pursuant
to section 4(a) of this order; or  
          (ii)  for contracts where an agency action is taken pursuant
to section 4(b) of this order, January 30, 2022, consistent with the
effective date for such action.  
     (b)  As an exception to subsection (a) of this section, where
agencies have issued a solicitation before the effective date for the
relevant action taken pursuant to section 4 of this order and entered
into a new contract or contract-like instrument resulting from such
solicitation within 60 days of such effective date, such agencies are
strongly encouraged but not required to ensure that the minimum wages
specified in sections 2 and 3 of this order are paid in the new contract
or contract-like instrument.  But if that contract or contract-like
instrument is subsequently extended or renewed, or an option is
subsequently exercised under that contract or contract-like instrument,
the minimum wages specified in sections 2 and 3 of this order shall
apply to that extension, renewal, or option.  
     (c)  For all existing contracts and contract-like instruments,
solicitations issued between the date of this order and the effective
dates set forth in this section, and contracts and contract-like
instruments entered into between the date of this order and the
effective dates set forth in this section, agencies are strongly
encouraged, to the extent permitted by law, to ensure that the hourly
wages paid under such contracts or contract-like instruments are
consistent with the minimum wages specified in sections 2 and 3 of this
order.

     Sec. 10.  General Provisions*.*  (a)  Nothing in this order shall

or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
