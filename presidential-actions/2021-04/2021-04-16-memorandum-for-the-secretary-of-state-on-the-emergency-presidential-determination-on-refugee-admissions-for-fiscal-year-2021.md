title: "Memorandum for the Secretary of State on the Emergency Presidential Determination\
  \ on Refugee Admissions for Fiscal Year\_2021"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, in accordance with section 207(b)
of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the “Act”) (8 U.S.C. 1157(b)),
and after appropriate consultation with the Congress, I have determined
that subsequent to the signing of Presidential Determination 2021-02 on
October 27, 2020 (Presidential Determination on Refugee Admissions for
Fiscal Year 2021) (PD 2021-02), an unforeseen emergency refugee
situation now exists due to new or increasing political violence,
repression, atrocities, or humanitarian crises in countries including
Burma, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Hong Kong and
Xinjiang (China), South Sudan, Syria, and Venezuela, as well as changing
conditions caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.  I have
further determined that the allocation of admissions among refugees of
humanitarian concern set forth in PD 2021-02 prevents the United States
Refugee Admissions Program from responding to this unforeseen emergency
refugee situation.  I hereby make the following determinations and
direct the following actions:  
  
     (a)  In response to the emergency refugee situation, the Fiscal
Year (FY) 2021 allocation of admissions among refugees of humanitarian
concern to the United States shall be revised as set forth in section
(b) of this determination.  This action is justified by grave
humanitarian concerns and is otherwise in the national interest.
 Further, the admission of refugees affected by the emergency refugee
situation cannot be accomplished under section 207(a) of the Act.  
  
     (b)  The revised allocations for FY 2021 are as follows:  
  
          Africa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  7,000  
          East Asia . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,000  
          Europe and Central Asia . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,500  
          Latin America and the Caribbean . . . . . . . . 3,000  
          Near East and South Asia . . . . . . . . . . .  1,500  
          Unallocated Reserve . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,000  
  
The Secretary of State, upon notification to the Judiciary Committees of
the Congress, is authorized to use the unallocated reserve where the
need for additional admissions arises and to transfer unused allocations
from a particular category to one or more other categories, if there is
a need for greater admissions for the category or categories to which
the allocations are being transferred.  
  
     (c)  In accordance with section 101(a)(42)(B) of the Act (8 U.S.C.
1101(a)(42)(B)), and after appropriate consultation with the Congress, I
specify that, for FY 2021, the following persons may, if otherwise
qualified, be considered refugees for the purpose of admission to the
United States within their countries of nationality or habitual
residence:  
          (i)    Persons in Cuba;  
          (ii)   Persons in Eurasia and the Baltics;  
          (iii)  Persons in Iraq;   
          (iv)   Persons in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador;  
          (v)    In special circumstances, persons identified by a
United States Embassy in any location or initially referred to the
Federal Government by a designated non-governmental organization.  
  
     (d)  The admission of up to 15,000 refugees remains justified by
humanitarian concerns and is otherwise in the national interest.  Should
15,000 admissions under the revised allocations for FY 2021 be reached
prior to the end of the fiscal year and the emergency refugee situation
persists, a subsequent Presidential Determination may be issued to
increase admissions, as appropriate.

     (e)  Refugee resettlement pursuant to this determination shall be
consistent with the requirements of Executive Order 14013 of February 4,
2021 (Rebuilding and Enhancing Programs to Resettle Refugees and
Planning for the Impact of Climate Change on Migration).

     (f)  Consistent with section 2(b)(2) of the Migration and Refugee
Assistance Act of 1962 (22 U.S.C. 2601(b)(2)), I hereby determine that
assistance to or on behalf of persons applying for admission to the
United States as part of the overseas refugee admissions program will
contribute to the foreign policy interests of the United States and
designate such persons for the purpose of that provision.  

     (g)  This determination supersedes PD 2021-02 of October 27, 2020.

     (h)  You are authorized and directed to publish this determination
in the *Federal Register.*

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
