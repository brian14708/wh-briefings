title: "Executive Order on Worker Organizing and\_Empowerment"
---
 
    By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as
follows:

     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 1.  Policy and
Findings</span>*.*  The National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151)
proclaims that the policy of the United States is to encourage worker
organizing and collective bargaining and to promote equality of
bargaining power between employers and employees.  In the Federal
Service Labor‑Management Relations Statute (5 U.S.C. 7101(a)(1)), the
Congress found that “experience in both private and public employment
indicates that the statutory protection of the right of employees to
organize, bargain collectively, and participate through labor
organizations of their own choosing in decisions which affect them . . .
safeguards the public interest, . . . contributes to the effective
conduct of public business, and . . . facilitates and encourages the
amicable settlements of disputes between employees and their employers
involving conditions of employment.” 

     In the past few decades, the Federal Government has not used its
full authority to promote and implement this policy of support for
workers organizing unions and bargaining collectively with their
employers.  During this period, economic change in the United States and
globally, technological developments, and the failure to modernize
Federal organizing and labor-management relations laws to respond
appropriately to the reality found in American workplaces, have made
worker organizing exceedingly difficult.

     The result has been a steady decline in union density in the United
States and the loss of worker power and voice in workplaces and
communities across the country.  This decline has had a host of negative
consequences for American workers and the economy, including weakening
and shrinking America’s middle class.  Meanwhile, some workers have been
excluded from opportunities to organize unions and bargain collectively
with their employers by law or practice, and so have never been able to
build meaningful economic power or have a voice in their workplaces.

     Confirming the policies declared in Federal labor laws, substantial
evidence shows that union membership increases wages, the likelihood of
receiving employer-provided benefits, and job security.  Union
membership also gives workers the means to build the power to ensure
that their voices are heard in their workplaces, their communities, and
in the Nation.

     Therefore, it is the policy of my Administration to encourage
worker organizing and collective bargaining.

     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 2.  Task Force on
Worker Organizing and Empowerment.</span>  There is hereby established
within the Executive Office of the President the Task Force on Worker
Organizing and Empowerment (Task Force).  
     (a)  The Vice President shall serve as Chair of the Task Force.  In

     (b)  The Task Force and its members shall identify executive branch
policies, practices, and programs that could be used, consistent with
applicable law, to promote my Administration’s policy of support
for worker power, worker organizing, and collective bargaining.  This
identification shall include policies, practices, and programs that
could be used to promote worker power in areas of the country
with hostile labor laws, for marginalized workers (including women and
persons of color) and hard-to-organize industries, and in changing
industries.  The Task Force and its members also shall identify
statutory, regulatory, or other changes that may be necessary to make
policies, practices, and programs more effective means of supporting
worker organizing and collective bargaining.  
     (c)  The functions of the Task Force are advisory in nature only;
the purpose of the Task Force is to make recommendations regarding
changes to policies, practices, programs, and other changes that would
serve the objectives of this order.  
     (d)  The Task Force should invite the National Labor Relations
Board, the Federal Labor Relations Authority, the National Mediation
Board, and other executive agencies, boards, and commissions with
responsibility for implementing laws concerning worker organizing and
collective bargaining to consult, as appropriate and consistent with
applicable law, with the Task Force.  
     (e)  The Chair may establish such sub‑committees or other working
groups composed of Task Force members or their representatives as may be
necessary to accomplish the objectives of this order.  
     (f)  Consistent with the objectives of this order and applicable
law, the Task Force may gather relevant information from labor
organizations, other worker advocates, academic and other experts, and
other entities and persons it identifies that will assist the Task Force
in accomplishing the objectives of this order.   
     (g)  The Task Force shall, within 180 days of the date of this
order, submit to the President recommendations for actions as described
in subsection (b) of this section to promote worker organizing and
collective bargaining in the public and private sectors, and to increase
union density.  The Task Force may, at the Chair’s discretion, recommend
appropriate or time-sensitive individual actions to promote worker
organizing and collective bargaining before the deadline established by
this section.  The Task Force and its members shall work to implement
all recommendations that the President may approve, to the extent
permitted by law, and shall report their progress as directed by the
Chair.
