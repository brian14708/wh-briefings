title: "Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to Hostage-Taking\
  \ and the Wrongful Detention of United\_States Nationals\_Abroad"
---
 
On July 19, 2022, by Executive Order 14078, the President declared a
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) to deal with the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and
economy of the United States constituted by hostage-taking and the
wrongful detention of United States nationals abroad. 

Hostage-taking and the wrongful detention of United States nationals are
heinous acts that undermine the rule of law.  Terrorist organizations,
criminal groups, and other malicious actors who take hostages for
financial, political, or other gain — as well as foreign states that
engage in the practice of wrongful detention, including for political
leverage or to seek concessions from the United States — threaten the
integrity of the international political system and the safety of United
States nationals and other persons abroad.  Hostage-taking and the
wrongful detention of United States nationals abroad continue to pose an
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign
policy, and economy of the United States.  For this reason, the national
emergency declared in Executive Order 14078 of July 19, 2022, must
continue in effect beyond July 19, 2023.  Therefore, in accordance with
section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am
continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order
14078 with respect to hostage-taking and the wrongful detention of
United States nationals abroad.

     This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and
transmitted to the Congress.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
 June 20, 2023.
