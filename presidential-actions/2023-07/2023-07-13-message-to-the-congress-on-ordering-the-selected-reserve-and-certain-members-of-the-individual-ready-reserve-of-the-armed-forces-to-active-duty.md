In accordance with section 12304(f) of title 10, United States Code, I
am providing notice that I have authorized the Secretary of Defense and
the Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to the Coast Guard when
it is not operating as a service in the Department of the Navy, to order
to active duty members and units of the Selected Reserve and
appropriately designated Individual Ready Reserve members, without the
consent of the member concerned, pursuant to 12304(a) of title 10,
United States Code.  Reserve mobilizations under this authorization are
not to exceed 3,000 total members at any one time, of whom not more than
450 may be members of the Individual Ready Reserve.  These Reserve
Component forces are to augment the active forces for Operation Atlantic
Resolve to enhance the United States’ ability to sustain its heightened
level of presence and operations in support of United States European
Command.

A copy of the Executive Order I have issued is enclosed.
