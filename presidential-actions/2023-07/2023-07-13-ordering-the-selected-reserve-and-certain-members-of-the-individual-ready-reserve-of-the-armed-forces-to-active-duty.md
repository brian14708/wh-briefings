title: "Ordering the Selected Reserve and Certain Members of the Individual Ready\
  \ Reserve of the Armed Forces to Active\_Duty"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including sections 121 and 12304
of title 10, United States Code, I hereby determine that it is necessary
to augment the active Armed Forces of the United States for the
effective conduct of Operation Atlantic Resolve in and around the
United States European Command’s area of responsibility.  In furtherance
of this operation, under the stated authority, I hereby authorize the
Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Homeland Security with
respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the
Navy, under their respective jurisdictions, to order to active duty any
units, and any individual members not assigned to a unit organized to
serve as a unit of the Selected Reserve, or any member in the Individual
Ready Reserve mobilization category and designated as essential under
regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, not to exceed 3,000
total members at any one time, of whom not more than 450 may be members
of the Individual Ready Reserve, as they deem necessary, and to
terminate the service of those units and members ordered to active duty.

     This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
