Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of South Dakota and ordered Federal assistance to
supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas
affected by flooding from April 9 to May 5, 2023.

Federal funding is available to state, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the flooding in the counties of Brown, Clark,
Codington, Day, Faulk, Grant, Hand, Marshall, Potter, and Roberts and
the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate of the Lake Traverse Reservation.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures in all areas within the state.

Kenneth G. Clark of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has
been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the affected
areas.

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
