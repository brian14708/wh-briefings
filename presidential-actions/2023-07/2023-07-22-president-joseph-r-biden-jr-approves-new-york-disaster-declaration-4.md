Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of New York and ordered Federal assistance to
supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas
affected by severe storms and flooding from July 9 to July 10, 2023.  
  
Federal funding is available to state, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the severe storms and flooding in the counties of
Clinton, Dutchess, Essex, Hamilton, Ontario, Orange, Putnam, and
Rockland.  
  
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.  
  
Lai Sun Yee of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has been
appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the affected
areas.   
  
Damage assessments are continuing in other areas, and more counties and
additional forms of assistance may be designated after the assessments
are fully completed.
