title: 'Press Release: Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect
  to Transnational Criminal Organizations'
---
 
On July 24, 2011, by Executive Order 13581, the President declared a
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) to deal with the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and
economy of the United States constituted by the activities of
significant transnational criminal organizations.

On March 15, 2019, by Executive Order 13863, the President took
additional steps to deal with the national emergency with respect to
significant transnational criminal organizations in view of the
evolution of these organizations as well as the increasing
sophistication of their activities, which threaten international
political and economic systems and pose a direct threat to the safety
and welfare of the United States and its citizens, and given the ability
of these organizations to derive revenue through widespread illegal
conduct, including acts of violence and abuse that exhibit a wanton
disregard for human life as well as many other crimes enriching and
empowering these organizations.

Significant transnational criminal organizations continue to pose an
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign
policy, and economy of the United States.  For these reasons, the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13581 on July 24, 2011,
under which additional steps were taken in Executive Order 13863 on
March 15, 2019, must continue in effect beyond July 24, 2023. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national
emergency with respect to significant transnational criminal
organizations declared in Executive Order 13581.

This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and transmitted
to the Congress.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

    July 19, 2023.
