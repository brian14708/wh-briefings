By virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United
States of America (the “President”), I hereby grant permission, subject
to the conditions set forth herein, to the General Services
Administration (the “permittee”) to expand and continue to operate and
maintain a vehicular and pedestrian crossing at the Calexico East Land
Port of Entry to Mexico located on the United States border with Mexico
in Calexico, California, as described in the “Application for
Presidential Permit Calexico East Land Port of Entry” dated December 19,
2022 (“December 19, 2022, Application”), by the permittee to the
Secretary of State in accordance with Executive Order 13867 and
associated procedures.  
   
     The term “Facilities” as used in this permit means the portion in
the United States of the bridge over the All-American Canal and
crossing, including two additional commercial and two additional
noncommercial lanes to be constructed at the Calexico East Land Port of
Entry, and any land, structures, installations, or equipment appurtenant
thereto located between the international boundary between the United
States and Mexico and a line approximately 1,066 feet north of the
international boundary.  
   
     This permit is subject to the following conditions:  
   
     Article 1.  The Facilities herein described and all aspects of
their operation are subject to all the conditions, provisions, and
requirements of this permit and any subsequent Presidential amendment to
it.  The construction, operation, and maintenance of the Facilities
shall be in all material respects as described in the December 19, 2022,
Application.  
   
     Article 2.  The standards for and the manner of construction,
connection, operation, and maintenance of the Facilities are subject to
inspection by the representatives of appropriate Federal, State, and
local agencies.  The permittee shall grant officers and employees of
such agencies that are duly authorized and performing their official
duties free and unrestricted access to said Facilities.  
     Article 3.  The permittee shall comply with all applicable Federal
laws and regulations regarding the construction, operation, and
maintenance of the Facilities.   
   
     Article 4.  The permittee shall immediately notify the President or
his designee of any decision to transfer custody and control of the
Facilities or any part thereof to any other agency or department of the
United States Government.  Said notice shall identify the transferee
agency or department and seek the approval of the President for the
transfer of the permit.  In the event of approval by the President of
such transfer, this permit shall remain in force and effect, and the
Facilities shall be subject to all the conditions, permissions, and
requirements of this permit and any amendments thereof.  The permittee
may transfer ownership or control of the Facilities to a non-Federal
entity or individual only upon the prior express approval of such
transfer by the President, which approval may include such conditions,
permissions, and requirements that the President, in his discretion,
determines are appropriate and necessary for inclusion in the permit, to
be effective on the date of transfer.  
   
     Article 5.  The permittee is responsible for acquiring and
maintaining any right-of-way grants or easements, permits, and other
authorizations as may become necessary or appropriate.  To ensure the
safe operation of the Facilities, the permittee shall maintain them and
every part of them in a condition of good repair and in compliance with
applicable law and use of best management practices.  
   
     Article 6.  (1)  The permittee shall take or cause to be taken all
appropriate measures to mitigate adverse impacts on or disruption of the
human environment in connection with the construction, operation, and
maintenance of the Facilities.  Mitigation measures are those that
avoid, minimize, or compensate for adverse impacts.  
   
     The permittee is responsible for obtaining any required Federal,
State, and local permits, approvals, and authorizations prior to
commencing construction activities.  The permittee shall implement the
mitigation identified in any environmental decision documents prepared
in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act and Federal
permits, including stormwater permits and permits issued in accordance
with section 402 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1342).  The permittee
shall comply with applicable Federal, State, and local environmental
laws.  
   
     (2)  Before initiating construction, the permittee shall obtain the
concurrence of the United States Section of the International Boundary
and Water Commission, United States and Mexico.  
   
     Article 7.  The permittee shall file any applicable statements and
reports required by applicable Federal law in connection with the
Facilities.  
   
     Article 8.  Upon request, the permittee shall provide appropriate
information to the President or his designee with regard to the
Facilities.  Such requests could include requests for information
concerning current conditions, environmental compliance, mitigation, or
anticipated changes in ownership or control, construction, connection,
operation, or maintenance of the Facilities.  
   
     Article 9.  The permittee shall not initiate construction until the
Department of State has provided notification to the permittee that the
Department has completed its exchange of diplomatic notes with the
Government of Mexico regarding authorization.  The permittee shall
provide written notification to the President or his designee at the
time that the construction authorized by this permit begins, at such
time as such construction is completed, interrupted, or discontinued,
and at other times as may be requested by the President.  
   
     Article 10.  The permittee shall make no substantial change to the
Facilities, in the location of the Facilities, or in the operation
authorized by this permit unless such changes have been approved by the
President.  The President may terminate, revoke, or amend this permit at
any time at his sole discretion.  The permittee’s obligation to
implement any amendment to this permit is subject to the availability of
funds.  If the permittee permanently closes the Calexico East Land Port
of Entry and it is no longer used as an international crossing, then
this permit shall terminate, and the permittee may manage, utilize, or
dispose of the Facilities in accordance with its statutory authorities. 
This permit shall continue in full force and effect for only so long as
the permittee continues the operations hereby authorized.  This permit
shall expire 10 years from the date of its issuance if the permittee has
not commenced construction of the Facilities by that date.  
   
     Article 11.  This permit is not intended to, and does not, create
any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or
in equity by any party against the United States, its departments,
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other
person.  
   
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United
States of America, have hereunto set my hand this  
sixth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-three,
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred
and forty-eighth.  
   
   
 

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
