title: "Press Release: Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect\
  \ to\_Lebanon"
---
 
On August 1, 2007, by Executive Order 13441, the President declared a
national emergency with respect to Lebanon pursuant to the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq*.) to deal with
the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and
foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions of
certain persons to undermine Lebanon’s legitimate and democratically
elected government or democratic institutions; to contribute to the
deliberate breakdown in the rule of law in Lebanon, including through
politically motivated violence and intimidation; to reassert Syrian
control or contribute to Syrian interference in Lebanon; or to infringe
upon or undermine Lebanese sovereignty contribute to political
and economic instability in that country and the region.

Certain ongoing activities, such as Iran’s continuing arms transfers to
Hizballah — which include increasingly sophisticated weapons systems —
serve to undermine Lebanese sovereignty, contribute to political and
economic instability in the region, and continue to constitute an
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign
policy of the United States.  For this reason, the national emergency
declared on August 1, 2007, must continue in effect beyond August 1,
2023.  Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the
national emergency with respect to Lebanon declared in Executive Order
13441.

This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register *and transmitted
to the Congress.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
 July 21, 2023.
