affected by flooding from April 10 to May 6, 2023.

Federal funding is available to state, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the flooding in the counties of Barnes, Burke,
Dickey, Dunn, Golden Valley, Grand Forks, Hettinger, LaMoure, McHenry,
Mercer, Morton, Mountrail, Nelson, Pembina, Ransom, Richland, Sargent,
