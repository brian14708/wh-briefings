Dear Mr. Speaker:   (Dear Madam President:)  
  
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to the situation in
Mali declared in Executive Order 13882 of July 26, 2019, is to continue
in effect beyond July 26, 2023.  
  
The situation in Mali, including repeated violations of ceasefire
arrangements made pursuant to the 2015 Agreement on Peace and
Reconciliation in Mali; the expansion of terrorist activities into
southern and central Mali; the intensification of drug trafficking and
trafficking in persons, human rights abuses, and hostage-taking; a
further coup d’etat; the presence of foreign mercenaries threatening
peace, security, and stability; and the intensification of attacks
against civilians, the Malian defense and security forces, the United
Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali
(MINUSMA), and international security presences, continues to pose an
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign
policy of the United States.  Therefore, I have determined that it is
necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order
13882 with respect to the situation in Mali.

                               Sincerely,  

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
