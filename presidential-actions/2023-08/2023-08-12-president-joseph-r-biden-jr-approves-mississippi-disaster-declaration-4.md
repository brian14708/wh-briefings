title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Approves Mississippi Disaster\_Declaration"
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Mississippi and ordered Federal assistance to
supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas
affected by severe storms, straight-line winds, and tornadoes from June
14 to June 19, 2023.  
  
The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in the counties of Jackson and Jasper.  
  
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.  
  
Federal funding also is available to state, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the severe storms, straight-line winds, and
tornadoes in the counties of Claiborne, Copiah, Covington, Jackson,
Jasper, Jefferson, Jefferson Davis, Lawrence, Leake, Neshoba, Newton,
Rankin, Scott, Simpson, Smith, and Wayne and the Mississippi Band of
Choctaw Indians.  
  
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures in all areas within the state.  
  
Darryl L. Dragoo of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has
been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the affected
areas.   
  
Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.  
  
Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance at
[www.DisasterAssistance.gov](https://www.disasterassistance.gov/), by
calling 800-621-FEMA (3362), or by using the [FEMA
App](https://www.ready.gov/fema-app). Anyone using a relay service, such
as video relay service (VRS), captioned telephone service or others, can
give FEMA the number for that service.
