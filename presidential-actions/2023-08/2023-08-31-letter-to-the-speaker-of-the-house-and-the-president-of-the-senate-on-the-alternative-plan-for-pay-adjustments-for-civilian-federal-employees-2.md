title: "Letter to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate on the\
  \ Alternative Plan for Pay Adjustments for Civilian Federal\_Employees"
---
 
Dear Mr. Speaker:   (Dear Madam President:)  
  
I am transmitting an alternative plan for pay adjustments for civilian
Federal employees covered by the General Schedule and certain other pay
systems in January 2024.  
  
Title 5, United States Code, authorizes me to implement alternative
plans for pay adjustments for civilian Federal employees covered by the
General Schedule and certain other pay systems if, because of “national
emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare,”
I view the increases that would otherwise take effect as
inappropriate.  
  
Accordingly, I have determined that it is appropriate to exercise my
authority to set alternative pay adjustments for 2024 pursuant to
5 U.S.C. 5303(b) and 5 U.S.C. 5304a.  
  
Specifically, I have determined that for 2024, the across-the-board base
pay increase will be 4.7 percent and locality pay increases will average
0.5 percent, resulting in an overall average increase of 5.2 percent for
civilian Federal employees, consistent with the assumption in my 2024
Budget.  
  
We must attract, recruit, and retain a skilled workforce with fair
compensation in order to keep our Government running, deliver services,
and meet our Nation’s challenges today and tomorrow.  This alternative
pay plan decision will continue to allow the Federal Government to
employ a well‑qualified Federal workforce on behalf of the American
people, keeping pace with prior wage growth in the labor market.  
  
The adjustment described above shall take effect on the first day of the
first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2024.

                                                             Sincerely,

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
