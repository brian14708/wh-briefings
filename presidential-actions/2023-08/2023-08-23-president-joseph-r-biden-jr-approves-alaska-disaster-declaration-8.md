title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Approves Alaska Disaster\_Declaration"
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Alaska and ordered Federal assistance to
supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas
affected by flooding from May 12 to June 3, 2023.

The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in the Copper River Regional Educational Attendance Area
(REAA), Kuspuk REAA, Lower Kuskokwim REAA, Lower Yukon REAA, and Yukon
Flats REAA.

Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.

Federal funding also is available to state, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the flooding in the Bering Strait School REAA,
Copper River REAA, Kuspuk REAA, Lower Yukon REAA, and Yukon Flats REAA.

Lastly, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Lance E. Davis of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has
been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the affected
areas. 

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.

Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance at
[www.DisasterAssistance.gov](/SHARE/FORMATS/DHS%200303/Expedited%20Requests%2003.02.21/www.DisasterAssistance.gov),
by calling 800-621-FEMA (3362), or by using the [FEMA
