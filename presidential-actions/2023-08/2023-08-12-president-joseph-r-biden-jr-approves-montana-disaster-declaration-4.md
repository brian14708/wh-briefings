Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Montana and ordered Federal assistance to
supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas
affected by flooding from April 10 to April 26, 2023.  
  
Federal funding is available to state, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the flooding in the counties of Blaine, Daniels,
Hill, Park, Roosevelt, Sheridan, and Valley and the Fort Peck Tribes.  
  
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.  
  
Jon Huss of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has been
appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the affected
areas.   
  
Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
