title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Approves Hawaii Disaster\_Declaration"
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Hawaii and ordered Federal aid to supplement
state and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by wildfires
beginning on August 8, 2023, and continuing.  
  
The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in Maui County.  
  
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.  
  
Federal funding also is available to state and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for debris removal and emergency protective measures
in Maui County, and assistance for emergency protective measures for
Hawaii County.  
  
Lastly, Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for
hazard mitigation measures statewide.  
  
Mr. Maona N. Ngwira of FEMA has been appointed to coordinate Federal
recovery operations in the affected areas.   
  
Damage assessments are continuing, and additional forms of assistance
may be designated after the assessments are fully completed.  
  
Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance at
[www.DisasterAssistance.gov](https://www.disasterassistance.gov/), by
calling 800-621-FEMA (3362), or by using the [FEMA
App](https://www.ready.gov/fema-app). Anyone using a relay service, such
as video relay service (VRS), captioned telephone service or others, can
give FEMA the number for that service.
