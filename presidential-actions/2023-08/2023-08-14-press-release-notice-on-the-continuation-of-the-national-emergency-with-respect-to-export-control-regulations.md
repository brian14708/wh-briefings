title: "Press Release: Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect\
  \ to Export Control\_Regulations"

    On August 17, 2001, the President issued Executive Order 13222
pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C.
1701 *et seq*.).  In that order, the President declared a national
emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States
related to the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as
amended (50 U.S.C. 4601 *et seq*.).  Because the implementation of
certain sanctions authorities, including sections 11A, 11B, and 11C of
such Export Administration Act of 1979, consistent with section 1766(b)
of Public Law 115-232, the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (50 U.S.C.
4801 note), is to be carried out under the International Emergency
Economic Powers Act, the national emergency declared on August 17, 2001,
must continue in effect beyond August 17, 2023.  Therefore, in
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 13222, as amended by Executive Order 13637
of March 8, 2013.

     This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and
transmitted to the Congress.  
  

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
    August 14, 2023.
