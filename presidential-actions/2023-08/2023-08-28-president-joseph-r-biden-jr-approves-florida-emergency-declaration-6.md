The President’s action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security,
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate all disaster
relief efforts which have the purpose of alleviating the hardship and
suffering caused by the emergency on the local population, and to
provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures,
authorized under Title V of the Stafford Act, to save lives and to
protect property and public health and safety, and to lessen or avert
the threat of a catastrophe in the counties of Alachua, Bay, Calhoun,
Charlotte, Citrus, Columbia, DeSoto, Dixie, Franklin, Gadsden,
Gilchrist, Gulf, Hamilton, Hardee, Hernando, Hillsborough, Jefferson,
Lafayette, Lee, Leon, Levy, Liberty, Madison, Manatee, Marion, Pasco,
Pinellas, Polk, Sarasota, Sumter, Suwannee, Taylor, and Wakulla.

Specifically, FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize, and provide at
its discretion, equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the
impacts of the emergency.  Emergency protective measures (Category B),
including direct Federal assistance, under the Public Assistance program
will be provided at 75 percent Federal funding. 

Mr. Brett H. Howard of FEMA has been appointed to coordinate Federal
recovery operations in the affected areas.
