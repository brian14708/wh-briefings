---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of South Carolina and ordered Federal aid to
supplement State and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by
Hurricane Ian during the period of September 25 to October 4, 2022.

The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in Charleston, Georgetown, and Horry Counties.

Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.

Federal funding is also available to state and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by Hurricane Ian in Berkeley, Charleston, Clarendon,
Georgetown, Horry, Jasper, and Williamsburg Counties.

Lastly, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Kevin A. Wallace, Sr. as
the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas. 

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.

Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance at
[www.DisasterAssistance.gov](www.DisasterAssistance.gov), by calling
800-621-FEMA (3362), or by using the [FEMA
App](https://www.ready.gov/fema-app). Anyone using a relay service, such
as video relay service (VRS), captioned telephone service or others, can
give FEMA the number for that service.
