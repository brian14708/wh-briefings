Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)

In accordance with section 506A(a)(3)(B) of the Trade Act of 1974, as
amended (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(3)(B)), I am providing advance notification
of my intent to terminate the designation of Burkina Faso as a
beneficiary sub-Saharan African country under the African Growth and
Opportunity Act (AGOA).

I am taking this step because I have determined that the Government of
Burkina Faso has not established, or is not making continual progress
toward establishing, the protection of the rule of law and of political
pluralism, as stated in the eligibility requirements of
section 104 of the AGOA.     

Accordingly, I intend to terminate the designation of Burkina Faso as a
beneficiary sub-Saharan African country under the AGOA, effective
January 1, 2023.  I will continue to assess whether the Government of
Burkina Faso is making continual progress toward meeting the AGOA
eligibility requirements.

                      Sincerely,  
JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
