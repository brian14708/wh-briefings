title: "Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Proliferation\
  \ of Weapons of Mass\_Destruction"
---
 
     On November 14, 1994, by Executive Order 12938, the President
declared a national emergency with respect to the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and
economy of the United States posed by the proliferation of nuclear,
biological, and chemical weapons (weapons of mass destruction) and the
means of delivering such weapons.  On July 28, 1998, by Executive Order
13094, the President amended Executive Order 12938 to respond more
effectively to the worldwide threat of weapons of mass destruction
proliferation activities.  On June 28, 2005, by Executive Order 13382,
the President, among other things, further amended Executive Order 12938
to improve our ability to combat proliferation.  The proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them continues
to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security,
foreign policy, and economy of the United States.  For this reason, the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 12938 of
November 14, 1994, with respect to the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction and the means of delivering such weapons must continue
beyond November 14, 2022.  Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d)
of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for
1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12938, as
amended. 

     This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and
transmitted to the Congress.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
   November 8, 2022.
