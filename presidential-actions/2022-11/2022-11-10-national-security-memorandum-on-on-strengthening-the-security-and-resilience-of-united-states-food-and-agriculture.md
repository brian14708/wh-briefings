SUBJECT:       Strengthening the Security and Resilience of United
States Food and Agriculture  
  
   
 The food and agriculture sector is extensive, interconnected, diverse,
and complex. Designated as critical infrastructure and primarily owned
and operated by private sector and non‑Federal entities, food and
agriculture systems and supply chains are vulnerable to disruption and
damage from domestic and global threats. Chemical, biological,
radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats that may result in
high-consequence and catastrophic incidents affecting the food and
agriculture sector include but are not limited to:  hazardous
contaminants such as poisonous agents including toxic industrial
compounds and materials, toxins, and chemical agents and precursors;
natural or genetically engineered pests and pathogens of livestock,
poultry, fish, shellfish, wildlife, plants, and insects; and physical
effects of nuclear detonations or dispersion of radioactive materials.
 Other threats that may result in high-consequence and catastrophic
incidents include pandemics impacting the sector’s critical
infrastructure and essential workforce, consequences of climate change,
and threats in the cyber domain, such as disruption to systems as a
result of increasing information technology and operational technology
convergence and intellectual property theft.  The evolving threat
environment requires the sector and its essential workforce to better
prepare for and respond to incidents with broad impacts on our national
and economic security.    
   
     Section 1.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States to
ensure that our Nation’s food and agriculture sector is secure and
resilient in response to the possibility of high-consequence and
catastrophic incidents.  To achieve this, the Federal Government will
identify and assess threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts from these
high-consequence and catastrophic incidents — including but not limited
to those presented by CBRN threats, climate change, and cybersecurity —
and will prioritize resources to prevent, protect against, mitigate,
respond to, and recover from the threats and hazards that pose the
greatest risk.  
   
     Sec. 2.  Coordination.  The Assistant to the President for National
Security Affairs (APNSA) or the APNSA’s designee shall coordinate the
executive branch actions necessary to implement this memorandum through
