title: "Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Situation\
  \ in\_Nicaragua"
---
 
On November 27, 2018, by Executive Order 13851, the President declared a
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et* *seq.*)to deal with the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the
United States constituted by the situation in Nicaragua.  On October 24,
2022, I issued Executive Order 14088 to take additional steps with
respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13851.

<img src="" loading="lazy" width="2" height="2" />The situation in
Nicaragua, including the violent response by the Government of Nicaragua
to the protests that began on April 18, 2018, and the Ortega-Murillo
regime’s continued systematic dismantling and undermining of democratic
institutions and the rule of law, its use of indiscriminate violence and
repressive tactics against civilians, as well as its corruption leading
to the destabilization of Nicaragua’s economy, continues to pose an
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign
policy of the United States.  For this reason, the national emergency
declared on November 27, 2018, must continue in effect beyond November
27, 2022.  Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13851 with respect to the
situation in Nicaragua.

This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and transmitted
to the Congress.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
November 10, 2022.
