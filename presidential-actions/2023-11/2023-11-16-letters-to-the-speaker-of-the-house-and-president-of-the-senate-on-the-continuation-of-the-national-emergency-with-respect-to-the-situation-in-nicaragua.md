Dear Mr. Speaker:   (Dear Madam President:)

Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to the situation in
Nicaragua declared in Executive Order 13851 of November 27, 2018, under
which additional steps were taken in Executive Order 14088 of October
24, 2022, is to continue in effect beyond November 27, 2023.

The situation in Nicaragua, including the violent response by the
Government of Nicaragua to the protests that began on April 18, 2018,
and the Ortega-Murillo regime’s continued systematic dismantling and
undermining of democratic institutions and the rule of law, its use of
indiscriminate violence and repressive tactics against civilians, as
well as its corruption leading to the destabilization of Nicaragua’s
economy, continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the
national security and foreign policy of the United States.  For this
reason, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national
emergency declared in Executive Order 13851 with respect to the
situation in Nicaragua.

                                Sincerely,

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
