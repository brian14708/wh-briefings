title: "President\_Biden Names Forty-Second Round of Judicial\_Nominees"
---
 
The President is announcing his intent to nominate two individuals to
federal circuit courts, three individuals to federal district courts,
and three individuals to the District of Columbia Superior Court—all of
whom are extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and devoted to the rule
of law and our Constitution.  
  
These choices also continue to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure
that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our
greatest assets as a country—both in terms of personal and professional
backgrounds.  
This will be President Biden’s forty-second round of nominees for
federal judicial positions, bringing the number of announced federal
judicial nominees to 203.
