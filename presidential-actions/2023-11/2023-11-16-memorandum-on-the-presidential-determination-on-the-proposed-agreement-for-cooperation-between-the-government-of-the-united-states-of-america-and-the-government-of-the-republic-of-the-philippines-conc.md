MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE  
               THE SECRETARY OF ENERGY  
  
SUBJECT:       Presidential Determination on the Proposed Agreement for
Cooperation between the Government of the United States of America and
the Government of the Republic of the Philippines Concerning Peaceful
Uses of Nuclear Energy  
  
  
I have considered the proposed Agreement for Cooperation between the
Government of the United States of America and the Government of the
Republic of the Philippines Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy
(the “proposed Agreement”), along with the views, recommendations, and
statements of the interested departments and agencies.   
  
I have determined that the performance of the proposed Agreement will
promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common
defense and security.  Pursuant to section 123 b. of the Atomic Energy
Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2153(b)), I hereby approve the
proposed Agreement and authorize the Secretary of State to arrange for
its execution.   
  
The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this
determination in the *Federal Register*.  
  
  
                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
