title: "A Proclamation on the Death of Rosalynn\_Carter"
---
 
     Throughout her life as First Lady of Georgia and First Lady of the
United States, Rosalynn Carter exemplified hope, warmth, and a steadfast
commitment to doing all she could to address many of our society’s
greatest needs.  She was a champion for equal rights and opportunities
for women and girls; an advocate for mental health and wellness for all;
and a supporter of the often unseen and uncompensated caregivers of our
children, aging loved ones, and people with disabilities.  Above all,
the deep love shared between Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter is the definition
of partnership, and their humble leadership is the definition of
patriotism.     
  
     As a mark of respect for the memory of Rosalynn Carter, by the
authority vested in me as President of the United States by
the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby
order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at
the White House and upon all public buildings and grounds, at all
military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the
Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the
United States and its Territories and possessions from November 25,
2023, until sunset, on the day of interment.  I also direct that the
flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same length of time at all
United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other
facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels
and stations.  
  
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first
day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-three, and
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-eighth.  
 

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
