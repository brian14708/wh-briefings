Today, President Joe Biden announced his intent to appoint Dr. W. Kimryn
Rathmell as the 17<sup>th</sup> Director of the National Cancer
Institute (NCI), the federal government’s principal agency for cancer
research and training and the largest funder of cancer research in the
world. Dr. W. Kimryn Rathmell is an accomplished physician-scientist and
internationally recognized cancer expert who is well suited to lead the
NCI during this critical time to achieve the goals the President set for
the Biden Cancer Moonshot as part of his Unity Agenda.   
   
**Statement from President Biden:** “Dr. Rathmell is the talented and
visionary leader the National Cancer Institute needs to drive us toward
ending cancer as we know it.  Throughout her career, she has been
committed to advancing discovery through scientific research,
maintaining a steadfast commitment to caring for her patients, and
demonstrating leadership in preparing the next generation of
researchers. She embodies the promise of the Biden Cancer Moonshot and
has spent her career driving toward the goals Jill and I set for the
initiative, to improve outcomes and boost support for those facing a
cancer diagnosis. The National Cancer Institute is central to the
success of the Cancer Moonshot and Dr. Rathmell will lead the agency
towards new ways to prevent, detect, and treat cancer and to ensure we
reach more Americans with the tools we have to save and extend lives.”

An accomplished physician-scientist and internationally recognized
expert in kidney cancer, Dr. Rathmell’s research focuses on the
underlying drivers of kidney cancers by using genetic, molecular, and
cell biology to develop robust approaches to improve patient
outcomes.

American Society of Clinical Investigation, Secretary-Treasury of the
American Society for Clinical Oncology, was inducted into the
Association of American Physicians, the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences, and the National Academy of Medicine, and won the 2021
American Association for Cancer Research Team Science Award.  She
founded a non-profit organization in support of patients with a rare
cancer seen primarily in African-American patients with sickle cell
trait.  
   
A Nebraska native, Dr. Rathmell graduated from the University of
Northern Iowa with degrees in biology and chemistry. She received her
