Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Arkansas and ordered Federal assistance to
supplement state and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by
severe storms, straight-line winds, and tornadoes from June 25 to June
26, 2023.  
   
Federal funding is available to state, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the severe storms, straight-line winds, and
tornadoes in the counties of Arkansas, Faulkner, Lonoke, and Poinsett.  
   
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.  
   
Mr. Roland W. Jackson of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas.   
   
Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
