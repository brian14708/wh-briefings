title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Approves U.S. Virgin Islands Emergency\_Declaration"
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that an emergency exists
in the territory of the U.S. Virgin Islands and ordered Federal
assistance to supplement the territory’s response efforts due to the
emergency conditions resulting from elevated levels of lead and copper
in the water supply beginning on October 25, 2023, and continuing.  
   
The President’s action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security,
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate all disaster
relief efforts which have the purpose of alleviating the hardship and
suffering caused by the emergency on the local population, and to
provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures,
authorized under Title V of the Stafford Act, to save lives and to
protect property and public health and safety, and to lessen or avert
the threat of a catastrophe on the island of St. Croix.  
   
Specifically, FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize, and provide at
its discretion, equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the
impacts of the emergency.  Emergency protective measures, including
direct federal assistance, under the Public Assistance program will be
provided for water, other necessary related items such as filters and
testing, and technical assistance necessary to identify and address
immediate threats to public health and safety for 90 days from the start
of the incident period.  
   
Ms. Lai Sun Yee of FEMA has been appointed to coordinate Federal
recovery operations in the affected areas.
