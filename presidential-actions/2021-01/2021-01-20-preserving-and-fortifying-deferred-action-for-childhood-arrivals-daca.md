MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THE SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY

SUBJECT: Preserving and Fortifying Deferred Action for Childhood
Arrivals (DACA)

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:

Section 1.  Policy.  In 2012, during the Obama-Biden Administration, the
Secretary of Homeland Security issued a memorandum outlining how, in the
exercise of prosecutorial discretion, the Department of Homeland
Security should enforce the Nation’s immigration laws against certain
young people.  This memorandum, known as the Deferred Action for
Childhood Arrivals (DACA) guidance, deferred the removal of certain
undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as
children, have obeyed the law, and stayed in school or enlisted in the
military.  DACA and associated regulations permit eligible individuals
who pass a background check to request temporary relief from removal and
to apply for temporary work permits.  DACA reflects a judgment that
these immigrants should not be a priority for removal based on
humanitarian concerns and other considerations, and that work
authorization will enable them to support themselves and their families,
and to contribute to our economy, while they remain.

Sec. 2.  Preserving and Fortifying DACA.  The Secretary of Homeland
Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall take all
actions he deems appropriate, consistent with applicable law, to
preserve and fortify DACA. 

Sec. 3.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this memorandum shall be
construed to impair or otherwise affect:

\(i\)   the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency,
or the head thereof; or

(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b)  This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable
law.

(c)  This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(d)  The Secretary of Homeland Security is authorized and directed to
publish this memorandum in the *Federal Register*.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
