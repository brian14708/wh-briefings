title: "Executive Order on Economic Relief Related to the COVID-\u206019\_Pandemic"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:

**Section 1. Background.** The pandemic caused by the coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to an economic crisis marked by the
closure of small businesses, job loss, food and housing insecurity, and
increased challenges for working families balancing jobs and caregiving
responsibilities. The current economic crisis has affected Americans
throughout the Nation, but it is particularly dire in communities of
color. The problems are exacerbated because State and local governments
are being forced to consider steep cuts to critical programs to address
revenue shortfalls the pandemic has caused. In addition, many
individuals, families, and small businesses have had difficulties
navigating relief programs with varying eligibility requirements, and
some are not receiving the intended assistance. The economic crisis
resulting from the pandemic must be met by the full resources of the
Federal Government.

**Sec. 2. Providing Relief to Individuals, Families, and Small
Businesses; and to State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial Governments.**
(a) All executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall promptly
identify actions they can take within existing authorities to address
the current economic crisis resulting from the pandemic. Agencies should
specifically consider actions that facilitate better use of data and
other means to improve access to, reduce unnecessary barriers to, and
improve coordination among programs funded in whole or in part by the
Federal Government.

\(b\) Agencies should take the actions identified in subsection (a) of
this section, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, and in
doing so should prioritize actions that provide the greatest relief to
individuals, families, and small businesses; and to State, local,
Tribal, and territorial governments.

\(c\) Independent agencies, as enumerated in 44 U.S.C. 3502(5), are
strongly encouraged to comply with this section.

**Sec. 3. General Provisions.** (a) Nothing in this order shall be
construed to impair or otherwise affect:

\(i\) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

\(ii\) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.

\(c\) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
