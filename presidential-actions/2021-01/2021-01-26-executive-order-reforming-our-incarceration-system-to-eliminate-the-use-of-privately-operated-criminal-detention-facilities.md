title: "Executive Order on Reforming Our Incarceration System to Eliminate the Use\
  \ of Privately Operated Criminal Detention\_Facilities"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:

**Section 1.  Policy. ** More than two million people are currently
incarcerated in the United States, including a disproportionate number
of people of color.  There is broad consensus that our current system of
mass incarceration imposes significant costs and hardships on our
society and communities and does not make us safer.  To decrease
incarceration levels, we must reduce profit-based incentives to
incarcerate by phasing out the Federal Government’s reliance on
privately operated criminal detention facilities.

We must ensure that our Nation’s incarceration and correctional systems
are prioritizing rehabilitation and redemption.  Incarcerated
individuals should be given a fair chance to fully reintegrate into
their communities, including by participating in programming tailored to
earning a good living, securing affordable housing, and participating in
our democracy as our fellow citizens.  However, privately operated
criminal detention facilities consistently underperform Federal
facilities with respect to correctional services, programs,
and resources.  We should ensure that time in prison prepares
individuals for the next chapter of their lives. 

The Federal Government also has a responsibility to ensure the safe and
humane treatment of those in the Federal criminal justice system. 
However, as the Department of Justice’s Office of Inspector General
found in 2016, privately operated criminal detention facilities do not
maintain the same levels of safety and security for people in the
Federal criminal justice system or for correctional staff.  We have a
duty to provide these individuals with safe working and living
conditions. 

**Sec. 2.  Contracts with Privately Operated Criminal Detention
Facilities. ** The Attorney General shall not renew Department of
Justice contracts with privately operated criminal detention facilities,
as consistent with applicable law.

**Sec. 3.  General Provisions.**  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be
construed to impair or otherwise affect:

(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
