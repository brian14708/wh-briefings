title: "Executive Order on Protecting the Federal Workforce and Requiring\_Mask-Wearing"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including section 7902(c) of title
5, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:

**Section 1.  Policy.**  It is the policy of my Administration to halt
the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by relying on the best
available data and science-based public health measures.  Such measures
include wearing masks when around others, physical distancing, and other
related precautions recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC).  Put simply, masks and other public health measures
reduce the spread of the disease, particularly when communities make
widespread use of such measures, and thus save lives.

Accordingly, to protect the Federal workforce and individuals
interacting with the Federal workforce, and to ensure the continuity of
Government services and activities, on-duty or on-site Federal
employees, on-site Federal contractors, and other individuals in Federal
buildings and on Federal lands should all wear masks, maintain physical
distance, and adhere to other public health measures, as provided in CDC
guidelines. 

**Sec. 2.  Immediate Action Regarding Federal Employees, Contractors,
Buildings, and Lands. ** (a)  The heads of executive departments and
agencies (agencies) shall immediately take action, as appropriate and
consistent with applicable law, to require compliance with CDC
guidelines with respect to wearing masks, maintaining physical distance,
and other public health measures by:  on-duty or on-site Federal
employees; on-site Federal contractors; and all persons in Federal
buildings or on Federal lands. 

(b)  The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the
Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the
Administrator of General Services, in coordination with the President’s
Management Council and the Coordinator of the COVID-19 Response and
Counselor to the President (COVID-19 Response Coordinator), shall
promptly issue guidance to assist heads of agencies with implementation
of this section.

(c)  Heads of agencies shall promptly consult, as appropriate, with
State, local, Tribal, and territorial government officials, Federal
employees, Federal employee unions, Federal contractors, and any other
interested parties concerning the implementation of this section.

(d)  Heads of agencies may make categorical or case-by-case exceptions
in implementing subsection (a) of this section to the extent that doing
so is necessary or required by law, and consistent with applicable law. 
If heads of agencies make such exceptions, they shall require
appropriate alternative safeguards, such as additional physical
distancing measures, additional testing, or reconfiguration of
workspace, consistent with applicable law.  Heads of agencies shall
document all exceptions in writing.

(e)  Heads of agencies shall review their existing authorities and, to
the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of
appropriations and resources, seek to provide masks to individuals in
Federal buildings when needed.

(f)  The COVID-19 Response Coordinator shall coordinate the
implementation of this section.  Heads of the agencies listed in 31
U.S.C. 901(b) shall update the COVID-19 Response Coordinator on their
progress in implementing this section, including any categorical
exceptions established under subsection (d) of this section, within 7
days of the date of this order and regularly thereafter.  Heads of
agencies are encouraged to bring to the attention of the COVID-19
Response Coordinator any questions regarding the scope or implementation
of this section. 

**Sec. 3.  Encouraging Masking Across America.**  (a)  The Secretary of
Health and Human Services (HHS), including through the Director of CDC,
