title: "Executive Order on Enabling All Qualified Americans to Serve Their Country\
  \ in\_Uniform"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:  
     Section 1.  Policy.  All Americans who are qualified to serve in
the Armed Forces of the United States (“Armed Forces”) should be able to
serve.  The All-Volunteer Force thrives when it is composed of diverse
Americans who can meet the rigorous standards for military service, and
an inclusive military strengthens our national security.  
     It is my conviction as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces that
gender identity should not be a bar to military service.  Moreover,
there is substantial evidence that allowing transgender individuals to
serve in the military does not have any meaningful negative impact on
the Armed Forces.  To that end, in 2016, a meticulous, comprehensive
study requested by the Department of Defense found that enabling
transgender individuals to serve openly in the United States military
would have only a minimal impact on military readiness and healthcare
costs.  The study also concluded that open transgender service has had
no significant impact on operational effectiveness or unit cohesion in
foreign militaries.  
     On the basis of this information, the Secretary of Defense
concluded in 2016 that permitting transgender individuals to serve
openly in the military was consistent with military readiness and with
strength through diversity, such that transgender service  members who
could meet the required standards and procedures should be permitted to
serve openly.  The Secretary of Defense also concluded that it was
appropriate to create a process that would enable service members to
take steps to transition gender while serving.  
     The previous administration chose to alter that policy to bar
transgender persons, in almost all circumstances, from joining the Armed
Forces and from being able to take steps to transition gender while
serving.  Rather than relying on the comprehensive study by a
nonpartisan federally funded research center, the previous
administration relied on a review that resulted in a policy that set
unnecessary barriers to military service.  It is my judgment that the
Secretary of Defense’s 2016 conclusions remain valid, as further
demonstrated by the fact that, in 2018, the then-serving Chief of Staff
of the Army, Chief of Naval Operations, Commandant of the Marine Corps,
and Chief of Staff of the Air Force all testified publicly to the
Congress that they were not aware of any issues of unit cohesion,
disciplinary problems, or issues of morale resulting from open
transgender service.  A group of former United States Surgeons General,
who collectively served under Democratic and Republican Presidents,
echoed this point, stating in 2018 that “transgender troops are as
medically fit as their non‑transgender peers and that there is no
medically valid reason — including a diagnosis of gender dysphoria — to
exclude them from military service or to limit their access to medically
necessary care.”  
     Therefore, it shall be the policy of the United States to ensure
that all transgender individuals who wish to serve in the United States
military and can meet the appropriate standards shall be able to do so
openly and free from discrimination.  
     Sec. 2.  Revocation.  The Presidential Memorandum of March 23, 2018
(Military Service by Transgender Individuals), is hereby revoked, and
the Presidential Memorandum of August 25, 2017 (Military Service by
Transgender Individuals), remains revoked.  
     Sec. 3.  Agency Roles and Responsibilities.  In furtherance of the
policy described in section 1 of this order, I hereby direct the
following:  
     (a)  The Secretary of Defense, and Secretary of Homeland Security
with respect to the Coast Guard, shall, after consultation with the
Joint Chiefs of Staff about how best to implement this policy and
consistent with applicable law, take all necessary steps to ensure that
all directives, orders, regulations, and policies of their respective
departments are consistent with this order.  These steps shall include
establishing a process by which transgender service members may
transition gender while serving, along with any further steps that the
Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Homeland Security deem appropriate
to advance the policy described in section 1 of this order.  
     (b)  The Secretary of Defense shall:  
(i)    immediately prohibit involuntary separations, discharges, and
denials of reenlistment or continuation of service on the basis of
gender identity or under circumstances relating to their gender
identity;  
(ii)   identify and examine the records of service members who have been
involuntarily separated, discharged, or denied reenlistment or
continuation of service on the basis of gender identity or under
circumstances relating to their gender identity;  
(iii)  issue guidance to the Secretaries of each military department
regarding the correction of the military records of individuals
described in subsection (b)(ii) of this section as necessary to remove
an injustice, pursuant to section 1552(a) of title 10, United States
Code, to the extent permitted by law; and  
(iv)   direct the Secretaries of each military department to provide
supplemental guidance, subject to the approval of the Secretary, to the
boards for the correction of military records, instructing such boards
on how to review applications for the correction of records of
individuals described in subsection (b)(ii) of this section.  Where
appropriate, the department concerned shall offer such individuals an
opportunity to rejoin the military should they wish to do so and meet
the current entry standards.   
     (c)  The Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to the Coast
Guard shall:  
(i)    immediately prohibit involuntary separations, discharges, and
denials of reenlistment or continuation of service, on the basis of
gender identity or under circumstances relating to their gender
identity;  
(ii)   identify and examine the records of service members who have been
involuntarily separated, discharged, or denied reenlistment or
continuation of service, on the basis of gender identity or under
circumstances relating to their gender identity;  
(iii)  issue guidance regarding the correction of the military records
of individuals described in subsection (c)(ii) of this section as
necessary to remove an injustice, pursuant to section 1552(a) of title
10, United States Code, to the extent permitted by law; and  
(iv)   provide supplemental guidance to the Board for Correction of
Military Records of the Coast Guard, instructing the Board on how to
review applications for the correction of records of individuals
described in subsection (c)(ii) of this section.  Where appropriate, the
Secretary of Homeland Security shall offer such individuals an
opportunity to rejoin the Coast Guard should they wish to do so and meet
the current entry standards.  
     (d)  The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland
Security shall report to me within 60 days of the date of this order on
their progress in implementing the directives in this order and the
policy described in section 1 of this order.  
     Sec. 4.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be
construed to impair or otherwise affect:  
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or  
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
     (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

  
                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.  
THE WHITE HOUSE,  
    January 25, 2021.
