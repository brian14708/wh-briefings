title: National Adoption Month, 2025

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

Every child deserves a safe and nurturing home where they can learn,
grow, and reach their full potential.  Adoption makes that possible by
opening the door to stability and belonging for children who need a
family.  During National Adoption Month, we commend the parents whose
love has changed lives and the children whose presence has completed
families — and we recommit to caring for the many children still waiting
for the comfort and security of a permanent home.

Adoption reflects the deep value our Nation places on family and
abundant life.  As President, I am committed to empowering families who
answer the call to open their hearts and homes to children.  Through the
One Big Beautiful Bill Act, I made the adoption tax credit more
accessible and expanded the child tax credit, helping remove financial
barriers to adopting and allowing families to save more of their income
to care for their children.

While adoption creates beautiful new beginnings, too many children in
our foster care system still wait for a permanent home.  During my first
term, I took monumental action to strengthen America’s foster care and
adoption systems by signing into law the landmark Family First
Prevention Services Act — the most sweeping reform of Federal child
welfare policy in decades.  This law utilizes proven intervention
methods to keep families intact and prevent unnecessary separation. 

This term, I remain firmly committed to continuing this vital work
alongside First Lady Melania Trump.  Just last week, I signed an
Executive Order on Fostering the Future for American Children and
Families, to harness Federal support, technology, and strategic
partnerships to provide young Americans in, or transitioning out of, the
foster-care system with the tools they need to become successful
adults.  This effort is strengthened by the leadership of the First Lady
whose work continues to uplift and protect the well-being of America’s
children — ensuring every child has greater access to a strong
foundation for the future. 

This month, we recognize the profound truth that all children are a gift
from God, worthy of love, care, and family.  We honor the parents and
families who welcome children into their homes and provide the stability
and guidance every young person deserves.  Above all, we commit to
protecting children, supporting those who care for them, and
strengthening the pillar of family across our great Nation. 

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2025 as
National Adoption Month throughout the United States.  I encourage all
Americans to observe this month by supporting children in need of a safe
and loving home, uplifting the families who welcome them, and helping
strengthen the bonds of family and community across our Nation.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this

seventeenth day of November, in the year of our Lord
two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States
of America the two hundred and fiftieth.

                               DONALD J. TRUMP
