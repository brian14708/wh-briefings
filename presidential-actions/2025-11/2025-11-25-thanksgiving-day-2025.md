BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

In 1789, just years after America’s triumph over tyranny in the
Revolutionary War, President George Washington established the first
National Day of Thanksgiving, declaring “the duty of all Nations to
acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey His will, to be
grateful for His benefits, and humbly to implore His protection and
favor.”  Decades later, in the midst of the bloody Civil War, President
Abraham Lincoln implored the Nation to join in unity for “a day of
Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the
Heavens.”  In every generation since, this spirit of reverence, trust,
and gratitude has preserved our way of life and made America the
strongest, greatest, and most resilient Nation the world has ever known.

From the pilgrims who settled our continent and the patriots who won our
independence on the battlefield to the pioneers who tamed the west and
the warriors who have preserved our freedom in distant lands, the spirit
of gratitude and grit embodied by those who celebrated the first
Thanksgiving more than 400 years ago have stood at the very heart of
what it means to be an American.

This year, God has bestowed abundant blessings all across our land and
indeed the entire world.  As we give thanks to Him, we continue to
advance our Nation through strong leadership and commonsense policy.  As
a result, the American economy is roaring back, we are making progress
on lowering the cost of living, a new era of peace is sweeping around
the world, our sovereignty is being swiftly restored, and the American
spirit is coming back greater and more powerful than ever before.

As we prepare to celebrate 250 glorious years of American independence,
this Thanksgiving, we summon the faith, resolve, and unflinching
fortitude of the giants of American history who came before us.  We vow
to build a future that echoes their sacrifice.  Above all, we offer our
endless gratitude to Almighty God for His love, grace, and infinite
blessings.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Thursday, November 27,
2025, as a National Day of Thanksgiving.  I encourage all Americans to
gather, in homes and places of worship, to offer a prayer of thanks to
God for our many blessings. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
fiftieth.

                              DONALD J. TRUMP
