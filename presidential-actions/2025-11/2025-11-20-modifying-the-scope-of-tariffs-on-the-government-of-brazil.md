title: Modifying the Scope of Tariffs on the Government of Brazil
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) (IEEPA), the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq.*), section 604 of the
Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title
3, United States Code, I hereby order:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.  In
Executive Order 14323 of July 30, 2025 (Addressing Threats to the United
States by the Government of Brazil), I found that the scope and gravity
of recent policies, practices, and actions of the Government of Brazil
constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security,
foreign policy, and economy of the United States that has its source in
whole or substantial part outside the United States.  I declared a
national emergency with respect to that threat and, to deal with that
threat, I determined that it was necessary and appropriate to impose an
additional *ad valorem* duty rate of 40 percent on certain articles of
Brazil.  Additionally, in Annex I to Executive Order 14323, I listed
certain articles that, in my judgment, should not be subject to the
additional *ad valorem* rate of duty imposed pursuant to that order.

On October 6, 2025, I participated in a call with Brazilian President
Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, during which we agreed to begin negotiations
to address the concerns identified in Executive Order 14323.  These
negotiations are ongoing.  I also have received additional information
and recommendations from various officials who, pursuant to my
direction, have been monitoring the circumstances involving the
emergency declared in Executive Order 14323.  For example, in their
opinion, certain agricultural imports from Brazil should no longer be
subject to the additional *ad valorem* rate of duty imposed under
Executive Order 14323 because, among other relevant considerations,
there has been initial progress in negotiations with the Government of
Brazil.

After considering the information and recommendations these officials
have provided to me and the status of negotiations with the Government
of Brazil, among other things, I have determined that it is necessary
and appropriate to modify the scope of products subject to the
additional *ad valorem* rate of duty imposed under Executive Order
14323.  Specifically, I have determined that certain agricultural
products shall not be subject to the additional *ad valorem* rate of
duty imposed under Executive Order 14323.  Accordingly, an updated
version of Annex I to Executive Order 14323 is attached to this order,
which shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption,
or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m.
eastern standard time on November 13, 2025.  In my judgment, these
modifications are necessary and appropriate to deal with the national
emergency declared in Executive Order 14323.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Tariff Modifications</span>. 
The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States shall be modified as
provided in Annex II to this order.  The modifications shall be
effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn
from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard
time on November 13, 2025.  To the extent that implementation of this
order requires a refund of duties collected, refunds shall be processed
pursuant to applicable law and the standard procedures of U.S. Customs
and Border Protection for such refunds.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Implementation</span>.  (a) 
The Secretary of State shall continue to monitor the circumstances
involving the emergency declared in Executive Order 14323 and shall
regularly consult on such circumstances with any senior official he
deems appropriate.  The Secretary of State shall inform me of any
circumstance that, in his opinion, might indicate the need for further
action by the President.

(b)  The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the
Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security,
the United States Trade Representative, the Assistant to the President
for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for
Economic Policy, the Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing, and
the Chair of the United States International Trade Commission, is
directed to take all necessary actions to implement and effectuate this
order, consistent with applicable law, and is hereby authorized to
employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary
to carry out the purposes of this order.  The Secretary of State may,
consistent with applicable law, redelegate the authority set forth in
this order within the Department of State.  Each executive department
and agency shall take all appropriate measures within its authority to
carry out this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Severability</span>.  If any
provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any
individual or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this
order and the application of its other provisions to any other
individuals or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.
 (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency,
or the head thereof; or

(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(d)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Department of State.
