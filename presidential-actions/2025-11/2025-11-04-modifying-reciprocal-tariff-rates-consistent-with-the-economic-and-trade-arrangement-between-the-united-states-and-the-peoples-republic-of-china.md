title: "Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates Consistent with the Economic and Trade Arrangement\
  \ Between the United States and the People\u2019s Republic of China"

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) (IEEPA), the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq.*), section 604 of the
Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title
3, United States Code, I hereby determine and order:

<u>Section</u> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.  In
Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a
Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large
and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), I found that
conditions reflected in large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade
deficits, including the consequences of those deficits, constitute an
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of
the United States that has its source in whole or substantial part
outside the United States.  I declared a national emergency with respect
to that threat, and to deal with that threat, I imposed additional *ad
valorem* duties that I deemed necessary and appropriate. 

In Executive Order 14259 of April 8, 2025 (Amendment to Reciprocal
Tariffs and Updated Duties as Applied to Low-Value Imports From the
People’s Republic of China), and Executive Order 14266 of April 9, 2025
(Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates To Reflect Trading Partner
Retaliation and Alignment), I raised the applicable *ad valorem* duty
rate for imports of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) established in
Executive Order 14257, in recognition of the PRC‘s retaliation against
the United States in response to the actions taken to address the
emergency declared in Executive Order 14257.

Subsequently, the United States entered into discussions with the PRC to
address the lack of trade reciprocity in our economic relationship and
the United States’ resulting national and economic security concerns.
 Accordingly, in Executive Order 14298 of May 12, 2025 (Modifying
Reciprocal Tariff Rates To Reflect Discussions With the People’s
Republic of China), and Executive Order 14334 of August 11, 2025
(Further Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates To Reflect Ongoing
Discussions With the People’s Republic of China), I determined that it
was necessary and appropriate to address the emergency declared in
Executive Order 14257 by suspending application of the heightened
*ad valorem* duties imposed on the PRC under Executive Order 14257, as
amended, and to instead impose on articles of the PRC an additional *ad
valorem* rate of duty of 10 percent.  During the suspension, the United
States continued to have discussions with the PRC to address the lack of
trade reciprocity in the United States’ economic relationship with the
PRC and the United States’ resulting national and economic security
concerns.

Following my meeting with President Xi Jinping of the People’s Republic
of China on October 30, 2025, in the Republic of Korea, the United
States and the PRC reached a historic and monumental deal on economic
and trade relations (Kuala Lumpur Joint Arrangement or Arrangement). 
Under the Arrangement, the PRC has committed to, among other things,
postpone and effectively eliminate the PRC’s current and proposed
coercive global export controls on rare earth elements and other
critical minerals, and address Chinese retaliation against United States
semiconductor manufacturers and other major companies in the
semiconductor supply chain.  The PRC has also committed to purchase
United States agricultural exports integral to the economy and general
welfare of the United States, including soybeans, sorghum, and logs. 
And the PRC has committed to suspend or remove many retaliatory actions
against the United States, including suspending tariffs on a vast swath
of United States agricultural products until December 31, 2026, and
extending the PRC’s market-based tariff exclusion process for United
States imports until November 10, 2026.

The United States, in turn, committed to, among other things, maintain
the suspension of heightened reciprocal tariffs on imports of the PRC
until 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on November 10, 2026.

In my judgment, the Arrangement will help remedy non‑reciprocal trade
arrangements and address the United States’ economic and national
security concerns.  The Arrangement will reduce the United States’ trade
deficit, boost the economy of the United States, and address the
consequences of the United States’ trade deficit by, among other things,
ensuring that the United States has access to materials vital to
national defense, the energy sector, and other aspects of the United
States’ economy and national security; strengthening the agricultural
infrastructure of the United States; and strengthening the manufacturing
and defense industrial base of the United States.

Accordingly, I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to
deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 by
implementing the Arrangement between the United States and the PRC. 
Therefore, I determine that it is necessary and appropriate to continue
the suspension of the heightened reciprocal tariffs on imports of the
PRC until 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on November 10, 2026.

Heading 9903.01.63 and subdivision (v)(xvii)(10) of U.S. note 2 to

standard time on November 10, 2026.

Secretary of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, in
consultation with the Secretary of State and any other officials they
deem appropriate, shall continue to monitor the conditions underlying
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, including the
United States’ trade deficit, the lack of reciprocity in our bilateral
trade relationships, disparate tariff rates and non-tariff barriers,
United States trading partners’ economic policies that suppress domestic
wages and consumption imports, the strength of our domestic
manufacturing base, the strength of our defense industrial base, and any
other relevant factors.  The Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of
Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative shall, from time to
time, update me on the status of these conditions.  In particular, the
Secretary of the Treasury and the United States Trade Representative
shall update me on the status and progress of the PRC’s implementation
of its commitments under the Arrangement.

Affairs, shall continue to inform me of any circumstance that, in their
opinion, might indicate the need for further action and shall continue
to recommend to me additional action that, in their opinion, will more
effectively deal with the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257.
