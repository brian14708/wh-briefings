title: Designation of Certain Muslim Brotherhood Chapters as Foreign Terrorist Organizations
  and Specially Designated Global Terrorists
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and
Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 *et seq.*) (INA), and the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) (IEEPA),  it is
hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  This order
sets in motion a process by which certain chapters or other subdivisions
of the Muslim Brotherhood shall be considered for designation as Foreign
Terrorist Organizations, consistent with section 219 of the INA (8
U.S.C. 1189) and specially designated global terrorists, consistent with
IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702), and Executive Order 13224 of September 23, 2001
(Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions with Persons Who Commit,
Threaten to Commit, or Support Terrorism), as amended.

The Muslim Brotherhood, founded in Egypt in 1928, has developed into a
transnational network with chapters across the Middle East and beyond.
 Relevant here, its chapters in Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt engage in or
facilitate and support violence and destabilization campaigns that harm
their own regions, United States citizens, and United States interests.
 For example, in the aftermath of the October 7, 2023, attack in Israel,
the military wing of the Lebanese chapter of the Muslim Brotherhood
joined Hamas, Hezbollah, and Palestinian factions to launch multiple
rocket attacks against both civilian and military targets within Israel.
 A senior leader of the Egyptian chapter of the Muslim Brotherhood, on
October 7, 2023, called for violent attacks against United States
partners and interests, and Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood leaders have
long provided material support to the militant wing of Hamas.  Such
activities threaten the security of American civilians in the Levant and
other parts of the Middle East, as well as the safety and stability of
our regional partners.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of the United States to cooperate with its regional partners to
eliminate the capabilities and operations of Muslim Brotherhood chapters
designated as foreign terrorist organizations pursuant to section 3 of
this order, deprive those chapters of resources, and thereby end any
threat such chapters pose to United States nationals or the national
security of the United States.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Implementation</span>.  (a) 
Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State and the
Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Attorney General
and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit a joint report
to the President, through the Assistant to the President for National
Security Affairs, concerning the designation of any Muslim Brotherhood
chapters or other subdivisions, including those in Lebanon, Jordan, and
Egypt, as foreign terrorist organizations consistent with 8 U.S.C. 1189,
and specially designated global terrorists consistent with 50 U.S.C.
1702 and Executive Order 13224.

(b)  Within 45 days of submitting the report required by subsection (a)
of this section, the Secretary of State or the Secretary of the
Treasury, as applicable, shall take all appropriate action consistent
with 8 U.S.C. 1189 or 50 U.S.C. 1702 and Executive Order 13224, as
applicable, with regard to the designation of any Muslim Brotherhood
chapters or other subdivisions described in section 1 of this order as
foreign terrorist organizations and specially designated global
terrorists.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. 
(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(d)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Department of State.
