BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

This week, our Nation observes Anti-Communism Week, a solemn remembrance
of the devastation caused by one of history’s most destructive
ideologies.  Across continents and generations, communism has wrought
devastation upon nations and souls.  More than 100 million lives have
been taken by regimes that sought to erase faith, suppress freedom, and
destroy prosperity earned through hard work, violating the God-given
rights and dignity of those they oppressed.  As we honor their memory,
we renew our national promise to stand firm against communism, to uphold
the cause of liberty and human worth, and to affirm once more that no
system of government can ever replace the will and conscience of a free
people.

For more than a century, communism has brought nothing but ruin. 
Wherever it spreads, it silences dissent, punishes beliefs, and demands
that generations kneel before the power of the state instead of standing
for freedom.  Its story is written in blood and sorrow, a grim reminder
that communism is nothing more than another word for servitude.

In the 34 years since the end of the Cold War, the world has witnessed
both the triumph of democracy and the persistence of tyranny in new
forms.  New voices now repeat old lies, cloaking them in the language of
“social justice” and “democratic socialism,” yet their message remains
the same:  give up your freedom, place your trust in the power of the
government, and trade the promise of prosperity for the empty comfort of
control.  America rejects this evil doctrine.  We remain a Nation
founded on the eternal truth that liberty and opportunity are the
birthrights of every person, and that no ideology, whether foreign or
domestic, can extinguish them.

As we mark Anti-Communism Week, we stand united in defense of the values
that define us as a free people.  We honor the victims of oppression by
keeping their cause alive and by ensuring that communism and every
system that denies the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness will find their place, once and for all, on the ash heap of
history.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the week of November 2
through November 8, 2025, as Anti-Communism Week. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
fiftieth.

                             DONALD J. TRUMP
