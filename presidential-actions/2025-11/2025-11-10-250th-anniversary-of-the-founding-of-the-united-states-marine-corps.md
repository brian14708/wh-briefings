title: 250th Anniversary of the Founding of the United States Marine Corps

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For two and a half centuries, the United States Marine Corps has stood
as a living force of American courage, discipline, and unity.  From the
birth of our Republic to the challenges of the modern world, the Marines
have always proven that they can accomplish any task, defend any shore,
and defeat any enemy.  As the United States approaches 250 years of
independence, we give thanks to Almighty God for the steadfast men and
women of the Marine Corps and we thank every Marine who has carried the
defense of our country upon their shoulders with valor and devotion.

The Marine Corps was born in the fires of revolution when the Second
Continental Congress established the Continental Marines by resolution
on November 10, 1775.  From the first combat action at Nassau in 1776,
Marines have proven to be ruthless in battle, and lethal guardians of
liberty and justice.  From that moment onward, the Marines have helped
shape the destiny of our Nation, fighting beside Andrew Jackson at the
Battle of New Orleans, standing firm in the trenches of World War I at
Belleau Wood, where they earned the nickname “Devil Dogs,” and seizing
victory after victory across the Pacific at Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima, and
Okinawa.  They confronted communism in Korea and Vietnam, upheld the
right to self-government in the Persian Gulf, and brought justice to our
enemies in the deserts and mountains of the Global War on Terror. 
Marines protect our embassies abroad, and ensure our Federal law
enforcement can do their jobs here at home.  Wherever liberty has been
threatened, the Marine Corps has answered with strength, courage, and
unyielding honor.

At Iwo Jima, the world witnessed why the United States Marine Corps
stands as the tip of the spear — the lead force that strikes first and
holds the line when freedom is on the brink.  On the morning of February
19, 1945, during World War II, the Marines launched one of the most
consequential and grueling campaigns in our Nation’s history.  Against
relentless fire and unyielding resistance from the Japanese Imperial
Army, our Marines stormed the black sand shores, raised the stars and
stripes over Mount Suribachi, and proved that no enemy could break the
spirit of the American warrior.  The battle was defined by massive
casualties, but also extraordinary acts of gallantry — 22 Marines
received the Medal of Honor for their valor, the most ever awarded for a
single battle in American history.  Their triumph at Iwo Jima advanced
America’s cause in the Pacific and set a timeless standard for Marines
who serve, defined by honor, courage, and unwavering commitment to
country. 

Today, the United States Marine Corps continues to stand as the shield
and spear of our Republic.  Their courage in combat, disciplined
precision, and relentless endurance are admired around the world, sure
in the knowledge that true peace is secured only by superior strength. 
Our Marines now serve under a mission-driven Department of War,
hyper-focused on military readiness, and they are receiving our best
resources and unrelenting support.  My Administration is committing more
than $150 billion to forge a leaner, more lethal force fit for the
twenty-first century.  With our investments in shipbuilding, missile
defense, and advanced capabilities, my Administration is providing our
Marines with every operational advantage so they can continue to ensure
American strength prevails in every domain.  Under my leadership, I will
always have the backs of our Marines and make certain they are never
constrained in exercising their legendary, indomitable warrior spirit. 

From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli, the United States
Marines have time and again carved their names into history.  Their
motto, Semper Fidelis, meaning always faithful, speaks to the enduring
strength of the Corps and to the greatness of the country they defend —
one Nation, under God, steadfast, and forever free.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 10, 2025, as
a day to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United
States Marine Corps.  I call upon all Government officials to display
the flag of the United States over Government buildings, and I encourage
the American people to display the flag and hold appropriate ceremonies
as an expression of our Nation’s gratitude and respect for the Marine
Corps’ valiant heritage.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
fiftieth.

                              DONALD J. TRUMP
