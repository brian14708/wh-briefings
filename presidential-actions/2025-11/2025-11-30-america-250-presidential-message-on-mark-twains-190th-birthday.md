title: "America 250: Presidential Message on Mark Twain\u2019s 190th Birthday"
---
 
Today, we celebrate the 190th birthday of the “father of American
literature,” Mark Twain, a storyteller whose wit, wisdom, and honesty
spoke to the heart of our Nation.  Through humor and imagination, he
transformed everyday life into timeless tales, embodying the American
spirit of daring and defiance, courage and confidence, and excellence
and adventure.    

Before he took up his famous pen name, Samuel Clemens was raised in the
river town of Hannibal, Missouri, where the sights and sounds of the
Mississippi River would later inspire some of his greatest stories.  He
worked as a printer’s apprentice, riverboat pilot, and silver miner
before discovering his true calling as a writer.  From these early
experiences came the sharp humor, plainspoken wisdom, and unforgettable
characters that made him one of America’s most beloved voices.     

Mark Twain witnessed the events that shaped our Nation’s story and
transformed his everyday life into novels that still define American
culture.  Living through the Civil War, the Reconstruction era, and the
rise of the Industrial Age, Mark Twain chronicled a country finding its
identity and gave voice to the forgotten Americans who make it so
unique.  His journeys took him around the world, where he found meaning
in the everyday experiences shared by Americans from all walks of life. 
Through classics such as *Adventures of Huckleberry Finn* and *The
Innocents Abroad*, he captured the humor, hardship, and hope of an era,
a people, and a Nation.  His humor was honest, his honesty was humorous,
and both were unapologetic, bold, and distinctly American.  

“The secret of getting ahead is getting started,” Mark Twain once
wrote.  And his words still ring true today.  From the very first day of
my Administration, we got to work fulfilling the promises we made to the
American people, and we are delivering historic results.  We are
revitalizing our economy, lowering prices and costs of living for
everyday Americans, securing the safest border in history, and brokering
unprecedented peace deals around the globe.  We are restoring law and
order, rebuilding American strength, and renewing pride in the values
that make our country great.  In so doing, we are fulfilling Mark
Twain’s hope for an America that measures greatness not in the illusion
he once called the “Gilded Age” but in the Golden Age of prosperity for
all Americans.

Happy birthday, Mark Twain!
