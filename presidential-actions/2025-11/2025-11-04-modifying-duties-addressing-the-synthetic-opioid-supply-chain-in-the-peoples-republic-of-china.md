title: "Modifying Duties Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People\u2019\
  s Republic of China"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) (IEEPA), the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq.*), section 604 of the
Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title
3, United States Code, I hereby determine and order:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.  In
Executive Order 14195 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties To Address
the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People’s Republic of China), I
found that the failure of the Government of the People’s Republic of
China (PRC) to act to blunt the sustained influx of synthetic opioids,
including fentanyl, flowing from the PRC to the United States
constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national
security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States that has its
source in substantial part outside the United States.  I declared a
national emergency with respect to that threat, and to deal with that
threat, I imposed an additional *ad valorem* rate of duty of 10 percent
on articles that are products of the PRC, as defined by the *Federal
Register* notice described in section 2(d) of Executive Order 14195, as
amended.

In Executive Order 14228 of March 3, 2025 (Further Amendment to Duties
Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People’s Republic of
China), I raised from 10 percent to 20 percent the additional *ad
valorem* rate of duty established in Executive Order 14195, as amended,
in response to the PRC’s failure to take adequate steps to alleviate the
illicit drug crisis described in Executive Order 14195.

After discussions between the United States and the PRC, among other
things, the PRC has committed to take steps to alleviate the national
emergency declared in Executive Order 14195.  Specifically, the PRC has
committed to take significant measures to end the flow of fentanyl to
the United States, including stopping the shipment of certain designated
chemicals to North America and strictly controlling exports of certain
other chemicals to all destinations in the world.  In light of the PRC’s
commitment, the United States committed to, among other things, reduce
the additional *ad valorem* rate of duty applicable under Executive
Order 14195, as amended, from 20 percent to 10 percent, effective
November 10, 2025.

Accordingly, I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to
deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14195 by
reducing the additional *ad valorem* rate of duty applicable under
Executive Order 14195, as amended, to 10 percent, effective November 10,
2025.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Implementation</span>.  (a) 
All articles that are subject to the additional *ad valorem* rate of
duty of 20 percent under Executive Order 14195, as amended, shall
instead be subject to an additional *ad valorem* rate of duty of 10
percent.  Accordingly, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the Harmonized
Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) shall be modified as
follows:

Effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn
from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard
time on November 10, 2025:

(i)   heading 9903.01.24 is amended by deleting “20%” each place that it
appears and inserting “10%” in lieu thereof and by deleting “or U.S.
note 2(w) to this subchapter”; and

(ii)  subdivision (u) of U.S. note 2 is modified by deleting “20%” and
inserting “10%” in lieu thereof and by deleting “March 4, 2025” and
inserting “November 10, 2025” in lieu thereof.

(b)  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the United
States International Trade Commission, shall determine whether any
additional modifications to the HTSUS are necessary to effectuate this
order and shall make such modifications through notice in the *Federal
Register*.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Monitoring and
Recommendations</span>.  (a)  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in
consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury,
and any other officials the Secretary of Homeland Security deems
appropriate, shall continue to monitor the conditions underlying the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 14195, including the
status and progress of the PRC’s implementation of its commitments to
alleviate the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14195, and
any other relevant factors.  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall,
from time to time, update me on the status of these conditions.  Should
the PRC fail to implement its commitments as described in section 1 of
this order, I may modify this order as necessary to deal with the
emergency declared in Executive Order 14195.

(b)  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the
Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President
for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for
Homeland Security, shall continue to inform me of any circumstance that,
in their opinion, might indicate the need for further action and shall
continue to recommend to me additional action that, in their opinion,
will effectively deal with the emergency declared in Executive Order
14195.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Delegation</span>.  Consistent
with applicable law, the Secretary of Homeland Security is directed and
authorized to take such actions, including adopting rules, regulations,
or guidance, and to employ all powers granted to the President,
including those granted by IEEPA, as may be necessary to implement and
effectuate this order.  The Secretary of Homeland Security, consistent
with applicable law, may redelegate any of these functions within the
Department of Homeland Security.  All executive departments and agencies
shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement
this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Severability</span>.  If any
provision of this order, or the application of any provision of this
order to any individual or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the
remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any
other individuals or circumstances shall not be affected.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.
 (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

\(i\)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or
agency, or the head thereof; or

(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

\(c\)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(d)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Department of Homeland Security.
