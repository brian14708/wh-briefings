title: Modifying the Scope of the Reciprocal Tariff with Respect to Certain Agricultural
  Products
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) (IEEPA), the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq.*), section 604 of the
Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title
3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:

Section 1.  Background.  In Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025
(Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices
That Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade
Deficits), I found that conditions reflected in large and persistent
annual U.S. goods trade deficits, including the consequences of those
deficits, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national
security and economy of the United States that has its source in whole
or substantial part outside the United States.  I declared a national
emergency with respect to that threat, and to deal with that threat, I
imposed certain *ad valorem* duties that I deemed necessary and
appropriate.  In Annex II to Executive Order 14257, I set forth a list
of certain goods that, in my judgment, should not be subject to the *ad
valorem* rates of duty imposed pursuant to that order.  

In Executive Order 14346 of September 5, 2025 (Modifying the Scope of
Reciprocal Tariffs and Establishing Procedures for Implementing Trade
and Security Agreements), I modified the scope of products subject to
the reciprocal tariff imposed under Executive Order 14257, as amended,
and I issued an updated version of Annex II to Executive Order 14257.

I have received additional information and recommendations from various
officials who, pursuant to my direction, have been monitoring the
circumstances involving the emergency declared in Executive Order
14257.  After considering the information and recommendations these
officials have provided to me, the status of negotiations with various
trading partners, current domestic demand for certain products, and
current domestic capacity to produce certain products, among other
things, I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to
further modify the scope of products subject to the reciprocal tariff
imposed under Executive Order 14257, as amended.  Specifically, I have
determined that certain agricultural products shall not be subject to
the reciprocal tariff imposed under Executive 14257, as amended. 
Accordingly, updated versions of Annex II to Executive Order 14257, as
amended, and the Annex to Executive Order 14346 entitled, “Potential
Tariff Adjustments for Aligned Partners,” are attached to this order and
shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or
withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern
standard time on November 13, 2025.  In my judgment, these modifications
are necessary and appropriate to deal with the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 14257.

Sec. 2.  Updating Scope of Duties Globally.** ** The Harmonized Tariff
Schedule of the United States shall be modified as provided in Annex I
to this order.  The modifications shall be effective with respect to
goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for
consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on November
13, 2025.  To the extent that implementation of this order requires a
refund of duties collected, refunds shall be processed pursuant to
applicable law and the standard procedures of U.S. Customs and Border
Protection for such refunds.

Sec. 3.  Implementation.  (a)  The Secretary of Commerce and the United
States Trade Representative shall continue to monitor the circumstances
involving the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 and shall
regularly consult on such circumstances with any senior official they
deem appropriate.  The Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade
Representative shall inform me of any circumstance that, in their
opinion, might indicate the need for further action by the President.

(b)  Consistent with applicable law, the Secretary of Commerce, the
Secretary of Homeland Security, and the United States Trade
Representative are directed and authorized to take such actions,
including adopting rules, regulations, or guidance, and to employ all
powers granted to the President, including those granted by IEEPA, as
may be necessary to implement and effectuate this order.  The Secretary
of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the United States
Trade Representative, consistent with applicable law, may redelegate any
of these functions within their respective department or agency.  All
executive departments and agencies shall take all appropriate measures
within their authority to implement this order.

Sec. 4.  Severability.  If any provision of this order, or the
application of any provision to any individual or circumstance, is held
to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its
other provisions to any other individuals or circumstances shall not be
affected thereby. 

Sec. 5.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be
construed to impair or otherwise affect:

\(i\)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or
agency, or the head thereof; or

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

\(c\)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(d)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
United States Trade Representative.
