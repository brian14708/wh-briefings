title: Regulatory Relief for Certain Stationary Sources to Promote American Coke Oven
  Processing Security

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

1.  Steel plays a vital role in the United States economy and daily
life, underpinning infrastructure, manufacturing, and various other
industries.  It is a fundamental material for construction,
transportation, energy systems, military hardware, and countless other
products, contributing significantly to the Nation’s economic output and
job creation.  Currently, approximately 70 percent of all steel is made
using metallurgical coke, a high-quality fuel and reductant used in
blast furnaces to reduce iron ore to pig iron.  A strong coke industry
is therefore vital to building and maintaining critical infrastructure
and military readiness.

2.  On July 5, 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency published a
final rule, pursuant to section 112 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C.
7412, titled *National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants
for Coke Ovens:  Pushing, Quenching, and Battery Stacks, and Coke Oven
Batteries; Residual Risk and Technology Review, and Periodic Technology
Review*, 89 FR 55684 (Coke Oven Rule).  The Coke Oven Rule imposes new
emissions-control requirements on coke oven facilities.  

3.  The Coke Oven Rule places severe burdens on the coke production
industry and, through its indirect effects, on the viability of our
Nation’s critical infrastructure, defense, and national security.
 Specifically, the Coke Oven Rule requires compliance with standards
premised on the application of emissions-control technologies that do
not yet exist in a commercially demonstrated or cost-effective form. 
Many of the testing and monitoring requirements outlined in the Coke
Oven Rule rely on technologies that are not practically available, not
demonstrated at the necessary scale, or cannot be implemented safely or
consistently under real-world conditions.  Due to the Coke Oven Rule’s
onerous implementation and compliance schedule for these standards, many
coke production facilities are in the impossible position of designing
and engineering novel systems with unproven technology within a short
time frame.  The current compliance timeline of the Coke Oven Rule as
set forth at 89 FR 55690 therefore raises the unacceptable risk of
threatening facility closures, production halts, and lasting harm to the
domestic coke production industry.  This in turn would undermine our
national security, as these effects would substantially impact local and
national economies and would undermine the coke and steel sectors’ vital
role in producing the iron and steel needed to support critical
infrastructure and defense.

4.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States
of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States, including section 112(i)(4) of the Clean Air
Act, 42 U.S.C. 7412(i)(4), do hereby proclaim that certain stationary
sources subject to the Coke Oven Rule, as identified in Annex I of this
proclamation, are exempt from compliance with certain requirements of
the Coke Oven Rule for a period of 2 years beyond the Coke Oven Rule’s
relevant compliance dates (Exemption).  This Exemption applies to all
compliance deadlines established under the Coke Oven Rule applicable to
the stationary sources listed in Annex I, with each such deadline
extended by 2 years from the date originally required for such deadline.
 The effect of this Exemption is that, during each such 2-year period
and with respect to the particular requirements identified in Annex I,
these stationary sources will be subject to the emissions and compliance
obligations that they are currently subject to under the applicable
standard as that standard existed prior to the Coke Oven Rule.  In
support of this Exemption, I hereby make the following determinations:

a.  The technology to implement the Coke Oven Rule is not available. 
Such technology does not exist in a commercially viable form sufficient
to allow implementation of and compliance with the Coke Oven Rule by the
compliance dates in the Coke Oven Rule.

b.  It is in the national security interests of the United States to
issue this Exemption for the reasons stated in paragraphs 1 and 3 of
this proclamation.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this

twenty-first day of November, in the year of our Lord
two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States
of America the two hundred and fiftieth.

                               DONALD J. TRUMP
