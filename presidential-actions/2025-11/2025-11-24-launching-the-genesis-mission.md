title: Launching the Genesis Mission
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  From the
founding of our Republic, scientific discovery and technological
innovation have driven American progress and prosperity.  Today, America
is in a race for global technology dominance in the development of
artificial intelligence (AI), an important frontier of scientific
discovery and economic growth.  To that end, my Administration has taken
a number of actions to win that race, including issuing multiple
Executive Orders and implementing America’s AI Action Plan, which
recognizes the need to invest in AI-enabled science to accelerate
scientific advancement.  In this pivotal moment, the challenges we face
require a historic national effort, comparable in urgency and ambition
to the Manhattan Project that was instrumental to our victory in World
War II and was a critical basis for the foundation of the Department of
Energy (DOE) and its national laboratories.

This order launches the “Genesis Mission” as a dedicated, coordinated
national effort to unleash a new age of AI‑accelerated innovation and
discovery that can solve the most challenging problems of this century.
 The Genesis Mission will build an integrated AI platform to harness
Federal scientific datasets — the world’s largest collection of such
datasets, developed over decades of Federal investments — to train
scientific foundation models and create AI agents to test new
hypotheses, automate research workflows, and accelerate scientific
breakthroughs.  The Genesis Mission will bring together our Nation’s
research and development resources — combining the efforts of brilliant
American scientists, including those at our national laboratories, with
pioneering American businesses; world-renowned universities; and
existing research infrastructure, data repositories, production plants,
and national security sites — to achieve dramatic acceleration in AI
development and utilization.  We will harness for the benefit of our
Nation the revolution underway in computing, and build on decades of
innovation in semiconductors and high-performance computing.  The
Genesis Mission will dramatically accelerate scientific discovery,
strengthen national security, secure energy dominance, enhance workforce
productivity, and multiply the return on taxpayer investment into
research and development, thereby furthering America’s technological
dominance and global strategic leadership.

including applicable classification, supply chain security, and Federal
cybersecurity standards and best practices.

(c)  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall
identify Federal computing, storage, and networking resources available
to support the Mission, including both DOE on-premises and cloud-based
high-performance computing systems, and resources available through
industry partners.  The Secretary shall also identify any additional
partnerships or infrastructure enhancements that could support the
computational foundation for the Platform.

(d)  Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall:

\(i\)   identify a set of initial data and model assets for use in the
Mission, including digitization, standardization, metadata, and
provenance tracking; and

\(ii\)  develop a plan, with appropriate risk-based cybersecurity
measures, for incorporating datasets from federally funded research,
other agencies, academic institutions, and approved private-sector
partners, as appropriate.

(e)  Within 240 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall
review capabilities across the DOE national laboratories and other
participating Federal research facilities for robotic laboratories and
production facilities with the ability to engage in AI-directed
experimentation and manufacturing, including automated and AI-augmented
workflows and the related technical and operational standards needed.

(f)  Within 270 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall,
consistent with applicable law and subject to available appropriations,
seek to demonstrate an initial operating capability of the Platform for
at least one of the national science and technology challenges
identified pursuant to section 4 of this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Identification of National
Science and Technology Challenges</span>.  (a)  Within 60 days of the
date of this order, the Secretary shall identify and submit to the APST
a detailed list of at least 20 science and technology challenges of
national importance that the Secretary assesses to have potential to be
addressed through the Mission and that span priority domains consistent
with National Science and Technology Memorandum 2 of September 23, 2025,
including:

(i)    advanced manufacturing;

(ii)   biotechnology;

\(iii\)  critical materials;

\(iv\)   nuclear fission and fusion energy;
