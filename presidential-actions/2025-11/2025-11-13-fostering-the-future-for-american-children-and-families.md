title: Fostering the Future for American Children and Families
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

Section 1.  Purpose and Policy.  My Administration is dedicated to
empowering mothers and fathers to raise their children in safe and
loving homes.  When crises prevent such an arrangement, our Nation’s
foster care system must be ready to serve children in need.  Today’s
foster care system must be improved in a number of important ways.   
     Children often stay in foster care for years, and those who
transition out due to age frequently face uncertain futures without the
support systems essential to educational, career, and relational
success.  Many caseworkers are overburdened.  Information systems are
often outdated.  Some jurisdictions and organizations maintain policies
that discourage or prohibit qualified families from serving children in
need as foster and adoptive parents because of their sincerely-held
religious beliefs or adherence to basic biological truths.  
     Our Nation’s children and youth — and the families who care for
them — deserve better.  To that end, my Administration, with special
leadership from the First Lady, will harness Federal support,
technology, and strategic partnerships to provide young Americans in or
transitioning out of the foster care system with the tools they need to
become successful adults.  

Sec. 2.  Modernizing the Child Welfare System.  (a)  The Secretary of
Health and Human Services shall, within 180 days of the date of this
order, take appropriate action to:  
          (i)    update applicable regulations, policies, and practices
to improve the collection, publication, utility, and transparency of
State-level child-welfare data, including by improving collection of
data and information indicative of child well-being and safety,
eliminating duplicative or unnecessary high-cost and low-value reporting
requirements, and expanding and expediting child-welfare data
publication;  
          (ii)   promote modernization of State child-welfare
information systems and use of the most effective foster care management
and outcome-tracking platforms, including by incorporating such
modernization efforts as part of information exchanged with or technical
assistance provided to States;  
          (iii)  expand States’ use of technological solutions,
including predictive analytics and tools powered by artificial
intelligence, to increase caregiver recruitment and retention rates,
improve caregiver and child matching, and deploy Federal child-welfare
funding to maximally effective purposes and recipients; and  
          (iv)   publish annually a scorecard that measures and is used
to evaluate State-level achievement of key outcomes and metrics that
reduce unnecessary entries into foster care, decrease the time between
reports of child maltreatment and investigations, reduce child injuries
and fatalities caused by caregiver neglect and abuse, increase caregiver
recruitment and retention, improve caregiver and child matching, reduce
placement disruptions, decrease the average time that children spend in
foster care, accelerate permanent placement for children, and increase
partnerships and collaboration with appropriate non-governmental
entities, including faith-based organizations.

Sec. 3.  Fostering the Future.  The Secretary of Health and Human
Services, in coordination with the Office of the First Lady and heads of
other relevant executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall,
within 180 days of the date of this order:  
     (a)  establish a “Fostering the Future” initiative to develop
partnerships with agencies and leading private sector organizations,
academic institutions, and non-profit entities to create new educational
and employment opportunities for individuals who are in or are
transitioning out of the foster care system;    
     (b)  develop a plan to launch, in conjunction with the National
Design Studio, a “Fostering the Future” online platform to help
individuals who have been in foster care by assessing their current
needs, providing guidance regarding accessing Federal, State, and local
programs and services for which they are eligible, including housing,
education, employment, healthcare, and mentoring services offering a
searchable database of those and other available resources, and
generating customized plans that support their self-sufficiency and
success;  
     (c) develop a strategy to reallocate funds returned by States from
Federal programs designed to assist individuals transitioning out of
foster care so that such returned funds are used to promote educational
success, occupational advancement, and financial literacy and
self-sufficiency for individuals transitioning out of foster care  
     (d)  increase flexibility in Education and Training Vouchers to
expand access for individuals transitioning out of foster care to
short-term, career-focused, and credential-awarding programs; and  
     (e)  facilitate, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury
and the Secretary of Education, State use of educational scholarships
created through tax-credited donations to scholarship-granting
organizations for children in foster care.

Sec. 4.  Maximizing Partnerships with Americans of Faith. The Secretary
of Health and Human Services, in coordination with the Director of the
White House Faith Office and the Director of the White House Office of
Intergovernmental Affairs, shall:  
     (a)  take appropriate action to address State and local policies
and practices that inappropriately prohibit participation in
federally-funded child-welfare programs by qualified individuals or
organizations based upon their sincerely-held religious beliefs or moral
convictions; and  
     (b)  take appropriate action to increase partnerships between
agencies and faith-based organizations and houses of worship to serve
families whose children have been placed in foster care or are at risk
of being placed in foster care.

Sec. 5.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be
construed to impair or otherwise affect:  
          (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department
or agency, or the head thereof; or  
          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.  
     (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.  
     (d)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Department of Health and Human Services.  
  
  
  
  
  
                               DONALD J. TRUMP  
  
  

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
    November 13, 2025.
