By virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United
States of America (the “President”), I hereby grant permission, subject
to the conditions set forth herein, to the City of Eagle Pass, Texas
(the “permittee”), to expand and continue to maintain and operate a
vehicular and pedestrian crossing at the Camino Real International
Bridge Land Port of Entry located on the United States border with
Mexico in Eagle Pass, Texas, as described in the “Camino Real
International Bridge Expansion Presidential Permit Application” dated
November 26, 2024, by the permittee to the Secretary of State and made
complete with additional information provided by the permittee on March
9, 2025 (collectively, the “Application”), in accordance with 33 U.S.C.
535d and associated procedures.

The term “Border facilities” as used in this permit consists of the
bridge over the Rio Grande, including six vehicle lanes in a second span
adjacent to the existing Camino Real International Bridge Land Port of
Entry, its approaches, and any land, structures, installations, or
equipment appurtenant thereto located approximately half a mile south of
the Eagle Pass-Piedras Negras International Bridge and immediately north
of the Eagle Pass Union Pacific International Railroad Bridge on the
United States side of the international boundary between the United
States and Mexico.

This permit is subject to the following conditions:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Article</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.  The Border
facilities herein described, and all aspects of their operation are
subject to all the conditions, provisions, and requirements of this
permit and any subsequent Presidential amendment to it.  The
construction, maintenance, and operation of the Border facilities shall
be in all material respects as described in the Application.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Article</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.  The standards for
and the manner of construction, maintenance, and operation of the Border
facilities are subject to inspection by the representatives of
appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies.  The permittee shall
grant officers and employees of such agencies that are duly authorized
and performing their official duties free and unrestricted access to
said Border facilities.  

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Article</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.  The permittee shall
comply with all applicable Federal laws and regulations regarding the

shall take or cause to be taken all appropriate measures to mitigate
adverse impacts on or disruption of the human environment in connection
with the construction, maintenance, and operation of the Border
facilities.  Mitigation measures are those that avoid, minimize, or
compensate for adverse impacts.

(2)  The permittee shall hold harmless and indemnify the United States
for any claimed or adjudged liability arising out of construction,
maintenance, and operation of the Border facilities, including

the event of approval by the President of such transfer, this permit
shall remain in force and effect, and the Border facilities shall be
subject to all the conditions, permissions, and requirements of this
permit and any amendments thereof.  The permittee may transfer ownership
or control of the Border facilities to a non-Federal entity or

<span style="text-decoration: underline">8</span>.  Before beginning

amend this permit at any time at his sole discretion.  The permittee’s
obligation to implement any amendment to this permit is subject to the
availability of funds.  If the permittee permanently closes the Camino
Real International Bridge and it is no longer used as an international
crossing, then this permit shall terminate, and the permittee may
manage, utilize, or dispose of the Border facilities in accordance with
applicable authorities.  This permit shall continue in full force and
effect for only so long as the permittee continues the operations hereby
authorized.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Article</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">14</span>.  This permit shall
expire 5 years from the date of its issuance if the permittee has not
commenced construction of the Border facilities by that date.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Article</span>

intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or
procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the
United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers,
employees, or agents, or any other person.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this

twentieth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five,
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred
and forty-ninth.
