MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR

THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE  
THE SECRETARY OF ENERGY  
THE SECRETARY OF THE ARMY  
THE CHAIR OF THE COUNCIL ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY  
  
SUBJECT:    Stopping Radical Environmentalism to Generate Power for the
Columbia River Basin  
  
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct:  
  
It is essential to protect Americans’ ability to take full advantage of
our vast natural resources to ensure human flourishing across our
country.  My Administration is committed to protecting the American
people from radical green agenda policies that make their lives more
expensive, and to maximizing the beneficial uses of our existing energy
infrastructure and natural resources to generate energy and lower the
cost of living.  
  
The Presidential Memorandum of September 27, 2023 (Restoring Healthy and
Abundant Salmon, Steelhead, and Other Native Fish Populations in the
Columbia River Basin), for example, elevates “equitable treatment for
fish” and misplaced concerns about climate change above the Nation’s
interests in reliable energy resources and the needs of American
citizens.  Among other things, the actions that the Biden Administration
contemplated in furtherance of the policy stated in the Presidential
Memorandum of September 27, 2023, included breaching four dams on the
Lower Snake River, eliminating over 3,000 megawatts of secure, reliable,
and affordable hydroelectric generating capacity.  The negative impacts
from these reckless acts, if completed, would be devastating for the
region, and there would be no viable approach to replace the low-cost,
baseload energy supplied; the critical shipping channels lost; the vital
water supply for local farmers reduced; or the recreational
opportunities that would no longer be possible as a result of these
acts.  
  
To prevent these harmful impacts, I hereby revoke the Presidential
Memorandum of September 27, 2023.  Further, within 15 days of the date
of this memorandum, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of the
Interior, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Assistant Secretary of the
Army for Civil Works under the direction of the Secretary of the Army
(heads of departments) shall take all appropriate steps to withdraw from
the Memorandum of Understanding filed on December 14, 2023, in the
Columbia River System litigation, *National Wildlife Federation v.
National Marine Fisheries Service*, 3:01-cv-640-SI (D. Or.), Dkt. 2450-1
(MOU).  
  
The heads of departments shall also rescind the “Notice of Intent to
Prepare a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) for the
Columbia River System Operations” published in the *Federal Register* on
December 18, 2024.  As appropriate, the heads of departments shall
develop a schedule to complete the Supplemental Columbia River System
Environmental Impact Statement and reissue the Notice of Intent pursuant
to that schedule and in alignment with any updated National
Environmental Policy Act procedures of the heads of departments.  The
heads of departments shall submit the schedule to the Chair of the
Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and the Chair shall convene
regular meetings among the heads of departments and any additional
appropriate Federal stakeholders for updates on the status of the
environmental review process.  
  
Within 30 days of the date of this memorandum, the heads of departments
shall identify and report to the President through the Chair of CEQ
on:  
  
        (i)    all actions taken pursuant to or consistent with the
Presidential Memorandum of September 27, 2023, including the MOU;  
  
        (ii)   the status of all Federal commitments made pursuant to
the Presidential Memorandum of September 27, 2023, and the MOU along
with an identification of any such commitments that may be consistent
with the policies of my Administration;  
  
        (iii)  any steps that may be taken to rescind or recoup Federal
funds obligated to implement the MOU; and  
  
        (iv)   any actions that have been taken and future steps that
must be taken to withdraw from the MOU.  
  
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
