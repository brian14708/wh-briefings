title: Providing for the Revocation of Syria Sanctions
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq*.), the National
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq*.) (NEA), the Syria
Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003 (Public
Law 108-175) (Syria Accountability Act), the Chemical and Biological
Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-182,
title III) (CBW Act), the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019,
as amended (22 U.S.C. 8791 note) (Caesar Act), the Illicit Captagon
Trafficking Suppression Act of 2023 (Public Law 118-50, div. P), and
section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.  The United
States is committed to supporting a Syria that is stable, unified, and
at peace with itself and its neighbors.  A united Syria that does not
offer a safe haven for terrorist organizations and ensures the security
of its religious and ethnic minorities will support regional security
and prosperity.  The Secretary of State and the Secretary of the
Treasury have taken initial steps towards this goal through the issuance
on May 23, 2025, of General License 25 and a waiver of sanctions under
the Caesar Act. 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of the United States to recognize that circumstances that gave
rise to the actions taken in the Executive Orders described in section
3(a) of this order, related to the policies and actions of the former
regime of Bashar al-Assad, have been transformed by developments over
the past 6 months, including the positive actions taken by the new
Syrian government under President Ahmed al-Sharaa.  This order supports
United States national security and foreign policy goals by directing
additional actions, including the removal of sanctions on Syria, the
issuance of waivers that permit the relaxation of export controls and
other restrictions on Syria, and other actions to be taken by the
Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of
Commerce, as well as by other executive departments and agencies
(agencies) of the United States, without providing relief to ISIS or
other terrorist organizations, human rights abusers, those linked to
chemical weapons or proliferation-related activities, or other persons
that threaten the peace, security, or stability of the United States,
Syria, and its neighbors. 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Revocation of Syria
Sanctions</span>.  (a)  Effective July 1, 2025, I hereby terminate the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13338 of May 11, 2004
(Blocking Property of Certain Persons and Prohibiting the Export of
Certain Goods to Syria), and revoke that order, as well as Executive
Order 13399 of April 25, 2006 (Blocking Property of Additional Persons
in Connection With the National Emergency With Respect to Syria),
Executive Order 13460 of February 13, 2008 (Blocking Property of
Additional Persons in Connection With the National Emergency With
Respect to Syria), Executive Order 13572 of April 29, 2011 (Blocking
Property of Certain Persons with Respect to Human Rights Abuses in
Syria), Executive Order 13573 of May 18, 2011 (Blocking Property of
Senior Officials of the Government of Syria), and Executive Order 13582
of August 17, 2011 (Blocking Property of the Government of Syria and
Prohibiting Certain Transactions with Respect to Syria).  
     (b)  Pursuant to section 202(a) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1622(a)),
termination of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13338,
as modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps taken in
Executive Order 13399, Executive Order 13460, Executive Order 13572,
Executive Order 13573, and Executive Order 13582 shall not affect any
action taken or pending proceeding not finally concluded or determined
as of July 1, 2025, any action or proceeding based on any act committed
prior to July 1, 2025, or any rights or duties that matured or penalties
that were incurred prior to July 1, 2025.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Accountability for the Former
Regime of Bashar al‑Assad</span>.  I find that additional steps must be
taken to ensure meaningful accountability for perpetrators of war
crimes, human rights violations and abuses, and the proliferation of
narcotics trafficking networks in and in relation to Syria during the
former regime of Bashar al-Assad and by those associated with it.
 Perpetrators of such actions threaten to undermine peace, security, and
stability in the region, and thereby constitute an unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the
United States.  
     (a)  I hereby expand the scope of the national emergency declared
in Executive Order 13894 of October 14, 2019 (Blocking Property and
Suspending Entry of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in
Syria), as amended in and relied on for additional steps taken in
Executive Order 14142 of January 15, 2025 (Taking Additional Steps With
Respect to the Situation in Syria), to deal with that threat, and
accordingly further amend Executive Order 13894 by:  
        (i)   striking section 1(a) and inserting, in lieu thereof, the
following:  
     “Section 1.  (a)  All property and interests in property that are
in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or

        (i)  any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in
consultation with the Secretary of State:  
          (A)  to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have
directly or indirectly engaged in, or attempted to engage in, any of the
following in or in relation to Syria:  
             (1)  actions or policies that further threaten the peace,
security, stability, or territorial integrity of Syria; or  
             (2)  the commission of serious human rights abuse;  
          (B)  to be a former government official of the former regime
of Bashar al-Assad or a person who acted for or on behalf of such an

significant risk of materially contributing to, the illicit production

or indirectly engaged in, or to be responsible for ordering,
controlling, or otherwise directing, instances in which a United States

(ii) a lawful permanent resident with significant ties to the United
States) went missing in Syria during the former regime of Bashar
al-Assad;   
          (E)  to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided
financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services
to or in support of:   
             (1)  the former regime of Bashar al-Assad;   
             (2)  any activity described in subsections
(a)(i)(A)–(a)(i)(D) of this section; or   
             (3)  any person whose property and interests in property
are blocked pursuant to this order;   
          (F)  to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or
purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person
whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this
order; or  
          (G)  to be an adult family member of a person designated under
subsections (a)(i)(A)–(a)(i)(D) of this section.”; and  
        (ii)  striking section 2(a) and inserting, in lieu thereof, the
following:    
     “Sec. 2.  (a)  The Secretary of State, in consultation with the
Secretary of the Treasury and other officials of the United States
Government as appropriate, is hereby authorized to impose on a foreign
person any of the sanctions described in subsections (b) and (c) of this
section, upon determining that the person, on or after the date of this
order:   
        (i)    is responsible for or complicit in, has directly or
indirectly engaged in, or attempted to engage in, or financed the
obstruction, disruption, or prevention of efforts to promote a Syria
that is stable, unified, and at peace with itself and its neighbors,
including:  
          (A)  the convening and conduct of a credible and inclusive
Syrian-led constitutional process;  
          (B)  the preparation for and conduct of supervised elections,
pursuant to the new constitution, that are free and fair and to the
highest international standards of transparency and accountability; or  
          (C)  the development of a Syrian government that is
representative and reflects the will of the Syrian people;  
        (ii)   is an adult family member of a person designated under
subsection (a)(i) of this section; or  
        (iii)  is responsible for or complicit in, or has directly or
indirectly engaged in, or attempted to engage in, the expropriation of
property, including real property, for personal gain or political
purposes in Syria.”  
     (b)  I additionally amend Executive Order 13606 of April 22, 2012
(Blocking the Property and Suspending Entry into the United States of
Certain Persons With Respect to Grave Human Rights Abuses by the
Governments of Iran and Syria Via Information Technology), by removing
the following text from the preamble:  “Executive Order 13338 of May 11,
2004, as modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps in
subsequent Executive Orders” and replacing it with:  “Executive Order
13894 of October 14, 2019, and relied upon for additional steps and
further amended in subsequent Executive Orders.”
