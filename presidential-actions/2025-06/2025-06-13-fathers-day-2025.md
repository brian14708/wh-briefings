By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America’s fathers are the custodians of our strength, the leaders of our
families, and the protectors of our security and safety.  This Father’s
Day, my Administration pays tribute to every father whose fierce love,
heroic devotion, and inspiring example are molding the next generation.

Whether by birth, adoption, or father figures, America’s dads help shape
the character and future of our Nation.  Through their example, they
instill strength, integrity, and perseverance in their children.  They
rise early, work late, make sacrifices, and remain steadfast in their
love and commitment to their families.  Fathers lead through action,
speak with purpose, and impart wisdom honed by experience.  From their
children’s earliest days as infants through their journey into
adulthood, fathers leave a lasting influence that reaches far beyond the
walls of their homes.

The presence of a father also serves to plant the seeds of virtue and
instill American values in their children.  For many, dads are the first
to teach the value of hard work, love of country, and the importance of
living with conviction.  With every generation, these lessons are
carried forth. 

As President, I am fighting every day for America’s fathers and families
— preserving the Child Tax Credit, expanding school choice, and
restoring the fundamental rights of parents to raise their children free
from Government interference.  I will always stand with our dads in
shielding children from the toxic lies of gender ideology, and I will
never stop working to keep our neighborhoods safe by backing our law
enforcement, crushing violent crime, and ensuring our southern border
remains sealed and secure.  Together, we are building a Nation where
fathers can lead with strength, protect their families, and pass on the
timeless values that make America great.

Today, we celebrate the invaluable role our fathers play in shaping our
families, guiding our communities, and strengthening our country — and
we offer our unending thanks for their leadership, selflessness, and
inspiration.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, in accordance with a joint resolution of the Congress approved
April 24, 1972, as amended (36 U.S.C. 109), do hereby proclaim June 15,
2025, as Father’s Day.  I call on United States Government officials to
display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on
Father’s Day and invite State and local governments and the people of
the United States to observe Father’s Day with appropriate ceremonies.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day
of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-ninth.

DONALD J. TRUMP
