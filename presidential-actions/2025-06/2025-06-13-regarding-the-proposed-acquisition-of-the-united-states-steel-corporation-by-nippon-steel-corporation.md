title: Regarding the Proposed Acquisition of the United States Steel Corporation by
  Nippon Steel Corporation
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including section 721 of the
Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (section 721), 50 U.S.C.
4565, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Review
by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States</span>.  (a)
 On March 14, 2024, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United
States (CFIUS) received a voluntary notice describing the proposed
acquisition by (1) Nippon Steel Corporation, a corporation organized
under the laws of Japan (Nippon Steel); (2) Nippon Steel North America,
Inc., a New York corporation (Nippon Steel NA); and (3) 2023 Merger
Subsidiary, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with Nippon Steel and
Nippon Steel NA, the Purchasers), of United States Steel Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (U.S. Steel, and such proposed acquisition, the
Proposed Transaction).  CFIUS subsequently initiated a review and
investigation of the Proposed Transaction, which ultimately concluded
with a referral to the President on December 23, 2024, for decision
pursuant to section 721(d).  
(b)  On January 3, 2025, pursuant to section 721(d)(1), then-President
Biden issued an order titled “Regarding the Proposed Acquisition of
United States Steel Corporation by Nippon Steel Corporation” (January 3
Order), which prohibited the Proposed Transaction.  
(c)  The statutory provision on which the January 3 Order was based
authorizes the President to “take such action for such time as the
President considers appropriate to suspend or prohibit any covered
transaction that threatens to impair the national security of the United
States.”  50 U.S.C. 4565(d)(1).  Consistent with that authority, section
3 of the January 3 Order reserved the President’s authority to issue
further orders as “necessary to protect the national security of the
United States.”  
(d)  Pursuant to the authority referred to in subsection (c) of this
section, and the President’s authority to reconsider prior actions, on
April 7, 2025, I issued a Presidential Memorandum, entitled “Review of
Proposed United States Steel Corporation Acquisition” (April 7 Memo),
which directed CFIUS to conduct a de novo review of the Proposed
Transaction to assist me in determining whether further action in this
matter may be appropriate.  
(e)  CFIUS submitted a recommendation to me on May 21, 2025, which, in
accordance with the April 7 Memo, described CFIUS agency views regarding
the risks to national security arising as a result of the Proposed
Transaction, and included views on whether any measures proposed by U.S.
Steel and the Purchasers are sufficient to mitigate those national
security risks.  The recommendation included a statement describing the
position of each member agency of CFIUS, including the reasons for such
position.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Findings</span>. 
(a)  I hereby affirm the following findings, made initially in the
January 3 Order:  
(i)   there is credible evidence that leads me to believe that the
Purchasers, through the Proposed Transaction, might take action that
threatens to impair the national security of the United States; and  
(ii)  provisions of law other than section 721 and the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq*.) do not, in my
judgment, provide adequate and appropriate authority for me to protect
the national security in this matter.  
(b)  Based on the recommendation of and my review of the materials
provided by CFIUS, including re-review of the prior assessment of risk,
I additionally find that the threatened impairment to the national
security of the United States arising as a result of the Proposed
Transaction can be adequately mitigated if the conditions set forth in
section 3 of this order are met.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Actions Ordered and
Authorized</span>.  On the basis of the findings set forth in section 2
of this order, considering the factors described in subsection 721(f) of
the Defense Production Act of 1950, as appropriate, and pursuant to my
authority under applicable law, including section 721, I hereby order
that:  
(a)  Section 2(a) of the January 3 Order is amended to read as follows:
 “The Proposed Transaction, and any substantially similar transaction
between the Purchasers and U.S. Steel, whether effected directly or
indirectly by the Purchasers, through the Purchasers’ shareholders or
shareholders’ immediate, intermediate, or ultimate foreign person
beneficial owners, or through the Purchasers’ partners, subsidiaries, or
affiliates, is prohibited, unless the Purchasers and U.S. Steel execute
with the Department of the Treasury and any other appropriate member
agencies of CFIUS, on or before the closing date of the Proposed
Transaction, and remain in compliance thereafter with, a national
security agreement (NSA) that is materially consistent, as so determined
by the Department of the Treasury, with the draft NSA submitted to the
Purchasers and U.S. Steel by the United States Government on June 13,
2025.”  
(b)  Section 2(e) of the January 3 Order is amended to read as follows:
 “Without limitation on the exercise of authority by any agency under
other provisions of law, and until such time as the Purchasers and U.S.
Steel have either abandoned the Proposed Transaction to the satisfaction
of CFIUS or entered into the NSA referred to in subsection (a) of this
section, CFIUS is further authorized to implement measures, including
monitoring and enforcement measures, it deems necessary and appropriate
with regard to the Proposed Transaction to protect the national security
of the United States, including measures available to it under section
721 and its implementing regulations, which include the remedies
available for violations of any order, agreement, or condition entered
into or imposed under section 721.”  
(c)  Sections 2(b) and 2(c) of the January 3 Order are stricken.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Reservation</span>.  I hereby
reserve my authority to issue further orders with respect to the
Purchasers or U.S. Steel as shall in my judgment be necessary to protect
the national security of the United States.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Publication and
Transmittal</span>.  (a)  This order shall be published in the *Federal
Register*.  
(b)  I hereby direct the Secretary of the Treasury to transmit a copy of
this order to the parties to the Proposed Transaction named in section 1
of this order.
