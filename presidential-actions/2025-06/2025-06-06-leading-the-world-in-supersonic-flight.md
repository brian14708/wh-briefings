MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES  
THE ADMINISTRATORS OF THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE  
AND MEDICAID SERVICES  
  
SUBJECT:       Eliminating Waste, Fraud, and Abuse in Medicaid

My Administration has been relentlessly committed to rooting out waste,
fraud, and abuse in Government programs to preserve and protect them for
those who rely most on them.   
  
The Medicaid program was designed to be a program to compassionately
provide taxpayer dollars to healthcare providers who offer care to the
most vulnerable Americans.  To keep payments reasonable, billable costs
for such care were historically capped at the same level that healthcare
providers could receive from Medicare.  The State and Federal
Governments jointly shared this cost burden to ensure those of lesser
means did not go untreated.  
  
Under the Biden Administration, States and healthcare providers were
permitted to game the system.  For example, States “taxed” healthcare
providers, but sent the same money back to them in the form of a
“Medicaid payment,” which automatically unlocked for healthcare
providers an additional “burden-sharing” payment from the Federal
Government.  Through this gimmick, the State could avoid contributing
money toward Medicaid services, meaning the State no longer had a reason
to be prudent in the amount of reimbursement provided.  Instead of
paying Medicare rates, many States that utilize these arrangements now
pay the same healthcare providers almost three times the Medicare
amount, a practice encouraged by the Biden Administration.  
  
These State Directed Payments have rapidly accelerated, quadrupling in
magnitude over the last 4 years and reaching $110 billion in 2024 alone.
 This trajectory threatens the Federal Treasury and Medicaid’s long-term
stability, and the imbalance between Medicaid and Medicare patients
threatens to jeopardize access to care for our seniors.  
  
I pledged to protect and improve these important Government healthcare
programs for those that rely on them.  Seniors on Medicare and Medicaid
recipients both deserve access to quality care in a system free from the
fraud, waste, and abuse, that enriches the unscrupulous and jeopardizes
the programs themselves.  We will take action to continue to love and
cherish the Medicare and Medicaid programs to ensure they are preserved
for those who need them most.  
  
The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall therefore take
appropriate action to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid,
including by ensuring Medicaid payments rates are not higher than
Medicare, to the extent permitted by applicable law.    
  
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
