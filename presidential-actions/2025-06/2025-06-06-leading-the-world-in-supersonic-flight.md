title: Leading The World in Supersonic Flight
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  The United
States stands at the threshold of a bold new chapter in aerospace
innovation.  For more than 50 years, outdated and overly restrictive
regulations have grounded the promise of supersonic flight over land,
stifling American ingenuity, weakening our global competitiveness, and
ceding leadership to foreign adversaries.  Advances in aerospace
engineering, materials science, and noise reduction now make supersonic
flight not just possible, but safe, sustainable, and commercially
viable.  This order begins a historic national effort to reestablish the
United States as the undisputed leader in high-speed aviation.  By
updating obsolete standards and embracing the technologies of today and
tomorrow, we will empower our engineers, entrepreneurs, and visionaries
to deliver the next generation of air travel, which will be faster,
quieter, safer, and more efficient than ever before.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Regulatory Reform for
Supersonic Flight</span>.  (a)  The Administrator of the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) shall take the necessary steps, including
through rulemaking, to repeal the prohibition on overland supersonic
flight in 14 CFR 91.817 within 180 days of the date of this order and
establish an interim noise-based certification standard, making any
modifications to 14 CFR 91.818 as necessary, as consistent with
applicable law.  The Administrator of the FAA shall also take immediate
steps to repeal 14 CFR 91.819 and 91.821, which will remove additional
regulatory barriers that hinder the advancement of supersonic aviation
technology in the United States.

\(b\)  Within 18 months of the date of this order, the Administrator of
the FAA shall issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to establish
a standard for supersonic aircraft noise certification under 14 CFR Part
36 and amend 14 CFR 91.817.  The proposed rule shall define acceptable
noise thresholds for takeoff, landing, and en-route supersonic operation
based on operational testing and research, development, testing, and
evaluation (RDT&E) data as identified in subsection 3(a) of this order,
and considering community acceptability, economic reasonableness, and
technological feasibility.  The proposed rule shall further specify a
process for periodic review and update of the rule to reflect future
advances in aircraft noise reduction technology.  Any final rule in
connection with the NPRM shall be issued within 24 months of the date of
this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Advancing Supersonic Research
and Development</span>.  (a)  The Director of the Office of Science and
Technology Policy (OSTP) shall, in consultation with the heads of
relevant executive departments and agencies (agencies), including the
Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of
Transportation, and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, coordinate supersonic research and development
through the National Science and Technology Council, with the goal of:

\(i\)    identifying RDT&E needs for regulatory development, commercial
viability, and operational integration of supersonic aircraft into the
National Airspace System;

\(ii\)   coordinating federally funded RDT&E and industry-led testing of
supersonic technologies at Federal test sites; and

\(iii\)  collecting and sharing the results of such RDT&E in a manner
suitable for informing domestic regulatory development and international
science and technology engagement on civil supersonic matters.

\(b\)  The Director of OSTP shall provide the results of the coordinated
efforts in subsection (a) of this section to the Administrator of the
FAA to inform the development of future procedures, regulations, and
policies, including those related to the certification of civil
supersonic aircraft and noise and environmental standards called for in
this section 3.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Promoting International
Engagement on Civil Supersonic Flight Regulations</span>.  (a)  The
Secretary of Transportation, acting through the Administrator of the
FAA, and in consultation with the Director of OSTP and the heads of
other agencies as considered appropriate by the Director of OSTP, shall
engage the International Civil Aviation Organization and key foreign
partners to seek global alignment regarding supersonic regulatory
approaches.

\(b\)  The Administrator of the FAA, under the supervision of the
Secretary of Transportation and in coordination with the Secretary of
State, shall seek to secure bilateral aviation safety agreements with
foreign aviation authorities as necessary for the safe international
operation of supersonic aircraft.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.  (a)
 Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:

\(i\)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or
agency, or the head thereof; or

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

\(c\)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

\(d\) The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Federal Aviation Administration.
