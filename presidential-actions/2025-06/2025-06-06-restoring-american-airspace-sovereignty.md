title: Restoring American Airspace Sovereignty
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>. Unmanned
aircraft systems (UAS), otherwise known as drones, offer the potential
to enhance public safety as well as cement America’s leadership in
global innovation.  But criminals, terrorists, and hostile foreign
actors have intensified their weaponization of these technologies,
creating new and serious threats to our homeland.  Drug cartels use UAS
to smuggle fentanyl across our borders, deliver contraband into prisons,
surveil law enforcement, and otherwise endanger the public.  Mass
gatherings are vulnerable to disruptions and threats by unauthorized UAS
flights.  Critical infrastructure, including military bases, is subject
to frequent — and often unidentified — UAS incursions.  Immediate action
is needed to ensure American sovereignty over its skies and that its
airspace remains safe and secure.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Definitions</span>.  For the
purposes of this order:

\(a\)  the term “unmanned aircraft systems” or “UAS” has the meaning
given in 49 U.S.C. 44801;

\(b\)  the term “critical infrastructure” has the meaning given in 42
U.S.C. 5195c(e), and includes systems and assets in all of the
designated critical infrastructure sectors identified in National
Security Memorandum 22 of April 30, 2024 (Critical Infrastructure
Security and Resilience) (NSM-22); and

\(c\)  the term Sector Risk Management Agency or “SRMA” has the same
meaning given in 6 U.S.C. 650 and as further described in NSM-22.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>. ** **It is the
policy of the United States to ensure control over our national airspace
and to protect the public, critical infrastructure, mass gathering
events, and military and sensitive government installations and
operations from threats posed by the careless or unlawful use of UAS.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Task Force to Restore American
Airspace Sovereignty</span>.  To assist in ensuring control over our
national airspace, there is hereby established the Federal Task Force to
Restore American Airspace Sovereignty (Task Force).  The Task Force
shall be chaired by the Assistant to the President for National Security
Affairs (APNSA) or a designee, and include principals, or their
designees, from appropriate executive departments and agencies as
identified by the APNSA.  The Task Force shall review relevant
operational, technical, and regulatory frameworks and develop and
propose solutions to UAS threats, as appropriate and consistent with
applicable law, and shall make recommendations on the implementation of
all actions identified in this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Airspace Regulations to
Protect the Public</span>.  The Administrator of the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) shall:

\(a\)  with respect to the rulemaking required by section 2209(f) of the
FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016, as amended:

\(i\)   promptly submit a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Task Force establishing
the statutorily required process for restricting drone flights over
fixed site facilities, and interpreting, to the extent appropriate,
critical infrastructure consistent with the definition of that term in
this order; and

\(ii\)  promulgate a final rule as soon as practicable after publication
of the NPRM;

\(b\)  make national security and homeland security assessments under
section 2209 in coordination with Sector Risk Management Agencies
(SRMAs), the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Homeland Security,
or the Attorney General, as appropriate, and whenever military
installations or operations are implicated, with the Secretary of
Defense; and

\(c\)  within 180 days of the date of this order, make freely available
online Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) and Temporary Flight Restrictions
(TFRs) in an open format easily accepted for drone geofencing and
Aircraft Navigation and Guidance system purposes.  This online
availability should supplement, but not replace, existing NOTAMs and TFR
promulgation methods.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Enhancing Airspace
Sovereignty</span>.  (a)  the Attorney General, in coordination with the
Administrator of the FAA, shall take appropriate steps to ensure full
enforcement of applicable civil and criminal laws when drone operators
endanger the public, violate established airspace restrictions, or
operate a drone in furtherance of an element of another crime;

\(b\)  on a recurring basis, the Attorney General shall submit to the
President, through the APNSA, legislative proposals that would revise
criminal penalties for violations of restricted airspace; and

\(c\)  within 30 days of the date of this order, and to the extent
allowed by law, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland
Security shall ensure that their respective departments’ grant programs
permit otherwise eligible State, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT)
agencies to receive grants to purchase UAS or equipment or services for
the detection, tracking, or identification of drones and drone signals,
consistent with the legal authorities of those SLTTs.

permitted by law and consistent with the Fourth Amendment, executive
departments and agencies shall use all available existing authorities to
employ equipment to detect, track, and identify drones and drone
signals.

\(b\)  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Attorney General,
the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and
the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission shall revise the
August 2020 “Advisory on the Application of Federal Laws to the
Acquisition and Use of Technology to Detect and Mitigate Unmanned
Aircraft Systems” to reflect relevant developments in Federal law and
regulations addressing drones.

\(c\)  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of
the FAA shall provide, to the extent permitted by law, including the
Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), automated real-time access to
personal identifying information associated with UAS remote
identification signals to appropriate executive departments and agencies
and SLTT agencies for the purposes of enforcing applicable Federal or
State law, with appropriate national security and privacy safeguards.

\(d\)  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of

submit a recommendation to the President, through the APNSA, using
risk-based assessment as defined in 6 U.S.C. 124n(k)(8), on whether the
northern and southern land borders; large airports; Federal facilities;
critical infrastructure; and military installations, facilities, and
assets should be designated as covered facilities or assets under 6
U.S.C. 124n and 10 U.S.C. 130i and whether any changes to law would be
necessary relating to such designation.
