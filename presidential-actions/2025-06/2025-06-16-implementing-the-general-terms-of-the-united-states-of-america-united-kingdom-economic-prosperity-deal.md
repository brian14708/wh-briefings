title: Implementing the General Terms of The United States of America-United Kingdom
  Economic Prosperity Deal
---
 
  
       By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution
and the laws of the United States of America, including the
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq*.),
the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq*.), section 232 of
the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862) (section
232), section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483),
and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby determine and
order:  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>*.*  On May 8,
2025, United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer and I announced the
General Terms for the United States of America and the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland Economic Prosperity Deal (General
Terms).  The General Terms outline a historic trade deal that provides
American companies unprecedented access to British markets while
bolstering the national security and economy of the United States.  The
deal includes billions of dollars of increased market access for
American exports, especially for beef, ethanol, and certain other
American agricultural exports.  In addition, the United Kingdom will
reduce or eliminate numerous non-tariff barriers that unfairly
discriminate against American products, hurt the United States’
manufacturing base, and threaten the national security of the United
States.  
     The General Terms provide, among other things, that the United
States intends to create an annual quota of 100,000 vehicles for United
Kingdom automotive imports at a 10 percent tariff rate.  In the General
Terms, the United Kingdom also committed to working to meet American
requirements on the security of the supply chains of steel and aluminum
products intended for export to the United States and on the nature of
ownership of relevant production facilities.  Provided the United
Kingdom meets these requirements, the United States intends to promptly
construct a quota at most-favored-nation rates for steel and aluminum
articles and certain derivative steel and aluminum articles that are
products of the United Kingdom in the context of implementing the
General Terms.    
     Furthermore, in the General Terms, the United States and the United
Kingdom committed to negotiate significantly preferential treatment
outcomes on pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients that are
products of the United Kingdom, contingent on the findings of an
investigation regarding pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients
under section 232, and provided that the United Kingdom complies with
certain supply chain security standards.  Finally, in the General Terms,
the United States and the United Kingdom committed to adopt a
structured, negotiated approach to addressing United States national
security concerns regarding sectors that may be subject to future
section 232 investigations.  To that end, the United States and the
United Kingdom further committed to strengthen aerospace and aircraft
manufacturing supply chains by establishing tariff-free bilateral trade
in certain aerospace products.  
     In my judgment, I determine that the following actions are
consistent with the national interests of the United States and are
necessary and appropriate to deal with the national emergency declared
in Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a
Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large
and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), as amended,
and to reduce or eliminate the threats to national security found in
Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into
the United States), as amended; Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018
(Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), as amended; and
Proclamation 9888 of May 17, 2019 (Adjusting Imports of Automobiles and
Automobile Parts Into the United States), as amended.  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Automobiles and Automobile
Parts</span>.  (a)  I hereby establish an annual tariff-rate quota of
100,000 automobiles as classified in heading 8703 of the Harmonized
Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) and as further specified in
note 33(b) to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS for automobiles
that are products of the United Kingdom.  Imports of automobiles within
the tariff-rate quota that would otherwise be subject to a 25 percent
tariff under Proclamation 10908 of March 26, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of
Automobiles and Automobile Parts Into the United States), shall instead
be subject to a 7.5 percent tariff, in addition to the
most-favored-nation rate for automobiles of 2.5 percent, for a combined
tariff of 10 percent.  Imports of automobiles in excess of the
tariff-rate quota shall remain subject to the full duties imposed by
Proclamation 10908.  The tariff-rate quota shall be adjusted for
calendar year 2025 to reflect the General Terms’ operative date of May
8, 2025.  The quota shall be effective 7 days after the publication of
this order in the *Federal Register*.  
     (b)  Automotive parts specified in note 33(g) to subchapter III of
chapter 99 of the HTSUS that would otherwise be subject to a 25 percent
tariff under Proclamation 10908 shall instead be subject to a total
tariff of 10 percent (including any most-favored-nation tariffs),
provided that they are products of the United Kingdom and are for use in
automobiles that are products of the United Kingdom.  This change shall
be effective as of the date of the publication of the *Federal Register*
notice described in subsection (c) of this section.   
     (c)  Within 7 days of the date of publication of this order in the
*Federal Register, *the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary), in
consultation with the United States International Trade Commission (ITC)

the *Federal Register* modifying the HTSUS consistent with this section,

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Aerospace</span>.  (a)  With
respect to products of the United Kingdom that fall under the World
Trade Organization Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft, the tariffs
imposed through the following Presidential actions and subsequent
amendments to those actions shall no longer apply, as of the date of
publication of the *Federal Register* notice described in subsection (b)
of this section:  
          (i)    Executive Order 14257, as amended;  
          (ii)   Proclamation 9704, as amended; and

 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Aluminum and Steel Articles
and Their Derivative Articles</span>*.*  (a)  At a future time that the
Secretary, in consultation with the United States Trade Representative,
deems appropriate, the Secretary shall design and establish a
tariff-rate quota for aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles
that are products of the United Kingdom, consistent with the General
Terms and the purpose of this order.  Imports of aluminum articles or
derivative aluminum articles that are products of the United Kingdom in
excess of the tariff-rate quota established by the Secretary shall
remain subject to the duties set forth in Proclamation 9704, as
amended.   
     (b)  At a future time that the Secretary, in consultation with the
United States Trade Representative, deems appropriate, the Secretary
shall design and establish a tariff-rate quota for steel articles and

Imports of steel articles or derivative steel articles that are products
of the United Kingdom in excess of the tariff-rate quota established by
the Secretary shall remain subject to the duties set forth in
Proclamation 9705, as amended.  
     (c)  In determining when to establish, whether to establish, and
the design of a tariff-rate quota for aluminum and steel articles and
their derivatives, the Secretary shall act in a manner consistent with
the national interests of the United States and the purpose of this
order and shall consider factors he deems appropriate, such as actions
taken by the United Kingdom to implement the General Terms and any final
agreement entered by the United States and the United Kingdom subsequent
to the General Terms; the need to deal with the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 14257, as amended; and the need to reduce or
eliminate the threats to national security found in Proclamation 9704,
as amended, and Proclamation 9705, as amended.
