MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL  
THE COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT

SUBJECT:       Reviewing Certain Presidential Actions

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby directed:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.  The
President of the United States, as the unitary head of the executive
branch, holds tremendous power and responsibility through his signature:
 words on paper can become the law of the land, individuals are
appointed to some of the highest offices in Government, national
policies can be created or eliminated, and prisoners can go free.  In
sum, the Nation is governed through Presidential signatures.

In recent months, it has become increasingly apparent that former
President Biden’s aides abused the power of Presidential signatures
through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden’s cognitive decline and
assert Article II authority.  This conspiracy marks one of the most
dangerous and concerning scandals in American history.  The American
public was purposefully shielded from discovering who wielded the
executive power, all while Biden’s signature was deployed across
thousands of documents to effect radical policy shifts.  

For years, President Biden suffered from serious cognitive decline.  The
Department of Justice, for example, concluded that, despite clear
evidence that Biden had broken the law, he should not stand trial owing
to his incompetent mental state.  Biden’s cognitive issues and apparent
mental decline during his Presidency were even “worse” in private, and
those closest to him “tried to hide it” from the public.  To do so,
Biden’s advisors during his years in office severely restricted his news
conferences and media appearances, and they scripted his conversations
with lawmakers, government officials, and donors, all to cover up his
inability to discharge his duties. 

Notwithstanding these well-documented issues, the White House issued
over 1,200 Presidential documents, appointed 235 judges to the Federal
bench, and issued more pardons and commutations than any administration
in United States history.  For instance, just 2 days before Christmas in
2024, the White House announced that Biden commuted the sentences of 37
of the 40 most vile and monstrous criminals on Federal death row,
including several child killers and mass murderers.

Although the authority to take these executive actions, along with many
others, is constitutionally committed to the President, there are
serious doubts as to the decision making process and even the degree of
Biden’s awareness of these actions being taken in his name. 

The vast majority of Biden’s executive actions were signed using a
mechanical signature pen, often called an autopen, as opposed to Biden’s
own hand.  This was especially true of actions taken during the second
half of his Presidency, when his cognitive decline had apparently become
even more clear to those working most closely with him.

Given clear indications that President Biden lacked the capacity to
exercise his Presidential authority, if his advisors secretly used the
mechanical signature pen to conceal this incapacity, while taking
radical executive actions all in his name, that would constitute an
unconstitutional wielding of the power of the Presidency, a circumstance
that would have implications for the legality and validity of numerous
executive actions undertaken in Biden’s name.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Investigation</span>.  (a)  The
Counsel to the President, in consultation with the Attorney General and
the head of any other relevant executive department or agency (agency),
shall investigate, to the extent permitted by law, whether certain
individuals conspired to deceive the public about Biden’s mental state
and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of
the President.  This investigation shall address:

\(i\)    any activity, coordinated or otherwise, to purposefully shield
the public from information regarding Biden’s mental and physical
health;

\(ii\)   any agreements between Biden’s aides to cooperatively and
falsely deem recorded videos of the President’s cognitive inability as
fake;

(iii)  any agreements between Biden’s aides to require false, public
statements elevating the President’s capabilities; and

(iv)   the purpose of these activities, including to assert the
authorities of the President.

(b)  The Counsel to the President shall also investigate, in
consultation with the Attorney General and the head of any other
relevant agency, the circumstances surrounding Biden’s supposed
execution of numerous executive actions during his final years in
office. This investigation shall address:

(i)   the policy documents for which the autopen was used, including
clemency grants, Executive Orders, Presidential memoranda, or other
Presidential policy decisions; and

(ii)  who directed that the President’s signature be affixed.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. 
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
