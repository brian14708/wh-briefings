title: Empowering Commonsense Wildfire Prevention and Response
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>. The devastation
of the January 2025 Los Angeles wildfires shocked the American people
and highlighted the catastrophic consequences when State and local
governments are unable to quickly respond to such disasters.  In too
many cases, including in California, a slow and inadequate response to
wildfires is a direct result of reckless mismanagement and lack of
preparedness. Wildfires threaten every region, yet many local government
entities continue to disregard commonsense preventative measures.
Firefighters across the country are forced to rely on outdated
technology and face challenges in quickly responding to wildfires
because of unnecessary regulation and bureaucracy.   
The Federal Government can empower State and local leaders by
streamlining Federal wildfire capabilities to improve their
effectiveness and promoting commonsense, technology-enabled local
strategies for land management and wildfire response and mitigation.    
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Streamlining Federal Wildland
Fire Governance</span>.  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the
Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall, to the
maximum degree practicable and consistent with applicable law,
consolidate their wildland fire programs to achieve the most efficient
and effective use of wildland fire offices, coordinating bodies,
programs, budgets, procurement processes, and research and, as
necessary, recommend additional measures to advance this objective.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Encouraging Local Wildfire
Preparedness and Response</span>.  (a)  Within 90 days of the date of
this order, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of
Agriculture, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security,
shall:  
        (i)   expand and strengthen the use of partnerships, agreements,
compacts, and mutual aid capabilities that empower Federal, State,
local, tribal, and community-driven land management that reduces
wildfire risk and improves wildfire response, including on public lands;
and  
        (ii)  develop and expand the use of other measures to
incentivize responsible land management and wildfire prevention,
mitigation, and response measures at the State and local levels.  
(b)  Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the
Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the
Secretary of Commerce and the heads of executive departments and
agencies (agencies) represented at the National Interagency Fire Center,
shall:  
        (i)   develop a comprehensive technology roadmap, in
consultation with the Director of the Office of Science and Technology
Policy (OSTP), to increase wildfire firefighting capabilities at the
State and local levels, including through artificial intelligence, data
sharing, innovative modeling and mapping capabilities, and technology to
identify wildland fire ignitions and weather forecasts to inform
response and evacuation; and  
        (ii)  promote the use of a risk-informed approach, as consistent
with Executive Order 14239 of March 18, 2025 (Achieving Efficiency
Through State and Local Preparedness), to develop new policies that
remove barriers to preventing and responding to wildfires, including
through year-round response readiness, better forest health, and
activities outlined in Executive Order 14225 of March 1, 2025 (Immediate
Expansion of American Timber Production).  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Strengthening Wildfire
Mitigation</span>.  Within 90 days of the date of this order:  
(a)  The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall
consider modifying or rescinding, as consistent with applicable law,
Federal rules or policies that impede the use of appropriate,
preventative prescribed fires.  
(b)  The Secretary of Agriculture and the Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Secretary of
the Interior, shall consider modifying or rescinding, as consistent with
applicable law, Federal rules or policies hindering the appropriate use
of fire retardant to fight wildfires.  
(c)  The Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the Secretary of
the Interior, shall consider promoting, assisting, and facilitating, as
consistent with applicable law, innovative uses of woody biomass and
forest products to reduce fuel loads in areas at risk of wildfires.  
(d)  The Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, the
Secretary of Energy, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall
consider initiating rulemaking proceedings to establish, as consistent
with applicable law, best practices to reduce the risk of wildfire
ignition from the bulk-power system without increasing costs for
electric-power end users, including through methods such as vegetation
management, the removal of forest-hazardous fuels along transmission
lines, improved engineering approaches, and safer operational practices.
   
(e)  The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of
Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior, shall review pending and
proposed wildfire-related litigation involving electrical utility
companies to ensure the Department’s positions and proposed resolutions
in such matters advance the wildfire prevention and mitigation efforts
identified in this order.

 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Modernizing Wildfire
Prevention and Response</span>.   
(a)  Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of
Defense, in consultation with the Director of OSTP, the Assistant to the
President for National Security Affairs, and the heads of relevant
agencies, shall, as appropriate, identify, declassify, and make publicly
available historical satellite datasets that will advance wildfire
prevention and response and improve wildfire prediction and evaluation
models.  
(b)  Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the
Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the
Secretary of Commerce and the heads of agencies represented at the
National Interagency Fire Center, shall:  
        (i)   Identify rules that impede wildfire prevention, detection,
or response and consider eliminating or revising those rules, as
consistent with applicable law.  This consideration and any resulting
rulemaking proceedings shall be reflected in the Fall 2025 Unified
Regulatory Agenda.   
        (ii)  Develop performance metrics for wildfire response,
including metrics related to average response times, annual fuels
treatments, safety and cost effectiveness, and other subjects, as
appropriate for inclusion in strategic and annual performance plans.  
(c)  Within 210 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense
shall evaluate and, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law,
prioritize the sale of excess aircraft and aircraft parts to support
wildfire mitigation and response.
