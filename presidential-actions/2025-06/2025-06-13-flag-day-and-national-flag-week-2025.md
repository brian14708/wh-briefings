BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  
   
A PROCLAMATION

On June 14, 1777, a banner of red, white, and blue was woven into
history when the Second Continental Congress passed the First Flag
Resolution, making our beloved Stars and Stripes the official flag of
our emerging Republic.  This Flag Day and National Flag Week, we pause
to revere the star-spangled emblem of our freedom — and we honor the
nearly 250 years of valor, sacrifice, and patriotism it has gloriously
inspired.

  
In the summer of 1777, more than 2 years into the Revolution and nearly
1 year after the American Colonies declared their Independence from
Great Britain, the need for unity, strength, and national identity was
essential.  On June 14, the Congress convened to adopt a momentous
resolution that galvanized the Colonies under a majestic and commanding
insignia and proclaimed “the flag of the United States be made of
thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen
stars, white in a blue field, representing a new Constellation.”  In the
midst of revolution, the emblem of our freedom was born — and the
mightiest symbol for sovereignty and justice ever conceived by human
hands was sewn into existence.

  
For nearly 250 years, Old Glory has presided over every chapter of the
American story.  It gallantly flew as General George Washington crossed
the Delaware, as President Abraham Lincoln spoke at Gettysburg, and as
American forces raised it on the summit of Iwo Jima, the shores of
Inchon, and in the jungles of Vietnam.  It waved from the moon on July
20, 1969 and rose from the ashes at Ground Zero on September 11, 2001 —
and time and again, it has been valiantly defended by patriots when
extremist bands of anti-American agitators have sought to desecrate and
destroy it.

  
Through every trial and triumph, the American flag has stood as an
enduring symbol of courage, unity, and the unwavering belief that
nothing will ever stand in the way of our beloved homeland, heritage,
history, and values.  This week, as we pause in grateful allegiance to
our beautiful flag, we pray for God’s continued providence and
protection.  May the red, white, and blue forever reign over the
greatest Nation in the history of the world — and may it always prevail
over those who seek to tear it down.

  
To commemorate the adoption of our flag, the Congress, by joint
resolution approved August 3, 1949, as amended (63 Stat. 492),
designated June 14 of each year as “Flag Day” and requested that the
President issue an annual proclamation calling for its observance and
for the display of the flag of the United States on all Federal
Government buildings.  The Congress also requested, by joint resolution
approved June 9, 1966, as amended (80 Stat. 194), that the President
issue annually a proclamation designating the week in which June 14
occurs as “National Flag Week” and calling upon all citizens of the
United States to display the flag during that week.

  
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, do hereby proclaim June 14, 2025, as Flag Day, and the week
starting June 8, 2025, as National Flag Week.  I direct the appropriate
officials to display the flag on all Federal Government buildings during
this week, and I urge all Americans to observe Flag Day and National
Flag Week by displaying the flag.  I also encourage the people of the
United States to proudly observe with all due ceremony those days from
Flag Day through Independence Day, set aside by the Congress (89 Stat.
211), as a time to honor America, to celebrate our heritage in public
gatherings and activities, and to publicly recite the Pledge of
Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America.

  
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
thirteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord
two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States
of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.  
   
   
                              DONALD J. TRUMP
