title: National Ocean Month, 2025

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  
   
A PROCLAMATION

This National Ocean Month, my Administration recognizes the foundational
role our bordering oceans have played in our treasured national story —
and we pledge to harness their resources, preserve their majesty, and
channel their power to safeguard American interests and uphold our way
of life.  

As President, I am steadfastly committed to restoring America’s maritime
dominance — including in the realms of trade, military readiness, and
resource production.  For this reason, on my first day in office, I
proudly renamed the largest gulf in the world to the Gulf of America,
recognizing its status as a vital extension of the Atlantic Ocean and
its central role in our economy, history, and national identity.  

To further expand American leadership at sea, I signed an Executive
Order to revitalize our Nation’s dominance in offshore critical minerals
and resources.  Every day, we are rapidly developing our domestic
capabilities for the exploration, production, and processing of critical
minerals from the deep seabed that are vital to our economic and
strategic advantage.  In April, I signed a proclamation to open the
Pacific Remote Islands National Monument to commercial fishing.  As part
of my America First vision, I also took action to bring back American
seafood competitiveness, end trade practices that harm American
fishermen, and boost domestic seafood production and exports.   

Under my leadership, we are in the midst of a new chapter of American
freedom, prosperity, and strength — both within our shores and beyond
our coasts.  

This National Ocean Month, my Administration renews its resolve to usher
in a new and radiant golden age both at home and at sea — using our
oceans and their magnificent resources to empower our citizens, defend
our homeland, and preserve our glorious American sovereignty for
generations to come.  

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2025 as National
Ocean Month.  This month, I call upon Americans to reflect on the value
and importance of oceans not only to our security, environment, and
economy but also as a source of recreation and enjoyment.  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
sixth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-ninth.  
   
   
                               DONALD J. TRUMP
