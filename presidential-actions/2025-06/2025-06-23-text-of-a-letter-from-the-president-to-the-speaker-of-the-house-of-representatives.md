Dear Mr. Speaker:   (Dear Mr. President:)

On the night of June 21, 2025, at my direction, United States forces
conducted a precision strike against three nuclear facilities in Iran
used by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its nuclear
weapons development program.  The strike was taken to advance vital
United States national interests, and in collective self-defense of our
ally, Israel, by eliminating Iran’s nuclear program.

The strike was limited in scope and purpose.  The United States
discretely targeted three Iranian nuclear facilities.  Iranian troops
and other military facilities were not targeted.  No United States
ground forces were used in the strike, and the mission was planned and
executed in a manner designed to minimize casualties, deter future
attacks, and limit the risk of escalation.

I directed this military action consistent with my responsibility to
protect United States citizens both at home and abroad as well as in
furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy
interests.  I acted pursuant to my constitutional authority as Commander
in Chief and Chief Executive and pursuant to my constitutional authority
to conduct United States foreign relations.  The United States took this
necessary and proportionate action consistent with international law,
and the United States stands ready to take further action, as necessary
and appropriate, to address further threats or attacks.

I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress
fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law
93-148).  I appreciate the support of the Congress in this action.

                  Sincerely,

                             DONALD J. TRUMP<span id="_msocom_1"></span>
