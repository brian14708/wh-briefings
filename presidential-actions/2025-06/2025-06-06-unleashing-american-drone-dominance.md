title: Unleashing American Drone Dominance
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  Unmanned
aircraft systems (UAS), otherwise known as drones, enhance United States
productivity, create high-skilled jobs, and are reshaping the future of
aviation.  Drones are already transforming industries from logistics and
infrastructure inspection to precision agriculture, emergency response,
and public safety.  Emerging technologies such as electric Vertical
Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft promise to modernize methods for
cargo delivery, passenger transport, and other advanced air mobility
capabilities.

The United States must accelerate the safe commercialization of drone
technologies and fully integrate UAS into the National Airspace System.
 The time has come to accelerate testing and to enable routine drone
operations, scale up domestic production, and expand the export of
trusted, American-manufactured drone technologies to global markets.
 Building a strong and secure domestic drone sector is vital to reducing
reliance on foreign sources, strengthening critical supply chains, and
ensuring that the benefits of this technology are delivered to the
American people.
