title: Further Extending the TikTok Enforcement Delay
---
 
  
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Extension</span>. 
(a)  The enforcement delay specified in section 2(a) of Executive Order
14166 of January 20, 2025 (Application of Protecting Americans from
Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act to TikTok), as extended by
Executive Order 14258 of April 4, 2025 (Extending the TikTok Enforcement
Delay), is further extended until September 17, 2025.  During this
period, the Department of Justice shall take no action to enforce the
Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act
(the “Act”) (Public Law 118-50, Div. H) or impose any penalties against
any entity for any noncompliance with the Act, including for
distributing, maintaining, or updating (or enabling the distribution,
maintenance, or updating) of any foreign adversary controlled
application as defined in the Act.  In light of this direction, even
after the expiration of the above-specified period, the Department of
Justice shall not take any action to enforce the Act or impose any
penalties against any entity for any conduct that occurred during the
above-specified period or any period prior to the issuance of this
order, including the period of time from January 19, 2025, until the
date of this order.  
(b)  The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to issue
written guidance to implement the provisions of subsection (a) of this
section.  
(c)  The Attorney General shall further issue a letter to each provider
stating that there has been no violation of the statute and that there
is no liability for any conduct that occurred during the above-specified
period, as well as for any conduct from the effective date of the Act
until the date of this order.  
(d)  Because of the national security interests at stake and because
section 2(d) of the Act vests authority for investigations and
enforcement of the Act only in the Attorney General, attempted
enforcement by the States or private parties represents an encroachment
on the powers of the Executive.  The Attorney General shall exercise all
available authority to preserve and defend the Executive’s exclusive
authority to enforce the Act.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.
 (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:  
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or  
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.  
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.  
(d)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Department of Justice.
