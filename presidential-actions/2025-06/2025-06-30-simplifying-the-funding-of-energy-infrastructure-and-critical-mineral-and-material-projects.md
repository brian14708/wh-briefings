THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE             
THE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION  
THE SECRETARY OF ENERGY  
THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

SUBJECT: Simplifying the Funding of Energy Infrastructure and Critical
Mineral and Material Projects  
   
Throughout my Administration, we have acted to make the Federal
Government more efficient and to support our domestic energy
industries.  To maintain energy dominance, executive departments and
agencies (agencies) must share information with one another when
providing funding to energy infrastructure and critical mineral and
material projects.  This will eliminate duplicative diligence processes
and improve strategic investment.  We must further ensure that
applicants for Federal funding within the energy infrastructure and
critical mineral and material industries are not burdened by
requirements to complete multiple, complex, and substantially similar
applications.  Streamlining this application process and increasing
information-sharing across agencies will enable the Federal Government
to make faster, better funding decisions that support our domestic
energy infrastructure and critical mineral and material supply chains.  
   
To the extent permissible by law, the heads of agencies to whom this
memorandum is directed shall share with the Chair of the National Energy
Dominance Council (NEDC) information regarding applications for funding,
and existing funding commitments of their respective agencies, related
to energy infrastructure or critical mineral or material-related
projects, and shall permit the Chair of the NEDC to share such
information with such other agencies as the Chair of the NEDC deems
relevant.  To the extent that sharing such information would require the
consent of the applicant, or of the funding recipient with respect to
funds that have already been committed or disbursed, agencies shall seek
such consent as expeditiously as possible.  If consent is needed prior
to sharing the relevant information, agencies shall not obligate or
disburse any funds for energy infrastructure or critical mineral or
material-related projects effective on the date of this memorandum, to
the extent permissible by law, unless the applicant or funding recipient
has provided the necessary consent as determined by the applicable
agency in consultation with the Chair of the NEDC.  Within 60 days of
the date of this memorandum, each agency to whom this memorandum is
directed shall further modify its existing information-sharing policies
and initiate appropriate rulemaking proceedings as needed to permit this
information sharing, as appropriate and consistent with applicable
law.   
   
Within 180 days of the date of this memorandum, the Director of the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Chair of the NEDC shall,
in coordination with the heads of agencies to whom this memorandum is
directed, develop a common application for Federal funding opportunities
related to energy infrastructure or critical mineral or material-related
projects that enables applicants to apply simultaneously to multiple
Federal Government funding programs using one common application.  The
common application shall include any legal terms, including consents,
necessary to facilitate the information-sharing requirements of the
preceding paragraph.  The heads of agencies to whom this memorandum is
directed shall determine, in coordination with the Chair of the NEDC and
the Director of OMB, the appropriate programs that will utilize the
common application, the technical means by which the common application
will be utilized by applicants and agencies, the material that will be
requested by the common application, the need for or permissibility of
any agency-specific addenda, relevant exemptions to use of the common
application, and any legal terms required to be included in the common
application in order to enable collection and sharing of information
across agencies.  
   
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
