I have reviewed the reports and recommendations presented to me by you
and the Secretary of State that recognition be given to the proposed
“Expo 2027 Minnesota – Healthy People, Healthy Planet:  Wellness and
Well-Being for All,” and find that such recognition will be in the
national interest.  
  
I approve granting Federal recognition to the proposed Exposition.  
  
On that basis, please advise the appropriate agencies and organizations
that official recognition is hereby granted.  
  
I would also appreciate your taking the appropriate steps to notify the
Congress of this action, in accordance with section 2(c) of Public Law
91-269.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
