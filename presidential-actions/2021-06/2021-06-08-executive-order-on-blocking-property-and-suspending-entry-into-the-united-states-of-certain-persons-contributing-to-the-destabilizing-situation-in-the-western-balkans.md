title: "Executive Order on Blocking Property And Suspending Entry Into The United\_\
  States Of Certain Persons Contributing To The Destabilizing Situation In The Western\_\
  Balkans"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) (IEEPA), the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq*.) (NEA), section
212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C.
1182(f)), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,

I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America,
hereby expand the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive
Order 13219 of June 26, 2001 (Blocking Property of Persons Who Threaten
International Stabilization Efforts in the Western Balkans), as amended
by Executive Order 13304 of May 28, 2003 (Termination of Emergencies
With Respect to Yugoslavia and Modification of Executive Order 13219 of
June 26, 2001), finding that the situation in the territory of the
former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of
Albania (the Western Balkans), over the past two decades, including the
undermining of post-war agreements and institutions following the
breakup of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as well
as widespread corruption within various governments and institutions in
the Western Balkans, stymies progress toward effective and democratic
governance and full integration into transatlantic institutions, and
thereby constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national
security and foreign policy of the United States. 

Accordingly, I hereby order:  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">1.</span>  (a)  All property and
interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come
within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the
possession or control of any United States person of the following
persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported,
withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:  any person determined by the
Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of
State:  
          (i)    to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have
directly or indirectly engaged in, actions or policies that threaten the
peace, security, stability, or territorial integrity of any area or
state in the Western Balkans;  
          (ii)   to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have
directly or indirectly engaged in, actions or policies that undermine
democratic processes or institutions in the Western Balkans;  
          (iii)  to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have
directly or indirectly engaged in, a violation of, or an act that has
obstructed or threatened the implementation of, any regional security,
peace, cooperation, or mutual recognition agreement or framework or
accountability mechanism related to the Western Balkans, including the
Prespa Agreement of 2018; the Ohrid Framework Agreement of 2001; United
Nations Security Council Resolution 1244; the Dayton Accords; or the
Conclusions of the Peace Implementation Conference Council held in
London in December 1995, including the decisions or conclusions of the
High Representative, the Peace Implementation Council, or its Steering
Board; or the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia,
or, with respect to the former Yugoslavia, the International Residual
Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals;  
          (iv)   to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have
directly or indirectly engaged in, serious human rights abuse in the
Western Balkans;  
          (v)    to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have
directly or indirectly engaged in, corruption related to the Western
Balkans, including corruption by, on behalf of, or otherwise related to
a government in the Western Balkans, or a current or former government
official at any level of government in the Western Balkans, such as the
misappropriation of public assets, expropriation of private assets for
personal gain or political purposes, or bribery;  
          (vi)   to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided
financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services
to or in support of, any person whose property and interests in property
are blocked pursuant to this order; or   
          (vii)  to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or
purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person
whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this
order.  
     (b)  The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply
except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders,
directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and
notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit
granted before the date of this order. 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">2.</span>  The prohibitions in
section 1 of this order include:  
     (a)  the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods,
or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and
interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and  
     (b)  the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods,
or services from any such person.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">3.</span>  I hereby determine that
the making of donations of the types of articles specified in section
203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of
any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant
to section 1(a) of this order would seriously impair my ability to deal
with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13219, as
amended by Executive Order 13304, and as expanded in this order, and I
hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">4.</span>  (a)  The unrestricted
immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of noncitizens
determined to meet one or more of the criteria in section l(a) of this
order would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and
the entry of such persons into the United States, as immigrants or
nonimmigrants, is hereby suspended, except when the Secretary of State
or the Secretary of Homeland Security, as appropriate, determines that
the person’s entry would not be contrary to the interests of the United
States, including when the Secretary of State or Secretary of Homeland
Security, as appropriate, so determines, based on a recommendation of
the Attorney General, that the person’s entry would further important
United States law enforcement objectives.   
     (b)  The Secretary of State shall implement this order as it
applies to visas pursuant to such procedures as the Secretary of State,
in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, may
establish.   
     (c)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall implement this order
as it applies to the entry of noncitizens pursuant to such procedures as
the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary
of State, may establish.  
     (d)  Such persons shall be treated by this section in the same
manner as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24,
2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security
Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act
Sanctions).

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">5.</span>  (a)  Any transaction that
evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a
violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth
in this order is prohibited.  
     (b)  Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set
forth in this order is prohibited.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">6.</span>  For the purposes of this
order:  
     (a)  the term “entity” means a partnership, association, trust,
joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;  
     (b)  the term “noncitizen” means any person who is not a citizen or
noncitizen national of the United States;  
     (c)  the term “person” means an individual or entity; and  
     (d)  the term “United States person” means any United States
citizen, lawful permanent resident, entity organized under the laws of
the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States
(including foreign branches), or any person in the United States.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">7.</span>  For those persons whose
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order
who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find
that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets
instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken
pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual.  I
therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in
addressing the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13219, as
amended by Executive Order 13304, and as expanded by this order, there
need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to
this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">8.</span>  The Secretary of the
Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby
authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and
regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA
as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order.  The
Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law,
redelegate any of these functions within the Department of
the Treasury.  All executive departments and agencies of the
United States shall take all appropriate measures within their authority
to implement this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">9.</span>  Nothing in this order
shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official business of
the Federal Government by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec.</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">10.</span>  (a)  Nothing in this
order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:  
          (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department
or agency, or the head thereof; or  
          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.  
     (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other
person.
