title: "Executive Order on Addressing the Threat from Securities Investments that\
  \ Finance Certain Companies of the People\u2019s Republic of China"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq*.) (IEEPA), the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq*.) (NEA), and section
301 of title 3, United States Code,

I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, find
that additional steps are necessary to address the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 13959 of November 12, 2020 (Addressing the
Threat From Securities Investments That Finance Communist Chinese
Military Companies), including the threat posed by the
military-industrial complex of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and
its involvement in military, intelligence, and security research and
development programs, and weapons and related equipment production under
the PRC’s Military-Civil Fusion strategy.  In addition, I find that the
use of Chinese surveillance technology outside the PRC and the
development or use of Chinese surveillance technology to facilitate
repression or serious human rights abuse constitute unusual and
extraordinary threats, which have their source in whole or substantial
part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign
policy, and economy of the United States, and I hereby expand the scope
of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13959 to address
those threats.

Accordingly, I hereby order as follows:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span
style="text-decoration: underline">1.</span>  Sections 1 through 5 of
Executive Order 13959, as amended by Executive Order 13974 of January
13, 2021 (Amending Executive Order 13959 — Addressing the Threat From
Securities Investments That Finance Communist Chinese Military
Companies), are hereby replaced and superseded in their entirety to read
as follows:
