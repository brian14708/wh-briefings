title: "Executive Order on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the\
  \ Federal\_Workforce"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including sections 1104, 3301, and
3302 of title 5, United States Code, and in order to strengthen the
Federal workforce by promoting diversity, equity, inclusion, and
accessibility, it is hereby ordered as follows:

Section 1.  Policy.  On my first day in office, I signed Executive Order
13985 (Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities
Through the Federal Government), which established that affirmatively
advancing equity, civil rights, racial justice, and equal opportunity is
the responsibility of the whole of our Government.  To further advance
equity within the Federal Government, this order establishes that it is
the policy of my Administration to cultivate a workforce that draws from
the full diversity of the Nation.

As the Nation’s largest employer, the Federal Government must be a model
for diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, where all employees
are treated with dignity and respect.  Accordingly, the Federal
Government must strengthen its ability to recruit, hire, develop,
promote, and retain our Nation’s talent and remove barriers to equal
opportunity.  It must also provide resources and opportunities to
strengthen and advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility
across the Federal Government.  The Federal Government should have
a workforce that reflects the diversity of the American people.  A
growing body of evidence demonstrates that diverse, equitable,
inclusive, and accessible workplaces yield higher-performing
organizations.

Federal merit system principles include that the Federal Government’s
recruitment policies should “endeavor to achieve a work force from all
segments of society” and that “\[a\]ll employees and applicants for
employment should receive fair and equitable treatment in all aspects of
personnel management” (5 U.S.C. 2301(b)(1), (2)).  As set forth in
Executive Order 13583 of August 18, 2011 (Establishing a Coordinated
Government-Wide Initiative to Promote Diversity and Inclusion in the
Federal Workforce), the Presidential Memorandum of October 5, 2016
(Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in the National Security Workforce),
Executive Order 13988 of January 20, 2021 (Preventing and Combating
Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation),
the National Security Memorandum of February 4, 2021 (Revitalizing
America’s Foreign Policy and National Security Workforce, Institutions,
and Partnerships), and Executive Order 14020 of March 8, 2021
(Establishment of the White House Gender Policy Council), the Federal
Government is at its best when drawing upon all parts of society, our
greatest accomplishments are achieved when diverse perspectives are
brought to bear to overcome our greatest challenges, and all persons
should receive equal treatment under the law.  This order reaffirms
support for, and builds upon, the procedures established by Executive
Orders 13583, 13988, and 14020, the Presidential Memorandum on Promoting
Diversity and Inclusion in the National Security Workforce, and the
National Security Memorandum on Revitalizing America’s Foreign Policy
and National Security Workforce, Institutions, and Partnerships.  This
order establishes that diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility
are priorities for my Administration and benefit the entire Federal
Government and the Nation, and establishes additional procedures to
advance these priorities across the Federal workforce.

Sec. 2. Definitions. For purposes of this order, in the context of the
Federal workforce:    
     (a)  The term “underserved communities” refers to populations
sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities,
who have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in
aspects of economic, social, and civic life. In the context of the
Federal workforce, this term includes individuals who belong to
communities of color, such as Black and African American, Hispanic and
Latino, Native American, Alaska Native and Indigenous, Asian American,
Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander, Middle Eastern, and North African
persons. It also includes individuals who belong to communities that
face discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender
identity (including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, gender
non-conforming, and non-binary (LGBTQ+) persons); persons who face
discrimination based on pregnancy or pregnancy-related conditions;
parents; and caregivers.  It also includes individuals who belong to
communities that face discrimination based on their religion or
disability; first-generation professionals or first-generation college
students; individuals with limited English proficiency; immigrants;
individuals who belong to communities that may face employment barriers
based on older age or former incarceration; persons who live in rural
areas; veterans and military spouses; and persons otherwise adversely
affected by persistent poverty, discrimination, or inequality.
Individuals may belong to more than one underserved community and face
intersecting barriers.  
     (b)  The term “diversity” means the practice of including the many
communities, identities, races, ethnicities, backgrounds, abilities,
cultures, and beliefs of the American people, including underserved
communities.  
     (c)  The term “equity” means the consistent and systematic fair,
just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals
who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such
treatment.  
     (d)  The term “inclusion” means the recognition, appreciation, and
use of the talents and skills of employees of all backgrounds.   
     (e)  The term “accessibility” means the design, construction,
development, and maintenance of facilities, information and
communication technology, programs, and services so that all people,
including people with disabilities, can fully and independently use
them.  Accessibility includes the provision of accommodations and
modifications to ensure equal access to employment and participation in
activities for people with disabilities, the reduction or elimination of
physical and attitudinal barriers to equitable opportunities, a
commitment to ensuring that people with disabilities can independently
access every outward-facing and internal activity or electronic space,
and the pursuit of best practices such as universal design.  
     (f)  The term “agency” means any authority of the United States
that is an “agency” under 44 U.S.C. 3502(1), other than one considered
to be an independent regulatory agency, as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(5).

Sec. 3.  Government-Wide Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility
Initiative and Strategic Plan.  The Director of the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) and the Deputy Director for Management of the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) — in coordination with the Chair of the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and in consultation with
the Secretary of Labor, the Director of the Office of Science and
Technology Policy, the Assistant to the President for National Security
Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy (APDP), the
Director of the National Economic Council, and the Co-Chairs of the
Gender Policy Council — shall:  
     (a) reestablish a coordinated Government-wide initiative to promote
diversity and inclusion in the Federal workforce, expand its scope to
specifically include equity and accessibility, and coordinate its
implementation with the provisions of Executive Order 13985 and the
National Security Memorandum on Revitalizing America’s Foreign Policy
and National Security Workforce, Institutions, and Partnerships;  
     (b)  develop and issue a Government-wide Diversity, Equity,
Inclusion, and Accessibility Strategic Plan (Government-wide DEIA Plan)
within 150 days of the date of this order that updates the
Government-wide plan required by section 2(b)(i) of Executive Order
13583.  The Government-wide DEIA Plan shall be updated as appropriate
and at a minimum every 4 years.  The Government-wide DEIA Plan shall:  
          (i)    define standards of success for diversity, equity,
inclusion, and accessibility efforts based on leading policies and
practices in the public and private sectors;  
          (ii)   consistent with merit system principles, identify
strategies to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility,
and eliminate, where applicable, barriers to equity, in Federal
workforce functions, including:  recruitment; hiring; background
investigation; promotion; retention; performance evaluations and awards;
professional development programs; mentoring programs or sponsorship
initiatives; internship, fellowship, and apprenticeship programs;
employee resource group and affinity group programs; temporary employee
details and assignments; pay and compensation policies; benefits,
including health benefits, retirement benefits, and employee services
and work‑life programs; disciplinary or adverse actions; reasonable
accommodations for employees and applicants with disabilities; workplace
policies to prevent gender-based violence (including domestic violence,
stalking, and sexual violence); reasonable accommodations for employees
who are members of religious minorities; and training, learning, and
onboarding programs;  
          (iii)  include a comprehensive framework to address workplace
harassment, including sexual harassment, which clearly defines the term
“harassment”; outlines policies and practices to prevent, report,
respond to, and investigate harassment; promotes mechanisms for
employees to report misconduct; encourages bystander intervention; and
addresses training, education, and monitoring to create a culture that
does not tolerate harassment or other forms of discrimination or
retaliation; and  
          (iv)   promote a data-driven approach to increase transparency
and accountability, which would build upon, as appropriate, the EEOC’s
Management Directive 715 reporting process;  
     (c)  establish an updated system for agencies to report regularly
on progress in implementing Agency DEIA Strategic Plans (as described in
section 4(b) of this order) and in meeting the objectives of this order.
 New reporting requirements should be aligned with ongoing reporting
established by Executive Order 13985 and the National Security
Memorandum on Revitalizing America’s Foreign Policy and National
Security Workforce, Institutions, and Partnerships.  Agency reports on
actions taken to meet the objectives of this order shall include
measurement of improvements, analysis of the effectiveness of agency
programs, and descriptions of lessons learned.  The Director of OPM and
the Deputy Director for Management of OMB shall support agencies in
developing workforce policies and practices designed to advance
diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility throughout agencies by,
for example, providing updated guidance and technical assistance to
ensure that agencies consistently improve, evaluate, and learn from
their workforce practices;  
     (d)  pursue opportunities to consolidate implementation efforts and
reporting requirements related to advancing diversity, equity,
inclusion, and accessibility established through related or overlapping
statutory mandates, Presidential directives, and regulatory
requirements; and  
     (e)  support, coordinate, and encourage agency efforts to conduct
research, evaluation, and other evidence-building activities to identify
leading practices, and other promising practices, for broadening
participation and opportunities for advancement in Federal employment,
and to assess and promote the benefits of diversity, equity, inclusion,
and accessibility for Federal performance and operations and barriers to
achieving these goals.  Agencies should use the capabilities of their
evaluation officers and chief statistical officers and requirements
under the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018,
Public Law 115-435, to advance this goal. 

Sec. 4.  Responsibilities of Executive Departments and Agencies. The
head of each agency shall make advancing diversity, equity, inclusion,
and accessibility a priority component of the agency’s management agenda
and agency strategic planning.  The head of each agency shall implement
the Government-wide DEIA Plan prepared pursuant to section 3 of this
order and such other related guidance as issued from time to time by the
Director of OPM or the Deputy Director for Management of OMB.  In
addition, the head of each agency shall:  
     (a)  within 100 days of the date of this order, submit to the APDP,
the Director of OPM, and the Deputy Director for Management of OMB a
preliminary assessment of the current state of diversity, equity,
inclusion, and accessibility in the agency’s human resources practices
and workforce composition.  In conducting such assessment, the head of
each agency should:  
          (i)    assess whether agency recruitment, hiring, promotion,
retention, professional development, performance evaluations, pay and
compensation policies, reasonable accommodations access, and training
policies and practices are equitable;  
          (ii)   take an evidence-based and data-driven approach to
determine whether and to what extent agency practices result in
inequitable employment outcomes, and whether agency actions may help to
overcome systemic societal and organizational barriers;  
          (iii)  assess the status and effects of existing diversity,
equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives or programs, and review
the amount of institutional resources available to support human
resources activities that advance the objectives outlined in section 1
of this order; and  
          (iv)   identify areas where evidence is lacking and propose
opportunities to build evidence to advance diversity, equity, inclusion,
and accessibility and address those gaps identified;  
     (b)  within 120 days of the issuance of the Government-wide DEIA
Plan, and annually thereafter, develop and submit to the APDP, the
Director of OPM, and the Deputy Director for Management of OMB an Agency
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility Strategic Plan (Agency
DEIA Strategic Plan), as described by section 3(b) of Executive Order
13583 and as modified by this order.  Agency DEIA Strategic Plans should
identify actions to advance diversity, equity, inclusion,
and accessibility in the workforce and remove any potential barriers to
diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in the workforce
identified in the assessments described in subsection (a) of this
section.  Agency DEIA Strategic Plans should also include quarterly
goals and actions to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and
accessibility initiatives in the agency workforce and in the agency’s
workplace culture;  
     (c)  on an annual basis, report to the President on the status of
the agency’s efforts to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and
accessibility within the agency, and the agency’s success in
implementing the Agency DEIA Strategic Plan.  Consistent with guidance
issued as part of the Government-wide DEIA Plan, the agency head shall
also make available to the general public information on efforts to
advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in the agency’s
workforce;  
     (d)  oversee, and provide resources and staffing to support, the
implementation of the Agency DEIA Strategic Plan;  
     (e)  enhance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility within
the agency, in collaboration with the agency’s senior officials and
consistent with applicable law and merit system principles;  
     (f)  seek opportunities to establish a position of chief diversity
officer or diversity and inclusion officer (as distinct from an equal
employment opportunity officer), with sufficient seniority to coordinate
efforts to promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility
within the agency;  
     (g)  strongly consider for employment, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, qualified applicants of any background who have advanced
diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in the workplace; and  
     (h)  in coordination with OMB, seek opportunities to ensure
alignment across various organizational performance planning
requirements and efforts by integrating the Agency DEIA Strategic Plan
and diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility goals into broader
agency strategic planning efforts described in 5 U.S.C. 306 and the
agency performance planning described in 31 U.S.C. 1115.

Sec. 5.  Data Collection.   
      (a)  The head of each agency shall take a data-driven approach to
advancing policies that promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and
accessibility within the agency’s workforce, while protecting the
privacy of employees and safeguarding all personally identifiable
information and protected health information.  
     (b)  Using Federal standards governing the collection, use, and
analysis of demographic data (such as OMB Directive No. 15 (Standards
for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and
Ethnicity) and OMB Memorandum M-14-06 (Guidance for Providing and Using
Administrative Data for Statistical Purposes)), the head of each agency
shall measure demographic representation and trends related to diversity
in the agency’s overall workforce composition, senior workforce
composition, employment applications, hiring decisions, promotions, pay
and compensation, professional development programs, and attrition
rates.  
     (c)  The Director of OPM,  the Chair of the EEOC, and the Deputy
Director for Management of OMB shall review existing guidance,
regulations, policies, and practices (for purposes of this section,
“guidance”) that govern agency collection of demographic data about
Federal employees, and consider issuing, modifying, or revoking such
guidance in order to expand the collection of such voluntarily
self-reported data and more effectively measure the representation of
underserved communities in the Federal workforce.  In revisiting or
issuing any such guidance, the Director of OPM, the Chair of the EEOC,
and the Deputy Director for Management of OMB shall take steps to
promote the protection of privacy and to safeguard personally
identifiable information; facilitate intersectional analysis; and reduce
duplicative reporting requirements.  In considering whether to revisit
or issue such guidance, the Director of OPM, the Chair of the EEOC, and
the Deputy Director for Management of OMB shall consult with the Chief
Statistician of the United States, the Chair of the Chief Data Officers
Council, and the Co-Chairs of the Interagency Working Group on Equitable
Data established in section 9 of Executive Order 13985.  
     (d)  The head of each agency shall implement any such revised
guidance issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section to expand the
collection of voluntarily self-reported demographic data.  The head of
each agency shall also take steps to ensure that data collection and
analysis practices allow for the capture or presence of multiple
attributes and identities to ensure an intersectional analysis.  
     (e)  The head of each agency shall collect and analyze voluntarily
self-reported demographic data regarding the membership of advisory
committees, commissions, and boards in a manner consistent with
applicable law, including privacy and confidentiality protections, and
with statistical standards where applicable.  For agencies that have
external advisory committees, commissions, or boards to which agencies
appoint members, agency heads shall pursue opportunities to increase
diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility on such committees,
commissions, and boards.

Sec*.* 6.  Promoting Paid Internships.  
     (a)  The Director of OPM and the Deputy Director for Management of
OMB shall issue guidance to agencies and the Executive Office of the
President with respect to internships and similar programs within the
Federal Government, including guidance on how to:  
          (i)    increase the availability of paid internships,
fellowships, and apprenticeships, and reduce the practice of hiring
interns, fellows, and apprentices who are unpaid;  
          (ii)   ensure that internships, fellowships, and
apprenticeships serve as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, the
competitive hiring process;  
          (iii)  ensure that internships, fellowships, and
apprenticeships serve to develop individuals’ talent, knowledge, and
skills for careers in government service;  
          (iv)   improve outreach to and recruitment of individuals from
underserved communities for internship, fellowship, and apprenticeship
programs; and  
          (v)    ensure all interns, fellows, and apprentices with
disabilities, including applicants and candidates, have a process for
requesting and obtaining reasonable accommodations to support their work
in the Federal Government, without regard to whether such individuals
are covered by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Public Law 93-112.  
     (b)  The head of each agency shall, as part of the annual reporting
process described in section 4(c) of this order, measure and report on
the agency’s progress with respect to the matters described in
subsection (a) of this section.

Sec. 7.  Partnerships and Recruitment.    
     (a)  The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy
(OSTP), the Director of OPM, and the Deputy Director for Management of
OMB, in consultation with the Chair of the EEOC, shall coordinate
a Government-wide initiative to strengthen partnerships (Partnerships
Initiative) to facilitate recruitment for Federal employment
opportunities of individuals who are members of underserved communities.
 To carry out the Partnerships Initiative, the Director of OSTP, the
Director of OPM, and the Deputy Director for Management of OMB shall
take steps to increase diversity in the Federal employment pipeline by
supporting and guiding agencies in building or strengthening
partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities,
including Historically Black Graduate Institutions; Hispanic-Serving
Institutions; Tribal Colleges and Universities; Native American-serving,
nontribal institutions; Asian American and Pacific Islander-serving
institutions; Tribally controlled colleges and universities; Alaska
Native-serving and Native Hawaiian-serving institutions; Predominantly
Black Institutions; women’s colleges and universities; State vocational
rehabilitation agencies that serve individuals with disabilities;
disability services offices at institutions of higher education;
organizations dedicated to serving veterans; public and non-profit
private universities serving a high percentage of economically
disadvantaged students or first-generation college or graduate students;
community colleges and technical schools; and community-based
organizations that are dedicated to serving and working with underserved
communities, including return-to-work programs, programs that provide
training and support for older adults seeking employment, programs
serving formerly incarcerated individuals, centers for independent
living, disability rights organizations, and organizations dedicated to
serving LGBTQ+ individuals.  
     (b)  The head of each agency shall work with the Director of OSTP,
the Director of OPM, and the Deputy Director for Management of OMB to
make employment, internship, fellowship, and apprenticeship
opportunities available through the Partnerships Initiative, and shall
take steps to enhance recruitment efforts through the Partnerships
Initiative, as part of the agency’s overall recruitment efforts.  The
head of each agency shall, as part of the reporting processes described
in sections 3(c) and 4(c) of this order, measure and report on the
agency’s progress on carrying out this subsection.

Sec. 8.  Professional Development and Advancement.    
     (a)  The Director of OPM, in consultation with the Deputy Director
for Management of OMB, shall issue detailed guidance to agencies for
tracking demographic data relating to participation in leadership and
professional development programs and development opportunities offered
or sponsored by agencies and the rate of the placement of participating
employees into senior positions in agencies, in a manner consistent with
privacy and confidentiality protections and statistical limitations.  
     (b)  The head of each agency shall implement the guidance issued
pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, and shall use demographic
data relating to participation in professional development programs to
identify ways to improve outreach and recruitment for professional
development programs offered or sponsored by the agency, consistent with
merit system principles.  The head of each agency shall also address any
barriers to access to or participation in such programs faced by members
of underserved communities.

Sec. 9.  Training and Learning.    
     (a)  The head of each agency shall take steps to implement or
increase the availability and use of diversity, equity, inclusion, and
accessibility training programs for employees, managers, and leadership.
 Such training programs should enable Federal employees, managers, and
leaders to have knowledge of systemic and institutional racism and bias
against underserved communities, be supported in building skillsets to
promote respectful and inclusive workplaces and eliminate workplace
harassment, have knowledge of agency accessibility practices, and have
increased understanding of implicit and unconscious bias.  
     (b)  The Director of OPM and the Chair of the EEOC shall issue
guidance and serve as a resource and repository for best practices for
agencies to develop or enhance existing diversity, equity, inclusion,
and accessibility training programs.

Sec. 10.  Advancing Equity for Employees with Disabilities.   
     (a)  As established in Executive Order 13548 of July 26, 2010
(Increasing Federal Employment of Individuals with Disabilities), the
Federal Government must become a model for the employment of individuals
with disabilities.  Because a workforce that includes people with
disabilities is a stronger and more effective workforce, agencies must
provide an equitable, accessible, and inclusive environment for
employees with disabilities.  In order for Federal employees and
applicants with disabilities to be assessed on their merits, accessible
information technologies must be provided and, where needed, reasonable
accommodations must be available that will allow qualified individuals
with disabilities to perform the essential functions of their positions
and access advancement opportunities.  To that end, the relevant
agencies shall take the actions set forth in this section.  
     (b)  The Secretary of Labor, the Director of OPM, the Chair of the
EEOC, the Deputy Director for Management of OMB, and the Executive
Director of the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance
Board (Access Board), in consultation with the Administrator of General
Services, as appropriate, shall coordinate with agencies to:  
          (i)    support the Federal Government’s effort to provide
people with disabilities equal employment opportunities and take
affirmative actions within the Federal Government to ensure that
agencies fully comply with applicable laws, including sections 501, 504,
and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 791,
794, 794d);  
          (ii)   assess current practices in using Schedule A hiring
authority to employ people with disabilities in the Federal Government,
and evaluate opportunities to enhance equity in employment opportunities
and financial security for employees with disabilities through different
practices or guidance on the use of Schedule A hiring authority; and  
          (iii)  ensure that:  
(A)  applicants and employees with disabilities have access to
information about and understand their rights regarding disability
self-identification;  
(B)  applicants and employees with disabilities have access to
information about Schedule A hiring authority for individuals with
disabilities;  
(C)  applicants and employees with disabilities have access to
information about, understand their rights to, and may easily request
reasonable accommodations, workplace personal assistance services, and
accessible information and communication technology;  
(D)  the process of responding to reasonable accommodation requests is
timely and efficient;  
(E)  the processes and procedures for appealing the denial of a
reasonable accommodation request are timely and efficient; and  
(F)  all information and communication technology and products
developed, procured, maintained, or used by Federal agencies are
accessible and usable by employees with disabilities consistent with all
standards and technical requirements of the Rehabilitation Act of
1973.  
     (c)  To ensure that all Federal office buildings and workplaces are
accessible to employees with disabilities, the Administrator of General
Services, the Director of OPM, the Deputy Director for Management of
OMB, and the Executive Director of the Access Board shall work with
Federal agencies to ensure that Federal buildings and leased facilities
comply with the accessibility standards of the Architectural Barriers
Act of 1968, Public Law 90-480, and related standards.  
     (d)  Beyond existing duties to comply with the Architectural
Barriers Act of 1968 and related standards, the head of each agency
shall maximize the accessibility of the physical environment of the
agency’s workplaces, consistent with applicable law and the availability
of appropriations, so as to reduce the need for reasonable
accommodations, and provide periodic notice to all employees that
complaints concerning accessibility barriers in Federal buildings can be
filed with the Access Board.   
     (e)  The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Labor shall
review the use of the Workforce Recruitment Program (WRP) for college
students and recent graduates with disabilities and take steps, as
appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to expand the WRP.  The
Secretaries shall submit a report to the APDP describing any steps taken
pursuant to this subsection and providing recommendations for any
Presidential, administrative, or congressional actions to further expand
and strengthen the program and expand job opportunities.

Sec. 11.  Advancing Equity for LGBTQ+ Employees.   
     (a)  As established in Executive Order 13988, it is the policy of
my Administration to prevent and combat discrimination on the basis of
gender identity or sexual orientation.  Each Federal employee should be
able to openly express their sexual orientation, gender identity, and
gender expression, and have these identities affirmed and respected,
without fear of discrimination, retribution, or disadvantage.  To that
end, the relevant agencies shall take the actions set forth in this
section.     
     (b)  The head of each agency shall, in coordination with the
Director of OPM, ensure that existing employee support services
equitably serve LGBTQ+ employees, including, as appropriate, through the
provision of supportive services for transgender and gender
non-conforming and non-binary employees who wish to legally, medically,
or socially transition.  
     (c) To ensure that LGBTQ+ employees (including their beneficiaries
and their eligible dependents), as well as LGBTQ+ beneficiaries and
LGBTQ+ eligible dependents of all Federal employees, have equitable
access to healthcare and health insurance coverage:  
          (i)   the Director of OPM shall take actions to promote
equitable healthcare coverage and services for enrolled LGBTQ+ employees
(including their beneficiaries and their eligible dependents),
LGBTQ+ beneficiaries, and LGBTQ+ eligible dependents, including coverage
of comprehensive gender-affirming care, through the Federal Employees
Health Benefits Program; and  
          (ii)  the Secretary of Defense shall take actions to promote
equitable healthcare coverage and services for LGBTQ+ members of the
uniformed services (including their beneficiaries and their eligible
dependents), LGBTQ+ beneficiaries, and LGBTQ+ eligible dependents,
including coverage of comprehensive gender-affirming care, through the
Military Health System.  
     (d)  To ensure that LGBTQ+ employees (including their beneficiaries
and their eligible dependents), LGBTQ+ beneficiaries, and LGBTQ+
eligible dependents have equitable access to all other insurance
coverage and employee benefits, the head of each agency shall, in
coordination with the Director of OPM, ensure that the Federal
Government equitably provides insurance coverage options and employee
benefits for LGBTQ+ employees (including their beneficiaries and their
eligible dependents), LGBTQ+ beneficiaries, and LGBTQ+ eligible
dependents, including long-term care insurance, sick leave, and life
insurance.  This includes ensuring that Federal benefits, programs, and
services recognize the diversity of family structures.  
     (e)  To ensure that all Federal employees have their respective
gender identities accurately reflected and identified in the
workplace:   
          (i)    the head of each agency shall, in coordination with the
Director of OPM, take steps to foster an inclusive environment where all
employees’ gender identities are respected, such as by including, where
applicable, non-binary gender marker and pronoun options in Federal
hiring, employment, and benefits enrollment forms;  
          (ii)   the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director
of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, shall update, as
appropriate and in consultation with any other relevant agencies, any
relevant Federal employee identification standards to ensure that
Federal systems for issuing employee identity credentials account for
the needs of transgender and gender non-conforming and non-binary
employees.  The Secretary, in coordination with any other relevant
agencies, shall take steps to reduce any unnecessary administrative
burden for transgender and gender non-conforming and non-binary
employees to update their names, photographs, gender markers, and
pronouns on federally issued employee identity credentials, where
applicable; and  
          (iii)  the head of each agency shall, in consultation with the
Director of OPM, update Federal employee identification standards to
include non-binary gender markers where gender markers are required in
employee systems and profiles, and shall take steps to reduce any
unnecessary administrative burden for transgender and gender
non-conforming and non-binary employees to update their gender markers
and pronouns in employee systems and profiles, where applicable.  
     (f)  To support all Federal employees in accessing workplace
facilities aligned with their gender identities, the head of each agency
shall explore opportunities to expand the availability of gender
non-binary facilities and restrooms in federally owned and leased
workplaces.

the Director of OPM and the heads of agencies, shall take steps to
mitigate any barriers in security clearance and background investigation
processes for LGBTQ+ employees and applicants, in particular transgender

Accordingly:  
     (a)  The Director of OPM shall review Government-wide regulations
and guidance and, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, in
order to address any pay inequities and advance equal pay, consider
whether to:  
          (i)   work with agencies to review, and revise if necessary,
job classification and compensation practices; and  
          (ii)  prohibit agencies from seeking or relying on an
applicant’s salary history during the hiring process to set pay or when
setting pay for a current employee, unless salary history is raised
without prompting by the applicant or employee.  
     (b)  The head of each agency that administers a pay system other
than one established under title 5 of the United States Code shall
review the agency’s regulations and guidance and, as appropriate and
consistent with applicable law, revise compensation practices in order
to address any pay inequities and advance equal pay.  Agencies should
report to OPM any revisions to compensation practices made to implement
this direction.   
     (c)  The Director of OPM shall submit a report to the President
describing any changes to Government-wide and agency-specific
compensation practices recommended and adopted pursuant to this order.

Sec. 13.  Expanding Employment Opportunities for Formerly Incarcerated
Individuals.  To support equal opportunity for formerly incarcerated
individuals who have served their terms of incarceration and to support
their ability to fully reintegrate into society and make meaningful
contributions to our Nation, the Director of OPM shall evaluate the
existence of any barriers that formerly incarcerated individuals face in
accessing Federal employment opportunities and any effect of those
barriers on the civil service.  As appropriate, the Director of OPM
shall also evaluate possible actions to expand Federal employment
opportunities for formerly incarcerated individuals, including the
establishment of a new hiring authority, and shall submit a report to
the President containing the results of OPM’s evaluation within 120 days
of the date of this order.

agency, or the head thereof; or  
          (ii)  functions of the Director of the Office of Management
and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.
