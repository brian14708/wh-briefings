<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 1.  Policy. </span>
Corruption corrodes public trust; hobbles effective governance; distorts
markets and equitable access to services; undercuts development efforts;
contributes to national fragility, extremism, and migration; and
provides authoritarian leaders a means to undermine democracies
worldwide.  When leaders steal from their nations’ citizens or oligarchs
flout the rule of law, economic growth slows, inequality widens, and
trust in government plummets.  
  
In financial terms alone, the costs of corruption are staggering.  It
has been estimated that acts of corruption sap between 2 and 5 percent
from global gross domestic product.  While such costs are not evenly
shared worldwide, the abuse of power for private gain, the
misappropriation of public assets, bribery, and other forms of
corruption impact every country and community.  The proceeds of these
acts cross national borders and can impact economies and political
systems far from their origin.  Anonymous shell companies, opaque
financial systems, and professional service providers enable the
movement and laundering of illicit wealth, including in the United
States and other rule-of-law-based democracies.  
  
Corruption threatens United States national security, economic equity,
global anti-poverty and development efforts, and democracy itself.  But
by effectively preventing and countering corruption and demonstrating
the advantages of transparent and accountable governance, we can secure
a critical advantage for the United States and other democracies.  
  
In issuing this National Security Study Memorandum, I establish
countering corruption as a core United States national security
interest.  My Administration will lead efforts to promote good
governance; bring transparency to the United States and global financial
systems; prevent and combat corruption at home and abroad; and make it
increasingly difficult for corrupt actors to shield their activities.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 2.  Strategy.</span> 
Accordingly, I hereby direct the Assistant to the President and National
Security Advisor, in coordination with the Assistant to the President
for Economic Policy and the Assistant to the President for Domestic
Policy, to conduct an interagency review process under National Security
Memorandum/NSM-2 (Renewing the National Security Council System) and
develop a Presidential strategy that will, when implemented,
significantly bolster the ability of the United States Government to:   
     (a)  Modernize, increase, coordinate, resource, and otherwise
improve the ability of key executive departments and agencies
(agencies), including those represented in the review and listed below,
to promote good governance and prevent and combat corruption, including,
as needed, by proposing relevant legislation to the Congress;  
     (b)  Combat all forms of illicit finance in the United States and
international financial systems, including by robustly implementing
Federal law requiring United States companies to report their beneficial
owner or owners to the Department of the Treasury; reducing offshore
financial secrecy; improving information sharing; and, as necessary,
identifying the need for new reforms;  
     (c)  Hold accountable corrupt individuals, transnational criminal
organizations, and their facilitators, including by, and where
appropriate, identifying, freezing, and recovering stolen assets through
increased information sharing and intelligence collection and analysis,
criminal or civil enforcement actions, advisories, and sanctions or
other authorities, and, where possible and appropriate, returning
recovered assets for the benefit of the citizens harmed by corruption;  
     (d)  Bolster the capacity of domestic and international
institutions and multilateral bodies focused on establishing global
anti-corruption norms, asset recovery, promoting financial transparency,
encouraging open government, strengthening financial institutions’
frameworks to prevent corruption in development finance projects, and
combating money laundering, illicit finance, and bribery, including,
where possible, addressing the demand side of bribery;  
     (e)  Support and strengthen the capacity of civil society, media,
and other oversight and accountability actors to conduct research and
analysis on corruption trends, advocate for preventative measures,
investigate and uncover corruption, hold leaders accountable, and inform
and support government accountability and reform efforts, and work to
provide these actors a safe and open operating environment domestically
and internationally;  
     (f)  Work with international partners to counteract strategic
corruption by foreign leaders, foreign state-owned or affiliated
enterprises, transnational criminal organizations, and other foreign
actors and their domestic collaborators, including, by closing loopholes
exploited by these actors to interfere in democratic processes in the
United States and abroad;  
     (g)  Enhance efforts to quickly and flexibly increase United States
and partner resources of investigative, financial, technical, political,
and other assistance to foreign countries that exhibit the desire to
reduce corruption;  
     (h)  Assist and strengthen the capacity of domestic (including
State and local) authorities and institutions, as well as partner and
other foreign governments at all levels, to implement transparency,
oversight, and accountability measures, which will counter corruption
and provide their citizens with accessible and usable information
regarding government programs, policies, and spending;  
     (i)  Promote partnerships with the private sector and civil society
to advocate for anti-corruption measures and take action to prevent
corruption; and  
     (j)  Establish best practices and enforcement mechanisms such that
foreign assistance and security cooperation activities have built-in
corruption prevention measures.
