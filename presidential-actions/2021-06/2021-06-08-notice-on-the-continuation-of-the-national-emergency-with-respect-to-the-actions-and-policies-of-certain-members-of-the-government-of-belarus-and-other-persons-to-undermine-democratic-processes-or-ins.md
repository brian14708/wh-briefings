  \ and Policies of Certain Members of the Government of Belarus and other Persons\
  \ to Undermine Democratic Processes or Institutions of\_Belarus"

On June 16, 2006, by Executive Order 13405, the President declared a
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq*.) to deal with the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the
United States constituted by the actions and policies of certain members
of the Government of Belarus and other persons to undermine Belarus’s
democratic processes or institutions, manifested in the fundamentally
undemocratic March 2006 elections; to commit human rights abuses related
to political repression, including detentions and disappearances; and to
engage in public corruption, including by diverting or misusing
Belarusian public assets or by misusing public authority.

The actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus
and other persons continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat
to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.  For
this reason, the national emergency declared on June 16, 2006, must
continue in effect beyond June 16, 2021.  Therefore, in accordance with
section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am
continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order
13405.

This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and transmitted
to the Congress.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
June 8, 2021.
