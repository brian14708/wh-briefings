By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the

that it is important to the national interest to furnish assistance
under the MRAA in an amount not to exceed $46 million from the United
States Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund for the purpose
of meeting unexpected urgent refugee and migration needs, including
