title: "Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Certain\
  \ Terrorist\_Attacks"
---
 
     Consistent with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50
U.S.C. 1622(d), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency
previously declared on September 14, 2001, in Proclamation 7463, with
respect to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the
continuing and immediate threat of further attacks on the United States.

     Because the terrorist threat continues, the national emergency
declared on September 14, 2001, and the powers and authorities adopted
to deal with that emergency must continue in effect beyond September 14,
2023.  Therefore, I am continuing in effect for an additional year the
national emergency that was declared on September 14, 2001, with respect
to the terrorist threat. 

     This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and
transmitted to the Congress.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
 September 7, 2023.
