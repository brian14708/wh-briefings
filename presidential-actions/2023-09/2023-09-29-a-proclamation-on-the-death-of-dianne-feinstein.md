title: "A Proclamation on the Death of Dianne\_Feinstein"
---
 
     Senator Dianne Feinstein was a pioneering American and a true
trailblazer.  In San Francisco, she showed enormous poise and courage in
the wake of tragedy, and became a powerful voice for American values.
 In the United States Senate, she turned passion into purpose, and led
the fight to ban assault weapons, also making her mark on everything
from national security to the environment to protecting civil liberties.
 Senator Feinstein was a role model for so many Americans and she had an
immense impact on younger female leaders for whom she generously opened
doors.  She was a historic figure, and our country will benefit from her
legacy for generations.

     As a mark of respect for the memory of Senator Dianne Feinstein, by
the authority vested in me as President of the United States by
the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby
order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at
the White House and upon all public buildings and grounds, at all
military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the
Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the
United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset, on the
day of interment.  I also direct that the flag shall be flown
at half-staff for the same length of time at all United States
embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad,
including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth
day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-three, and
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-eighth.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
