title: "Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to\_Ethiopia"
---
 
  On September 17, 2021, by Executive Order 14046, I declared a national
emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act
(50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq*.) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States
constituted by the situation in and in relation to northern Ethiopia.

     The situation in and in relation to northern Ethiopia, which has
been marked by activities that threaten the peace, security, and
stability of Ethiopia and the greater Horn of Africa region, continues
to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and
foreign policy of the United States.  For this reason, the national
emergency declared in Executive Order 14046 of September 17, 2021, must
continue in effect beyond September 17, 2023.  Therefore, in accordance
with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)),
I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive
Order 14046 with respect to Ethiopia.

     This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and
transmitted to the Congress.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
September 7, 2023.
