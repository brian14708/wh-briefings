---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that an emergency exists
in the State of Maine and ordered Federal assistance to supplement
State, tribal, and local response efforts due to the emergency
conditions resulting from Hurricane Lee from September 15 to September
17, 2023.  
   
The President’s action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security,
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate all disaster
relief efforts which have the purpose of alleviating the hardship and
suffering caused by the emergency on the local population, and to
provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures,
authorized under Title V of the Stafford Act, to save lives and to
protect property and public health and safety, and to lessen or avert
the threat of a catastrophe statewide.  
   
Specifically, FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize, and provide at
its discretion, equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the
impacts of the emergency.  Emergency protective measures, limited to
direct Federal assistance and reimbursement for mass care, including
evacuation and sheltering support, will be provided at 75 percent
Federal funding.   
   
Mr. William F. Roy of FEMA has been appointed to coordinate Federal
recovery operations in the affected areas.
