Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Wyoming and ordered Federal assistance to
supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas
affected by flooding on June 15, 2023.

Federal funding is available to state, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the flooding in Natrona County.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Mr. Jon K. Huss of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has
been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the affected
areas. 

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
