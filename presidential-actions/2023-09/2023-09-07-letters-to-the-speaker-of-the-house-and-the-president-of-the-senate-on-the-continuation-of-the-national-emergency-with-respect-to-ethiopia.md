Dear Mr. Speaker:   (Dear Madam President:)  
  
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to Ethiopia declared in
Executive Order 14046 of September 17, 2021, is to continue in effect
beyond September 17, 2023.  
  
The situation in and in relation to northern Ethiopia, which has been
marked by activities that threaten the peace, security, and stability of
Ethiopia and the greater Horn of Africa region, continues to pose an
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign
policy of the United States.    
  
Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 14046 with respect to
Ethiopia.

Sincerely,

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
