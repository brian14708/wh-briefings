title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. to Award the Medal of\_Honor"
---
 
On September 5, 2023, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., will award the
Medal of Honor to Captain Larry L. Taylor, United States Army, for
conspicuous gallantry.     
   
On June 18, 1968, near the hamlet of Ap Go Cong, Republic of Vietnam,
then-First Lieutenant Taylor was serving as a team leader of a
helicopter light-fire team deployed in support of a long-range
reconnaissance patrol that had been surrounded by an enemy force.  First
Lieutenant Taylor and his wingman arrived at the contact site and, once
overhead, Taylor radioed the patrol team and asked the four Soldiers to
mark their location with flares. Using the illumination as a reference
point, he and his wingman strafed the enemy with mini-guns and aerial
rockets. Braving intense ground fire, the two Cobra gunships continued
to make low-level attack runs for the next 45 minutes.  
  
With both helicopters nearly out of ammunition and the enemy still
closing in, Taylor reconnoitered the escape route the team intended to
take. Returning to the patrol team’s location, Taylor learned that a
plan to rescue the Soldiers with a UH-1 “Huey” helicopter had been
canceled because it stood almost no chance of success. Running low on
fuel, with the patrol team nearly out of ammunition, Taylor decided to
extract the team using his two-man Cobra helicopter, a feat that had
never been accomplished or even attempted.  
  
He directed his wingman to fire his remaining mini-gun rounds along the
eastern flank of the patrol team and then return to base camp. Taylor
fired his own remaining mini-gun rounds along the team’s western flank,
using his Cobra’s landing lights to draw the enemy’s attention while the
patrol team headed southeast toward a nearby extraction point Taylor had
designated.  
  
When the team reached the site, Taylor landed his Cobra under heavy
enemy fire and with complete disregard for his personal safety. The
patrol team climbed aboard, grabbing on to rocket-pods and skids, and
Taylor carried them to a safe location before landing them back on the
ground.  
  
Taylor’s conspicuous gallantry, his profound concern for his fellow
Soldiers, and his intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond
the call of duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military
service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit and the United
States Army.  
   
**PERSONAL BACKGROUND**:  
   
Captain Taylor was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee.  He is a graduate of
the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.  On June 5, 1966, he was
commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Army Reserve, and entered
the Regular Army on August 14, 1966.  He received training at the U.S.
Army Armor School, Fort Knox, Kentucky, and the U.S. Army Primary
Helicopter School, Fort Wolters, Texas.  On June 30, 1967, he qualified
as an Army Aviator.  He later served in Vietnam as a helicopter pilot
from August 1967 to August 1968.  Other military decorations include
multiple awards of the Distinguished Flying Cross and Air Medal.  He was
honorably released from active duty on August 31, 1970, having attained
the rank of Captain, and was discharged from the U.S. Army Reserve on
October 17, 1973.
