title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Approves Georgia Disaster\_Declaration"
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Georgia and ordered Federal aid to supplement
State and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by Hurricane
Idalia on August 30, 2023.  
   
The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in the counties of Cook, Glynn, and Lowndes.  
   
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.  
   
Federal funding is also available to state and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for debris removal and emergency protective measures
in the counties of Cook, Glynn, and Lowndes.  
   
Lastly, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.  
   
Ms. Judy M. Kruger has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery
operations in the affected areas.   
   
Damage assessments are continuing in other areas, and more counties and
additional forms of assistance may be designated after the assessments
are fully completed.  
   
Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance at
[www.DisasterAssistance.gov](https://www.disasterassistance.gov/), by
calling 800-621-FEMA (3362), or by using the [FEMA
App](https://www.ready.gov/fema-app). Anyone using a relay service, such
as video relay service (VRS), captioned telephone service or others, can
give FEMA the number for that service.
