Presidential Determination  
No.        2023-13           

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE  
  
SUBJECT:       Presidential Determination on Refugee  
               Admissions for Fiscal Year 2024  
  
  
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States, in accordance with section 207 of the
Immigration and Nationality Act (the “Act”) (8 U.S.C. 1157), and after
appropriate consultations with the Congress, I hereby make the following
determinations and authorize the following actions:  
  
The admission of up to 125,000 refugees to the United States during
Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 is justified by humanitarian concerns or is
otherwise in the national interest.  
  
The admissions numbers shall be allocated among refugees of special
humanitarian concern to the United States in accordance with the
following regional allocations:

Africa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30,000-50,000  
East Asia . . . . . . . . . . . . .  10,000-20,000  
Europe and Central Asia . . . . . . .  2,000-3,000  
Latin America/Caribbean . . . . . .  35,000-50,000  
Near East/South Asia . . . . . . . . 30,000-45,000

The above allocation ranges are intended to provide flexibility as needs
arise, but the total admissions among all of the regions may not exceed
125,000.  Upon providing notification to the Judiciary Committees of the
Congress, you are hereby authorized to transfer unused admissions
allocated to a particular region to one or more other regions, if there
is a need for greater admissions for the region or regions to which the
admissions are being transferred.  
Consistent with section 2(b)(2) of the Migration and Refugee Assistance
Act of 1962 (22 U.S.C. 260l(b)(2)), I hereby determine that assistance
to or on behalf of persons applying for admission to the United States
as part of the overseas refugee admissions program will contribute to
the foreign policy interests of the United States and designate such
persons for this purpose.  
  
Consistent with section 10l(a)(42) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 (a)(42)),
and after appropriate consultation with the Congress, I also specify
that, for FY 2024, the following persons may, if otherwise qualified, be
considered refugees for the purpose of admission to the United States
within their countries of nationality or habitual residence:

1.  Persons in Cuba;
2.  Persons in Eurasia and the Baltics;
3.  Persons in Iraq;
4.  Persons in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras; and
5.  In certain circumstances, persons identified by a United States
    Embassy in any location.

You are authorized and directed to publish this determination in the
*Federal* *Register.*  

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
