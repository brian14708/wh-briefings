title: Restricting and Limiting the Entry of Foreign Nationals to Protect the Security
  of the United States
---
 
During my first Administration, I restricted the entry of certain
foreign nationals into the United States to prevent national security
and public safety threats from reaching our borders.  The Supreme Court
upheld these restrictions.  I reinstated these successful policies in
Executive Order 14161 of January 20, 2025 (Protecting the United States
From Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety
Threats), and Proclamation 10949 of June 4, 2025 (Restricting the Entry
of Foreign Nationals To Protect the United States From Foreign
Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats).

It is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from
foreign nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our
national security and public safety, incite hate crimes, or otherwise
exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes.

The United States must exercise extreme vigilance during the
visa-issuance and immigration processes to identify, prior to their
admission or entry into the United States, foreign nationals who intend
to harm Americans or our national interests.  The United States
Government must ensure that admitted aliens do not intend to threaten
its citizens; undermine or destabilize its culture, government,
institutions, or founding principles; or advocate for, aid, or support
designated foreign terrorists or other threats to our national security.

In order to protect our Nation, as directed in Executive Order 14161,
the Secretary of State, in coordination with the Attorney General, the
Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National
Intelligence, identified countries throughout the world for which
screening and vetting information was so deficient as to warrant a full
or partial suspension of the admission of nationals from those countries
pursuant to section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA),
8 U.S.C. 1182(f).  Accordingly, in Proclamation 10949, I restricted the
entry of foreign nationals into the United States from countries with
deficient screening and vetting information to protect the national
security and public safety of the United States and its people.  The
proclamation also directed the United States Government to immediately
engage countries identified in the proclamation on measures that must be
taken to comply with the screening, vetting, immigration, and security
requirements of the United States. 

Despite those engagements, most of the countries identified in
Proclamation 10949, as well as others, continue to exhibit woeful
inadequacies in screening, vetting, and provision of information.  At
least one country lacks mechanisms in hospitals to ensure births are
reported, and widespread corruption, combined with a general lack of
vetting and poor recordkeeping, result in any non-citizen being able to
obtain any civil document from that country, particularly if that person
is willing to pay a fee or engage an individual that specializes in
assisting in such fraud.  In that same country, law enforcement records
are not maintained with the accuracy or consistency necessary to provide
representations of individuals’ criminal histories to the United States
Government.  In another country, civil documents like marriage licenses
and birth certificates are handwritten and stamped on regular paper,
making them highly susceptible to alteration, and there is a fraudulent
document market that produces all types of falsified records, making
written corroboration of any visa application practically impossible. 
In yet another country, criminal records are widely unreliable and
inaccessible.  And in another, United States visas are used as a tool
for illicit transborder movement of assets by corrupt government
officials and organized criminal groups.  Corruption in another country
even extends to the national school system, which has provided falsified
diplomas and grade information in the past to fraudsters who have tried
to obtain student visas and eligibility for large athletic scholarships.
 The government of another country refuses to provide passport
exemplars, undermining the United States Government’s ability to detect
fraudulent documents.  In another country, the population, for the most
part, does not formally document life events.  This makes effective
verification of basic biographical data such as birthdates, marriages,
and parentage exceedingly difficult, if not impossible.  Such countries
warrant continued or new travel restrictions.  

Further, after continuing their review, and in light of the experience
gained since the issuance of Proclamation 10949 and the reaction of
foreign countries to the issuance of that proclamation, the Secretary of
State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the
Director of National Intelligence have identified additional countries
that cannot meet basic criteria for identifying their nationals and
residents who pose national security and public safety threats and for
sharing information with the United States.  For example, only 40
percent of one country’s territory is under complete government control,
and officials there have noted that their ability to securely process,
house, or monitor non citizens is constrained.  In another country,
corruption in various forms is pervasive.  Other countries have been
subject to successful efforts to overthrow or undermine their
governments, with the result that radical terrorist groups operate with
minimal, if any, interference from law enforcement, engaging in forced
labor, sex trafficking, illegal drug manufacturing and distribution, and
other activities that destabilize such countries.  And, because of the
poor documentation practices and corrupt governments in these countries,
there can be little assurance that the foreign nationals from these
countries who seek to come to America on immigrant or nonimmigrant visas
are not bringing these criminal enterprises with them to the United
States. 

According to United States law enforcement reporting, foreign nationals
from countries named in this proclamation have been involved with crimes
that include murder, terrorism, embezzling public funds, human
smuggling, human trafficking, and other criminal activity.  Many of
these countries are ranked in the top third of countries for
criminality, and widely unreliable foreign civil documents and lack of
authoritative criminal information make it extremely difficult for
United States screening and vetting authorities to assess prior criminal
activity and other grounds of inadmissibility. 

Finally, some of these countries have offered Citizenship by Investment
(CBI) without residency, which poses challenges for screening and
vetting purposes.  As an example, a foreign national from a country that
is subject to travel restrictions could purchase CBI from a second
country that is not subject to travel restrictions, obtain a passport in
the citizenship of that second country, and subsequently apply for a
United States visa for travel to the United States, thus evading the
travel restrictions on his or her first country.  Additionally, United
States law enforcement and the Department of State have found that,
historically, CBI programs have been susceptible to several risks. 
These risks include allowing an individual to conceal his or her
identity and assets to circumvent travel restrictions or financial or
banking restrictions.

Foreign nationals from the countries described above have also exploited
the historic generosity of the United States and violated our Nation’s
immigration laws by not adhering to the terms of their nonimmigrant or
immigrant visas.  As cited in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
Entry/Exit Overstay Report, foreign nationals from many countries have
high nonimmigrant visa overstay rates.  These visa overstays and other
abuses flagrantly violate United States immigration laws, despite
generous incentives offered by my Administration — for example, the
ability to self-deport using the CBP Home app.  To faithfully uphold
United States immigration law, the flow of foreigners from countries
with high overstay rates or significant fraud must stop.

In addition, the implementation of Proclamation 10949 counsels narrowing
the categorical exceptions described in that proclamation to prevent
exploitation by foreign nationals.  For example, immigrant visas for
family members of individuals in the United States will no longer be a
broad categorical exception.  As described above, the countries to which
this proclamation applies have persistent, chronic vetting deficiencies
that impede conclusive admissibility determinations and that are readily
exploitable to threaten United States national security and public
safety.  These deficiencies include poor civil documentation and
recordkeeping practices, widespread corruption and fraud, unreliable or
inaccessible criminal records, and unreliable government travel
documents.  These pervasive risks concerning nationals from the covered
countries apply with at least equal force to family-based visa
applications — which comprise most of the immigrant visa applications
from such countries — and potentially with even greater force.  Familial
ties can serve — and, in the past, have in fact served, based on
concrete information provided by United States law enforcement and the
Department of State — as unique vectors for fraudulent, criminal, or
even terrorist activity through means such as the domestic or
international financing of such activity.  Broadly excepting most
immigrant visa applicants from the countries whose risks and
deficiencies most gravely threaten America is inconsistent with
protecting our national security and with the purpose of driving greater
cooperation and vetting improvements by these specific countries.  This
is particularly true in light of the large numbers of individuals
granted United States immigration status during the prior administration
without sufficient documentation and vetting mechanisms in place, whose
family members might take advantage of such an exception, just as
criminals have taken advantage of family-based visas in the past. 
Accordingly, I have determined that the risks from the classes of aliens
covered by this proclamation cannot be satisfactorily mitigated absent
resolution of the predominating country-specific concerns, and any
extraordinary cases can be appropriately addressed through the
national-interest exceptions provided for in this proclamation and
Proclamation 10949.

As a result of these reviews and considerations, I have decided — as
described in sections 2 and 3 of this proclamation — to continue to
impose and modify the limitations set forth in sections 2 and 3 of
Proclamation 10949 on the entry into the United States by certain
classes of foreign nationals.  Also, I have decided — as described in
sections 4 and 5 of this proclamation — to impose the limitations set
forth below on the entry into the United States by certain other classes
of foreign nationals.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws
of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of
the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), and section 301 of title 3,
United States Code, hereby find that, absent the measures set forth in
this proclamation, the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United
States of persons described in sections 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this
proclamation would be detrimental to the interests of the United States,
and that their entry should be subject to certain restrictions,
limitations, and exceptions.  I therefore hereby proclaim the following:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy and Purpose</span>*.*
 (a)  It is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from
terrorist attacks and other national security and public safety threats.
 Screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with visa
adjudications and other immigration processes play a critical role in
implementing that policy.  These protocols and procedures enhance our
ability to detect foreign nationals who may commit, aid, or support acts
of terrorism, or otherwise pose a safety threat, and they aid our
efforts to prevent such foreign nationals from entering the United
States.

\(b\)  Identity-management and information-sharing standards and
practices of foreign governments impact the effectiveness of the
screening and vetting protocols and procedures of the United States.
 Foreign governments manage the identity and travel documents of their
nationals and residents.  They also control the circumstances under
which they provide information about their nationals and residents to
other governments, including information about known and suspected
terrorists and criminals.

It is, therefore, the policy of the United States to take all necessary
and appropriate steps to encourage foreign governments to improve their
identity-management and information-sharing protocols and procedures and
to regularly share their identity and threat information with the
screening and vetting systems of the United States.

(c)  Proclamation 10949 directed the United States Government to fully
restrict and limit the entry of nationals of the following 12 countries:
 Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea,
Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen.  The
proclamation directed the United States Government to partially restrict
and limit the entry of nationals of the following 7 countries:  Burundi,
Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.
 Additionally, the proclamation directed the Secretary of State, in
consultation with the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland
Security, and the Director of National Intelligence, to immediately
engage each of the countries identified in the proclamation on measures
that must be taken to comply with United States screening, vetting,
immigration, and security requirements.

(d)  Proclamation 10949 directed the Secretary of State, in consultation
with the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the
Director of National Intelligence, to submit a report to the President,
through the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, describing
his assessment and recommending whether any suspensions and limitations
imposed by the proclamation should be continued, terminated, modified,
or supplemented.

(e)  The Secretary of State, with the Assistant to the President for
Homeland Security, presented the report described in subsection (d) of
this section, recommending that entry restrictions and limitations
continue to apply to foreign nationals of several countries.  The report
also identified additional countries for which vetting and screening
information is so deficient as to warrant a full or partial suspension
of admission.  These recommendations follow the engagement with foreign
countries that I directed in Proclamation 10949.

(f)  In evaluating the recommendations from the Secretary of State and
determining whether and to what extent to impose, or continue to impose,
restrictions for each country, I consulted with the Secretary of State,
the Secretary of War, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland
Security, the Director of National Intelligence, appropriate Assistants
to the President, and the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.
 I considered foreign policy, national security, and counterterrorism
goals.  I further considered various factors, including each country’s
screening and vetting capabilities, information-sharing policies, and
country-specific risk factors, including whether each country has a
significant terrorist presence within its territory, its visa-overstay
rate, and its cooperation with accepting back its removable nationals.
 Each of these factors, including visa-overstay rates, was just one
of the factors considered in making the determinations in this
proclamation, and the determinations in this proclamation are based on
the totality of the circumstances with respect to each country after a
review of all relevant factors.

I also considered the different risks posed by aliens admitted on
immigrant visas and those admitted on nonimmigrant visas.  Persons
admitted on immigrant visas are, or can become, lawful permanent
residents of the United States.  Such persons admitted on immigrant
visas may present national security or public safety concerns that may
be distinct from those admitted as nonimmigrants.  The United States
affords lawful permanent residents more enduring rights than it does to
nonimmigrants.  Lawful permanent residents are more difficult to remove
than nonimmigrants, even after national security or public safety
concerns arise, which increases the costs and aggravates the dangers of
errors associated with admitting such individuals.  And although
immigrants are generally subject to more extensive vetting than
nonimmigrants, such vetting is far less reliable when the country from
which someone seeks to emigrate maintains inadequate identity-management
or information-sharing policies or otherwise poses risks to the national
security or public safety of the United States.

I reviewed these factors and assessed these goals, with a particular
focus on crafting country-specific restrictions.  This approach was
designed to encourage cooperation with the relevant countries in
recognition of each country’s unique circumstances.  The restrictions
and limitations imposed by this proclamation are, in my judgment,
necessary to prevent the entry or admission of foreign nationals about
whom the United States Government lacks sufficient information to assess
the risks they pose to the United States.  The restrictions and
limitations imposed by this proclamation are necessary: to garner
cooperation from foreign governments, including as to reducing overstay
rates of their nationals; enforce our immigration laws; and advance
other important foreign policy, national security, and counterterrorism
objectives.  Under the current circumstances, without the restrictions
and limitations imposed in this proclamation, the entry or admission of
such foreign nationals is detrimental to the national interest.

(g)  After reviewing the report described in subsection (d) of this
section, and after accounting for the foreign policy, national security,
and counterterrorism objectives of the United States, I have determined
to continue to fully restrict and limit the entry of nationals of the
following 12 countries: Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo,
Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and
Yemen.  These restrictions distinguish between, but apply to both, the
entry of immigrants and nonimmigrants.

(h)  After reviewing the report described in subsection (d) of this
section, and after accounting for the foreign policy, national security,
and counterterrorism objectives of the United States, I have determined
to fully restrict and limit the entry of nationals of 7 additional
countries:  Burkina Faso, Laos, Mali, Niger, Sierra Leone, South Sudan,
and Syria.  These restrictions distinguish between, but apply to both,
the entry of immigrants and nonimmigrants.  I have also determined to
fully restrict and limit the entry of individuals using travel documents
issued or endorsed by the Palestinian Authority (PA).

(i)  After reviewing the report described in subsection (d) of this
section, and after accounting for the foreign policy, national security,
and counterterrorism objectives of the United States, I have determined
to continue to partially restrict and limit the entry of nationals of
the following 4 countries:  Burundi, Cuba, Togo, and Venezuela.  I have
also decided to modify the partial restriction and limitation on
the entry of nationals of Turkmenistan.  These restrictions distinguish
between, but apply to both, the entry of immigrants and nonimmigrants.

(j)  After reviewing the report described in subsection (d) of this
section, and after accounting for the foreign policy, national security,
and counterterrorism objectives of the United States, I have determined
to partially restrict and limit the entry of nationals of the following
15 countries:  Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Cote d ‘Ivoire,
Dominica, Gabon, The Gambia, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal,
Tanzania, Tonga, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.  These restrictions distinguish
between, but apply to both, the entry of immigrants and nonimmigrants.

(k)  Sections 4 and 5 of this proclamation describe some of the
identity-management and information-sharing inadequacies that led me to
impose, or continue to impose, the restrictions described in this
proclamation.  These inadequacies are sufficient to justify my finding
that unrestricted entry of nationals from the named countries would be
detrimental to the interests of the United States.  Publicly disclosing
additional details on which I relied in making these determinations,
however, would cause serious damage to the national security of the
United States, and many such details are classified.

waivers described in section 6 of this proclamation:

(a)  Burkina Faso

\(i\)  According to the Department of State, terrorist organizations
continue to plan and conduct terrorist activities throughout Burkina
Faso.  According to the Fiscal Year 2024, Department of Homeland
Security (DHS) Entry/Exit Overstay Report (“Overstay Report”), Burkina
Faso had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 9.16 percent and a student (F),
vocational (M), and exchange visitor (J) visa overstay rate of 22.95
percent.  Additionally, Burkina Faso has historically refused to accept
back its removable nationals.

\(ii\)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Burkina Faso as
immigrants and as nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended. 

(b)  Laos

\(i\)   According to the Overstay Report, Laos had a B‑1/B-2 visa
overstay rate of 28.34 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of
11.41 percent.  According to the Fiscal Year 2023, Department of
Homeland Security (DHS) Entry/Exit Overstay Report (“2023 Overstay
Report”), Laos had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 34.77 percent and an
F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 6.49 percent.  Additionally, Laos has
historically failed to accept back its removable nationals.

\(ii\)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Laos as
immigrants and as nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended. 

(c)  Mali

\(i\)   According to the Department of State, armed conflict between the
Malian government and armed groups is common throughout the country. 
Terrorist organizations operate freely in certain areas of Mali. 

\(ii\)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Mali as
immigrants and as nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.

(d)  Niger

\(i\)   According to the Department of State, terrorists and their
supporters are active in planning kidnappings in Niger, and they may
attack anywhere in the country.  According to the Overstay Report, Niger
had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 13.41 percent and an F, M, and J
visa overstay rate of 16.46 percent.

\(ii\)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Niger as
immigrants and as nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.

(e)  Sierra Leone

\(i\)   According to the Overstay Report, Sierra Leone had a B-1/B-2
visa overstay rate of 16.48 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay
rate of 35.83 percent.  According to the 2023 Overstay Report, Sierra
Leone had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 15.43 percent and an F, M, and
J visa overstay rate of 35.83 percent.  Additionally, Sierra Leone has
historically failed to accept back its removable nationals.

(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Sierra Leone as
immigrants and as nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.

(f)  South Sudan

\(i\)   According to the Overstay Report, South Sudan had a B-1/B-2 visa
overstay rate of 6.99 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of
26.09 percent.  Additionally, South Sudan has historically failed to
accept back its removable nationals.

\(ii\)  The entry into the United States of nationals of South Sudan as
immigrants and as nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.

(g)  Syria

(i)   Syria is emerging from a protracted period of civil unrest and
internal strife.  While the country is working to address its security
challenges in close coordination with the United States, Syria still
lacks an adequate central authority for issuing passports or civil
documents and does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures. 
According to the Overstay Report, Syria had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate
of 7.09 percent and a F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 9.34 percent. 

\(ii\)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Syria as
immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.

\(h\)  Palestinian Authority Documents

(i)   Several United States-designated terrorist groups operate actively
in the West Bank or Gaza Strip and have murdered American citizens. 
Also, the recent war in these areas likely resulted in compromised
vetting and screening abilities.  In light of these factors, and
considering the weak or nonexistent control exercised over these areas
by the PA, individuals attempting to travel on PA-issued or endorsed
travel documents cannot currently be properly vetted and approved for
entry into the United States.

(ii)  The entry into the United States of foreign nationals who seek to
travel on any travel documents issued or endorsed by the PA, as
immigrants and nonimmigrants, is hereby fully suspended.
