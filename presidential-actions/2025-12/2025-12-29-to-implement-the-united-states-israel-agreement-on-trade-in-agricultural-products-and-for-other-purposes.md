title: To Implement the United States-Israel Agreement on Trade in Agricultural Products
  and for Other Purposes
---
 
1\.  On April 22, 1985, the United States and Israel entered into the
Agreement on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area between the
Government of the United States of America and the Government of Israel
(the “USIFTA”), which the Congress approved in section 3 of the United
States–Israel Free Trade Area Implementation Act of 1985 (the “USIFTA
Implementation Act”) (Public Law 99-47, 99 Stat. 82 (19 U.S.C. 2112
note)).  Section 4(b) of the USIFTA Implementation Act provides that,
when the President determines that it is necessary to maintain the
general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with
respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, the President may proclaim
such withdrawal, suspension, modification, or continuance of any duty,
or such continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, or such
additional duties, as the President determines to be required or
appropriate to carry out the USIFTA.  In order to maintain the general
level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect
to agricultural trade with Israel, on July 27, 2004, the United States
entered into an agreement with Israel concerning certain aspects of
trade in agricultural products during the period January 1, 2004,
through December 31, 2008 (United States-Israel Agreement Concerning
Certain Aspects of Trade in Agricultural Products (the “2004
Agreement”)).

2.  In Proclamation 7826 of October 4, 2004, the President determined,
pursuant to section 4(b) of the USIFTA Implementation Act and consistent
with the 2004 Agreement, that, in order to maintain the general level of
reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel
provided for by the USIFTA, it was necessary to provide duty-free access
into the United States through December 31, 2008, for specified
quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel.  Each year from
2008 through 2024, the United States and Israel entered into agreements
to extend the period that the 2004 Agreement was in force for 1-year
periods to allow additional time for the two governments to conclude an
agreement to replace the 2004 Agreement.  To carry out the extension
agreements, in Proclamations 8334 of December 31, 2008; 8467 of December
23, 2009; 8618 of December 21, 2010; 8770 of December 29, 2011; 8921 of
December 20, 2012; 9072 of December 23, 2013; 9223 of December 23, 2014;
9383 of December 21, 2015; 9555 of December 15, 2016; 9687 of December
22, 2017; 9834 of December 21, 2018; 9974 of December 26, 2019; 10128 of
December 22, 2020; 10326 of December 23, 2021; 10509 of December 23,
2022; 10692 of December 29, 2023; and 10875 of December 20, 2024,
Presidents Bush, Obama, Biden and I modified the Harmonized Tariff
Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) to provide duty-free access into
the United States for specified quantities of certain agricultural
products of Israel, each time for an additional 1‑year period.  

3\.  On April 22, 1985, the United States and Israel entered into the
Agreement on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area between the
Government of the United States of America and the Government of Israel
(the “USIFTA”), which the Congress approved in section 3 of the United
States–Israel Free Trade Area Implementation Act of 1985 (the “USIFTA
Implementation Act”) (Public Law 99-47, 99 Stat. 82 (19 U.S.C. 2112
note)).  Section 4(b) of the USIFTA Implementation Act provides that,
when the President determines that it is necessary to maintain the
general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with
respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, the President may proclaim
such withdrawal, suspension, modification, or continuance of any duty,
or such continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, or such
additional duties, as the President determines to be required or
appropriate to carry out the USIFTA.  In order to maintain the general
level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect
to agricultural trade with Israel, on July 27, 2004, the United States
entered into an agreement with Israel concerning certain aspects of
trade in agricultural products during the period January 1, 2004,
through December 31, 2008 (United States-Israel Agreement Concerning
Certain Aspects of Trade in Agricultural Products (the “2004
Agreement”)).

4.  On December 1, 2025, the United States entered into an agreement
with Israel to make permanent modifications to the 2004 Agreement.  On
December 4, 2025, the United States entered into an additional agreement
with Israel to extend the period that the 2004 Agreement is in force, in
order to provide time for the permanent modifications to the 2004
Agreement to enter into force.  Pursuant to section 4(b) of the USIFTA
Implementation Act, I have determined that it is necessary, in order to
maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous
concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, to
provide duty-free access into the United States through the close of
December 31, 2026, for specified quantities of certain agricultural
products of Israel, as provided in Annex I of this proclamation.

5.  On May 6, 2003, the United States and the Republic of Singapore
entered into the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (the
“USSFTA”), which the Congress approved in section 101 of the United
States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the “USSFTA
Implementation Act”) (Public Law 108–78, 117 Stat. 948, 949 (19 U.S.C.
3805 note)).  Section 201 of the USSFTA Implementation Act authorizes
the President to proclaim such modifications or continuation of any
duty, such continuation of duty-free or excise treatment, or such
additional duties, as the President determines to be necessary or
appropriate to carry out or apply articles 2.2, 2.5, 2.6, and 2.12 of
the USSFTA and the schedule of reductions set forth in Annex 2B of the
USSFTA.  Section 202 of the USSFTA Implementation Act provides certain
rules for determining whether a good is an originating good for the
purposes of implementing tariff treatment under the USSFTA and
authorizes the President to proclaim the provisions set out in Annexes
3A, 3B, and 3C of the USSFTA and any additional subordinate category
necessary to carry out Title II consistent with the USSFTA.  In
Proclamation 7747 of December 30, 2003, the President determined that it
was necessary to add general note 25 to the HTSUS to implement the
tariff modifications and rules of origin necessary to carry out the
USSFTA. 

6.  Proclamation 7747 contained two technical errors with respect to the
rules of origin for HTSUS subheadings in chapter 90 in general note 25. 
I have determined that additional modifications to the HTSUS are
necessary or appropriate to correct these errors.

7.  On June 30, 2007, the United States and the Republic of Korea
entered into the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement (the
“USKFTA”), which the Congress approved in section 101 of the United
States-Korea Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the “USKFTA
Implementation Act”) (Public Law 112-41, 125 Stat. 428, 430 (19 U.S.C.
3805 note)).  Proclamation 8783 of March 6, 2012, implemented the USKFTA
with respect to the United States and, pursuant to the USKFTA
Implementation Act, incorporated into the HTSUS the schedule of duty
reductions and rules of origin necessary or appropriate to carry out the
USKFTA. 

8.  Proclamation 8771 of December 29, 2011, pursuant to section 1206(a)
of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (Public Law
100-418, 102 Stat. 1107, 1151 (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)), modified the HTSUS to
reflect amendments to the International Convention on the Harmonized
Commodity Description and Coding System (the “Convention”).  Section 201
of the USKFTA Implementation Act authorizes the President to proclaim
such modifications or continuation of any duty, such continuation of
duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as the
President determines to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or
apply articles 2.3, 2.5, and 2.6, and Annex 2-B, Annex 4-B, and Annex
22-A, of the USKFTA.  Section 202(o) of the USKFTA Implementation Act
authorizes the President to proclaim, as part of the HTSUS, the rules of
origin set out in the USKFTA and to proclaim any modifications to such
previously proclaimed rules of origin, subject to the exceptions stated
in section 202(o)(2)(A) of the USKFTA Implementation Act.  In
Proclamation 9072 of December 23, 2013, the President determined that it
was necessary to modify general note 33 to the HTSUS to implement agreed
modifications to the rules of origin in the USKFTA and ensure the
continuation of such staged reductions in rates of duty for originating
goods under tariff categories that had been modified to reflect
amendments to the Convention. 

9.  Proclamation 9072 contained a technical error in tariff
classification rule 1 to chapter 88 in general note 33.  I have
determined that additional modifications to the HTSUS are necessary or
appropriate to correct this error.

10.  In Proclamation 8114 of March 19, 2007, the President established
HTSUS subheading 9819.15.10 and a new U.S. Note 5 to subchapter XIX of
chapter 98 of the HTSUS in order to implement certain aspects of the
tariff treatment provided for in section 112(b)(8) and section 112(c) of
the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Title I of the Trade and
Development Act of 2000, Public Law 106-200, 114 Stat. 251, 262), as
amended by section 6002(b) of the Africa Investment Incentive Act of
2006 (Division D, Title VI of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of
2006, Public Law 109-432, 120 Stat. 2922, 3193 (19 U.S.C. 3721(b)(8) and
(c))).  In Proclamation 8240 of April 17, 2008, the President made
modifications to U.S. Notes 2(a), 2(b), and 2(e) to subchapter XIX of
chapter 98 of the HTSUS to include references to the various HTSUS
subheadings established by Proclamation 8114, including references to
subheading 9819.15.10.  In Proclamation 8323 of November 25, 2008, the
President further modified the HTSUS by deleting U.S. Note 5 to
subchapter XIX of chapter 98 of the HTSUS, and its associated
subheadings, including subheading 9819.15.10.  However, Proclamation
8323 inadvertently omitted conforming changes to U.S. Notes 2(a), 2(b),
and 2(e) to subchapter XIX of chapter 98 of the HTSUS. 

11.  In Proclamation 10326 of December 23, 2021, the President made
certain necessary conforming changes to U.S. Notes 2(a), 2(b), and 2(e)
to subchapter XIX of chapter 98 of the HTSUS, including removing
references to subheading 9819.15.10 from U.S. Notes 2(a) and 2(e), but
inadvertently failed to remove the reference to subheading 9819.15.10 in
the first line of U.S. Note 2(b).  I have determined that additional
modifications to the HTSUS are necessary or appropriate to reflect the
deletion of U.S. Note 5 to subchapter XIX of chapter 98 of the HTSUS,
and its associated subheadings.

12.  Executive Order 14346 of September 5, 2025 (Modifying the Scope of
Reciprocal Tariffs and Establishing Procedures for Implementing Trade
and Security Agreements), authorized the Secretary of Commerce and the
United States Trade Representative to take the necessary and appropriate
steps to implement any current or forthcoming trade and security
framework agreements between a foreign trading partner and the United
States, including modifications to the HTSUS.  The Secretary of Commerce
and the United States Trade Representative, in a *Federal Register*
notice of September 25, 2025 (90 FR 46136), modified the HTSUS to
provide for the preferential treatment of certain goods of the European
Union with respect to the additional *ad valorem* duty imposed under
Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a
Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large
and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), as amended,
including by adding headings 9903.02.74, 9903.02.75, 9903.02.76, and
9903.02.77 to the HTSUS.  These four headings each cross-referenced
explanatory notes in subdivisions (v)(xvi), (xvii), (xviii), and (xix)
of U.S. Note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS,
respectively.

13.  Subsequently, Proclamation 10976 of September 29, 2025 (Adjusting
Imports of Timber, Lumber, and Their Derivative Products Into the United
States), inserted a new subdivision (v)(xiii), effective October 14,
2025, and Proclamation 10984 of October 17, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of
Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles, Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicle Parts,
and Buses Into the United States), inserted new subdivisions (v)(xiv)
and (v)(xv), effective November 1, 2025, into U.S. Note 2 to subchapter
III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS.  Although both proclamations adjusted
the numbering of subsequent provisions in subdivision (v), they omitted
conforming changes to the cross-references in headings
9903.02.74–9903.02.77.  I have determined that additional modifications
to the HTSUS are necessary or appropriate to reflect these conforming
changes.

14.  Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the “Trade Act”)
(Public Law 93-618, 88 Stat. 1978, 2073 (19 U.S.C. 2483)), authorizes
the President to embody in the HTSUS the substance of the relevant
provisions of the Trade Act, and of other acts affecting import
treatment, and actions taken thereunder, including the removal,
modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other
import restriction. 

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to
section 4(b) of the USIFTA Implementation Act, sections 201 and 202 of
the USSFTA Implementation Act, sections 201 and 202 of the USKFTA
Implementation Act, and section 604 of the Trade Act, do proclaim that: 

\(1\)  In order to implement tariff commitments under the 2004 Agreement
through December 31, 2026, the HTSUS is modified as set forth in Annex I
of this proclamation.

(2)  The modifications and technical rectifications to the HTSUS made by
Annex I of this proclamation shall enter into effect on the applicable
dates set forth in Annex I of this proclamation.

\(3\)  In order to make the modifications and technical rectifications
to the HTSUS described in paragraphs 4 through 12 of this proclamation,
the HTSUS is modified as set forth in Annex II of this proclamation.
 These modifications and technical rectifications shall enter into
effect on the applicable dates set forth in Annex II of this
proclamation.

\(4\)  Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders
that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
fiftieth.

DONALD J. TRUMP
