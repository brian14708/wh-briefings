title: Amendments to Adjusting Imports of Timber, Lumber, and their Derivative Products
  into the United States
---
 
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

1.  On July 1, 2025, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted
to me a report on his investigation into the effects of imports of
timber, lumber, and their derivative products (collectively, wood
products) on the national security of the United States under section
232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, 19 U.S.C. 1862
(section 232).  Based on the facts considered in that investigation, the
Secretary found and advised me of his opinion that wood products are
being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such
circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the
United States and provided recommendations for action under section 232
to adjust the imports of wood products so that such imports will not
threaten to impair the national security of the United States.

2.  In Proclamation 10976 of September 29, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of
Timber, Lumber, and Their Derivative Products Into the United States), I
concurred in the Secretary’s finding that wood products are being
imported into the United States in such quantities and under such
circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the
United States and adopted a plan of action to adjust the imports of wood
products so that such imports will not threaten to impair the national
security of the United States.

3.  In Proclamation 10976, I directed the United States Trade
Representative (Trade Representative), in consultation with the
Secretary and any senior official the Trade Representative deemed
appropriate, to pursue negotiations of agreements or continue current
negotiations of agreements to address the threatened impairment of the
national security with respect to imported wood products from any
country and from time to time update me on the status or outcome of
those negotiations.  I also imposed a 10 percent *ad valorem* tariff on
imports of certain softwood timber and lumber and a 25 percent *ad
valorem* tariff on imports of certain upholstered wooden products,
kitchen cabinets, and vanities.  I further stated that on January 1,
2026, the duty rate for upholstered furniture would increase from 25
percent to 30 percent and the duty rate for kitchen cabinets and
vanities would increase from 25 percent to 50 percent except for
countries with which the United States reached an agreement that
addresses the threatened impairment of the national security posed by
imports of wood products.

4.  The Trade Representative has informed me that the United States
continues to engage in productive negotiations of agreements with
multiple countries to address the threatened impairment of the national
security with respect to imports of wood products.  After considering
the information the Trade Representative has provided me, among other
things, I determine that it is necessary and appropriate to continue
these negotiations and to delay for an additional year the increase in
the duty rates for upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets, and
vanities.  In my judgment, the action in this proclamation will result
in more productive negotiations of agreements to address the threatened
impairment to the national security found in Proclamation 10976, while
the tariffs imposed in Proclamation 10976 will continue to adjust the
imports of wood products and address the threat to impair the national
security found in Proclamation 10976.

5.  Section 232 authorizes the President to take action to adjust the
imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into
the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to
threaten to impair the national security.  Section 232 includes the
authority to adopt and carry out a plan of action, with adjustments over
time, to address the national security threat.  That initial plan of
action may include negotiations of agreements with foreign trading
partners along with other actions to adjust imports to address the
national security threat, including tariffs.  

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws
of the United States of America, including section 232, and section 301
of title 3, United States Code, do hereby proclaim as follows:

\(1\)  Proclamation 10976 is amended by revising clause 5 to read as
follows:

“(5)  The rates of duty established in this proclamation shall apply
with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from
warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time
on October 14, 2025.  Effective January 1, 2027, the duty rate in clause
2 shall increase to 30 percent and the duty rate in clause 3 shall
increase to 50 percent, and shall continue in effect, except for
countries with which the United States reaches an agreement that
addresses the threatened impairment of the national security posed by
imports of wood products.  Except as otherwise provided in this
proclamation, the tariffs imposed in this proclamation are in addition
to any other duties, taxes, fees, exactions, and charges applicable to
such imported wood products.”

\(2\)  The Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary and
any senior official the Trade Representative deems appropriate, shall
pursue negotiations of agreements or continue current negotiations of
agreements to address the threatened impairment of the national security
with respect to imported wood products from any country.  The Trade
Representative shall, from time to time, update me on the status or
outcome of the negotiations described in Proclamation 10976 and this
proclamation.  The Trade Representative shall provide one of these
updates shortly before the date that is 180 days after the date of
Proclamation 10976.

(3)  Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that
is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.  If any provision of
this proclamation or the application of any provision to any individual
or circumstance is held to be invalid, the remainder of this
proclamation and the application of its provisions to any other
individuals or circumstances shall not be affected.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
fiftieth.

                               DONALD J. TRUMP
