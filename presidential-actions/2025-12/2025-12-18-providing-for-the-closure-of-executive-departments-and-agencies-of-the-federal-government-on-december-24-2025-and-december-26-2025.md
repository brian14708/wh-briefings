By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.  All executive
departments and agencies of the Federal Government shall be closed and
their employees excused from duty on Wednesday, December 24, 2025, and
Friday, December 26, 2025, the day before and the day following
Christmas Day, respectively.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.  The heads of
executive departments and agencies may determine that certain offices
and installations of their organizations, or parts thereof, must remain
open and that certain employees must report for duty on December 24,
2025, or December 26, 2025, or both, for reasons of national security,
defense, or other public need.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.  December 24, 2025,
and December 26, 2025, shall be considered as falling within the scope
of Executive Order 11582 of February 11, 1971, and of 5 U.S.C. 5546 and
6103(b) and other similar statutes insofar as they relate to the pay and
leave of employees of the United States.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.  The Director of the
Office of Personnel Management shall take such actions as may be
necessary to implement this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. 
(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(d)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Office of Personnel Management.
