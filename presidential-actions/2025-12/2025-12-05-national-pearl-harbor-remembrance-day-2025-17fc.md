BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

------------------------------------------------------------------------

On December 7, 1941, a peaceful Sunday morning on the Hawaiian island of
Oahu was shattered by an unprovoked attack by the naval and air forces
of the Empire of Japan on the United States Pacific Fleet at Pearl
Harbor and the aircraft and hangars at Kaneohe, Ford Island, Barbers
Point, and Hickam Field.  The surprise offensive claimed the lives of
2,403 American service members and civilians and propelled our Nation
into the Second World War. 

The Japanese mission was designed to cripple our military assets and
obliterate the American spirit, but instead, the fatal attacks rallied
our shattered citizenry and fueled our resolve.  Young men from every
corner of our country put their lives and futures on hold and were
thrust into bloody and brutal battles of historic consequence that would
forever change the world.  Although untested in battle, these patriots,
still reeling from horror and disbelief, united in a singular mission: 
to defeat tyranny.  The exceptional courage and immeasurable sacrifices
of the Greatest Generation secured our way of life and the blessings of
freedom for future generations.

In the decades since the “date which will live in infamy,” the aggressor
has become our loyal ally and trusted friend.  Japan is one of our
closest security partnerships, and our military forces work together
every day to defend our common interests.  We are united by commerce,
history, culture, and mutual respect.  Our strong alliance is a
testament to the transformational power of peace, diplomacy, and
democracy.

The lessons learned 84 years ago on that fateful day still resound with
America’s exceptional fighting force.  We must remain ever vigilant and
prepared to annihilate any foe who dares to threaten our liberty.  This
annual day of remembrance must be held in the highest esteem and
reverence as we honor the Americans who laid down their lives to defend
our homeland on the island of Oahu and in the battles of World War II.

The Congress, by Public Law 103-308, as amended, has designated December
7 of each year as “National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.”

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 7, 2025, as
National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.  I encourage all Americans to
observe this solemn day and to honor our military, past and present,
with appropriate ceremonies and activities.  I urge all Federal agencies
and interested organizations, groups, and individuals to fly the flag of
the United States at half-staff in honor of those American patriots who
died as a result of their service at Pearl Harbor.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
fiftieth.

                               DONALD J. TRUMP
