BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a mark of respect for the memory of Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, West
Virginia Army National Guard, by the authority vested in me as President
of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the
United States of America, I hereby order that the flag of the
United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and upon
all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval
stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the
District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its
Territories and possessions until sunset, December 4, 2025.  I also
direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same length of
time at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and
other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval
vessels and stations.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
fiftieth.

DONALD J. TRUMP
