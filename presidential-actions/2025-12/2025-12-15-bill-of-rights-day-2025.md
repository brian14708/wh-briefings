title: Bill of Rights Day, 2025
---
 
Two hundred and fifty years ago, our Nation was conceived in liberty,
our freedom was wrested from the hands of tyranny, and our people
courageously united as one Nation under God, committed to the immortal
principles of sovereignty, justice, and self-determination.  Today, we
proudly celebrate the ratification of our Bill of Rights — the
revolutionary document that enshrines in law the principles of freedom,
human dignity, and due process upon which the United States was
founded.  On this Bill of Rights Day, we proudly carry forth the bold
vision of our Founding Fathers.  We recommit to the timeless freedoms
enshrined in the Bill of Rights, and we vow to always preserve, protect,
and defend our God-given rights, our glorious American heritage, and our
constitutional way of life.

Following the Revolutionary War, the framers of our Constitution set
aside 10 core protections from government authority that would
ultimately become known as the “Bill of Rights.”  After decades of
oppression under British rule, James Madison — the Father of the
Constitution — came to understand that it was necessary to clearly
define what freedoms the law protected, setting the stage for the
triumph of true self-government.  Though Madison was once concerned that
a written bill of rights would not succeed in fending off forces of
tyranny and oppression, his friend Thomas Jefferson later convinced him:
“A bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every
government on earth, general or particular, and what no just government
should refuse or rest on inference.”  

In 1789, the First United States Congress drafted the first 10
amendments to the Constitution and later sent them to the States to
ratify.  In doing so, the States forever secured a series of freedoms
that no tyrant could ever infringe — including the rights to speak and
worship freely, to keep and bear arms, to resist unlawful arrest and
seizure of private property, to be assured of a quick and fair trial,
and to be protected against cruel and unusual punishment — and affirmed
that the States hold all powers not granted to the Federal Government.

More than two centuries later, these foundational legal principles
remain the lifeblood of our Republic and continue to stand at the heart
of our laws, our system of government, and our livelihood.  Our framers
understood that codifying our rights in ink alone would not be
sufficient and that our rights depended on the endurance of bedrock
American principles like the separation of powers, due process, checks
and balances, and States’ rights.  Above all, however, they knew that
our rights would forever rely on a good and moral citizenry committed to
the virtues that gave rise to our Republic and have sustained our
liberty through victory and defeat, triumphs and setbacks, and times of
peace and war since July 4, 1776.

Every day, my Administration is acting with strength and conviction to
guard these freedoms, the meaning of American citizenship, and our
constitutional heritage.  We are restoring the rule of law, fighting
back against left-wing lawfare, cleaning up our corrupt bureaucracies
and draining the swamp, and forever ensuring that the American people do
not answer to Washington, Washington answers to the American people.

As we approach 250 glorious years of American independence next year, we
proudly carry forward the legacy forged by our Founders in the crucible
of revolution.  We renew our commitment to always upholding the common
good and the dignity of the human person — and above all, we pledge to
preserve the promise of a proud, free, self-governing Republic for
ourselves and our posterity.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 15, 2025, as
Bill of Rights Day.  I call upon the people of the United States,
especially teachers, educators, and school administrators, to mark this
observance with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
fiftieth.

                              DONALD J. TRUMP
