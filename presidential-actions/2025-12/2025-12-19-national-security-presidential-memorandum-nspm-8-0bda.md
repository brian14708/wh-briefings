THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE  
THE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION  
THE SECRETARY OF ENERGY  
THE SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY  
THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET  
THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE

SUBJECT:       Winning the 6G Race  
   
   
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct:  
   
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  The next
generation of mobile communications networks (6G) will be foundational
to the national security, foreign policy, and economic prosperity of the
United States.  This technology will play a pivotal role in the
development and adoption of emerging technologies like artificial
intelligence, robotics, and implantable technologies.  6G will also
provide faster, more resilient, and more secure communication networks
that can be utilized for national security and public safety purposes.  
   
It is the policy of the United States to lead the world in 6G
development.  Certain steps are necessary to achieve the goal of this
policy, including steadfastly advancing American interests in the
international standards bodies that will play a crucial role in 6G
development, and identifying a significant volume of radiofrequency
spectrum that can be harmonized for 6G networks internationally.  My
Administration has been studying multiple spectrum bands this year to
determine what Federal spectrum can be reallocated to commercial use for
6G development without undermining national security missions that occur
in those bands.  Consistent with the preliminary conclusions of those
evaluations, I am hereby directing the following actions to ensure
America’s leadership in 6G development.  
   
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Spectrum Relocation</span>.
 (a)  The Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and
Information (Assistant Secretary) shall, in consultation with the
Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and the Assistant to the
President for Science and Technology, immediately commence studies in
consultation with Federal incumbents with operations between the
7.125-7.4 GHz spectrum frequencies to determine how to relocate their
affected systems to other frequencies, including 7.4-8.4 GHz.  
   
(b)  No later than 12 months from the date of this memorandum, the
Assistant Secretary shall submit to the President, through the Assistant
to the President for Economic Policy, the Assistant to the President for
Science and Technology, and the Assistant to the President for National
Security Affairs, results of the studies required under subsection (a)
of this section, including estimated transition costs and timelines as
determined by the Assistant Secretary.  This submission by the Assistant
Secretary shall also demonstrate how such relocation of systems will not
materially impair the national security missions or electric grid
operations that occur in the 7.125-7.4 GHz band, as identified by the
Secretary of War and the Director of National Intelligence.  
   
(c)  This section shall not apply to systems at fixed geographic sites
that are used for satellite telemetry uplink and radio astronomy as
identified by the Assistant Secretary.  
   
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Spectrum Designation</span>. 
Pursuant to section 40002(c)(2)(A) of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act
(Public Law 119-21), the Assistant Secretary shall immediately begin the
process of identifying the band of spectrum frequencies at 7.125-7.4 GHz
for reallocation for full-power commercial licensed use cases.   
   
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Spectrum Studies</span>.
 Pursuant to section 40002(f) of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the
Assistant Secretary shall immediately begin the process to commence
studies on the 2.69-2.9 GHz and the 4.4-4.94 GHz spectrum frequencies to
determine whether portions of those bands can feasibly be reallocated
for full-power commercial licensed use cases.  
   
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Diplomatic Engagement</span>.
 The Secretary of State shall, in coordination with the Assistant to the
President for Economic Policy, the Assistant to the President for
Science and Technology, the Assistant Secretary, the Chairman of the
Federal Communications Commission, and any other official the Secretary
of State deems appropriate, advance the objectives identified in section
1 of this memorandum through diplomatic engagements.  These efforts
shall include building a coalition of industry and foreign partners that
supports the United States’ positions on Agenda Item 1.7 at the
International Telecommunication Union’s World Radiocommunication
Conference-27.  
   
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.  (a)
 Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:  
   
     (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or
agency, or the head thereof; or  
   
     (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
   
(b)  This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
   
(c)  This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
