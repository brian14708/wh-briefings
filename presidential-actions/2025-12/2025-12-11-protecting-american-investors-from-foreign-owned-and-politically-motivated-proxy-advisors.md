title: Protecting American Investors from Foreign-Owned and Politically-Motivated
  Proxy Advisors
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>*.*  Unbeknownst
to many Americans, two foreign-owned proxy advisors, Institutional
Shareholder Services Inc. and Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC, play a
significant role in shaping the policies and priorities of America’s
largest companies through the shareholder voting process.  These firms,
which control more than 90 percent of the proxy advisor market, advise
their clients about how to vote the enormous numbers of shares their
clients hold and manage on behalf of millions of Americans in mutual
funds and exchange traded funds.  Their clients’ holdings often
constitute a significant ownership stake in the United States’ largest
publicly traded companies, and their clients often follow the proxy
advisors’ advice. 

As a result, these proxy advisors wield enormous influence over
corporate governance matters, including shareholder proposals, board
composition, and executive compensation, as well as capital markets and
the value of Americans’ investments more generally, including 401(k)s,
IRAs, and other retirement investment vehicles.  These proxy advisors
regularly use their substantial power to advance and prioritize radical
politically-motivated agendas — like “diversity, equity, and inclusion”
and “environmental, social, and governance” — even though investor
returns should be the only priority.  For example, these proxy advisors
have supported shareholder proposals requiring American companies to
conduct racial equity audits and significantly reduce greenhouse gas
emissions, and one continues to provide guidance based on the racial or
ethnic diversity of corporate boards.  Their practices also raise
significant concerns about conflicts of interest and the quality of
their recommendations, among other concerns.  The United States must
therefore increase oversight of and take action to restore public
confidence in the proxy advisor industry, including by promoting
accountability, transparency, and competition.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Protecting Investors from
Politicized Advice</span>.  (a)  The Chairman of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) shall review all rules, regulations, guidance,
bulletins, and memoranda relating to proxy advisors.  Consistent with
the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 551 *et* *seq.*), the
SEC Chairman shall consider revising or rescinding those rules,
regulations, guidance, bulletins, and memoranda that are inconsistent
with the purpose of this order, especially to the extent that they
implicate “diversity, equity, and inclusion” and “environmental, social,
and governance” policies.

(b)  Consistent with the APA, the SEC Chairman shall consider revising
or rescinding all rules, regulations, guidance, bulletins, and memoranda
relating to shareholder proposals, including Rule 14a-8 (17 CFR
240.14a-8), that are inconsistent with the purpose of this order.

\(c\)  The SEC Chairman shall:

\(i\)    enforce the Federal securities laws’ anti‑fraud provisions with
respect to material misstatements or omissions contained in proxy
advisors’ proxy voting recommendations;

\(ii\)   assess whether to require proxy advisors whose activities fall
within the scope of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b-1
*et seq.*) and the rules promulgated thereunder, to register as
Registered Investment Advisers;

\(iii\)  consider requiring proxy advisors to provide increased
transparency on their recommendations, methodology, and conflicts of
interest, especially regarding “diversity, equity, and inclusion” and
“environmental, social, and governance” factors;

\(iv\)   analyze whether, and under what circumstances, a proxy advisor
serves as a vehicle for investment advisers to coordinate and augment
their voting decisions with respect to a company’s securities and,
through such coordination and augmentation, form a group for purposes of
sections 13(d)(3) and 13(g)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(15 U.S.C. 78a *et seq*.); and

(v)    direct SEC staff to examine whether the practice of Registered
Investment Advisers engaging proxy advisors to advise on (and following
the recommendations of such proxy advisors with respect to)
non-pecuniary factors in investing, including, as appropriate,
“diversity, equity, and inclusion” and “environmental, social, and
governance” factors, is inconsistent with their fiduciary duties.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Unfair, Deceptive, or
Anticompetitive Practices</span>.  (a)  The Chairman of the Federal
Trade Commission (FTC), in consultation with the Attorney General, shall
review ongoing State antitrust investigations into proxy advisors and
determine if there is a probable link between conduct underlying those
investigations and violations of Federal antitrust law.

\(b\)  The FTC Chairman, under the authorities provided in the Federal
Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 *et seq.*) and in consultation with
the Attorney General, as appropriate, shall investigate whether proxy
advisors engage in unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive
acts or practices that harm United States consumers by:

\(i\)    conspiring or colluding, explicitly or implicitly, to diminish
the value of consumer investments (including pensions and retirement
accounts);

\(ii\)   failing to adequately disclose conflicts of interest;

\(iii\)  providing misleading or inaccurate information;

\(iv\)   undermining the ability of consumers to make informed choices;
or

\(v\)    otherwise engaging in conduct that violates the antitrust laws
as defined in 15 U.S.C. 12(a) or section 5 of the Federal Trade
Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45).

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Protecting Pensions and
Retirement Plans</span>.  (a)  The Secretary of Labor shall, consistent
with the APA, take steps to revise all regulations and guidance
regarding the fiduciary status of individuals who manage, or, like proxy
advisors, advise those who manage, the rights appurtenant to shares held
by plans covered under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 (ERISA) (29 U.S.C. 1001 *et seq.*), including proxy votes and
corporate engagement, consistent with the policy of this order.  The
Secretary of Labor shall consider whether these proposed revisions
should include amendments to specify that any individual who has a
relationship of trust and confidence with their client, including any
proxy advisor, and who provides advice for a fee or other compensation,
direct or indirect, with respect to the exercise of the rights
appurtenant to shares held by ERISA plans, is an investment advice
fiduciary under ERISA.

(b)  The Secretary of Labor shall take all appropriate action to
strengthen the fiduciary standards of pension and retirement plans
covered under ERISA.  Such action shall include assessing whether proxy
advisors act solely in the financial interests of plan participants and
the extent to which any of their practices undermine the pecuniary value
of the assets of ERISA plans.

\(c\)  The Secretary of Labor shall take all appropriate action to
enhance transparency concerning the use of proxy advisors, particularly
regarding “diversity, equity, and inclusion” and “environmental, social,
and governance” investment practices.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.
 (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

\(d\)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Department of Labor.
