title: INCREASING MEDICAL MARIJUANA AND CANNABIDIOL RESEARCH
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose and Policy</span>.
 Americans deserve access to the best medical treatments and research
infrastructure in the world.  In 2023, the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) completed a review of the landscape of medical use of marijuana
and found scientific support for its use to treat anorexia related to a
medical condition, nausea and vomiting, and pain. Chronic pain affects
nearly 1 in 4 United States adults and more than 1 in 3 United States
seniors, and 6 in 10 people who use medical marijuana report doing so to
manage pain.  Forty States plus the District of Columbia have State- or
locally-sanctioned, regulated medical marijuana programs.  Yet decades
of Federal drug control policy have neglected marijuana’s medical uses.
 That oversight has limited the ability of scientists and manufacturers
to complete the necessary research on safety and efficacy to inform
doctors and patients.

Marijuana is currently controlled under Schedule I of the Controlled
Substances Act (CSA).  In 2023, the Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) recommended to the Drug Enforcement Agency that marijuana
be controlled under Schedule III of the CSA.  Schedule I drugs are
defined as drugs with no currently accepted medical use, a high
potential for abuse, and a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug
under medical supervision.  Schedule III drugs are classified as having
a potential for abuse less than the drugs or other substances in
Schedules I and II, a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the
United States, and a potential for moderate or low physical dependence
or high psychological dependence in the event of drug abuse.

The recommendation from HHS included a determination that medical
marijuana has a currently accepted medical use.  That determination was
based in part on a finding by the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary
of Health that more than 30,000 licensed healthcare practitioners across
43 United States jurisdictions are authorized to recommend the medical
use of marijuana for more than 6 million registered patients to treat at
least 15 medical conditions.  It was also based on a finding by the FDA
of credible scientific support to substantiate the use of marijuana in
the treatment of pain, anorexia related to certain medical conditions,
and nausea and vomiting induced by chemotherapy.  The National Institute
on Drug Abuse concurred with the FDA’s recommendation that marijuana be
rescheduled from Schedule I to Schedule III of the CSA.  In May 2024,
the Department of Justice issued a proposed rule to reschedule marijuana
to Schedule III.  The proposed rule received nearly 43,000 public
comments and is currently awaiting an administrative law hearing.

The Federal Government’s long delay in recognizing the medical use of
marijuana does not serve the Americans who report health benefits from
the medical use of marijuana to ease chronic pain and other various
medically recognized ailments.  Americans who often seek alternative
relief from chronic pain symptoms are particularly impacted.  For
example, in one research survey, 20 percent of participating United
States veterans reported using fewer opioids as a result of their
medical marijuana use.  One in 10 seniors used marijuana in the last
year and some evidence shows improvements in seniors’ health-related
quality of life and pain with medical marijuana use.  However, the
current Schedule I position of marijuana has impeded research.  The lack
of appropriate research on medical marijuana and consequent lack of FDA
approval leaves American patients and doctors without adequate guidance
on appropriate prescribing and utilization.  One patient survey showed
that just 56 percent of older Americans using marijuana have discussed
the usage with their healthcare provider.  This places patients,
especially seniors who may be on multiple medications, at increased risk
of drug interactions or other adverse events.  The Federal Government
must improve the research infrastructure for medical marijuana to better
serve Americans.  

In addition to medical marijuana, which is primarily made up of two
cannabinoids — cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydracannabinol (THC) —
hemp-derived cannabinoid products, defined by section 297A of the
Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C. 1639o), have shown
potential to improve patient symptoms for common ailments and are
frequently used by Americans.  One in 5 United States adults and nearly
15 percent of seniors reported using CBD in the past year, and chronic
pain patients have reported improvements with CBD use in clinical
studies.  Furthermore, evidence suggests that the amount of THC in
hemp-derived cannabinoid products can affect both pain treatment
efficacy and adverse events.  Hemp-derived cannabinoids, as defined in 7
U.S.C. 1639o, are not controlled substances under the CSA but are
subject to the same authorities and requirements as FDA-regulated
products containing any other substance.  Adding complexity is the fact
that some full-spectrum CBD products will once again be controlled as
marijuana under the CSA when section 781 of Public Law 119-37 goes into
effect because they contain THC levels above the per-container threshold
set by that law.  Further, a recent study found that some commercially
available CBD products evaluated were inaccurately labeled regarding CBD
isolate, broad-spectrum, or full-spectrum composition, posing safety
risks for consumers.  In short, the current legal landscape leaves
American patients and doctors without adequate guidance or product
safeguards for CBD.

It is the policy of my Administration to increase medical marijuana and
CBD research to better inform patients and doctors.  It is critical to
close the gap between current medical marijuana and CBD use and medical
knowledge of risks and benefits, including for specific populations and
conditions.  Research methods and models should include real-world
evidence and should facilitate affordable access in order to rapidly
assess the health outcomes of medical marijuana and legal CBD products
while focusing on long-term health effects in vulnerable populations
like adolescents and young adults.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Rescheduling Medical Marijuana
and Improving Access to Cannabidiol Products</span>.  (a)  The Attorney
General shall take all necessary steps to complete the rulemaking
process related to rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III of the CSA in
the most expeditious manner in accordance with Federal law, including 21
U.S.C. 811.

(b)  The Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff for
Legislative, Political, and Public Affairs shall work with the Congress
to update the statutory definition of final hemp-derived cannabinoid
products to allow Americans to benefit from access to appropriate
full-spectrum CBD products while preserving the Congress’s intent to
restrict the sale of products that pose serious health risks.  This will
include consultation with appropriate executive departments and agencies
and authorities to develop a regulatory framework for hemp-derived
cannabinoid products, including development of guidance on an upper
limit on milligrams of THC per serving with considerations on per
container limits and CBD to THC ratio requirements.  The Secretary of
Health and Human Services, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, the
Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the
Director of the National Institutes of Health shall develop research
methods and models utilizing real-world evidence to improve access to
hemp-derived cannabinoid products in accordance with Federal law and to
inform standards of care.
