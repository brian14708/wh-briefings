title: Aligning United States Core Childhood Vaccine Recommendations with Best Practices
  from Peer, Developed Countries

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

THE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION

SUBJECT:       Aligning United States Core Childhood Vaccine
Recommendations with Best Practices from Peer, Developed Countries

In January 2025, the United States recommended vaccinating all children
for 18 diseases, including COVID-19, making our country a high outlier
in the number of vaccinations recommended for all children.  Peer,
developed countries recommend fewer childhood vaccinations — Denmark
recommends vaccinations for just 10 diseases with serious morbidity or
mortality risks; Japan recommends vaccinations for 14 diseases; and
Germany recommends vaccinations for 15 diseases.  Other current United
States childhood vaccine recommendations also depart from policies in
the majority of developed countries.  Study is warranted to ensure that
Americans are receiving the best, scientifically-supported medical
advice in the world.

I hereby direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the
Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to review
best practices from peer, developed countries for core childhood
vaccination recommendations — vaccines recommended for all children —
and the scientific evidence that informs those best practices, and, if
they determine that those best practices are superior to current
domestic recommendations, update the United States core childhood
vaccine schedule to align with such scientific evidence and best
practices from peer, developed countries while preserving access to
vaccines currently available to Americans.

This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

                             DONALD J. TRUMP
