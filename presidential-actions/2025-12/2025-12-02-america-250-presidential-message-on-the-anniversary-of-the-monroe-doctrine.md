title: 'America 250: Presidential Message on the Anniversary of the Monroe Doctrine'
---
 
On December 2, 1823, the doctrine of American sovereignty was
immortalized in prose when President James Monroe declared before the
Nation a simple truth that has echoed throughout the ages:  The United
States will never waver in defense of our homeland, our interests, or
the well-being of our citizens.  Today, my Administration proudly
reaffirms this promise under a new “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe
Doctrine:  That the American people—not foreign nations nor globalist
institutions—will always control their own destiny in our hemisphere.

More than 2 centuries ago, President Monroe proclaimed before the United
States Congress what is today known as the legendary “Monroe Doctrine”—a
bold policy that rejects foreign interference of faraway nations and
confidently asserts United States leadership in the Western Hemisphere. 
“The American continents, by the free and independent condition which
they have assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as
subjects for future colonization by any European powers,” President
Monroe professed.  With those mighty words, every nation knew that the
United States of America was emerging as a superpower unlike anything
the world had ever known—and that nothing could ever rival the strength,
unity, and resolve of a freedom-loving people.

In the centuries since, President Monroe’s doctrine of sovereignty has
guarded the American continents against communism, fascism, and foreign
infringement, and as the 47th President of the United States, I am
proudly reasserting this time-honored policy.  Since I took office, I
have aggressively pursued an America first policy of peace through
strength.  We restored U.S. privileged access through the Panama Canal. 
We are reestablishing American maritime dominance.  We are disrupting
non-market practices in the international supply chain and logistics
sectors. 

My Administration is also halting the flow of deadly drugs flowing
through Mexico, ending the invasion of illegal aliens along our southern
border, and dismantling narco-terrorist networks all across the Western
Hemisphere.  To defend our Nation’s workers and industries, I recently
secured historic trade deals with El Salvador, Argentina, Ecuador, and
Guatemala, allowing greater and more streamlined market access. 
Reinvigorated by my Trump Corollary, the Monroe Doctrine is alive and
well—and American leadership is coming roaring back stronger than ever
before.

Today, we renew our pledge to always uphold American sovereignty,
security, and safety first.  Above all, we vow to protect our cherished
national legacy of republican self-government against all threats,
foreign and domestic.
