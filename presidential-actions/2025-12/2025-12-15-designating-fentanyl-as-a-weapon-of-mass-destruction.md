title: DESIGNATING FENTANYL AS A WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose and Policy</span>. 
Illicit fentanyl is closer to a chemical weapon than a narcotic.  Two
milligrams, an almost undetectable trace amount equivalent to 10 to 15
grains of table salt, constitutes a lethal dose.  Hundreds of thousands
of Americans have died from fentanyl overdoses.

The manufacture and distribution of fentanyl, primarily performed by
organized criminal networks, threatens our national security and fuels
lawlessness in our hemisphere and at our borders.  The production and
sale of fentanyl by Foreign Terrorist Organizations and cartels fund
these entities’ operations — which include assassinations, terrorist
acts, and insurgencies around the world — and allow these entities to
erode our domestic security and the well-being of our Nation.  The two
cartels that are predominantly responsible for the distribution of
fentanyl in the United States engage in armed conflict over territory
and to protect their operations, resulting in large-scale violence and
death that go beyond the immediate threat of fentanyl itself.  Further,
the potential for fentanyl to be weaponized for concentrated,
large-scale terror attacks by organized adversaries is a serious threat
to the United States.  

As President of the United States, my highest duty is the defense of the
country and its citizens.  Accordingly, I hereby designate illicit
fentanyl and its core precursor chemicals as Weapons of Mass Destruction
(WMD).

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Implementation</span>.  The
heads of relevant executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall
take appropriate action to implement this order and eliminate the threat
of illicit fentanyl and its core precursor chemicals to the
United States.  This includes the following actions:

(a)  the Attorney General shall immediately pursue investigations and
prosecutions into fentanyl trafficking, including through criminal
charges as appropriate, sentencing enhancements, and sentencing
variances;

\(b\)  the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury shall
pursue appropriate actions against relevant assets and financial
institutions in accordance with applicable law for those involved in or
supporting the manufacture, distribution, and sale of illicit fentanyl
and its core precursor chemicals;

(c)  the Secretary of War and the Attorney General shall determine
whether the threats posed by illicit fentanyl and its impact on the
United States warrant the provision of resources from the Department of
War to the Department of Justice to aid in the enforcement of title 18
of the United States Code, as consistent with 10 U.S.C. 282;

(d)  the Secretary of War, in consultation with the Secretary of
Homeland Security, shall update all directives regarding the Armed
Forces’ response to chemical incidents in the homeland to include the
threat of illicit fentanyl; and

\(e\)  to ensure the United States uses the full array of appropriate
counter-fentanyl tools, the Secretary of Homeland Security, as
consistent with applicable law and in coordination with the heads of
relevant agencies, as appropriate, shall identify threat networks
related to fentanyl smuggling using WMD- and nonproliferation-related
threat intelligence to support the full spectrum of counter-fentanyl
operations.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Definitions</span>.  (a)
 “Illicit fentanyl” means fentanyl that is manufactured, distributed, or
dispensed, or possessed with intent to manufacture, distribute, or
dispense in violation of section 401 and 406 of the Controlled
Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841, 846). 

\(b\)  “Core precursor chemicals” means the core chemicals that create
illicit fentanyl and its analogues, such as Piperidone or other
Piperidone-based substances.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.
 (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or

(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(d)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Department of Justice.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

    December 15, 2025.
