title: ENSURING AMERICAN SPACE SUPERIORITY
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  Superiority
in space is a measure of national vision and willpower, and the
technologies Americans develop to achieve it contribute substantially to
the Nation’s strength, security, and prosperity.  The United States must
therefore pursue a space policy that will extend the reach of human
discovery, secure the Nation’s vital economic and security interests,
unleash commercial development, and lay the foundation for a new space
age.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  My
Administration will focus its space policy on achieving the following
priorities:

\(a\)  Leading the world in space exploration and expanding human reach
and American presence in space by:

\(i\)    returning Americans to the Moon by 2028 through the Artemis
Program, to assert American leadership in space, lay the foundations for
lunar economic development, prepare for the journey to Mars, and inspire
the next generation of American explorers;

\(ii\)   establishing initial elements of a permanent lunar outpost by
2030 to ensure a sustained American presence in space and enable the
next steps in Mars exploration; and

\(iii\)  enhancing sustainability and cost-effectiveness of launch and
exploration architectures, including enabling commercial launch services
and prioritizing lunar exploration;

\(b\)  Securing and defending American vital national and economic
security interests in, from, and to space by:

\(i\)    developing and demonstrating prototype next-generation missile
defense technologies by 2028 to progressively and materially enhance
America’s air and missile defenses pursuant to Executive Order 14186 of
January 27, 2025 (The Iron Dome for America);

\(ii\)   ensuring the ability to detect, characterize, and counter
threats to United States space interests from very low-Earth orbit and
through cislunar space, including any placement of nuclear weapons in
space;

\(iii\)  creating a responsive and adaptive national security space
architecture by accelerating acquisition reform, integrating commercial
space capabilities, and enabling new market entrants; and

\(iv\)   strengthening ally and partner contributions to United States
and collective space security, including through increased space
security spending, operational cooperation, basing agreements, and ally
and partner investments in America’s space industrial base;

\(c\)  Growing a vibrant commercial space economy through the power of
American free enterprise by:

\(i\)    fostering economic growth, attracting at least $50 billion of
additional investment in American space markets by 2028, and increasing
launch and reentry cadence through new and upgraded facilities, improved
efficiency, and policy reforms;

\(ii\)   demonstrating spectrum leadership across space applications to
promote United States technology competitiveness, spectrum management
efficiency, and global market access; and

\(iii\)  spurring private sector initiative and a commercial pathway to
replace the International Space Station by 2030; and

\(d\)  Developing and deploying advanced capabilities and approaches to
enable the next century of space achievements by:

\(i\)    optimizing space research-and-development investments to
achieve my Administration’s near-term space objectives, use emerging
technologies and scientific discoveries to advance mission capabilities,
and enable scientific discovery for America’s long-term science and
technology leadership;

\(ii\)   enabling near-term utilization of space nuclear power by
deploying nuclear reactors on the Moon and in orbit, including a lunar
surface reactor ready for launch by 2030;

\(iii\)  improving high-value space and Earth weather forecasting and
operations to meet needs on Earth and beyond, utilizing improved
business approaches such as firm fixed-price contracts and as-a-service
models for both space and ground-based segments;

\(iv\)   enabling the sustainability of space operations through
effective and responsible approaches to space traffic management;
orbital debris mitigation and remediation; and terrestrial and cislunar
positioning, navigation, and timing, including by establishing the
United States as the standards and services leader in these areas; and

\(v\)    establishing ground, space, and lunar infrastructure and
standards that enable implementation of space priorities and
a robust space industrial base.
