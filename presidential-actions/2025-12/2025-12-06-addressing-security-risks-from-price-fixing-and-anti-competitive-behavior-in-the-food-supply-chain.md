title: Addressing Security Risks from Price Fixing and Anti-Competitive Behavior in
  the Food Supply Chain
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>.  An
affordable and secure food supply is vital to America’s national and
economic security.  However, anti-competitive behavior, especially when
carried out by foreign-controlled corporations, threatens the stability
and affordability of America’s food supply.  In recent years certain
companies in the American food supply chain have even settled civil
suits accusing them of price fixing for tens of millions of dollars.
 Food supply sectors including meat processing, seed, fertilizer, and
equipment have similar vulnerabilities to price fixing and other
anti-competitive practices.  My Administration will act to determine
whether anti-competitive behavior, especially by foreign-controlled
companies, increases the cost of living for Americans and address any
associated national security threat to food supply chains.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Food Supply Chain Security
Task Forces to Protect Competition</span>.  (a)  The Attorney General
and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission shall each establish a
Food Supply Chain Security Task Force within the Department of Justice
and the Federal Trade Commission, respectively, that will take all
necessary and appropriate actions to investigate food-related industries
within their established areas of expertise and determine whether
anti-competitive behavior exists in food supply chains in the United
States, as well as whether control of food-related industries by foreign
entities is increasing the cost of food products in the United States or
creating a national or economic security threat to Americans.  The
Attorney General and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission shall
take such actions as are necessary to remedy any anti-competitive
behavior that their respective investigations uncover, including
bringing enforcement actions and proposing new regulatory approaches.
 Should the Department of Justice Food Supply Chain Security Task Force
uncover any evidence of criminal collusion, the Attorney General shall
commence criminal proceedings as appropriate, including grand jury
investigations.

\(b\)  The Task Forces shall, as permitted by law, jointly brief the
Speaker of the House, the Majority Leader of the Senate, and the chairs
of congressional committees of jurisdiction with a summary of their
progress pursuant to this order once within 180 days following the date
of this order, and again within 365 days following the date of this
order, including, if relevant after consulting with the Assistant to the
President and Deputy Chief of Staff for Legislative, Political, and
Public Affairs, any recommended congressional actions.  Such briefings
shall not include any information related to ongoing investigations,
prosecutions, regulatory actions, or litigation nor any non‑public
information regarding any food-related industry investigated pursuant to
this order.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.
 (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

\(i\)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or
agency, or the head thereof; or

\(ii\)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

\(b\)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

\(c\)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

\(d\)  The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the
Department of Justice.

THE WHITE HOUSE,
