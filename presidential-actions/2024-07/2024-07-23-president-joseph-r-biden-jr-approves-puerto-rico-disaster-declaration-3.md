Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and ordered Federal aid to
supplement Commonwealth and local recovery efforts in the areas affected
by severe storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides from April 29 to
May 10, 2024.  
  
Federal funding is available to Commonwealth and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the severe storms, flooding, landslides, and
mudslides in the municipalities of Adjuntas, Guánica, Lajas, Las Marías,
Luquillo, Maricao, Naranjito, Orocovis, Sábana Grande, San Sebastián,
Toa Alta, Utuado, and Yauco.  
  
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures for the entire Commonwealth.  
  
Mr. Robert Little III of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas.   
  
Damage assessments are continuing in other areas, and more counties and
additional forms of assistance may be designated after the assessments
are fully completed.
