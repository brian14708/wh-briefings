title: "President\_Biden Names Fifty-Third Round of Judicial\_Nominees"
---
 
The President is announcing his intent to nominate three individuals to
federal district courts and two individuals to the District of Columbia
Superior Court—all of whom are extraordinarily qualified, experienced,
and devoted to the rule of law and our Constitution.  
These choices also continue to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure
that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our
greatest assets as a country—both in terms of personal and professional
backgrounds.  
  
This will be President Biden’s fifty-third round of nominees for federal
judicial positions, bringing the number of announced federal judicial
nominees to 254. The President has now announced 25 nominees to serve on
the District of Columbia Superior Court.
