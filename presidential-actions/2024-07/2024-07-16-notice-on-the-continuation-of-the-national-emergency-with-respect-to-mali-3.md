title: "Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to\_Mali"
---
 
  
     On July 26, 2019, by Executive Order 13882, the President declared
a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq*.) to deal with the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the
United States constituted by the situation in Mali.  
     The situation in Mali, including repeated violations of ceasefire
arrangements made pursuant to the 2015 Agreement on Peace and
Reconciliation in Mali; a coup d’etat resulting in the termination of
that agreement; the expansion of terrorist activities into southern and
central Mali; the intensification of drug trafficking and trafficking in
persons, human rights abuses, and hostage-taking; the presence of
foreign mercenaries threatening peace, security, and stability; and the
intensification of attacks against civilians, the Malian defense and
security forces, the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated
Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), and international security
presences, continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the
national security and foreign policy of the United States.  For this
reason, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13882 on July
26, 2019, must continue in effect beyond July 26, 2024.  Therefore, in
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 13882 with respect to the situation in
Mali.  
     This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and
transmitted to the Congress.  
   
                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.  
   
   
   
THE WHITE HOUSE,  
    July 16, 2024.
