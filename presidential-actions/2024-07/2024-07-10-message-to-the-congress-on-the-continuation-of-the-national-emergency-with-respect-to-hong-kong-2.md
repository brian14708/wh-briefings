title: "Message to the Congress on the Continuation of the National Emergency With\
  \ Respect to Hong\_Kong"

TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:

     Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to Hong Kong that
was declared in Executive Order 13936 of July 14, 2020, is to continue
in effect beyond July 14, 2024. 

     The situation with respect to Hong Kong, including recent actions
taken by the People’s Republic of China to fundamentally undermine Hong
Kong’s autonomy, continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat,
which has its source in substantial part outside the United States, to
the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United
States.  Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13936 with respect to
the situation in Hong Kong.

                              JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

    July 10, 2024.
