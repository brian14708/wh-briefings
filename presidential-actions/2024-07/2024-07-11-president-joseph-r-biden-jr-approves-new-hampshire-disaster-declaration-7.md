Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of New Hampshire and ordered Federal assistance to
supplement state and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by a
severe winter storm and flooding from April 3 to April 5, 2024.  
  
Federal funding is available to state and eligible local governments and
certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for
emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by
the severe winter storm and flooding in the counties of Belknap,
Carroll, Rockingham, and Sullivan.  
  
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.  
  
Mr. William F. Roy of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has
been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the affected
areas.   
  
Damage assessments are continuing in other areas, and additional
counties may be designated for assistance after the assessments are
fully completed.
