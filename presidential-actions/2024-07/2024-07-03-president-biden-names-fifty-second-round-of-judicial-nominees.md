title: "President\_Biden Names Fifty-Second Round of Judicial\_Nominees"
---
 
The President is announcing his intent to nominate one individual to a
federal circuit court and three individuals to federal district
courts—all of whom are extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and
devoted to the rule of law and our Constitution.

These choices also continue to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure
that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our
greatest assets as a country—both in terms of personal and professional
backgrounds.

This will be President Biden’s fifty-second round of nominees for
federal judicial positions, bringing the number of announced federal
judicial nominees to 251.
