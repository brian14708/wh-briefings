Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists for the Chickasaw Nation and ordered federal aid to supplement
the Tribal Nation’s efforts in the areas affected by severe storms from
March 14 to March 15, 2024.

Federal funding is available to the Chickasaw Nation and certain private
nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and
the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storms.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures for the Chickasaw Nation.

Mr. Maona N. Ngwira of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas. 

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
Tribal Nation and warranted by the results of further damage
assessments.
