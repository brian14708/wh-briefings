Dear Mr. Speaker:   (Dear Madam President:)

Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to the situation in
Mali declared in Executive Order 13882 of July 26, 2019, is to continue
in effect beyond July 26, 2024.

The situation in Mali, including repeated violations of ceasefire
arrangements made pursuant to the 2015 Agreement on Peace and
Reconciliation in Mali; a coup d’etat resulting in the termination of
that agreement; the expansion of terrorist activities into southern and
central Mali; the intensification of drug trafficking and trafficking in
persons, human rights abuses, and hostage-taking; the presence of
foreign mercenaries threatening peace, security, and stability; and the
intensification of attacks against civilians, the Malian defense and
security forces, the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated
Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), and international security
presences, continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the
national security and foreign policy of the United States.  Therefore, I
have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 13882 with respect to the situation in Mali.

                             Sincerely,

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
