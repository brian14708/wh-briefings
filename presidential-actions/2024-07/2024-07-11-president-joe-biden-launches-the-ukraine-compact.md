title: "President Joe\_Biden Launches the Ukraine\_Compact"
---
 
*Today, President Biden launched the Ukraine Compact at an event with 32
allies and partners as part of our commitment to Ukraine’s long term
security. This Compact fulfills the promise President Biden and these
countries made in Vilnius in 2023 to negotiate long-term bilateral
security agreements with Ukraine to support Ukraine as it defends itself
now, and to deter aggression against Ukraine in the future as part of
its bridge to NATO membership. Leveraging each of our agreements, this
historic Compact creates a unified and comprehensive security
architecture to support Ukraine today and in the future, in war and in
peace. Together, will achieve our collective goal: a Ukraine that is
free, sovereign, democratic, independent, and prosperous, and able to
defend itself and deter future aggression*  
   
We the leaders of the United States of America, Belgium, Canada,
Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Japan,
Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland,
Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, together with
the President of the European Council, the President of the European
Commission, and the President of Ukraine:  
   
Commend the security agreements and arrangements finalized with Ukraine
by 22 countries and the European Union (EU) under the framework of the
Joint Declaration of Support for Ukraine (Joint Declaration) released on
the margins of the 2023 Vilnius North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) Summit, and welcome all the remaining Joint Declaration
signatories finalizing their respective security agreements and
arrangements with Ukraine in the near future;  
   
Affirm that the security of Ukraine is integral to
the security of the Euro-Atlantic region and beyond, and that we intend
to support Ukraine until it prevails against Russia’s aggression;  
   
Emphasize our unwavering commitment to a free, independent, democratic,
and sovereign Ukraine capable of defending itself and deterring future
aggression, and reaffirm Ukraine’s sovereign right to choose its own
security arrangements as well as political, social, economic, and
cultural systems;  
   
Underscore that Russia’s illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine is a
threat to international peace and security; a flagrant violation of
international law, including the United Nations (UN) Charter; and
incompatible with our security interests; and  
   
Recognize Ukraine’s commitment to reforms strengthening democracy, the
rule of law, and respect for human rights and media freedoms, as needed
to advance its Euro-Atlantic aspirations, and emphasize our shared
values and interests, including respect for the principles of the UN
Charter such as sovereignty and territorial integrity.  
   
Today, we announce the Ukraine Compact (Compact) with a view towards
coordinating and accelerating our collective efforts to meet Ukraine’s
comprehensive security needs, as outlined in the Joint Declaration and
in the security agreements and arrangements each of the signatories
(Compact Signatories) has completed with Ukraine.  Through this Compact,
we declare our enduring intent and commitment to ensure Ukraine can
successfully defend its freedom, independence, sovereignty, and
territorial integrity today and deter acts of aggression
in the future.  To meet these vital objectives, as outlined in our
respective bilateral security agreements and arrangements and consistent
with all applicable laws and our respective legal systems, Compact
Signatories pledge to:  
   
(1)  Support Ukraine’s immediate defense and security needs, including
through the continued provision of security assistance and training,
modern military equipment, and defense industrial and necessary economic
support, working bilaterally and through existing multilateral
mechanisms, including the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) and its
Capability Coalitions, NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine
(NSATU), and the EU Military Assistance Mission in support of Ukraine
(EUMAM Ukraine);  
   
(2)  Accelerate efforts to build a Ukrainian future force that maintains
a credible defense and deterrence capability, including by convening
within 6 months at the level of Defense Ministers through the UDCG to
review and approve roadmaps prepared by the leaders of the Capability
Coalitions — each a Compact Signatory — on future force development
through 2027, in coordination with EUMAM Ukraine, with a view to
continue strengthening the force into the 2030s; and  
   
(3)  In the event of future Russian armed attack against Ukraine
following the conclusion of current hostilities, convene swiftly and
collectively at the most senior levels to determine appropriate next
steps in supporting Ukraine as it exercises its right of self-defense as
enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter, including the provision of
swift and sustained security assistance and the imposition of economic
and other costs on Russia.  
   
We intend to uphold these commitments with unwavering determination
by leveraging the multilateral security architecture that supports
Ukraine, consistent with our respective national laws and security and
defense policies.  Compact Signatories plan to take these commitments
forward while Ukraine pursues its pathway towards future membership in
the EU, NATO, and the broader Euro-Atlantic community.  Other countries
that wish to contribute to this effort to ensure a free, democratic,
independent, and sovereign Ukraine may join this Compact upon completion
of a bilateral security agreement or arrangement with Ukraine.
