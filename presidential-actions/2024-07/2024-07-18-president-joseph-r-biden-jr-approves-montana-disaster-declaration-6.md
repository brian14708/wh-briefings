Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Montana and ordered Federal assistance to
supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas
affected by a severe winter storm and flooding from May 6 to May 9,
2024.

Federal funding is available to state, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the severe winter storm and flooding in the
counties of Blaine, Chouteau, Fergus, Hill, Judith Basin, Petroleum,
Pondera, Teton, Toole, and Wheatland and the Rocky Boy’s Indian
Reservation and the Fort Belknap Indian Community.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Mr. Edwin J. Martin of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas. 

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
