Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the Commonwealth of Kentucky and ordered Federal assistance to
supplement Commonwealth and local recovery efforts in the areas affected

The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in the counties of Butler, Caldwell, Calloway, Christian,
Clay, Greenup, Hopkins, Knox, Logan, Muhlenberg, Simpson, Todd, Trigg,
Warren, and Whitley.

Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.

Federal funding is also available to Commonwealth and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes,
landslides, and mudslides in the counties of Adair, Allen, Ballard,
Barren, Breckinridge, Butler, Caldwell, Calloway, Carlisle, Christian,
Clay, Clinton, Crittenden, Cumberland, Edmonson, Estill, Fulton,

Muhlenberg, Ohio, Owsley, Pulaski, Rockcastle, Russell, Simpson, Todd,
Trigg, Warren, Washington, Wayne, Whitley, and Woodford.

Lastly, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures for the entire Commonwealth.

Mr. E. Craig Levy Sr. of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas. 

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
Commonwealth and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.

areas can begin applying for assistance at
