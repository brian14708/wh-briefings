MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE  
              THE SECRETARY OF ENERGY  
  
SUBJECT: Presidential Determination on the Proposed  
              Amendment to the 1958 Agreement Between the  
              Government of the United States of America and  
              the Government of the United Kingdom of Great  
              Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation  
              on the Uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual  
              Defense Purposes  
  
  
I have reviewed and concur with the positions taken in your joint
memorandum of April 19, 2024, recommending approval of a proposed
Amendment to the 1958 Agreement Between the Government of the United
States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation on the Uses of Atomic
Energy for Mutual Defense Purposes of July 3, 1958, as amended (the
“1958 Agreement”).  I note your joint recommendation and concur with
your assessment that the United Kingdom, by participating with the
United States pursuant to an international arrangement, is making
substantial and material contributions to our mutual defense and
security.  The proposed Amendment to the 1958 Agreement will permit
cooperation, which will further improve our mutual defense posture and
support our interests under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
I hereby:

-   approve the proposed Amendment to the 1958 Agreement;
-   determine that the performance of the proposed Amendment will
    promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common
    defense and security;
-   approve the program outlined in the proposed Amendment and determine
    that such program will promote, and will not constitute an
    unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security; and
-   authorize the execution of the proposed Amendment for the Government
    of the United States of America in a manner specified by the
    Secretary of State.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
