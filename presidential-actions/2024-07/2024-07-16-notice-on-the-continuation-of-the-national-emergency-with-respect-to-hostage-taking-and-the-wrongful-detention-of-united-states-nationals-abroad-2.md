title: "Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Hostage-Taking\
  \ and the Wrongful Detention of United\_States Nationals\_Abroad"
---
 
On July 19, 2022, by Executive Order 14078, I declared a national
emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act
(50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary
threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the
United States constituted by hostage-taking and the wrongful detention
of United States nationals abroad. 

     Hostage-taking and the wrongful detention of United States
nationals are heinous acts that undermine the rule of law.  Terrorist
organizations, criminal groups, and other malicious actors who take
hostages for financial, political, or other gain — as well as foreign
states that engage in the practice of wrongful detention, including for
political leverage or to seek concessions from the United States —
threaten the integrity of the international political system and the
safety of United States nationals and other persons abroad. 
Hostage-taking and the wrongful detention of United States nationals
abroad continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. 
For this reason, the national emergency declared in Executive Order
14078 of July 19, 2022, must continue in effect beyond July 19, 2024. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national
emergency declared in Executive Order 14078 with respect to
hostage-taking and the wrongful detention of United States nationals
abroad.

     This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and
transmitted to the Congress.

                             JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

    July 16, 2024.
