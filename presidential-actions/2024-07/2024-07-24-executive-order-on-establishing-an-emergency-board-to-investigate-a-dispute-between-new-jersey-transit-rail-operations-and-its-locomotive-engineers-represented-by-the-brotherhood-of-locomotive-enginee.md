     A dispute exists between the New Jersey Transit Rail Operations and
its Locomotive Engineers represented by the Brotherhood of Locomotive
Engineers and Trainmen.  
  
     The dispute has not heretofore been adjusted under the provisions
of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, 45 U.S.C. 151-188 (RLA).  
  
     A party empowered by the RLA has requested that the President
establish an emergency board pursuant to section 9A of the RLA (45
U.S.C. 159a).  
  
     Section 9A(c) of the RLA provides that the President, upon such
request, shall appoint an emergency board to investigate and report on
the dispute.  
  
     NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as President by the
Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 9A of
the RLA, it is hereby ordered as follows:  
  
     Section 1.  Establishment of Emergency Board (Board).  There is
established, effective 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on July 25,
2024, a Board composed of a chair and two other members, all of whom
shall be appointed by the President to investigate and report on the
dispute.  No member shall be pecuniarily or otherwise interested in any
organization of railroad employees or any carrier.  The Board shall
perform its functions subject to the availability of funds.  
  
      Sec. 2.  Report.  The Board shall report to the President with
respect to the dispute within 30 days of its creation.  
  
     Sec. 3.  Maintaining Conditions.  As provided by section 9A(c) of
the RLA, for 120 days from the date of the creation of the Board, no
change in the conditions out of which the dispute arose shall be made by
the parties to the controversy, except by agreement of the parties.  
  
     Sec. 4.  Records Maintenance.  The records and files of the Board
are records of the Office of the President and upon the Board’s
termination shall be maintained in the physical custody of the National
Mediation Board.  
  
     Sec. 5.  Expiration.  The Board shall terminate upon the submission
of the report provided for in section 2 of this order.  
  
  
  
                              JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
