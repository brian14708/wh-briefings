title: "Message to the Congress on the Continuation of the National Emergency With\
  \ Respect to Certain Terrorist\_Attacks"

TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:

     Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d),
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  Consistent with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* the enclosed notice, stating that the
emergency declared in Proclamation 7463 with respect to the terrorist
attacks on the United States of September 11, 2001, is to continue in
effect for an additional year.

     The terrorist threat that led to the declaration on September 14,
2001, of a national emergency continues.  For this reason, I have
determined that it is necessary to continue in effect after September
14, 2024, the national emergency with respect to the terrorist threat.

                              JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
September 9, 2024.
