President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Approves Connecticut Disaster Declaration

Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Connecticut and ordered Federal assistance to
supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas
affected by a severe storm, flooding, landslides, and mudslides from
August 18 to August 19, 2024.

The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in the counties of Fairfield, Litchfield, and New Haven.

Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Mr. Robert V. Fogel of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas. 

Damage assessments are continuing in other areas, and additional
counties may be designated for assistance after the assessments are
fully completed.** **

Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance at
[www.DisasterAssistance.gov](/SHARE/FORMATS/DHS%200303/Expedited%20Requests%2003.02.21/www.DisasterAssistance.gov),
by calling 800-621-FEMA (3362), or by using the [FEMA
App](https://www.ready.gov/fema-app). Anyone using a relay service, such
as video relay service (VRS), captioned telephone service or others, can
give FEMA the number for that service.
