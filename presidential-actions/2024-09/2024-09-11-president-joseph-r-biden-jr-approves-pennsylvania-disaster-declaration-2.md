title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Approves Pennsylvania Disaster\_Declaration"
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and ordered Federal
assistance to supplement commonwealth and local recovery efforts in the
areas affected by Tropical Storm Debby from August 9 to August 10,
2024.  
  
The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in the counties of Lycoming, Potter, Tioga, and Union.  
  
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.  
  
Mr. Mark K. O’Hanlon of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas.   
  
Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
commonwealth and warranted by the results of further damage
assessments.  
  
Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance at
[www.DisasterAssistance.gov](/SHARE/FORMATS/DHS%200303/Expedited%20Requests%2003.02.21/www.DisasterAssistance.gov),

as video relay service (VRS), captioned telephone service or others, can
give FEMA the number for that service.
