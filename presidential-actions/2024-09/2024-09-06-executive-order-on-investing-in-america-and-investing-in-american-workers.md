title: "Executive Order on Investing in America and Investing in American\_Workers"
---
 
     By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as
follows: 

     Section 1.  Policy.  The Federal Government has made significant
strides in implementing the Investing in America agenda, a historic set
of recently enacted laws aimed at rebuilding American infrastructure,
bringing back American manufacturing, and catalyzing a clean energy
economy.  That agenda has been furthered by Executive Order 14082 of
September 12, 2022 (Implementation of the Energy and Infrastructure
Provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022), and Executive Order
14080 of August 25, 2022 (Implementation of the CHIPS Act of 2022).  As
implementation of the Investing in America agenda continues, it is
essential that it supports the creation of well-paying jobs, especially
union jobs, that improve opportunities for millions of Americans.

     Investing in American workers is critical to growing the economy
equitably and resiliently, increasing our Nation’s competitiveness, and
ensuring our Nation’s economic security.  Workers understand the value
of a good job that provides economic security for them and their
families.  Many companies also recognize that providing good-quality
jobs while promoting workers’ free and fair choice to join a union makes
those companies employers of choice, creating a clear competitive
advantage.

     The Federal Government has long promoted high labor standards to
ensure fair competition, stability, and efficiency on federally assisted
projects.  The use of high labor standards on federally assisted
projects, such as the use of prevailing wages, project labor agreements,
and equal employment opportunity policies, dates back almost a century.
 These tools ensure timely and economical completion of projects,
provide a reliable source of highly skilled workers, support equitable
workforce development, and improve worker health and safety on the job,
while also improving outcomes for the communities in which projects are
located.  But these tools can and should be employed to a greater extent
than they have been in the past.

     For instance, providing incentives for federally assisted projects
with high labor standards — including those using collective bargaining
agreements, project labor agreements, and certain community benefits
agreements — drives efficient project completion while also supporting
high-quality jobs, worker safety, and broader investment in
communities.  Ensuring that workers on federally assisted projects are
paid competitive and equitable wages will enhance worker productivity,
generate higher-quality work, and reduce turnover, providing value for
taxpayers.  Promoting inclusivity, with equal opportunity for all
qualified workers, will help ensure that federally assisted projects
have the workforce needed to implement the Investing in America agenda.

     Therefore, it is the policy of my Administration to promote the
creation of equitable workforce development pathways for workers to
obtain good jobs that pay family-sustaining wages, provide critical
benefits, prevent workplace discrimination, ensure worker safety, and
allow workers a free and fair chance to join a union.

     Sec. 2.  Definitions.  For purposes of this order:

     (a)  The term “implementing agencies” means the Department of the

return for community support of the project.  
     (c)  The term “Federal financial assistance” means funds obtained
from the Federal Government or borrowed on the credit of the Federal

     Sec. 3.  Implementation Priorities.  In selecting projects for
receiving Federal financial assistance from the Investing in America
agenda, implementing agencies shall consider actions that, as
appropriate and consistent with applicable law:

     (a)  Prioritize projects for selection that provide a clear plan
for efficient project delivery by promoting positive labor-management
relations.  Examples of instruments and policies that implementing
agencies could consider encouraging applicants to adopt, as appropriate,
may include:  project labor agreements, community benefits agreements,
collective bargaining agreements, agreements intended to ensure the
uninterrupted delivery of services, agreements designed to facilitate
first collective bargaining agreements, voluntary union recognition, and
neutrality by the employer with respect to union organizing.  
     (b)  Prioritize projects that enhance worker productivity by
promoting family-sustaining wages.  Examples of policies that
implementing agencies could consider encouraging applicants to adopt, as
appropriate, may include:  payment of wages tied to a particular metric
— such as wages not less than prevailing wages, the upper quartile of
industry pay, or union pattern wage scales — including for workers in
the care workforce, that is, individuals working in the fields of child
care and long-term care; policies to promote equal pay and eliminate
discriminatory pay practices, such as transparency measures; and other
policies aligned with the Good Jobs Principles established by the
Department of Commerce and the Department of Labor on June 21, 2022.  
     (c)  Prioritize projects that supply critical benefits that promote
economic security for workers, such as paid leave (including paid sick,
family, and medical leave); health care; retirement benefits; and child,
dependent, and elder care.   
     (d)  Prioritize projects that promote and expand access to, and put
in place policies that combat discrimination that limits employment in,
high-quality jobs for workers from underserved communities.  Examples of
policies that implementing agencies could consider encouraging
applicants to adopt, as appropriate, may include:  workforce plans that
contain strategies for recruiting, hiring, and retaining workers from
underserved and local communities; policies that help prevent workplace
discrimination and harassment, including through reporting structures
and ongoing training; and participation in programs designed to support
compliance with existing equal employment opportunity obligations under
Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965 (Equal Employment
Opportunity), as amended, section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973
*(Public Law 93-112), *the Vietnam Era Veterans’ Readjustment Assistance
Act of 1972 (Public Law 92–540), as amended, and their implementing
regulations.  
     (e)  Prioritize projects that strengthen workforce development by
expanding worker access to high-quality training and portable
credentials that lead to good jobs.  Examples of policies that
implementing agencies could consider encouraging applicants to adopt, as
appropriate, may include:  the use of joint labor-management
partnerships that invest in union-affiliated training programs,
registered apprenticeships, and pre-apprenticeship programs that
matriculate to registered apprenticeships; partnerships with
organizations that deliver training such as community colleges, career
and technical education programs, disability service organizations, the
public workforce system, and the American Climate Corps; and the
provision of supportive services necessary to complete training such as
child care and transportation assistance.  
     (f)  Prioritize projects that promote and protect worker health and
safety through policies that encourage supplemental safety training,
worker and union participation in the design and implementation of
workplace safety and health management systems, and disclosure of
occupational safety and health violations.  
  
      Sec. 4.  Implementation Approach.  (a)  Implementing agencies
shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, consider the
following strategies in connection with their Federal financial
assistance programs to promote the implementation priorities identified
in section 3 of this order:

          (i)    including application evaluation criteria or selection
factors that prioritize applicants that adopt or provide a specific plan
to adopt those priorities;  
          (ii)   publishing best practice guides and other guidance to
applicants to promote and implement those priorities, including guides
on what types of Federal financial assistance can be used for workforce
development, such as supportive services;  
          (iii)  engaging with applicants, where appropriate, during
pre-award processes to ensure that applicants understand the benefits of
those priorities for key programs and projects;  
          (iv)   collecting relevant data to demonstrate funding
recipients’ progress, including by:  
(A)  requesting in funding notices or through other appropriate
mechanisms that applicants address a series of “yes” or “no” questions
regarding the implementation of those priorities to ensure transparency
of labor practices and commitments;  
(B)  using existing compliance practices (such as the collection of
certified payrolls when applicable) to collect detailed data on job
quality, equity, and worker empowerment; and  
(C)  requesting reporting on key metrics and encouraging voluntary
public reporting of additional relevant metrics developed by the
implementing agency;  
          (v)    promoting compliance with Federal law and commitments
made by applicants, including, as appropriate, referring alleged
violations of law to other executive departments and agencies for a
determination of whether circumstances warrant the issuance of financial
penalties or collection of relief for workers harmed, withholding
further Federal financial assistance pending correction of a deficiency,
recovery of some or all Federal funds, or debarment; and  
          (vi)   supporting program staff and developing implementing
agency expertise, including by consulting the Department of Labor and
implementing agency labor advisors, to train program staff on how to
implement those priorities and ensure that staff have the expertise
needed to support the creation of good jobs through each phase of
project delivery on federally assisted projects.  
     (b)  Implementing agencies shall carry out their responsibilities
under this order consistent with their responsibilities under the
Justice40 Initiative set forth in Executive Order 14008 of January 27,
2021 (Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad).
