Dear Mr. Speaker:   (Dear Madam President:)

Pursuant to section 233(e)(1) of the Social Security Act, as amended by
the Social Security Amendments of 1977 (Public Law 95-216, 42 U.S.C.
433(e)(1)), I transmit herewith a social security totalization agreement
with Romania, titled “Agreement on Social Security between the United
States of America and Romania,” and the accompanying legally binding
administrative arrangement, titled “Administrative Arrangement between
the Competent Authorities of the United States of America and Romania
for the Implementation of the Agreement on Social Security between the
United States of America and Romania” (collectively the “Agreements”).
 The Agreements were signed at Bucharest on March 23, 2023.

The Agreements are similar in objective and content to the social
security totalization agreements already in force with 30 countries.
 Such bilateral agreements provide for limited coordination between the
United States and foreign social security systems to eliminate dual
social security coverage and taxation and to help prevent the lost
benefit protection that can occur when workers divide their careers
between two countries.

The Agreements contain all provisions mandated by section 233 of the
Social Security Act and, pursuant to section 233(c)(4), other provisions
which I deem appropriate to carry out the purposes of section 233.

I also transmit for the information of the Congress a report required by
section 233(e)(1) of the Social Security Act and prepared by the Social
Security Administration on the estimated number of individuals who will
be affected by the Agreements and the Agreements’ estimated cost effect.
 Also included are a summary of the main provisions and an annotated
version of the Agreements with descriptions of each article.  The
Department of State and the Social Security Administration have
recommended the Agreements to me.

I commend to the Congress the Agreement on Social Security between the
United States of America and Romania and the Administrative Arrangement
between the Competent Authorities of the United States of America and
Romania for the Implementation of the Agreement on Social Security
between the United States of America and Romania.

                              Sincerely,

                              JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
