Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of New York and ordered Federal assistance to
supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas
affected by the remnants of Tropical Storm Debby from August 8 to August
10, 2024.

Federal funding is available to state, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of
facilities damaged by the remnants of Tropical Storm Debby in the
counties of Allegany, Broome, Delaware, Essex, Franklin, Jefferson,
Ontario, Steuben, St. Lawrence, and Yates.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Ms. Lai Sun Yee of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has
been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the affected
areas. 

Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the
state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
