Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of North Carolina and ordered Federal aid to
supplement State, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas

continuing.

The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in Alexander, Alleghany, Ashe, Avery, Buncombe, Burke,
Caldwell, Catawba, Clay, Cleveland, Gaston, Haywood, Henderson, Jackson,
Lincoln, Macon, Madison, McDowell, Mitchell, Polk, Rutherford,
Transylvania, Watauga, Wilkes, and Yancey Counties and the Eastern Band
of Cherokee Indians.

Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.

Federal funding also is available to State, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work in Alexander, Alleghany, Ashe,

affected areas. 

Damage assessments are continuing in other areas, and more counties and
additional forms of assistance may be designated after the assessments
are fully completed.
