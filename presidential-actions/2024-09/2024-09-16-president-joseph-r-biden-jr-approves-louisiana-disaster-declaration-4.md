title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Approves Louisiana Disaster\_Declaration"
---
 
Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster
exists in the State of Louisiana and ordered Federal aid to supplement
State, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by
Hurricane Francine from September 9 to September 12, 2024.

The President’s action makes Federal funding available to affected
individuals in the parishes of Ascension, Assumption, Lafourche, St.
Charles, St. James, St. John the Baptist, St. Mary, and Terrebonne.

Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs,
low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to
help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the
disaster.

Federal funding also is available to State, tribal, and eligible local
governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a
cost-sharing basis for emergency work in the parishes of Ascension,
Assumption, Lafourche, St. Charles, St. James, St. John the Baptist, St.
Mary, and Terrebonne.

Finally, Federal funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.

Ms. Sandra L. Eslinger of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
has been appointed to coordinate Federal recovery operations in the
affected areas. 

Damage assessments are continuing in other areas, and more parishes and
additional forms of assistance may be designated after the assessments
are fully completed.

Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated
areas can begin applying for assistance at
[www.DisasterAssistance.gov](//fema.net/hqss/rrshare/SHARE/AGREES/Florida/2024/4806%20Debby/www.DisasterAssistance.gov),
or by calling 800-621-FEMA (3362), or by using the [FEMA
App](https://www.ready.gov/fema-app). Anyone using a relay service, such
as video relay service (VRS), captioned telephone service or others, can
give FEMA the number for that service.
