TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:

Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal* *Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal* *Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to the threat of
foreign interference in or undermining public confidence in
United States elections declared in Executive Order 13848 of September
12, 2018, is to continue in effect beyond September 12, 2024.

Although there has been no evidence of a foreign power altering the
outcomes or vote tabulation in any United States election, foreign
powers have historically sought to exploit America’s free and open
political system.  In recent years, the proliferation of digital devices
and internet-based communications has created significant
vulnerabilities and magnified the scope and intensity of the threat of
foreign interference.  The ability of persons located, in whole or in
substantial part, outside the United States to interfere in or undermine
public confidence in United States elections, including through the
unauthorized accessing of election and campaign infrastructure or the
covert distribution of propaganda and disinformation, continues to pose
an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign
policy of the United States.  Therefore, I have determined that it is
necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order
13848 with respect to the threat of foreign interference in or
undermining public confidence in United States elections.

                              JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
September 9, 2024.
