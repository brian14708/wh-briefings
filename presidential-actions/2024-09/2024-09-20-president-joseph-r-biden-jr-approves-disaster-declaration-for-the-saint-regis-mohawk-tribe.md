storm and flooding from August 8 to August 10, 2024.

Federal funding is available to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe and certain
private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency
work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe
storm and flooding.

mitigation measures for the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe.
