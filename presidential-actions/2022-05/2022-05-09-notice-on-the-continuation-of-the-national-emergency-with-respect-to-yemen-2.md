title: "Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to\_Yemen"
---
 
On May 16, 2012, by Executive Order 13611, the President declared a
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq*.) to deal with the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the
United States constituted by the actions and policies of certain members
of the Government of Yemen and others that threatened Yemen’s peace,
security, and stability.  These actions include obstructing the
political process in Yemen and blocking the implementation of the
agreement of November 23, 2011, between the Government of Yemen and
those in opposition to it, which provide for a peaceful transition of
power that meets the legitimate demands and aspirations of the Yemeni
people.

The actions and policies of certain former members of the Government of
Yemen and others in threatening Yemen’s peace, security, and stability
continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national
security and foreign policy of the United States.  For this reason, the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13611 on May 16, 2012, to
deal with that threat must continue in effect beyond May 16, 2022.
 Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13611 with respect to
Yemen.

This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and transmitted
to the Congress.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
    May 9, 2022.
