Today, we mark a tragic milestone:  one million American lives lost to
COVID-19.  One million empty chairs around the dinner table.  Each an
irreplaceable loss.  Each leaving behind a family, a community, and a
Nation forever changed because of this pandemic.  Jill and I pray for
each of them.

As a Nation, we must not grow numb to such sorrow.  To heal, we must
remember.  We must remain vigilant against this pandemic and do
everything we can to save as many lives as possible.  In remembrance,
let us draw strength from each other as fellow Americans.  For while we
have been humbled, we never give up.  We can and will do this together
as the United States of America.

In memory of the one million American lives lost to COVID-19 and their
loved ones left behind, I hereby order, by the authority vested in me by
the Constitution and laws of the United States, that the flag of the
United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and on all
public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations,
and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of
Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and
possessions until sunset May 16, 2022.  I also direct that the flag
shall be flown at half-staff for the same period at all United States
embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad,
including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of May,
in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence
of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
