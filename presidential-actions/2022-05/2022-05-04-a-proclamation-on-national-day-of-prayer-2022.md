Throughout our history, prayer has been an anchor for countless
Americans searching for strength and wisdom in times of struggle and
sharing hope and gratitude in seasons of joy.  In public reflections on
life’s many blessings and in quiet moments during life’s most difficult
trials, Americans of nearly every background and faith have turned to
prayer for comfort and inspiration.  Prayer is a sacred right protected
by free speech and religious liberty enshrined in our Constitution, and
it continues to lift our spirits as we navigate the challenges of our
time.  
  
On this day, we recognize the healing power of prayer, especially as we
recover from the trauma and loss of the COVID‑19 pandemic.  Today we
find ourselves in a moment of renewal — of lives saved, of new jobs
created, and of new hope for rebuilding America.  Today is also a moment
of reflection when we are called to address some of the greatest
challenges humanity has ever faced — saving our planet from the
existential threat of climate change; responding to attacks on democracy
at home and abroad; and living up to our Nation’s promise of liberty,
justice, and equality for all.  
  
As the late President Dwight D. Eisenhower once said, “There is a need
we all have in these days and times for some help which comes from
outside ourselves.”  Across our diverse and cherished beliefs, on this
National Day of Prayer, no matter how or whether we pray, we are all
called to look outside ourselves.  Let us find in our hearts and prayers
the determination to put aside our differences, come together, and truly
see one another as fellow Americans.  
  
The Congress, by Public Law 100-307, as amended, has called on the
President to issue each year a proclamation designating the first
Thursday in May as a “National Day of Prayer.”  
  
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States
of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 5, 2022, as a
National Day of Prayer.  I call upon the citizens of our Nation to give
thanks, in accordance with their own faiths and consciences, for our
many freedoms and blessings, and I invite all people of faith to join me
in asking for God’s continued guidance, mercy, and protection.  
  
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of May,
in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence
of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.  
 

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
