title: "A Proclamation: Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United\_States\_(Ukraine)"
---
 
1.  On January 11, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary)
transmitted to the President a report on the Secretary’s investigation
into the effect of imports of steel mill articles (steel articles) on
the national security of the United States under section 232 of the
Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862).  The Secretary
found and advised the President of his opinion that steel articles are
being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such
circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the
United States.

2.  In Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel
Into the United States), the President concurred in the Secretary’s
finding that steel articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation
9705, as amended by clause 8 of Proclamation 9711 of March 22, 2018
(Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), are being imported
into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances
as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and
decided to adjust the imports of those steel articles by imposing a 25
percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from all countries
except Canada and Mexico.  The proclamation further stated that any
country with which we have a security relationship is welcome to discuss
with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened
impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country,
and noted that, should the United States and any such country arrive at
a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national
security such that the President determines that imports from that
country no longer threaten to impair the national security, the
President may remove or modify the restriction on steel articles imports
from that country and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as it applies to
other countries, as the national security interests of the United States
require.

3.  The United States and Ukraine have developed a close security
relationship.  Ukraine has expressed its willingness to work with the
United States to address the global excess capacity for producing steel.
 Ukraine’s steel industry has been significantly disrupted by the
Russian Federation’s unjustified, unprovoked, unyielding, and
unconscionable war against Ukraine.  The significant disruption in
Ukraine’s steel production is expected to decrease the total amount of
steel produced by Ukraine as well as the amount of steel imported into
the United States from Ukraine, which in 2021 accounted for less than 1
percent of all steel imports into the United States.  At the same time,
the steel industry has been historically important to Ukraine, and both
the United States and Ukraine have an interest in maintaining that
industry as an economic lifeline while the country recovers.

4.  The United States and Ukraine have recently engaged in broad
security discussions.  The current disruption of Ukrainian steel
production has been part of those discussions, and the ongoing
discussion is anticipated to include alternative measures to prevent
imports of steel from Ukraine from threatening the national security of
the United States as Ukraine’s steel production recovers from the
significant disruption caused by the war.

5.  In light of the ongoing security discussions and significant
disruption of Ukraine’s ability to produce steel, I conclude that
Ukraine’s present situation presents a special case.  I have determined
to suspend the tariffs set forth in Proclamation 9705 for the import of
steel articles and derivative steel articles from Ukraine for 1 year. 
The Secretary shall monitor the situation in the domestic steel industry
and developments in Ukraine’s steel industry and inform me of any need
to terminate or extend this suspension.

6.  In light of my determination to adjust the tariff proclaimed in
Proclamation 9705 as applied to eligible steel articles and derivative
steel articles that are the product of Ukraine, I have considered
whether it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national
security interests to make any corresponding adjustments to such tariff
as it applies to products of other countries.  I have determined that it
is necessary and appropriate, at this time, to maintain the current
tariff level as it applies to products of other countries.

7.  Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended,
authorizes the President to take action to adjust the imports of an
article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United
States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to
impair the national security.

8.  Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483),
authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of
the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import
treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification,
continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import
restriction.

Now, Therefore, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States
of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade
Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States

proclaim as follows:
