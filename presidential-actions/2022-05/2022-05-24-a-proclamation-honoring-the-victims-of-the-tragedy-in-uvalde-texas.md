title: "A Proclamation Honoring The Victims Of The Tragedy In Uvalde,\_Texas"
---
 
As a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence
perpetrated on May 24, 2022, by a gunman at Robb Elementary School
in Uvalde, Texas, by the authority vested in me as President of the
United States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of
America, I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be
flown at half-staff at the White House and upon all public buildings and
grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval
vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and
throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until
sunset, May 28, 2022.  I also direct that the flag shall be flown
at half-staff for the same length of time at all United States
embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad,
including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day
of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-sixth.

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
