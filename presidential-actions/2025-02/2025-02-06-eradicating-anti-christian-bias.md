title: Eradicating Anti-Christian Bias
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  
  
     Section 1.  Purpose and Policy.  It is the policy of the United
States, and the purpose of this order, to protect the religious freedoms
of Americans and end the anti-Christian weaponization of government. 
The Founders established a Nation in which people were free to practice
their faith without fear of discrimination or retaliation by their
government.   
  
     For that reason, the United States Constitution enshrines the
fundamental right to religious liberty in the First Amendment.  Federal
laws like the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, as amended (42
U.S.C. 2000bb *et seq.*), further prohibit government interference with
Americans’ rights to exercise their religion.  Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2000e *et seq.*), prohibits
religious discrimination in employment while Federal hate-crime laws
prohibit offenses committed due to religious animus.  
  
     Yet the previous Administration engaged in an egregious pattern of
targeting peaceful Christians, while ignoring violent, anti-Christian
offenses.  The Biden Department of Justice sought to squelch faith in
the public square by bringing Federal criminal charges and obtaining in
numerous cases multi-year prison sentences against nearly two dozen
peaceful pro-life Christians for praying and demonstrating outside
abortion facilities.  Those convicted included a Catholic priest and
75-year-old grandmother, as well as an 87-year-old woman and a father of
11 children who were arrested 18 months after praying and singing hymns
outside an abortion facility in Tennessee as a part of a politically
motivated prosecution campaign by the Biden Administration.  I rectified
this injustice on January 23, 2025, by issuing pardons in these
cases.   
   
     At the same time, Catholic churches, charities, and pro-life
centers sought justice for violence, theft, and arson perpetrated
against them, which the Biden Department of Justice largely ignored.
 After more than 100 attacks, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a
resolution condemning this violence and calling on the Biden
Administration to enforce the law.  
   
     Then, in 2023, a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) memorandum
asserted that “radical-traditionalist” Catholics were domestic-terrorism
threats and suggested infiltrating Catholic churches as “threat
mitigation.”  This later-retracted FBI memorandum cited as support
evidence propaganda from highly partisan sources.  
     
     The Biden Department of Education sought to repeal
religious-liberty protections for faith-based organizations on college
campuses.  The Biden Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sought to
force Christians to affirm radical transgender ideology against their
faith.  And the Biden Department of Health and Human Services sought to
drive Christians who do not conform to certain beliefs on sexual
orientation and gender identity out of the foster-care system.  The
Biden Administration declared March 31, 2024 — Easter Sunday — as
“Transgender Day of Visibility.”  
     
      In this atmosphere of anti-Christian government, hostility and
vandalism against Christian churches and places of worship surged, with
the number of such identified acts in 2023 exceeding by more than eight
times the number from 2018.  Catholic churches and institutions have
been aggressively targeted with hundreds of acts of hostility, violence,
and vandalism.  
       
     My Administration will not tolerate anti-Christian weaponization of
government or unlawful conduct targeting Christians.  The law protects
the freedom of Americans and groups of Americans to practice their faith
in peace, and my Administration will enforce the law and protect these
freedoms.  My Administration will ensure that any unlawful and improper
conduct, policies, or practices that target Christians are identified,
terminated, and rectified.  
  
     Sec. 2.  Establishing a Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian
Bias.  (a)  There is hereby established within the Department of Justice
the Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias (Task Force).
