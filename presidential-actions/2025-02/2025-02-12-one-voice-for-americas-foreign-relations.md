By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>*.*  Article II
of the United States Constitution vests the power to conduct foreign
policy in the President of the United States.  Presidents rely on their
Secretaries of State and their subordinate officials to ensure that the
United States is served and protected at home and abroad.  As the
principal steward of the President’s foreign policy, the Secretary must
maintain an exceptional workforce of patriots to implement this policy
effectively.  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>. All officers or
employees charged with implementing the foreign policy of the United
States must under Article II do so under the direction and authority of
the President. Failure to faithfully implement the President’s policy is
grounds for professional discipline, including separation.  The
personnel procedures of executive departments and agencies (agencies)
charged with implementing the President’s foreign policy must therefore
provide an effective and efficient means for ensuring that officers and
employees faithfully implement the President’s policies.  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Definitions</span>.  For the
purposes of this order:  
(a)  the terms “Department,” “Foreign Service,” “Service,” and
“Secretary” shall have the meaning given those terms by section 3902 of
title 22, United States Code; and  
(b)  the term “members of the Foreign Service” shall have the same
meaning as “members of the Service” under section 3903 of title 22,
United States Code.  
(c)  the term “Civil Service employee” shall mean an employee of the
Department holding United States citizenship, except for a member of the
Foreign Service, as defined in section 2664a of title 22, United States
Code.  
(d)  the term “other staff” shall mean locally employed staff and agents
under the authority of sections 202(a)(4)(A) (22 U.S.C. 3922(a)(4)(A))
and 303 (22 U.S.C. 3943) of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, or special
Government employees of the Department as defined in section 202(a) of
title 18, United States Code.  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Election of Procedures</span>.
 When the Secretary concludes that a member of the Foreign Service, a
Civil Service employee, or other staff has demonstrated performance or
conduct that warrants a personnel action, the Secretary shall, with
respect to officials appointed by the Secretary or others within the
Department, take appropriate action, subject to the supervision of the
President, and shall, with respect to officials appointed by the
President, preliminarily determine whether to refer such a matter for
the President’s consideration.  Such preliminary determination shall be
made in the Secretary’s sole and exclusive discretion.  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Service Reform</span>. 
(a)  The Secretary shall, consistent with applicable law, reform the
Foreign Service and the administration of foreign relations to ensure
faithful and effective implementation of the President’s foreign policy
agenda.  
(b)  The Secretary shall, consistent with applicable law, implement
reforms in recruiting, performance, evaluation, and retention standards,
and the programs of the Foreign Service Institute, to ensure a workforce
that is committed to faithful implementation of the President’s foreign
policy.  
(c)  In implementing the reforms identified in this section, the
Secretary shall, consistent with applicable law, revise or replace the
Foreign Affairs Manual and direct subordinate agencies to remove, amend,
or replace any handbooks, procedures, or guidance.  
(d)  The Secretary shall have sole and exclusive discretion in the
exercise or delegation of the responsibilities enumerated in this order,
and, as the Secretary deems necessary or appropriate, may prescribe
additional procedures that subordinate officials shall follow in the
performance of such responsibilities.  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>. 
(a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:  
(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or  
(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.  
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
