SUBJECT: Imposing Maximum Pressure on the Government of  
       the Islamic Republic of Iran, Denying Iran All  
       Paths to a Nuclear Weapon, and Countering Iran’s  
       Malign Influence  
  
  
As President, my highest priority is to ensure the safety and security
of the United States and the American people.  Since its inception in
1979 as a revolutionary theocracy, the Government of the Islamic
Republic of Iran has declared its hostility to the United States and its
allies and partners.  Iran remains the world’s leading state sponsor of
terror and has aided Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, the Taliban,
al-Qa’ida, and other terrorist networks.  The Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps (IRGC) is itself a designated Foreign Terrorist
Organization.  
  
The Iranian Government, including the IRGC, is using agents and
cyber-enabled means to target United States nationals living in the
United States and other countries around the world for attacks,
including assault, kidnapping, and murder.  Iran has also directed its
proxy groups, including Hezbollah’s Islamic Jihad Organization, to embed
sleeper cells in the Homeland to be activated in support of this
terrorist activity.     
  
Iran bears responsibility for the horrific Hamas massacres committed on
October 7, 2023, and bears responsibility for continued Houthi attacks
against the United States Navy, allied navies, and international
commercial shipping in the Red Sea.  Since April 2024, the regime has
twice demonstrated its willingness to launch ballistic and cruise
missile attacks against the State of Israel.   
  
Iran commits grievous human rights abuses and arbitrarily detains
foreigners, including United States citizens, on spurious charges
without due process of law, subjecting them to abuse.  The United States
stands with the women of Iran who face daily abuse by the regime.   
  
Iran’s nuclear program, including its enrichment- and
reprocessing-related capabilities and nuclear-capable missiles, poses an
existential danger to the United States and the entire civilized world. 
A radical regime like this can never be allowed to acquire or develop
nuclear weapons, or to extort the United States or its allies through
the threat of nuclear weapons acquisition, development, or use.  Iran
today stands in breach of its Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
obligations by concealing undeclared nuclear sites and material as
required by its Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement with the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  Iran has obstructed IAEA
access to its military sites or sites tied to the Organization of
Defensive Innovation and Research, also known as SPND, and to interview
nuclear weapons scientists still employed by SPND.  Public reports
indicating that Iran may now be engaged in computer modeling related to
nuclear weapons development raise immediate alarm.  We must deny Iran
all paths to a nuclear weapon and end the regime’s nuclear extortion
racket.   
  
Iran’s behavior threatens the national interest of the United States. 
It is therefore in the national interest to impose maximum pressure on
the Iranian regime to end its nuclear threat, curtail its ballistic
missile program, and stop its support for terrorist groups.   
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 1.  Policy. </span> It
is the policy of the United States that Iran be denied a nuclear weapon
and intercontinental ballistic missiles; that Iran’s network and
campaign of regional aggression be neutralized; that the IRGC and its
surrogates be disrupted, degraded, or denied access to the resources
that sustain their destabilizing activities; and to counter Iran’s
aggressive development of missiles and other asymmetric and conventional
weapons capabilities.   
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 2.  Enacting Maximum
Pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran*. *</span> (a)  The Secretary
of the Treasury shall:  
  
              (i)    immediately impose sanctions or appropriate
enforcement remedies on all persons for which the Department has
evidence of activity in violation of one or more Iran-related
sanctions;  
  
              (ii)   implement a robust and continual sanctions
enforcement campaign with respect to Iran that denies the regime and its
terror proxies access to revenue;  
  
              (iii)  review for modification or rescission any general
license, frequently asked question, or other guidance that provides Iran
or any of its terror proxies any degree of economic or financial relief;

              (iv)   issue updated guidance to all relevant business
sectors including shipping, insurance, and port operators, about the
risks to any person that knowingly violates United States sanctions with
respect to Iran or an Iranian terror proxy; and  
  
              (v)    maintain countermeasures against Iran at the
Financial Action Task Force, evaluate beneficial ownership thresholds to
ensure sanctions deny Iran all possible illicit revenue, and evaluate
whether financial institutions should adopt a “Know Your Customer’s
Customer” standard for Iran-related transactions to further prevent
sanctions evasion. 

\(b\)  The Secretary of State shall:  
  
              (i)    modify or rescind sanctions waivers, particularly
those that provide Iran any degree of economic or financial relief,
including those related to Iran’s Chabahar port project;  
  
              (ii)   implement a robust and continual campaign, in
coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury and other relevant
executive departments or agencies (agencies), to drive Iran’s export of
oil to zero, including exports of Iranian crude to the People’s Republic
of China;  
  
              (iii)  lead a diplomatic campaign to isolate Iran
throughout the world, including within international organizations,
including the denial of freedom of movement or safe haven to the IRGC or
any terror proxy of Iran wherever such may operate outside Iran’s
borders; and  
  
              (iv)   take immediate steps, in coordination with the
Secretary of the Treasury and other relevant agencies, to ensure that
the Iraqi financial system is not utilized by Iran for sanctions evasion
or circumvention, and that Gulf countries are not used as sanctions
evasion transshipment points.   
  
(c)  The United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations
shall:  
  
              (i)    work with key allies to complete the snapback of
international sanctions and restrictions on Iran;  
  
              (ii)   hold Iran accountable for its breach of the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty; and  
  
              (iii)  regularly convene the United Nations Security
Council to highlight the myriad threats posed by Iran to international
peace and security.   
  
(d)  The Secretary of Commerce shall conduct a robust and continuous
export control enforcement campaign to restrict the flow of technology
and components used by the regime for military purposes.   

\(e\)  The Attorney General shall:  
  
              (i)    pursue all available legal steps to investigate,
disrupt, and prosecute financial and logistical networks, operatives, or
front groups inside the United States that are sponsored by Iran or an
Iranian terror proxy;  
  
              (ii)   pursue all available legal steps to impound illicit
Iranian oil cargoes;  
  
              (iii)  pursue all available legal steps to identify
Iranian governmental assets in the United States and overseas, and help
American victims of terrorism, including Gold Star Families, collect on
Federal judgments against Iran;  
  
              (iv)   pursue all available legal steps to indict and
prosecute the leaders and members of Iranian-funded terrorist groups and
proxies that have captured, harmed, or killed American citizens and,
where possible and in coordination with the Secretary of State, seek
their arrest and extradition to the United States; and     
  
              (v)    use all criminal, regulatory, and cyber authorities
and tools to vigorously investigate, prosecute, and disrupt efforts by
the Iranian government to conduct espionage or obtain military,
intelligence, government, or other sensitive information, compromise the
Homeland and our critical infrastructure, evade sanctions and export
controls, obtain material support for terrorism, exert foreign malign
influence, and threaten harm and infringe on First Amendment-protected
speech, including efforts designed to sow anti-Semitism.  
  
  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 3.  General Provisions.
</span> (a)  Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or
otherwise affect:  
  
              (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive
department or agency, or the head thereof; or  
  
              (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.     
  
     (b)  This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with
applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.     
  
     (c)  This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in
equity by any party against the United States, its departments,
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other
person.
