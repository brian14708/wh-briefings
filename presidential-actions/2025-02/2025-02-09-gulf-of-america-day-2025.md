title: Gulf of America Day, 2025

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  
   
A PROCLAMATION  
     

Today, I am very honored to recognize February 9, 2025, as the first
ever Gulf of America Day.  
  
     On January 20, 2025, I signed Executive Order 14172 (“Restoring
Names That Honor American Greatness”).  Among other actions, that
Executive Order required the Secretary of the Interior, acting pursuant
to 43 U.S.C. 364 through 364f, to “take all appropriate actions to
rename as the ‘Gulf of America’ the U.S. Continental Shelf area bounded
on the northeast, north, and northwest by the State of Texas, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama and Florida and extending to the seaward boundary
with Mexico and Cuba in the area formerly named as the Gulf of
Mexico.”  
  
     I took this action in part because, as stated in that Order,
“\[t\]he area formerly known as the Gulf of Mexico has long been an
integral asset to our once burgeoning Nation and has remained an
indelible part of America.”  
  
     Today, I am making my first visit to the Gulf of America since its
renaming.  As my Administration restores American pride in the history
of American greatness, it is fitting and appropriate for our great
Nation to come together and commemorate this momentous occasion and the
renaming of the Gulf of America.  
  
     NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States
of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 9, 2025,
as Gulf of America Day.  I call upon public officials and all the people
of the United States to observe this day with appropriate programs,
ceremonies, and activities.  
  
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of
February, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and
forty-ninth.
