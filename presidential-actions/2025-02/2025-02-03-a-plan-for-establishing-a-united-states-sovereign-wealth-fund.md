---
 
     By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States of America, and in order to promote the
long-term financial health and international leadership of the United
States, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 1.  Policy and
Purpose.</span>  It is the policy of the United States to maximize the
stewardship of our national wealth for the sole benefit of American
citizens.  To this end, it is in the interest of the American people
that the Federal Government establish a sovereign wealth fund to promote
fiscal sustainability, lessen the burden of taxes on American families
and small businesses, establish economic security for future
generations, and promote United States economic and strategic leadership
internationally. 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 2.  Sovereign Wealth
Fund.</span>  The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of
Commerce, in close coordination with the Assistant to the President for
Economic Policy, shall develop a plan for the establishment of a
sovereign wealth fund consistent with section 1 of this order.  The
Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Commerce shall jointly
submit this plan to the President within 90 days of the date of this
order.  Such plan shall include recommendations for funding mechanisms,
investment strategies, fund structure, and a governance model.  The plan
shall also include an evaluation of the legal considerations for
establishing and managing such a fund, including any need for
legislation. 

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 3.  General
Provisions.</span>  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to
impair or otherwise affect:  
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or  
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.  
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
