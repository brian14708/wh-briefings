MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY

     THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE

     THE UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE

     THE SENIOR COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT FOR TRADE

     AND MANUFACTURING

SUBJECT:       Defending American Companies and Innovators From  
               Overseas Extortion and Unfair Fines and Penalties  
   
   
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>. 
In recent years, the gross domestic product of the United States’
digital economy alone, driven by cutting-edge American technology
companies, has been bigger than the entire economy of Australia, Canada,
or most members of the European Union.  Instead of empowering their own
workers and economies, foreign governments have increasingly exerted
extraterritorial authority over American companies, particularly in the
technology sector, hindering these companies’ success and appropriating
revenues that should contribute to our Nation’s well-being, not theirs.
   
   
     Beginning in 2019, several trading partners enacted digital
services taxes (DSTs) that could cost American companies billions of
dollars and that foreign government officials openly admit are designed
to plunder American companies.  Foreign countries have additionally
adopted regulations governing digital services that are more burdensome
and restrictive on United States companies than their own domestic
companies.  Additional foreign legal regimes limit cross-border data
flows, require American streaming services to fund local productions,
and charge network usage and Internet termination fees.  All of these
measures violate American sovereignty and offshore American jobs, limit
American companies’ global competitiveness, and increase American
operational costs while exposing our sensitive information to
potentially hostile foreign regulators.  
   
     My Administration will not allow American companies and workers and
American economic and national security interests to be compromised by
one-sided, anti-competitive policies and practices of foreign
governments.  American businesses will no longer prop up failed foreign
economies through extortive fines and taxes.  
   
   
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>. 
It is the policy of my Administration that where a foreign government,
through its tax or regulatory structure, imposes a fine, penalty, tax,
or other burden that is discriminatory, disproportionate, or designed to
transfer significant funds or intellectual property from American
companies to the foreign government or the foreign government’s favored
domestic entities, my Administration will act, imposing tariffs and
taking such other responsive actions necessary to mitigate the harm to
the United States and to repair any resulting imbalance.  
   
     In taking such responsive action, my Administration shall
consider:  
   
     (a)  taxes imposed on United States companies by foreign
governments, including those that may discriminate against United States
companies;  
   
     (b)  regulations imposed on United States companies by foreign
governments that could inhibit the growth or intended operation of
United States companies;  
   
     (c)  any act, policy, or practice of a foreign government that
could require a United States company to jeopardize its intellectual
property; and  
   
     (d)  Any other act, policy, or practice of a foreign government
that serves to undermine the global competitiveness of United States
companies.    
 

   
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Agency
Responsibilities</span>.  (a)  The United States Trade Representative
shall determine, in accordance with applicable law, whether to renew
investigations under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C.
2411) of the DSTs of France, Austria, Italy, Spain, Turkey, and the
United Kingdom, which were initiated under my Administration on July 16,
2019, and June 5, 2020.  If the United States Trade Representative
determines to renew such investigations, he shall take all appropriate
and feasible action in response to those DSTs.  
  
     (b)  The United States Trade Representative shall determine,
consistent with section 302(b) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C.
2412(b)) (section 302(b)), whether to investigate the DST of any other
country that may discriminate against United States companies or burden
or restrict United States commerce.  He shall further determine whether
to pursue a panel under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement on the
DST imposed by Canada and whether to investigate Canada’s DST under
section 302(b).  In making these determinations, the United States Trade
Representative shall consult with the Secretary of the Treasury, as
appropriate.  
   
     (c)  The Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, and
the United States Trade Representative shall jointly identify trade and
other regulatory practices by other countries, including, without
limitation, those described in section 2 of this memorandum, that
discriminate against, disproportionately affect, or otherwise undermine
the global competitiveness or intended operation of United States
companies, in the digital economy and more generally, and recommend to
me appropriate actions to counter such practices under applicable
authorities.  The United States Trade Representative shall include the
results of this review as part of the report required in section 5(c) of
the Presidential Memorandum of January 20, 2025 (America First Trade
Policy) (America First Trade Policy Memorandum).  
   
     (d)  The Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, and
the United States Trade Representative shall investigate whether any
act, policy, or practice of any country in the European Union or the
United Kingdom has the effect of requiring or incentivizing the use or
development of United States companies’ products or services in ways
that undermine freedom of speech and political engagement or otherwise
moderate content, and recommend appropriate actions to counter such
practices under applicable authorities.  The United States Trade
Representative shall include the results of this review as part of the
report required in section 5(c) of the America First Trade Policy
Memorandum.  
   
     (e)  The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the
Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative, shall
determine whether any foreign country subjects United States citizens or
companies, including, without limitation, in the digital economy, to
discriminatory or extraterritorial taxes, or has any tax measure in
place that otherwise undermines the global competitiveness of United
States companies, is inconsistent with any tax treaty of the United
States, or is otherwise actionable under section 891 of title 26, United
States Code, or other tax-related legal authority.  The Secretary of the
Treasury shall include the results of this determination as part of the
report required in section 2 of the Presidential Memorandum of January
20, 2025 (The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development
(OECD) Global Tax Deal).  
   
     (f)  The United States Trade Representative shall identify tools
the United States can use to secure among trading partners a permanent
moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions.  The United
States Trade Representative shall include the results of this review as
part of the report required in section 5(c) of the America First Trade
Policy Memorandum.  
   
     (g)  The United States Trade Representative, in consultation with
the Secretary of Commerce and the Senior Counselor to the President for
Trade and Manufacturing, shall establish a process that allows American
businesses to report to the United States Trade Representative foreign
tax or regulatory practices that disproportionately harm United States
companies.  
   
   
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">General
Provisions</span>.  (a)  Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed
to impair or otherwise affect:  
   
          (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department
or agency, or the head thereof; or  
   
          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.  
   
     (b)  This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with
applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
   
     (c)  This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in
equity by any party against the United States, its departments,
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other
person.  
  
     (d)  The United States Trade Representative is authorized and
directed to publish this memorandum in the *Federal Register*.
