title: "Establishing the President\u2019s Make America Healthy Again Commission"
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  American life
expectancy significantly lags behind other developed countries, with
pre‑COVID-19 United States life expectancy averaging 78.8 years and
comparable countries averaging 82.6 years.  This equates to 1.25 billion
fewer life years for the United States population.  Six in 10 Americans
have at least one chronic disease, and four in 10 have two or more
chronic diseases.  An estimated one in five United States adults lives
with a mental illness.

These realities become even more painful when contrasted with nations
around the globe.  Across 204 countries and territories, the United
States had the highest age-standardized incidence rate of cancer in
2021, nearly double the next-highest rate.  Further, from 1990-2021, the
United States experienced an 88 percent increase in cancer, the largest
percentage increase of any country evaluated.  In 2021, asthma was more
than twice as common in the United States than most of Europe, Asia, or
Africa.  Autism spectrum disorders had the highest prevalence in
high-income countries, including the United States, in 2021.  Similarly,
autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and
multiple sclerosis are more commonly diagnosed in high-income areas such
as Europe and North America.  Overall, the global comparison data
demonstrates that the health of Americans is on an alarming trajectory
that requires immediate action.

This concern applies urgently to America’s children.  In 2022, an
estimated 30 million children (40.7 percent) had at least one health
condition, such as allergies, asthma, or an autoimmune disease.  Autism
spectrum disorder now affects 1 in 36 children in the United States — a
staggering increase from rates of 1 to 4 out of 10,000 children
identified with the condition during the 1980s.  Eighteen percent of
late adolescents and young adults have fatty liver disease, close to 30
percent of adolescents are prediabetic, and more than 40 percent of
adolescents are overweight or obese.

These health burdens have continued to increase alongside the increased
prescription of medication.  For example, in the case of Attention
Deficit Disorder/Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, over 3.4
million children are now on medication for the disorder — up from 3.2
million children in 2019-2020 — and the number of children being
diagnosed with the condition continues to rise.  

This poses a dire threat to the American people and our way of life.
 Seventy-seven percent of young adults do not qualify for the military
based in large part on their health scores.  Ninety percent of the
Nation’s $4.5 trillion in annual healthcare expenditures is for people
with chronic and mental health conditions.  In short, Americans of all
ages are becoming sicker, beset by illnesses that our medical system is
not addressing effectively.  These trends harm us, our economy, and our
security.

To fully address the growing health crisis in America, we must re-direct
our national focus, in the public and private sectors, toward
understanding and drastically lowering chronic disease rates and ending
childhood chronic disease.  This includes fresh thinking on nutrition,
physical activity, healthy lifestyles, over-reliance on medication and
treatments, the effects of new technological habits, environmental
impacts, and food and drug quality and safety.  We must restore the
integrity of the scientific process by protecting expert recommendations
from inappropriate influence and increasing transparency regarding
existing data.  We must ensure our healthcare system promotes health
rather than just managing disease.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It shall be
the policy of the Federal Government to aggressively combat the critical
health challenges facing our citizens, including the rising rates of
mental health disorders, obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases.
 To do so, executive departments and agencies (agencies) that address
health or healthcare must focus on reversing chronic disease.  Under
this policy:

\(a\)  all federally funded health research should empower Americans
through transparency and open-source data, and should avoid or eliminate
conflicts of interest that skew outcomes and perpetuate distrust;

\(b\)  the National Institutes of Health and other health-related
research funded by the Federal Government should prioritize
gold-standard research on the root causes of why Americans are getting
sick;

\(c\)  agencies shall work with farmers to ensure that United States
food is the healthiest, most abundant, and most affordable in the world;
and

\(d\)  agencies shall ensure the availability of expanded treatment
options and the flexibility for health insurance coverage to provide
benefits that support beneficial lifestyle changes and disease
prevention.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Establishment and Composition
of the President’s Make America Healthy Again Commission</span>*.*  (a)

crisis, including by ending Federal practices that exacerbate the health
crisis or unsuccessfully attempt to address it, and by adding powerful
new solutions that will end childhood chronic disease.

\(c\)  The Chair may hold public hearings, meetings, roundtables, and
similar events, as appropriate, and may receive expert input from
leaders in public health and Government accountability.
