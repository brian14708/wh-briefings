title: Protecting Second Amendment Rights
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  
  
     Section 1.  Purpose.  The Second Amendment is an indispensable
safeguard of security and liberty.  It has preserved the right of the
American people to protect ourselves, our families, and our freedoms
since the founding of our great Nation.  Because it is foundational to
maintaining all other rights held by Americans, the right to keep and
bear arms must not be infringed.   
  
     Sec. 2.  Plan of Action.  (a)  Within 30 days of the date of this
order, the Attorney General shall examine all orders, regulations,
guidance, plans, international agreements, and other actions of
executive departments and agencies (agencies) to assess any ongoing
infringements of the Second Amendment rights of our citizens, and
present a proposed plan of action to the President, through the Domestic
Policy Advisor, to protect the Second Amendment rights of all
Americans.  
     (b)  In developing such proposed plan of action, the Attorney
General shall review, at a minimum:  
          (i)    All Presidential and agencies’ actions from January
2021 through January 2025 that purport to promote safety but may have
impinged on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens;  
          (ii)   Rules promulgated by the Department of Justice,
including by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives,
from January 2021 through January 2025 pertaining to firearms and/or
Federal firearms licensees;  
          (iii)  Agencies’ plans, orders, and actions regarding the
so-called “enhanced regulatory enforcement policy” pertaining to
firearms and/or Federal firearms licensees;  
          (iv)   Reports and related documents issued by the White House
Office of Gun Violence Prevention;  
          (v)    The positions taken by the United States in any and all
ongoing and potential litigation that affects or could affect the
ability of Americans to exercise their Second Amendment rights;  
          (vi)   Agencies’ classifications of firearms and ammunition;
and  
          (vii)  The processing of applications to make, manufacture,
transfer, or export firearms.  
  
     Sec. 3.  Implementation.  Upon submission of the proposed plan of
action described in section 2 of this order, the Attorney General shall
work with the Domestic Policy Advisor to finalize the plan of action and
establish a process for implementation.  
  
     Sec. 4.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be
construed to impair or otherwise affect:  
          (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department,
agency, or the head thereof; or  
          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.  
     (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
