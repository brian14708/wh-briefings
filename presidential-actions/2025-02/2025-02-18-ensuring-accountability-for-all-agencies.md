title: Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies
---
 
 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  

   
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy and Purpose</span>.
 The Constitution vests all executive power in the President and charges
him with faithfully executing the laws.  Since it would be impossible
for the President to single-handedly perform all the executive business
of the Federal Government, the Constitution also provides for
subordinate officers to assist the President in his executive duties.
 In the exercise of their often-considerable authority, these executive
branch officials remain subject to the President’s ongoing supervision
and control.  The President in turn is regularly elected by and
accountable to the American people.  This is one of the structural
safeguards, along with the separation of powers between the executive
and legislative branches, regular elections for the Congress, and an
independent judiciary whose judges are appointed by the President by and
with the advice and consent of the Senate, by which the Framers created
a Government accountable to the American people.   

     However, previous administrations have allowed so-called
“independent regulatory agencies” to operate with minimal Presidential
supervision.  These regulatory agencies currently exercise substantial
executive authority without sufficient accountability to the President,
and through him, to the American people.  Moreover, these regulatory
agencies have been permitted to promulgate significant regulations
without review by the President.  

     These practices undermine such regulatory agencies’ accountability
to the American people and prevent a unified and coherent execution of
Federal law.  For the Federal Government to be truly accountable to the
American people, officials who wield vast executive power must be
supervised and controlled by the people’s elected President.   

     Therefore, in order to improve the administration of the executive
branch and to increase regulatory officials’ accountability to the
American people, it shall be the policy of the executive branch to
ensure Presidential supervision and control of the entire executive
branch.  Moreover, all executive departments and agencies, including
so-called independent agencies, shall submit for review all proposed
and final significant regulatory actions to the Office of Information
and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Executive Office of the
President before publication in the *Federal Register*. 

   
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Definitions</span>.  For the
purposes of this order:

     (a)  The term “employees” shall have the meaning given that term in
section 2105 of title 5, United States Code.   

     (b)  The term “independent regulatory agency” shall have the
meaning given that term in section 3502(5) of title 44, United States
Code.  This order shall not apply to the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System or to the Federal Open Market Committee in its
conduct of monetary policy.  This order shall apply to the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System only in connection with its
conduct and authorities directly related to its supervision and
regulation of financial institutions.  

     (c)  The term “independent regulatory agency chairman” shall mean,
with regard to a multi-member independent regulatory agency, the
chairman of such agency, and shall mean, with regard to a single-headed
independent regulatory agency, such agency’s chairman, director, or
other presiding officer.    

     (d)  The term “head” of an independent regulatory agency shall mean
those appointed to supervise independent regulatory agencies and in whom
the agencies’ authorities are generally vested, encompassing the
chairman, director, or other presiding officer, and, as applicable,
other members, commissioners, or similar such officials with
responsibility for supervising such agencies.   

     Sec. 3.  OIRA Review of Agency Regulations.  (a)  Section 3(b) of
Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 (“Regulatory Planning and
Review”), as amended, is hereby amended to read as follows:   

     “(b)  “Agency,” unless otherwise indicated, means any authority of
the United States that is an “agency” under 44 U.S.C. 3502(1), and shall
also include the Federal Election Commission.  This order shall not
apply to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or to the
Federal Open Market Committee in its conduct of monetary policy.  This
order shall apply to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System only in connection with its conduct and authorities directly
related to its supervision and regulation of financial institutions.”.

     (b)  The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
shall provide guidance on implementation of this order to the heads of
executive departments and agencies newly submitting regulatory actions

independent regulatory agencies under such section shall commence within
the earlier of 60 days from the date of this order, or completion of
such implementation guidance.  

   
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Performance Standards and
Management Objectives</span>.  The Director of OMB shall establish
performance standards and management objectives for independent agency
heads, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, and report

     (b)  consult with independent regulatory agency chairmen and adjust
such agencies’ apportionments by activity, function, project, or object,
as necessary and appropriate, to advance the President’s policies and
priorities.  Such adjustments to apportionments may prohibit independent
regulatory agencies from expending appropriations on particular
activities, functions, projects, or objects, so long as such
restrictions are consistent with law.

strategic plans developed pursuant to the Government Performance and
Results Act of 1993 to the Director of OMB for clearance prior to
finalization.

 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Rules of Conduct Guiding
Federal Employees’ Interpretation of the Law</span>. The President and
the Attorney General, subject to the President’s supervision and
control, shall provide authoritative interpretations of law for the
executive branch.  The President and the Attorney General’s opinions on
questions of law are controlling on all employees in the conduct of
their official duties.  No employee of the executive branch acting in
their official capacity may advance an interpretation of the law as the
position of the United States that contravenes the President or the
Attorney General’s opinion on a matter of law, including but not limited
to the issuance of regulations, guidance, and positions advanced in
litigation, unless authorized to do so by the President or in writing by
the Attorney General.

provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the
remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any
other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.
