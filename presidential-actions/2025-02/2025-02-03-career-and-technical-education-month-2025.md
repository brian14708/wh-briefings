title: Career and Technical Education Month, 2025
---
 
Hardworking Americans are the backbone of our great Nation.  Our
workforce is the best in the world, and my Administration is dedicated
to giving our students and workers the tools they need to succeed in a
time where emerging technologies are advancing at an unprecedented pace.
 During Career and Technical Education Month, we reaffirm our belief in
excellence by putting America first and investing in the best training
and retraining opportunities that will result in a stronger workforce
and a booming economy.  
  
     Under my leadership, America will once again champion a culture
where hard work is rewarded and equip our people with real skills for
real careers that our communities are in desperate need to fill.  During
my first term, I proudly signed the Strengthening Career and Technical
Education for the 21st Century Act, which provided millions of students
with excellent vocational opportunities.  And we saw unparalleled growth
and economic development, empowering students and workers to undertake
new high-wage careers, especially in science, technology, and
engineering.  We will make technology work for Americans, not Americans
for technology.  
  
     America is well-positioned at the forefront of innovation and
entrepreneurship, and our history of ingenuity and grit is unrivaled. 
Over the next 4 years, we will rebuild our economy, raise wages, and
strengthen families.  My Administration will invest in the next
generation and expand access to high-quality career and technical
education for all Americans.  We will unleash the enormous potential of
the American people and provide students and workers with the necessary
skills training to ensure that our Nation dominates the 21st century.  
  
     This February, we celebrate our incredible workers who are making
America bigger, better, and more beautiful than ever before.  By
offering more alternatives to higher education, we will train
college-aged kids in relevant skills for the 21st century economy.  We
will put America first, invest in our people, and lead the world into a
new golden age.  
  
     NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States
of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 2025 as
Career and Technical Education Month.  
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this  
third day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five,
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred
and forty-ninth.
