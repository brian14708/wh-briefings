              THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND

SUBJECT:        Suspension of Security Clearances and Evaluation  
of Government Contracts  
  
I hereby direct the Attorney General and all other relevant heads of
executive departments and agencies (agencies) to immediately take steps
consistent with applicable law to suspend any active security clearances
held by Peter Koski and all members, partners, and employees of
Covington & Burling LLP who assisted former Special Counsel Jack Smith
during his time as Special Counsel, pending a review and determination
of their roles and responsibilities, if any, in the weaponization of the
judicial process.  I also direct the Attorney General and heads of
agencies to take such actions as are necessary to terminate any
engagement of Covington & Burling LLP by any agency to the maximum
extent permitted by law and consistent with the memorandum that shall be
issued by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.  
  
Additionally, if any of the covered Covington & Burling LLP members,
partners, and employees referenced in this memorandum obtained a
security clearance from an agency not included as an addressee of this
memorandum, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall
provide this memorandum to the appropriate clearance-granting agency to
ensure compliance.    
  
I further direct the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to
issue a memorandum to all agencies to review all Government contracts
with Covington & Burling LLP.  To the extent permitted by applicable
law, heads of agencies shall align their agency funding decisions with
the interests of the citizens of the United States; with the goals and
priorities of my Administration as expressed in executive actions,
especially Executive Order 14147 of January 20, 2025 (Ending the
Weaponization of the Federal Government); and as heads of agencies deem
appropriate.   
  
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
