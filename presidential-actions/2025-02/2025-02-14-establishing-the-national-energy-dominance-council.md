title: Establishing the National Energy Dominance Council
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

   
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>*.*  America is
blessed with an abundance of natural resources and is a leader in energy
technologies and innovation that are critical to the economic prosperity
and national security of the American people, as well as our partners
and allies.  We must expand all forms of reliable and affordable energy
production to drive down inflation, grow our economy, create good-paying
jobs, reestablish American leadership in manufacturing, lead the world
in artificial intelligence, and restore peace through strength by
wielding our commercial and diplomatic levers to end wars across the
world.  By utilizing our amazing national assets, including our crude
oil, natural gas, lease condensates, natural gas liquids, refined
petroleum products, uranium, coal, biofuels, geothermal heat, the
kinetic movement of flowing water, and critical minerals, we will
preserve and protect our most beautiful places, reduce our dependency on
foreign imports, and grow our economy — thereby enabling the reduction
of our deficits and our debt.  
It shall be the policy of my Administration to make America energy
dominant.

   
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.

is hereby established within the Executive Office of the President the

the energy sector; and the regulatory constraints driving up the cost of
reliable energy to consumers;
