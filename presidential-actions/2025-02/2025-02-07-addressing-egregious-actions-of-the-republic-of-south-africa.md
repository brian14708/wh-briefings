title: Addressing Egregious Actions of The Republic of South Africa
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:  
  
     Section 1. * *Purpose.  In shocking disregard of its citizens’
rights, the Republic of South Africa (South Africa) recently enacted
Expropriation Act 13 of 2024 (Act), to enable the government of South
Africa to seize ethnic minority Afrikaners’ agricultural property
without compensation.  This Act follows countless government policies
designed to dismantle equal opportunity in employment, education, and
business, and hateful rhetoric and government actions fueling
disproportionate violence against racially disfavored landowners.  
In addition, South Africa has taken aggressive positions towards the
United States and its allies, including accusing Israel, not Hamas, of
genocide in the International Court of Justice, and reinvigorating its
relations with Iran to develop commercial, military, and nuclear
arrangements.    
  
     The United States cannot support the government of South Africa’s
commission of rights violations in its country or its ‘undermining
United States foreign policy, which poses national security threats to
our Nation, our allies, our African partners, and our interests.  
  
     Sec. 2. * *Policy.  It is the policy of the United States that, as
long as South Africa continues these unjust and immoral practices that
harm our Nation:  
          (a)  the United States shall not provide aid or assistance to
South Africa; and  
          (b)  the United States shall promote the resettlement of
Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored race-based
discrimination, including racially discriminatory property
confiscation.  
  
     Sec. 3.  Assistance.  (a)  All executive departments and agencies
(agencies), including the United States Agency for International
Development, shall, to the maximum extent allowed by law, halt foreign
aid or assistance delivered or provided to South Africa, and shall
promptly exercise all available authorities and discretion to halt such
aid or assistance.  
          (b)  The head of each agency may permit the provision of any
such foreign aid or assistance that, in the discretion of the relevant
agency head, is necessary or appropriate.   
  
     Sec. 4.  Refugee Resettlement and Other Humanitarian
Considerations.  The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland
Security shall take appropriate steps, consistent with law, to
prioritize humanitarian relief, including admission and resettlement
through the United States Refugee Admissions Program, for Afrikaners in
South Africa who are victims of unjust racial discrimination.  Such plan
shall be submitted to the President through the Assistant to the
President and Homeland Security Advisor.  
  
     Sec. 5.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be
construed to impair or otherwise affect:   
          (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department
or agency, or the head thereof; or   
          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.   
     (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.   
     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

    February 7, 2025.
