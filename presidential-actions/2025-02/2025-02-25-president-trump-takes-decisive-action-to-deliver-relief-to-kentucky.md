title: President Trump Takes Decisive Action to Deliver Relief to Kentucky
---
 
President Donald J. Trump granted a Major Disaster Declaration for the
Commonwealth of Kentucky on Monday following severe storms and
flooding.  
  
The President’s
[action](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20250225/president-donald-j-trump-approves-major-disaster-declaration-kentucky) will
make federal funding available for individuals in impacted areas. The
assistance can include grants for temporary housing and other programs
to help individuals and businesses recover. Federal funding will also be
made available to the Commonwealth, local governments, and certain
nonprofit organizations.

Acting FEMA Administrator Cameron Hamilton: “President Trump clearly
understands that when Americans are in need, we all have to act
together. Starting with his decisive action on February 16 that allowed
us to activate search and rescue assets and other emergency efforts to
save lives to his major declaration, I know the people of Kentucky value
his leadership which will now open up the full suite of FEMA support to
those impacted.”  
  
Kush Desai, Deputy White House Press Secretary: “In response to the
tragic loss of life and destruction gripping Kentucky, President Trump
has issued a Major Disaster Declaration to ensure that Kentucky gets the
support it needs. In addition to our and the nation’s prayers, the Trump
Administration is committed to marshaling every resource that Kentucky
needs to save lives, rebuild communities, and emerge stronger in the
face of tragedy.”  
  
Governor Andy Beshear
[said](https://www.wkyt.com/2025/02/24/president-approves-disaster-declaration-kentucky/):
“We are thankful to President Trump and his administration for approving
this funding. This support will be a big help for our families and
communities as they recover and rebuild from yet another terrible
storm.”  
  
Congressman Hal Rogers
[said](https://www.wkyt.com/2025/02/24/president-approves-disaster-declaration-kentucky/):
“I’m grateful for President Trump’s expedited Major Disaster Declaration
for Kentucky, which includes public assistance and individual assistance
for ten counties.”  
  
President Trump’s approval of a Major Disaster Declaration on Monday
follows the
[initial](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/president-donald-j-trump-approves-kentucky-emergency-declaration/)
emergency declaration last week. Governor Beshear
[noted](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1891555123010195934) that
President Trump has “responded to all of our requests — turned around
the declaration of emergency about as quickly as I’ve ever seen.”
