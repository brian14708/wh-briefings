title: Keeping Education Accessible and Ending Covid-19 Vaccine Mandates in Schools
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose and Policy</span>.
 Some school districts and universities continue to coerce children and
young adults into taking the COVID-19 vaccine by conditioning their
education on it, and others may re-implement such mandates.  Parents and
young adults should be empowered with accurate data regarding the remote
risks of serious illness associated with COVID-19 for children and young
adults, as well as how those risks can be mitigated through various
measures, and left free to make their own decisions accordingly.  Given
the incredibly low risk of serious COVID-19 illness for children and
young adults, threatening to shut them out of an education is an
intolerable infringement on personal freedom.  Such mandates usurp
parental authority and burden students of many faiths.      
It is the policy of my Administration that discretionary Federal funds
should not be used to directly or indirectly support or subsidize an
educational service agency, State educational agency, local educational
agency, elementary school, secondary school, or institution of higher
education that requires students to have received a COVID-19 vaccination
to attend any in-person education program.  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Definitions</span>.  For the
purposes of this order:    
(a)  The term “educational service agency” has the meaning given in 20
U.S.C. 1401(5).  
(b)  The term “elementary school” has the meaning given in 34 C.F.R.
77.1(c).   
(c)  The term “institution of higher education” has the meaning given in
20 U.S.C. 1001(a).   
(d)  The term “local educational agency” has the meaning given in 34
C.F.R. 77.1(c).  
(e)  The term “secondary school” has the meaning given in 34 C.F.R.
77.1(c).   
(f)  The term “State educational agency” has the meaning given in 34
C.F.R. 77.1(c).  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Ending COVID-19 Vaccine
Mandate Coercion</span>.  (a)  The Secretary of Education shall as soon
as practicable issue guidelines to elementary schools, local educational
agencies, State educational agencies, secondary schools, and
institutions of higher education regarding those entities’ legal
obligations with respect to parental authority, religious freedom,
disability accommodations, and equal protection under law, as relevant
to coercive COVID-19 school mandates.  
(b)  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of
Education, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human
Services, shall provide to the President, through the Assistant to the
President for Domestic Policy, a plan to end coercive COVID-19 school
mandates, consistent with applicable law, and including, as appropriate,
any proposed legislation.  Such plan shall also include:  
(i)   a list of discretionary Federal grants and contracts provided to
elementary schools, local educational agencies, State educational
agencies, secondary schools, and institutions of higher education that
are non-compliant with the guidelines issued pursuant to subsection (a)
of this section; and  
(ii)  each executive department or agency’s process for, to the maximum
extent consistent with applicable law, preventing Federal funds from
being provided to, and rescinding Federal funds from, elementary
schools, local educational agencies, State educational agencies,
secondary schools, and institutions of higher education that are
non-compliant with the guidelines issued pursuant to subsection (a) of
this section.  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.
 (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:  
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or  
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.  
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
