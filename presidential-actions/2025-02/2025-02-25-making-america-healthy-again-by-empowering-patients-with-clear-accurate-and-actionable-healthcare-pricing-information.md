title: Making America Healthy Again by Empowering Patients with Clear, Accurate, and
  Actionable Healthcare Pricing Information
---
 
     By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:   
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  During my
first term, my Administration took historic steps to correct a
fundamental wrong within the American healthcare system.  For far too
long, prices were hidden from patients and employers, with inadequate
recourse available to individuals looking to shop for care or obtain
pricing information from a healthcare provider in advance of a visit or
procedure.  These opaque pricing arrangements allowed powerful entities,
such as hospitals and insurance companies, to operate with insufficient
accountability regarding their pricing practices, resulting in patients,
employers, and taxpayers shouldering the burden of inflated healthcare
costs.    
  
     Pursuant to Executive Order 13877 of June 24, 2019 (Improving Price
and Quality Transparency in American Healthcare to Put Patients First),
my Administration issued paradigm-shifting regulations to put patients
first by requiring hospitals and health plans to deliver meaningful
price information to the American people.  These regulations require
hospitals to maintain a consumer-friendly display of pricing information
for up to 300 shoppable services and a machine-readable file with
negotiated rates for every single service the hospital provides; health
plans to post their negotiated rates with providers as well as their
out-of-network payments to providers and the actual prices they or their
pharmacy benefit manager pay for prescription drugs; and health plans to
maintain a consumer-facing internet tool through which individuals can
access price information.   
  
     One economic analysis from 2023 estimated the impact of these
regulations, if fully implemented, could result in as much as $80
billion in healthcare savings for consumers, employers, and insurers by
2025.  Another report from 2024 suggested healthcare price transparency
could help employers reduce healthcare costs by 27 percent across 500
common healthcare services.  Recent data has found the top 25 percent of
most expensive healthcare service prices have dropped by 6.3 percent per
year following the initial implementation of price transparency during
my first term.    
  
     Unfortunately, progress on price transparency at the Federal level
has stalled since the end of my first term.  Hospitals and health plans
were not adequately held to account when their price transparency data
was incomplete or not even posted at all.  The Biden Administration
failed to take sufficient steps to fully enforce my Administration’s
requirement that would end the opaque nature of drug prices by ensuring
health plans publicly post the true prices they pay for prescription
drugs.   
  
     The American people deserve better.  Making America healthy again
will require empowering individuals with the best information possible
to inform their life and healthcare choices.  By building on the
historic efforts of my first term, my Administration will make more
meaningful price information available to patients to support a more
competitive, innovative, affordable, and higher quality healthcare
system.   
      
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  It is the
policy of the United States to put patients first and ensure they have
the information they need to make well-informed healthcare decisions.
 The Federal Government will continue to promote universal access to
clear and accurate healthcare prices and will take all necessary steps
to improve existing price transparency requirements; increase
enforcement of price transparency requirements; and identify
opportunities to further empower patients with meaningful price
information, potentially including through the expansion of existing
price transparency requirements.   
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Fulfilling the Promise of
Radical Transparency</span>.  The Secretary of the Treasury, the
Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall
take all necessary and appropriate action to rapidly implement and
enforce the healthcare price transparency regulations issued pursuant to
Executive Order 13877, including, within 90 days of the date of this
order, action to:  
     (a)  require the disclosure of the actual prices of items and
services, not estimates;   
     (b)  issue updated guidance or proposed regulatory action ensuring
pricing information is standardized and easily comparable across
hospitals and health plans; and  
     (c)  issue guidance or proposed regulatory action updating
enforcement policies designed to ensure compliance with the transparent
reporting of complete, accurate, and meaningful data.  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.
 (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:   
          (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department
or agency, or the head thereof; or   
          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.   
     (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.   
     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
