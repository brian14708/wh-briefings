title: Expanding Access to In Vitro Fertilization
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

   
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose and Policy</span>.
 Today, many hopeful couples dream of starting a family, but as many as
one in seven are unable to conceive a child.  Despite their hopes and
efforts, infertility struggles can make conception difficult, turning
what should be a joyful experience into an emotional and financial
struggle.  My Administration recognizes the importance of family
formation, and as a Nation, our public policy must make it easier for
loving and longing mothers and fathers to have children.  
     In vitro fertilization (IVF) offers hope to men and women
experiencing fertility challenges.  Americans need reliable access to
IVF and more affordable treatment options, as the cost per cycle can
range from $12,000 to $25,000.  Providing support, awareness, and access
to affordable fertility treatments can help these families navigate
their path to parenthood with hope and confidence.  
     Therefore, to support American families, it is the policy of my
Administration to ensure reliable access to IVF treatment, including by
easing unnecessary statutory or regulatory burdens to make IVF treatment
drastically more affordable.

   
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Lowering Costs and Reducing
Barriers to IVF</span>.  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the
Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy shall submit to the
President a list of policy recommendations on protecting IVF access and
aggressively reducing out-of-pocket and health plan costs for IVF
treatment.

   
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.
 (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:

             (i)  the authority granted by law to an executive
department or agency, or the head thereof; or

             (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.

     (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
