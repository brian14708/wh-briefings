title: President Donald J. Trump Approves Kentucky Emergency Declaration
---
 
Today, President Donald J. Trump declared that an emergency exists in
the Commonwealth of Kentucky and ordered Federal assistance to
supplement Commonwealth and local response efforts due to the emergency
conditions resulting from severe storms, straight-line winds, flooding,
and landslides beginning on February 14, 2025, and continuing. 

  
The President’s action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security,
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate all disaster
relief efforts which have the purpose of alleviating the hardship and
suffering caused by the emergency on the local population. FEMA will
provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures,
authorized under Title V of the Stafford Act, to save lives and to
protect property and public health and safety, and to lessen or avert
the threat of a catastrophe in all 120 counties of the Commonwealth of
Kentucky.  
   
Specifically, FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize, and provide, at
its discretion, equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the
impacts of the emergency.  Emergency protective measures, limited to
direct federal assistance, will be provided at 75 percent Federal
funding.   
   
Mr. Jeremy Slinker of FEMA has been appointed to coordinate Federal
recovery operations in the affected areas.
