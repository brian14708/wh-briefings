MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES

SUBJECT:       Radical Transparency About Wasteful Spending

The United States Government spends too much money on programs,
contracts, and grants that do not promote the interests of the American
people.  For too long, taxpayers have subsidized ideological projects
overseas and domestic organizations engaged in actions that undermine
the national interest.  The American people have seen their tax dollars
used to fund the passion projects of unelected bureaucrats rather than
to advance the national interest.  The American people have a right to
see how the Federal Government has wasted their hard-earned wages.

I therefore direct the heads of executive departments and agencies
(agencies) to take all appropriate actions to make public, to the
maximum extent permitted by law and as the heads of agencies deem
appropriate to promote the policies of my Administration, the complete
details of every terminated program, cancelled contract, terminated
grant, or any other discontinued obligation of Federal funds.  Agencies
shall ensure that such publication occurs in accordance with all
applicable laws, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the
underlying contract, grant, or other award.
