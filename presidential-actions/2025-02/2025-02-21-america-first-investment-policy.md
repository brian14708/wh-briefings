SUBJECT:       America First Investment Policy  
   
   
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:  
   
       
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Principles and
Objectives</span>.  America’s investment policy is critical to our
national and economic security.  Welcoming foreign investment and
strengthening the United States’ world-leading private and public
capital markets will be a key part of America’s Golden Age.  The United
States has the world’s most attractive assets, in technology and across
our economy, and we will make it easier for our overseas allies to
support United States jobs, United States innovators, and United States
economic growth with their capital.  
   
         Investment by United States allies and partners can create
hundreds of thousands of jobs and significant wealth for the United
States.  Our Nation is committed to maintaining the strong, open
investment environment that benefits our economy and our people, while
enhancing our ability to protect the United States from new and evolving
threats that can accompany foreign investment.  
   
         Investment at all costs is not always in the national interest,
however.  Certain foreign adversaries, including the People’s Republic
of China (PRC), systematically direct and facilitate investment in
United States companies and assets to obtain cutting-edge technologies,
intellectual property, and leverage in strategic industries.  The PRC
pursues these strategies in diverse ways, both visible and concealed,
and often through partner companies or investment funds in third
countries.   
   
         Economic security is national security.  The PRC does not
allow United States companies to take over their critical
infrastructure, and the United States should not allow the PRC to take
over United States critical infrastructure.  PRC-affiliated investors
are targeting the crown jewels of United States technology, food
supplies, farmland, minerals, natural resources, ports, and shipping
terminals.  
   
         The PRC is also increasingly exploiting United States capital
to develop and modernize its military, intelligence, and other security
apparatuses, which poses significant risk to the United States homeland
and Armed Forces of the United States around the world.  Related actions
include the development and deployment of dual-use technologies, weapons
of mass destruction, advanced conventional weapons, and malicious
cyber‑enabled actions against the United States and its people.  Through
its national Military-Civil Fusion strategy, the PRC increases the size
of its military-industrial complex by compelling civilian Chinese
companies and research institutions to support its military and
intelligence activities.  
   
         Those Chinese companies also raise capital by:  selling to
American investors securities that trade on American and foreign public
exchanges; lobbying United States index providers and funds to include
these securities in market offerings; and engaging in other acts to
ensure access to United States capital and accompanying intangible
benefits.  In this way, the PRC exploits United States investors to
finance and advance the development and modernization of its military.  
   
       
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy</span>.  (a)  It is the
policy of the United States to preserve an open investment environment
to help ensure that artificial intelligence and other emerging
technologies of the future are built, created, and grown right here in
the United States.  Investment in our economy from our allies and
partners, some of whom have tremendous sovereign wealth funds, supports
the national interest.  My Administration will make the United States
the world’s greatest destination for investment dollars, to the benefit
of all of us.   
   
         (b)  Yet for investment in United States businesses involved in
critical technology, critical infrastructure, personal data, and other
sensitive areas, restrictions on foreign investors’ access to United
States assets will ease in proportion to their verifiable distance and
independence from the predatory investment and technology-acquisition
practices of the PRC and other foreign adversaries or threat actors.  
   
         (c)  The United States will create an expedited “fast-track”
process, based on objective standards, to facilitate greater investment
from specified allied and partner sources in United States businesses
involved with United States advanced technology and other important
areas.  This process will allow for increased foreign investment subject
to appropriate security provisions, including requirements that the
specified foreign investors avoid partnering with United States foreign
adversaries.    
   
         (d)  My Administration will also expedite environmental reviews
for any investment over $1 billion in the United States.  
   
         (e)  The United States will reduce the exploitation of public
and private sector capital, technology, and technical knowledge by
foreign adversaries such as the PRC.  The United States will establish
new rules to stop United States companies and investors from investing
in industries that advance the PRC’s national Military-Civil Fusion
strategy and stop PRC-affiliated persons from buying up critical
American businesses and assets, allowing only those investments that
serve American interests.  
   
         (f)  The United States will use all necessary legal
instruments, including the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United
States (CFIUS), to restrict PRC-affiliated persons from investing in
United States technology, critical infrastructure, healthcare,
agriculture, energy, raw materials, or other strategic sectors.  My
Administration will protect United States farmland and real estate near
sensitive facilities.  It will also seek, including in consultation with
the Congress, to strengthen CFIUS authority over “greenfield”
investments, to restrict foreign adversary access to United States
talent and operations in sensitive technologies (especially artificial
intelligence), and to expand the remit of “emerging and foundational”
technologies addressable by CFIUS.  
   
         (g)  To reduce uncertainty for investors, reduce administrative
burden, and increase Government efficiency, my Administration will cease
the use of overly bureaucratic, complex, and open-ended “mitigation”
agreements for United States investments from foreign adversary
countries.  In general, mitigation agreements should consist of concrete
actions that companies can complete within a specific time, rather than
perpetual and expensive compliance obligations.  More administrative
resources, in turn, will be directed toward facilitating investments
from key partner countries.  
   
         (h)  The United States will continue to welcome and encourage
passive investments from all foreign persons.  These include
non-controlling stakes and shares with no voting, board, or other
governance rights and that do not confer any managerial influence,
substantive decisionmaking, or non-public access to technologies or
technical information, products, or services.  This will allow our
cutting-edge businesses to continue to benefit from foreign investment
capital, while ensuring protection of our national security.  
   
         (i)  The United States will also use all necessary legal
instruments to further deter United States persons from investing in the
PRC’s military-industrial sector.  These may include the imposition of
sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)
through the blocking of assets or through other actions, including
actions pursuant to Executive Order 13959 of November 12, 2020
(Addressing the Threat From Securities Investments That Finance
Communist Chinese Military Companies), as amended by Executive Order
13974 of January 13, 2021 (Amending Executive Order 13959 — Addressing
the Threat From Securities Investments That Finance Communist Chinese
Military Companies) and Executive Order 14032 of June 3, 2021
(Addressing the Threat From Securities Investments That Finance Certain
Companies of the People’s Republic of China), and actions pursuant to
Executive Order 14105 of August 9, 2023 (Addressing United States
Investments in Certain National Security Technologies and Products in
Countries of Concern).  Executive Order 14105 is under review by my
Administration, pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of January 20,
2025 (America First Trade Policy), to examine whether it includes
sufficient controls to address national security threats.  
   
         (j)  This review will build on measures taken under my
authority in 2020 and 2021 and consider new or expanded restrictions on
United States outbound investment in the PRC in sectors such as
semiconductors, artificial intelligence, quantum, biotechnology,
hypersonics, aerospace, advanced manufacturing, directed energy, and
other areas implicated by the PRC’s national Military-Civil Fusion
strategy.  Covered sectors should be reviewed and updated regularly,
including by the Office of Science and Technology Policy.  As part of
the review, my Administration will consider applying restrictions on
investment types including private equity, venture capital, greenfield
investments, corporate expansions, and investments in publicly traded
securities, from sources including pension funds, university endowments,
and other limited-partner investors.  It is past time for American
universities to stop supporting foreign adversaries with their
investment decisions, much as they should stop granting university
access to supporters of terrorism.  
   
         (k)  To further reduce incentives for United States persons to
invest in our foreign adversaries, we will review whether to suspend or
terminate the 1984 United States-The People’s Republic of China Income
Tax Convention.  That tax treaty, along with the PRC’s admission to the
World Trade Organization and the related undertaking by the United
States to accord unconditional Most Favored Nation treatment to goods
and services of the PRC, led to the deindustrialization of the United
States and the technological modernization of the PRC military.  We will
seek to reverse both those trends.  United States investors will invest
in the future of America, not the future of the PRC.  
   
         (l)  To protect the savings of United States investors and
channel them into American growth and prosperity, my Administration will
also:  
   
         (i)    determine if adequate financial auditing standards are
upheld for companies covered by the Holding Foreign Companies
Accountable Act;  
   
         (ii)   review the variable interest entity and subsidiary
structures used by foreign-adversary companies to trade on United States
exchanges, which limit the ownership rights and protections for United
States investors, as well as allegations of fraudulent behavior by these
companies; and  
   
         (iii)  restore the highest fiduciary standards as required by
the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974, seeking to ensure that
foreign adversary companies are ineligible for pension plan
contributions.  
   
       
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Implementation</span>.  The

Secretary of the Treasury, and with respect to the authorities of CFIUS
in coordination with the members thereof, shall take such actions,
including the promulgation of rules and regulations, to support all
powers granted to the President by IEEPA, section 721 of the Defense
Production Act of 1950, as amended, and other statutes to carry out the
purposes of this memorandum.

behavior for all foreign adversary companies currently listed on
domestic exchanges; and with respect to section 2(l)(iii) of this
memorandum, the Secretary of Labor shall publish updated fiduciary
standards under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 for
investments in public market securities of foreign adversary
companies.
