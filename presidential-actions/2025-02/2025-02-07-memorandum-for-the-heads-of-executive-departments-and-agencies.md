SUBJECT:       Advancing United States Interests When Funding

               Nongovernmental Organizations

The United States Government has provided significant taxpayer dollars
to Nongovernmental Organizations (NGOs), many of which are engaged in
actions that actively undermine the security, prosperity, and safety of
the American people.  It is the policy of my Administration to stop
funding NGOs that undermine the national interest.  
 

I therefore direct the heads of executive departments and agencies
(agencies) to review all funding that agencies provide to NGOs.  The
heads of agencies shall align future funding decisions with the
interests of the United States and with the goals and priorities of my
Administration, as expressed in executive actions; as otherwise
determined in the judgment of the heads of agencies; and on the basis of
applicable authorizing statutes, regulations, and terms.
