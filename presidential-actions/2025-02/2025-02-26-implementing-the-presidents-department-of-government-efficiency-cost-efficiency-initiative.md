     By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

   
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  This order
commences a transformation in Federal spending on contracts, grants, and
loans to ensure Government spending is transparent and Government
employees are accountable to the American public.

   
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Definitions</span>.  As used
in this order:  
(a)  “Administrator” means the Administrator of the United States DOGE
Service, as defined in Executive Order 14158 of January 20, 2025
(Establishing and Implementing the President’s “Department of Government
Efficiency”).  
(b)  “Agency” has the meaning given to that term in section 3502 of
title 44, United States Code, except that such term does not include the
Executive Office of the President or any components thereof.  
(c)  “Agency Head” means the highest-ranking official of an agency, such
as the Secretary, Administrator, Chairman, or Director.  Agency Heads
may select designees within their agencies to carry out the
responsibilities specified in this order.  
(d)  “Covered contracts and grants” means discretionary spending through
Federal contracts, grants, loans, and related instruments, but excludes
direct assistance to individuals; expenditures related to immigration
enforcement, law enforcement, the military, public safety, and the
intelligence community; and other critical, acute, or emergency
spending, as determined by the relevant Agency Head.  Notification shall
be made to the agency’s DOGE Team Lead.  
(e)  “DOGE Team Lead” means the leader of the DOGE Team at each agency,
as defined in Executive Order 14158.  
Sec. 3.  Cutting Costs to Save Taxpayers Money.  each Agency Head shall,
with assistance as requested from the agency’s DOGE Team Lead, build a
centralized technological system within the agency to seamlessly record
every payment issued by the agency pursuant to each of the agency’s
covered contracts and grants, along with a brief, written justification
for each payment submitted by the agency employee who approved the
payment.  This system shall include a mechanism for the Agency Head to
pause and rapidly review any payment for which the approving employee
has not submitted a brief, written justification within the
technological system.   
(i)   Once the system described in subsection (a) of this section is in
place, the Agency Head shall issue guidance, in consultation with the
agency’s DOGE Team Lead, to require that the relevant agency employee
promptly submit a brief, written justification prior to that employee’s
approval of a payment under covered contracts and grants, subject to any
exceptions the Agency Head deems appropriate.  
(ii)  To the maximum extent permitted by law, and to the maximum extent
deemed practicable by the Agency Head, the payment justifications
described in subsection (a)(i) of this section shall be posted
publicly.  
(b)  *Review of Covered Contracts and Grants*.  Each Agency Head, in
consultation with the agency’s DOGE Team Lead, shall review all existing
covered contracts and grants and, where appropriate and consistent with
applicable law, terminate or modify (including through renegotiation)
such covered contracts and grants to reduce overall Federal spending or
reallocate spending to promote efficiency and advance the policies of my
Administration.  This process shall commence immediately and shall
prioritize the review of funds disbursed under covered contracts and
grants to educational institutions and foreign entities for waste,
fraud, and abuse.  Each Agency Head shall complete this review within 30
days of the date of this order.  
(c)  *Contract and Grant Process Review*.  Each Agency Head, in
consultation with the agency’s DOGE Team Lead, shall conduct a
comprehensive review of each agency’s contracting policies, procedures,
and personnel.  Each Agency Head shall complete this process within 30
days of the date of this order and shall not issue or approve new
contracting officer warrants during the review period, unless the Agency
Head determines such approval is necessary.   
(d)  *CoveredContract and Grant Approval*.    
(i)   Following the review specified in subsection (c) of this section,
and prior to entering into new contracts, each Agency Head shall, in
consultation with the agency’s DOGE Team Lead, issue guidance on signing
new contracts or modifying existing contracts to promote Government
efficiency and the policies of my Administration.  The Agency Head may
approve new contracts prior to the issuance of such guidance on a
case-by-case basis.   
(ii)  Each DOGE Team Lead shall provide the Administrator with a monthly
informational report on contracting activities.  As soon as an agency’s
contract and grant justification process described in subsection (a) of
this section is established, this report shall include all payment
justifications provided pursuant to that process, to the extent
consistent with law.  
(e)  *Non-Essential Travel Justification*.  Each Agency Head shall, with
assistance from the agency’s DOGE Team Lead, build a technological
system within each agency that centrally records approval for federally
funded travel for conferences and other non-essential purposes.  Once an
agency’s system is in place, the Agency Head shall prohibit agency
employees from engaging in federally funded travel for conferences or
other non-essential purposes unless the travel-approving official has
submitted a brief, written justification for the federally funded travel
within such system.  Each DOGE Team Lead shall, to the extent consistent
with law, provide the Administrator with a monthly informational report
listing each agency’s justifications for non-essential travel.  Such
justifications shall be posted publicly unless prohibited by law or
unless the Agency Head grants an exemption from this requirement.  
(f)  *Credit Card Freeze*.  To the maximum extent permitted by law, all
credit cards held by agency employees shall be treated as frozen for 30
days from the date of this order, except for any credit cards held by
employees engaged in, or charges related to employees utilizing such
credit cards for, disaster relief or natural disaster response benefits
or operations or other critical services as determined by the Agency
Head, and subject to such additional individualized or categorical
exceptions as the Agency Head, in consultation with the agency’s DOGE
Team Lead, deems appropriate.  
(g)  *Real Property Disposition*.  Agencies shall take the following
actions:  
(i)    *Real Property Report*.  Within 7 days of the date of this order,
each Agency Head shall confirm to the Administrator of General Services
or his designee that the Agency Head has submitted updates to the
Federal Real Property Profile Management System to ensure the system
reflects a complete and accurate inventory of real property subject to
the agency’s administration.  
(ii)   *Real Property Leases*.  Within 30 days of the date of this
order, each Agency Head shall promptly identify all termination rights
the Agency Head may have under existing leases of Government-owned real
property and, in consultation with agency’s DOGE Team Lead and the
Administrator of General Services or his designee, determine whether to
exercise such rights.  
(iii)  *Real Property Disposition*.  Within 60 days of the date of this
order, the Administrator of General Services shall submit a plan to the
Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for the
disposition of Government-owned real property which has been deemed by
the agency as no longer needed.
