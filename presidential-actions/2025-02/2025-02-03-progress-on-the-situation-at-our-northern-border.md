title: Progress on the Situation at Our Northern Border
---
 
     By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq*.) (IEEPA), the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq*.), section 604 of the
Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301
of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:

     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 1.
 Background.</span> On February 1, 2025, I determined that the failure
of Canada to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise intercept drug
trafficking organizations, other drug and human traffickers, criminals
at large, and illicit drugs constitutes an unusual and extraordinary
threat, which has its source in substantial part outside the United
States, to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the
United States.  To address that threat, I invoked my authority under
section 1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA to impose ad valorem tariffs on articles
that are products of Canada.

     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 2.  Immediate
Steps.</span>  Pursuant to section 3 of my Executive Order of February
1, 2025, titled “Imposing Duties to Address the Situation at Our
Northern Border” (“the Executive Order of February 1, 2025”), I have
determined that the Government of Canada has taken immediate steps
designed to alleviate the illegal migration and illicit drug crisis
through cooperative actions.  Further time is needed, however, to assess
whether these steps constitute sufficient action to alleviate the crisis
and resolve the unusual and extraordinary threat beyond our northern
border.

     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 3.  Pause</span>. 
(a)  In recognition of the steps taken by the Government of Canada, and
in order to assess whether the threat described in section 1 of this
order has abated, the additional 25 percent ad valorem rates of duty,
and 10 percent ad valorem rates of duty as to energy products, shall be
paused and will not take effect until March 4, 2025, at 12:01 a.m.
eastern time.  Accordingly, section 2(a), section 2(b), section 2(e),
and section 2(f) of the Executive Order of February 1, 2025, are amended
by striking the term “February 4, 2025,” where it appears in those
sections and inserting in lieu thereof the term “March 4, 2025.”  The
exceptions set forth in section 2(a) and section 2(b) of the Executive
Order of February 1, 2025, related to covered goods loaded onto a vessel
at a port of entry or in transit on the final mode of transport prior to
entry into the United States are, hereby, withdrawn.  
(b)  During this pause, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in
consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the
Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the
Assistant to the President for Homeland Security shall continue to
assess the situation at our northern border, as provided in section 3 of
the Executive Order of February 1, 2025.  
(c)  If the illegal migration and illicit drug crises worsen, and if the
Government of Canada fails to take sufficient steps to alleviate these
crises, the President shall take necessary steps to address the
situation, including by immediate implementation of the tariffs
described in the Executive Order of February 1, 2025.

 
   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 4.  Severability.</span> 
If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to
any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this
order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or
circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 5.  General
Provisions.</span>  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to
impair or otherwise affect:  
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or  
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.  
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
