 Hiring Ratio.  Pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of January 20,
2025 (Hiring Freeze), the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget shall submit a plan to reduce the size of the Federal
Government’s workforce through efficiency improvements and attrition
(Plan).  The Plan shall require that each agency hire no more than one
employee for every four employees that depart, consistent with the plan
and any applicable exemptions and details provided for in the Plan.
 This order does not affect the standing freeze on hiring as applied to
the Internal Revenue Service.  This ratio shall not apply to functions
related to public safety, immigration enforcement, or law enforcement.

promulgated pursuant to Executive Order 14170 of January 20, 2025
(Reforming the Federal Hiring Process and Restoring Merit to Government
Service).

appointment hiring decisions shall be made in consultation with the
agency’s DOGE Team Lead, consistent with applicable law.

DOGE Service (USDS) Administrator with a monthly hiring report for the
agency.  
     (c)  Reductions in Force.  Agency Heads shall promptly undertake
preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force (RIFs),
consistent with applicable law, and to separate from Federal service
temporary employees and reemployed annuitants working in areas that will
likely be subject to the RIFs.  All offices that perform functions not
mandated by statute or other law shall be prioritized in the RIFs,
including all agency diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives; all
agency initiatives, components, or operations that my Administration
suspends or closes; and all components and employees performing
functions not mandated by statute or other law who are not typically
designated as essential during a lapse in appropriations as provided in
the Agency Contingency Plans on the Office of Management and Budget
website.  This subsection shall not apply to functions related to public
safety, immigration enforcement, or law enforcement.   
     (d)  Rulemaking.  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the
Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) shall initiate a
rulemaking that proposes to revise 5 C.F.R. 731.202(b) to include
additional suitability criteria, including:   
          (i)    failure to comply with generally applicable legal
obligations, including timely filing of tax returns;   
          (ii)   failure to comply with any provision that would
preclude regular Federal service, including citizenship requirements;   
          (iii)  refusal to certify compliance with any applicable
nondisclosure obligations, consistent with 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(13), and
failure to adhere to those compliance obligations in the course of
Federal employment; and  
          (iv)   theft or misuse of Government resources and equipment,
or negligent loss of material Government resources and equipment.   
     (e)  Developing Agency Reorganization Plans.  Within 30 days of the
date of this order, Agency Heads shall submit to the Director of the
Office of Management and Budget a report that identifies any statutes
that establish the agency, or subcomponents of the agency, as
statutorily required entities.  The report shall discuss whether the
agency or any of its subcomponents should be eliminated or
consolidated.  
     (f)  Within 240 days of the date of this order, the USDS
Administrator shall submit a report to the President regarding
implementation of this order, including a recommendation as to whether
any of its provisions should be extended, modified, or terminated.  
       
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 4.  Exclusions.</span>
 (a)  This order does not apply to military personnel.  
     (b)  Agency Heads may exempt from this order any position they deem
necessary to meet national security, homeland security, or public safety
responsibilities.   
     (c)  The Director of OPM may grant exemptions from this order where
those exemptions are otherwise necessary and shall assist in promoting
workforce reduction.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 5.  General
Provisions.</span>  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to
impair or otherwise affect:  
          (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department,
agency, or the head thereof; or  
          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.  
     (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
