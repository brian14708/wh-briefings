By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  
 

     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  It is the
policy of my Administration to focus the executive branch’s limited
enforcement resources on regulations squarely authorized by
constitutional Federal statutes, and to commence the deconstruction of
the overbearing and burdensome administrative state.  Ending Federal
overreach and restoring the constitutional separation of powers is a
priority of my Administration.  

     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Rescinding Unlawful
Regulations and Regulations That Undermine the National
Interest</span>.  (a)  Agency heads shall, in coordination with their
DOGE Team Leads and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget,
initiate a process to review all regulations subject to their sole or
joint jurisdiction for consistency with law and Administration policy.
 Within 60 days of the date of this order, agency heads shall, in
consultation with the Attorney General as appropriate, identify the
following classes of regulations:  
(i)    unconstitutional regulations and regulations that raise serious
constitutional difficulties, such as exceeding the scope of the power
vested in the Federal Government by the Constitution;  
(ii)   regulations that are based on unlawful delegations of legislative
power;  
(iii)  regulations that are based on anything other than the best
reading of the underlying statutory authority or prohibition;  
(iv)   regulations that implicate matters of social, political, or
economic significance that are not authorized by clear statutory
authority;  
(v)    regulations that impose significant costs upon private parties
that are not outweighed by public benefits;  
(vi)   regulations that harm the national interest by significantly and
unjustifiably impeding technological innovation, infrastructure
development, disaster response, inflation reduction, research and
development, economic development, energy production, land use, and
foreign policy objectives; and  
(vii)  regulations that impose undue burdens on small business and
impede private enterprise and entrepreneurship.  
(b)  In conducting the review required by subsection (a) of this
section, agencies shall prioritize review of those rules that satisfy
the definition of “significant regulatory action” in Executive Order
12866 of September 30, 1993 (Regulatory Planning and Review), as
amended.  
(c)  Within 60 days of the date of this order, agency heads shall
provide to the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs (OIRA) within the Office of Management and Budget a list of all
regulations identified by class as listed in subsection (a) of this
section.  
(d)  The Administrator of OIRA shall consult with agency heads to
develop a Unified Regulatory Agenda that seeks to rescind or modify
these regulations, as appropriate.  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Enforcement Discretion to
Ensure Lawful Governance</span>.  (a)  Subject to their paramount
obligation to discharge their legal obligations, protect public safety,
and advance the national interest, agencies shall preserve their limited
enforcement resources by generally de-prioritizing actions to enforce
regulations that are based on anything other than the best reading of a
statute and de-prioritizing actions to enforce regulations that go
beyond the powers vested in the Federal Government by the
Constitution.  
(b)  Agency heads shall determine whether ongoing enforcement of any
regulations identified in their regulatory review is compliant with law
and Administration policy.  To preserve resources and ensure lawful
enforcement, agency heads, in consultation with the Director of the
Office of Management and Budget, shall, on a case-by-case basis and as
appropriate and consistent with applicable law, then direct the
termination of all such enforcement proceedings that do not comply with
the Constitution, laws, or Administration policy.  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Promulgation of New
Regulations</span>.  Agencies shall continue to follow the processes set
out in Executive Order 12866 for submitting regulations for review by
OIRA.  Additionally, agency heads shall consult with their DOGE Team
Leads and the Administrator of OIRA on potential new regulations as soon
as practicable.  In evaluating potential new regulations, agency heads,
DOGE Team Leads, and the Administrator of OIRA shall consider, in
addition to the factors set out in Executive Order 12866, the factors
set out in section 2(a) of this order.     
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Implementation</span>.  The
Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall issue
implementation guidance, as appropriate.  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.
