title: Commencing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  It is the
policy of my Administration to dramatically reduce the size of the
Federal Government, while increasing its accountability to the American
people.  This order commences a reduction in the elements of the Federal
bureaucracy that the President has determined are unnecessary.  Reducing
the size of the Federal Government will minimize Government waste and
abuse, reduce inflation, and promote American freedom and innovation.  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Reducing the Scope of the
Federal Bureaucracy</span>.   (a)  The non-statutory components and
functions of the following governmental entities shall be eliminated to
the maximum extent consistent with applicable law, and such entities
shall reduce the performance of their statutory functions and associated
personnel to the minimum presence and function required by law:  
(i)    the Presidio Trust;  
(ii)   the Inter-American Foundation;  
(iii)  the United States African Development Foundation; and

are statutorily required and to what extent.  
(c)  In reviewing budget requests submitted by the governmental entities
listed in subsection (a) of this section, the OMB Director or the head
of any executive department or agency charged with reviewing grant
requests by such entities shall, to the extent consistent with
applicable law and except insofar as necessary to effectuate an expected
termination, reject funding requests for such governmental entities to
the extent they are inconsistent with this order.  
(d)  The Presidential Memorandum of November 13, 1961 (Need for Greater
Coordination of Regional and Field Activities of the Government), is
hereby revoked.  The Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM
Director) is directed to initiate the process to withdraw the
regulations at title 5, part 960, Code of Federal Regulations, thereby
eliminating the Federal Executive Boards.    
(e)  The OPM Director is directed to initiate the process to withdraw
the regulations at title 5, part 362, subpart D, Code of Federal
Regulations, and to take any other steps necessary to promptly terminate

the final regulations promulgated by the OPM Director, Executive Order
13318 of November 21, 2003, is revoked and Executive Order 13562 of
December 27, 2010, is amended by:  
(i)    striking from section 2 the words “along with the Presidential
Management Fellows Program, as modified herein,”;  
(ii)   striking section 5;  
(iii)  striking from section 6(b) the words “or PMF Programs” and

combined conversion cap applicable to all three categories together)”
and inserting in their place “the competitive service of Interns or
Recent Graduates (or a Government-wide combined conversion cap
applicable to both categories together)”; and  
(v)    redesignating sections 6, 7, 8, and 9 as sections 5, 6, 7, and 8
respectively.    
(f)  Within 14 days of the date of this order, the following heads of
executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall take the following
actions with respect to the following Federal Advisory Committees within
their respective agencies:

entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
