title: Establishment of The White House Faith Office
---
 
     By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States of America, and to assist faith-based
entities, community organizations, and houses of worship in their
efforts to strengthen American families, promote work and
self-sufficiency, and protect religious liberty, it is hereby ordered:  
  
     Section 1.  Policy*.*  Faith-based entities, community
organizations, and houses of worship have tremendous ability to serve
individuals, families, and communities through means that are different
from those of government and with capacity and effectiveness that often
exceeds that of government.  These organizations lift people up, keep
families strong, and solve problems at the local level.  The executive
branch wants faith-based entities, community organizations, and houses
of worship, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to compete on a
level playing field for grants, contracts, programs, and other Federal
funding opportunities.  The efforts of faith-based entities, community
organizations, and houses of worship are essential to strengthening
families and revitalizing communities, and the Federal Government
welcomes opportunities to partner with such organizations through
innovative, measurable, and outcome-driven initiatives.  
The executive branch is committed to ensuring that all executive
departments and agencies (agencies) honor and enforce the Constitution’s
guarantee of religious liberty and to ending any form of religious
discrimination by the Federal Government.  
  
     Sec. 2.  Amendments to Executive Orders*.*  (a)  Executive Order
13198 of January 29, 2001 (Agency Responsibilities With Respect to
Faith-Based and Community Initiatives); Executive Order 13279 of
December 12, 2002 (Equal Protection of the Laws for Faith-Based and
Community Organizations), as amended by Executive Order 13559 of
November 17, 2010 (Fundamental Principles and Policymaking Criteria for
Partnerships With Faith-Based and Other Neighborhood Organizations);
Executive Order 13280 of December 12, 2002 (Responsibilities of the
Department of Agriculture and the Agency for International Development
With Respect to Faith-Based and Community Initiatives); Executive Order
13342 of June 1, 2004 (Responsibilities of the Departments of Commerce
and Veterans Affairs and the Small Business Administration With Respect
to Faith-Based and Community Initiatives); and Executive Order 13397 of
March 7, 2006 (Responsibilities of the Department of Homeland Security
With Respect to Faith-Based and Community Initiatives), are hereby
amended by:

Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives” or “White House OFBCI”
each time it appears in those orders; and  
          (ii)  substituting “Center for Faith” for “Center for
Faith-based and Community Initiatives,” and “Centers for Faith” for

     Sec. 4.  White House Faith Office Functions*.*  (a)  To the extent
