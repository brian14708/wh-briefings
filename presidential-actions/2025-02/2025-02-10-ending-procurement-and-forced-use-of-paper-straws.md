title: Ending Procurement and Forced Use of Paper Straws
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 1. 
Policy. </span> An irrational campaign against plastic straws has
resulted in major cities, States, and businesses banning the use or
automatic inclusion of plastic straws with beverages.  Plastic straws
are often replaced by paper straws, which are nonfunctional, use
chemicals that may carry risks to human health, are more expensive to
produce than plastic straws, and often force users to use multiple
straws.  Additionally, paper straws sometimes come individually wrapped
in plastic, undermining the environmental argument for their use.  
It is therefore the policy of the United States to end the use of paper
straws.   
  
    <span style="text-decoration: underline"> Sec. 2.  Purchases of
Paper Straws by the Federal Government.</span>  (a)  The heads of
executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall take all appropriate
action to eliminate the procurement of paper straws and otherwise ensure
that paper straws are no longer provided within agency buildings.  
(b)  Agencies shall take appropriate action to eliminate policies
designed to disfavor plastic straws issued to further Executive Order
14057 of December 8, 2021 (Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs
Through Federal Sustainability), which I revoked on January 20, 2025.  
(c)  Within 45 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the
President for Domestic Policy, in coordination with relevant agencies,
shall issue a National Strategy to End the Use of Paper Straws.  This
strategy shall address:  
(i)    The elimination of all policies within the executive branch
designed to disfavor plastic straws;  
(ii)   Contract policies and terms with entities, including States, that
ban or penalize plastic straw purchase or use; and  
(iii)  All other available tools to achieve the policy of this order
nationwide.  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 3. General
Provisions.</span>  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to
impair or otherwise affect:    
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency,
or the head thereof; or   
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.    
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.    
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
