By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Today, our Nation commemorates the Father of our country, the patriarch
of our freedom, and a timeless exemplar of valor and virtue:  the first
President of the United States, George Washington.  On President
Washington’s Birthday, we honor his heroic legacy and steadfast love of
country.

As our Nation’s first chief executive, President Washington was a key
architect of our Federal Government and constitutional order.  He was a
visionary unifier, a fierce advocate for an America First foreign
policy, and a man of devout faith.  To this day, he lives on in our
souls as the original American patriot, the face of the American
Revolution, and a legendary titan of American liberty.

Through his presidency, private life, and personal conduct, George
Washington was a model of public service and a living reminder that no
challenge is too great for the strength of the American spirit.

In the winter of 1776, with the Revolutionary War raging and the
Continental Army on the verge of collapse, General Washington refused to
surrender.  Low on supplies and teetering on the edge of defeat, he
carried on, writing “Victory or Death” before departing for battle.  In
the waning hours of Christmas night, Washington’s Continental Army
ventured through miles of ice-cold darkness with nothing but patriotism
in their hearts, courage in their veins, and faith in their God — going
on to defeat the enemy and forever change the course of history.

President Washington’s unflinching devotion to the common good remains
the mandate of every American citizen.  As my Administration continues
the work of reforming our country, we look to George Washington, the
sacrifices he made, and the victories he won.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 17, 2025, as
a reserved holiday commemorating George Washington’s Birthday.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this

seventeenth day of February, in the year of our Lord
two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States
of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.
