title: Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders
---
 
  By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:   
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1.</span> 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  The plain text
of Federal law, including the Personal Responsibility and Work
Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193) (PRWORA),
generally prohibits illegal aliens from obtaining most taxpayer-funded
benefits.  Title IV of the PRWORA states that it is national policy that
“aliens within the Nation’s borders not depend on public resources to
meet their needs,” and that “\[i\]t is a compelling government interest
to remove the incentive for illegal immigration provided by the
availability of public benefits.”  But in the decades since the passage
of the PRWORA, numerous administrations have acted to undermine the
principles and limitations directed by the Congress through that law.
 Over the last 4 years, in particular, the prior administration
repeatedly undercut the goals of that law, resulting in the improper
expenditure of significant taxpayer resources.   
  
     My Administration will uphold the rule of law, defend against the
waste of hard-earned taxpayer resources, and protect benefits for
American citizens in need, including individuals with disabilities and
veterans.  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>*.*
<span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>. 
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Preserving Federal Public
Benefits</span>.  (a)  To prevent taxpayer resources from acting as a
magnet and fueling illegal immigration to the United States, and to
ensure, to the maximum extent permitted by law, that no taxpayer-funded
benefits go to unqualified aliens, the head of each executive department
or agency (agency) shall:  
          (i)    identify all federally funded programs administered by
the agency that currently permit illegal aliens to obtain any cash or
non-cash public benefit, and, consistent with applicable law, take all
appropriate actions to align such programs with the purposes of this
order and the requirements of applicable Federal law, including the
PRWORA;  
          (ii)   ensure, consistent with applicable law, that Federal
payments to States and localities do not, by design or effect,
facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or
abet so-called “sanctuary” policies that seek to shield illegal aliens
from deportation; and  
          (iii)  enhance eligibility verification systems, to the
maximum extent possible, to ensure that taxpayer-funded benefits exclude
any ineligible alien who entered the United States illegally or is
otherwise unlawfully present in the United States.  
     (b)  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Director of the
Office of Management and Budget and the Administrator of the United
States DOGE Service, in coordination with the Assistant to the President
for Domestic Policy, shall further:  
           (i)   identify all other sources of Federal funding for
illegal aliens; and  
           (ii)  recommend additional agency actions to align Federal
spending with the purposes of this order, and, where relevant, enhance
eligibility verification systems.  
     (c)  Agencies shall refer any improper receipt or use of Federal
benefits to the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland
Security for appropriate action.  
  
     <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">3.</span>
 <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions.</span>
 (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise
affect:  
          (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department
or agency, or the head thereof; or  
          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.  
     (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
