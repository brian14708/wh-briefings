title: Pausing Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Enforcement to Further American Economic
  and National Security
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  
  
     Section 1.  Purpose and Policy.  Since its enactment in 1977, the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (15 U.S.C. 78dd-1 *et seq*.) (FCPA) has
been systematically, and to a steadily increasing degree, stretched
beyond proper bounds and abused in a manner that harms the interests of
the United States.  Current FCPA enforcement impedes the United States’
foreign policy objectives and therefore implicates the President’s
Article II authority over foreign affairs.  
  
     The President’s foreign policy authority is inextricably linked
with the global economic competitiveness of American companies. 
American national security depends in substantial part on the United
States and its companies gaining strategic business advantages whether
in critical minerals, deep-water ports, or other key infrastructure or
assets.   
  
     But overexpansive and unpredictable FCPA enforcement against
American citizens and businesses — by our own Government — for routine
business practices in other nations not only wastes limited
prosecutorial resources that could be dedicated to preserving American
freedoms, but actively harms American economic competitiveness and,
therefore, national security.   
     It is therefore the policy of my Administration to preserve the
Presidential authority to conduct foreign affairs and advance American
economic and national security by eliminating excessive barriers to
American commerce abroad.   
  
     Sec. 2.  Policy of Enforcement Discretion.  (a)  For a period of
180 days following the date of this order, the Attorney General shall
review guidelines and policies governing investigations and enforcement
actions under the FCPA.  During the review period, the Attorney General
shall:  
          (i)    cease initiation of any new FCPA investigations or
enforcement actions, unless the Attorney General determines that an
individual exception should be made;  
          (ii)   review in detail all existing FCPA investigations or
enforcement actions and take appropriate action with respect to such
matters to restore proper bounds on FCPA enforcement and preserve
Presidential foreign policy prerogatives; and  
          (iii)  issue updated guidelines or policies, as appropriate,
to adequately promote the President’s Article II authority to conduct
foreign affairs and prioritize American interests, American economic
competitiveness with respect to other nations, and the efficient use of
Federal law enforcement resources.  
     (b)  The Attorney General may extend such review period for an
additional 180 days as the Attorney General determines appropriate.  
     (c)  FCPA investigations and enforcement actions initiated or
continued after the revised guidelines or policies are issued under
subsection (a) of this section:  
          (i)   shall be governed by such guidelines or policies; and  
          (ii)  must be specifically authorized by the Attorney
General.  
     (d)  After the revised guidelines or policies are issued under
subsection (a) of this section, the Attorney General shall determine
whether additional actions, including remedial measures with respect to
inappropriate past FCPA investigations and enforcement actions, are
warranted and shall take any such appropriate actions or, if
Presidential action is required, recommend such actions to the
President.  
  
     Sec. 3.  Severability.  If any provision of this order, or the
application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to
be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its
provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected
thereby.  
  
     Sec. 4.  General Provisions*.  *(a)  Nothing in this order shall be
construed to impair or otherwise affect:   
          (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department,
agency, or the head thereof; or   
          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.   
     (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.   
     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
