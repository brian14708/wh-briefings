title: Imposing Sanctions on the International Criminal Court
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) (IEEPA), the
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq.*) (NEA), section
212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C.
1182(f)), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,  
  
    I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find
that the International Criminal Court (ICC), as established by the Rome
Statute, has engaged in illegitimate and baseless actions targeting
America and our close ally Israel.  The ICC has, without a legitimate
basis, asserted jurisdiction over and opened preliminary investigations
concerning personnel of the United States and certain of its allies,
including Israel, and has further abused its power by issuing baseless
arrest warrants targeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Former Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant.  The ICC has no jurisdiction
over the United States or Israel, as neither country is party to the
Rome Statute or a member of the ICC.  Neither country has ever
recognized the ICC’s jurisdiction, and both nations are thriving
democracies with militaries that strictly adhere to the laws of war.
 The ICC’s recent actions against Israel and the United States set a
dangerous precedent, directly endangering current and former United
States personnel, including active service members of the Armed Forces,
by exposing them to harassment, abuse, and possible arrest.  This malign
conduct in turn threatens to infringe upon the sovereignty of the United
States and undermines the critical national security and foreign policy
work of the United States Government and our allies, including Israel.
 Furthermore, in 2002, the Congress enacted the American Servicemembers’
Protection Act of 2002 (22 U.S.C. 7421 *et seq.*) to protect United
States military personnel, United States officials, and officials and
military personnel of certain allied countries against criminal
prosecution by an international criminal court to which the United
States is not party, stating, “In addition to exposing members of the
Armed Forces of the United States to the risk of international criminal
prosecution, the Rome Statute creates a risk that the President and
other senior elected and appointed officials of the United States
Government may be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court.” (22
U.S.C. 7421(9)).    
  
    The United States unequivocally opposes and expects our allies to
oppose any ICC actions against the United States, Israel, or any other
ally of the United States that has not consented to ICC jurisdiction.
 The United States remains committed to accountability and to the
peaceful cultivation of international order, but the ICC and parties to
the Rome Statute must respect the decisions of the United States and
other countries not to subject their personnel to the ICC’s
jurisdiction, consistent with their respective sovereign prerogatives.  
  
     The United States will impose tangible and significant consequences
on those responsible for the ICC’s transgressions, some of which may
include the blocking of property and assets, as well as the suspension
of entry into the United States of ICC officials, employees, and agents,
as well as their immediate family members, as their entry into our
Nation would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.  
  
    I therefore determine that any effort by the ICC to investigate,
arrest, detain, or prosecute protected persons, as defined in section
8(d) of this order, constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to
the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I
hereby declare a national emergency to address that threat.  I hereby
determine and order:  
     Section 1.  (a)  All property and interests in property that are in
the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that
are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United
States person, of the following persons are blocked and may not be
transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:  
(i)   the person listed in the Annex to this order; and  
(ii)  any foreign person determined by the Secretary of State, in
consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney
General:  
(A)  to have directly engaged in any effort by the ICC to investigate,
arrest, detain, or prosecute a protected person without consent of that
person’s country of nationality;  
(B)  to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial,
material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in
support of, any activity in subsection (a)(ii)(A) of this section or any
person whose property or interests in property are blocked pursuant to
this order; or  
(C)  to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act
for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property
or interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.  
(b)  The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to
the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives,
or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and
notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit
granted before the date of this order.  
  
    Sec. 2.  I hereby determine that the making of donations of the
types of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C.
1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and
interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order
would seriously impair my ability to address the national emergency
declared in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided
by section 1 of this order.  
  
     Sec. 3.  The prohibitions in section 1(a) of this order include:  
     (a)  the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods,
or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and
interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order;
and  
     (b)  the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods,
or services from any such person.  
  
    Sec. 4.  The unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the
United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of the criteria
in section 1 of this order, as well as immediate family members of such
aliens, or aliens determined by the Secretary of State to be employed
by, or acting as an agent of, the ICC, would be detrimental to the
interests of the United States, and the entry of such persons into the
United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, is hereby suspended,
except where the Secretary of State determines that the entry of the
person into the United States would not be contrary to the interests of
the United States, including when the Secretary of State so determines,
based on a recommendation of the Attorney General, that the person’s
entry would further important United States law enforcement objectives.
 In exercising this responsibility, the Secretary of State shall consult
with the Secretary of Homeland Security on matters related to
admissibility or inadmissibility within the authority of the Secretary
of Homeland Security.  Such persons shall be treated as persons covered
by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry
of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and
International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions).  The Secretary
of State shall have the responsibility for implementing this section
pursuant to such conditions and procedures as the Secretary of State has
established or may establish pursuant to Proclamation 8693.  
  
    Sec. 5.  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of
the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit
to the President a report on additional persons that should be included
within the scope of section 1 of this order.  
  
    Sec. 6.  (a)  Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose
of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate
any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.  
(b)  Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth
in this order is prohibited.  
  
    Sec. 7.  Nothing in this order shall prohibit transactions for the
conduct of the official business of the Federal Government by employees,
grantees, or contractors thereof.  
  
     Sec. 8.  For the purposes of this order:  
     (a)  the term “person” means an individual or entity;  
     (b)  the term “entity” means a government or instrumentality of
such government, partnership, association, trust, joint venture,
corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;  
     (c)  the term “United States person” means any United States
citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of
the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States
(including a foreign branch, subsidiary, or employee of such entity), or
any person lawfully in the United States;  
     (d)  the term “protected person” means:  
(i)   any United States person, unless the United States provides formal
consent to ICC jurisdiction over that person or becomes a state party to
the Rome Statute, including:  
(A)  current or former members of the Armed Forces of the United
States;  
(B)  current or former elected or appointed officials of the United
States Government; and  
(C)  any other person currently or formerly employed by or working on
behalf of the United States Government; and  
(ii)  any foreign person that is a citizen or lawful resident of an ally
of the United States that has not consented to ICC jurisdiction over
that person or is not a state party to the Rome Statute, including:  
(A)  current or former members of the armed forces of such ally of the
United States;  
(B)  current or former elected or appointed government officials of such
ally of the United States; and  
(C)  any other person currently or formerly employed by or working on
behalf of such a government;  
     (e)  the term “ally of the United States” means:  
(i)   a government of a member country of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization; or  
(ii)  a government of a “major non-NATO ally,” as that term is defined
by section 2013(7) of the American Servicemembers’ Protection Act of
2002 (22 U.S.C. 7432(7));  
     (f)  the term “immediate family member” means a spouse or child;  
     (g)  the term “alien” has the meanings given to the term in section
101(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C.
1101(a)(3)); and  
     (h)  the term “foreign person” means a person that is not a United
States person.  
  
    Sec. 9.  For those persons whose property and interests in property
are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional
presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to
transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such
persons of measures to be taken pursuant to section 1 of this order
would render those measures ineffectual.  I therefore determine that for
these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency
declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or
determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.  
  
    Sec. 10.  The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including
adopting rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the
President by IEEPA as may be necessary to implement this order.  The
Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law,
redelegate any of these functions within the Department of the Treasury.
 All executive departments and agencies of the United States shall take
all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this
order.  
  
    Sec. 11.  The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to submit recurring and final
reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this
order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and
section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).  
  
     Sec. 12.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair
or otherwise affect:  
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency,
or the head thereof; or  
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.  
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of appropriations.  
(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
