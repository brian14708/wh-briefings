title: Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to Transnational
  Criminal Organizations
---
 
On July 24, 2011, by Executive Order 13581, the President declared a
national emergency with respect to transnational criminal organizations
pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C.
1701 *et seq*.) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States
constituted by the activities of significant transnational criminal
organizations. 

On March 15, 2019, by Executive Order 13863, the President took
additional steps to deal with the national emergency with respect to
significant transnational criminal organizations in view of the
evolution of these organizations as well as the increasing
sophistication of their activities, which threaten international
political and economic systems and pose a direct threat to the safety
and welfare of the United States and its citizens, and given the ability
of these organizations to derive revenue through widespread illegal
conduct, including acts of violence and abuse that exhibit a wanton
disregard for human life as well as many other crimes enriching and
empowering these organizations.

The activities of significant transnational criminal organizations
continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national
security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.  For these
reasons, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13581 of
July 24, 2011, under which additional steps were taken in Executive
Order 13863 of March 15, 2019, must continue in effect beyond July 24,
2021.  Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the
national emergency with respect to significant transnational criminal
organizations declared in Executive Order 13581.

This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and transmitted
to the Congress.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
July 7, 2021.
