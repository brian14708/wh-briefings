title: Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to Hong Kong
---
 
On July 14, 2020, by Executive Order 13936, the President declared a
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *etseq.*) to deal with the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and
economy of the United States constituted by the situation with respect
to Hong Kong.   

The situation with respect to Hong Kong, including recent actions taken
by the People’s Republic of China to fundamentally undermine Hong Kong’s
autonomy, continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.
 For this reason, the national emergency declared on July 14, 2020, must
continue in effect beyond July 14, 2021.  Therefore, in accordance with
section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am
continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order
13936 with respect to the situation in Hong Kong.

This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and transmitted
to the Congress.  
                             

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
July 7, 2021.
