title: Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy
---
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, and in order to promote the
interests of American workers, businesses, and consumers, it is hereby
ordered as follows:  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Section 1.  Policy</span>.   
    A fair, open, and competitive marketplace has long been a
cornerstone of the American economy, while excessive market
concentration threatens basic economic liberties, democratic
accountability, and the welfare of workers, farmers, small businesses,
startups, and consumers.  
     The American promise of a broad and sustained prosperity depends on
an open and competitive economy.  For workers, a competitive marketplace
creates more high-quality jobs and the economic freedom to switch jobs
or negotiate a higher wage.  For small businesses and farmers, it
creates more choices among suppliers and major buyers, leading to more
take-home income, which they can reinvest in their enterprises.  For
entrepreneurs, it provides space to experiment, innovate, and pursue the
new ideas that have for centuries powered the American economy and
improved our quality of life.  And for consumers, it means more choices,
better service, and lower prices.   
     Robust competition is critical to preserving America’s role as the
world’s leading economy.  
     Yet over the last several decades, as industries have consolidated,
competition has weakened in too many markets, denying Americans the
benefits of an open economy and widening racial, income, and wealth
inequality.  Federal Government inaction has contributed to these
problems, with workers, farmers, small businesses, and consumers paying
the price.  
     Consolidation has increased the power of corporate employers,
making it harder for workers to bargain for higher wages and better work
conditions.  Powerful companies require workers to sign non-compete
agreements that restrict their ability to change jobs.  And, while many
occupational licenses are critical to increasing wages for workers and
especially workers of color, some overly restrictive occupational
licensing requirements can impede workers’ ability to find jobs and to
move between States.  
     Consolidation in the agricultural industry is making it too hard
for small family farms to survive.  Farmers are squeezed between
concentrated market power in the agricultural input industries — seed,
fertilizer, feed, and equipment suppliers — and concentrated market
power in the channels for selling agricultural products.  As a result,
farmers’ share of the value of their agricultural products has
decreased, and poultry farmers, hog farmers, cattle ranchers, and other
agricultural workers struggle to retain autonomy and to make sustainable
returns.  
     The American information technology sector has long been an engine
of innovation and growth, but today a small number of dominant Internet
platforms use their power to exclude market entrants, to extract
monopoly profits, and to gather intimate personal information that they
can exploit for their own advantage.  Too many small businesses across
the economy depend on those platforms and a few online marketplaces for
their survival.  And too many local newspapers have shuttered or
downsized, in part due to the Internet platforms’ dominance
in advertising markets.  
     Americans are paying too much for prescription drugs and healthcare
services — far more than the prices paid in other countries.  Hospital
consolidation has left many areas, particularly rural communities, with
inadequate or more expensive healthcare options.  And too often, patent
and other laws have been misused to inhibit or delay — for years and
even decades — competition from generic drugs and biosimilars, denying
Americans access to lower-cost drugs.  
     In the telecommunications sector, Americans likewise pay too much
for broadband, cable television, and other communications services, in
part because of a lack of adequate competition.  In the
financial-services sector, consumers pay steep and often hidden fees
because of industry consolidation.  Similarly, the global container
shipping industry has consolidated into a small number of dominant
foreign-owned lines and alliances, which can disadvantage American
exporters.  
     The problem of economic consolidation now spans these sectors and
many others, endangering our ability to rebuild and emerge from the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic with a vibrant, innovative,
and growing economy.  Meanwhile, the United States faces new challenges
to its economic standing in the world, including unfair competitive
pressures from foreign monopolies and firms that are state-owned or
state-sponsored, or whose market power is directly supported by foreign
governments.  
     We must act now to reverse these dangerous trends, which constrain
the growth and dynamism of our economy, impair the creation of
high-quality jobs, and threaten America’s economic standing in the
world.   
     This order affirms that it is the policy of my Administration to
enforce the antitrust laws to combat the excessive concentration of
industry, the abuses of market power, and the harmful effects of
monopoly and monopsony — especially as these issues arise in labor
markets, agricultural markets, Internet platform industries, healthcare
markets (including insurance, hospital, and prescription drug markets),
repair markets, and United States markets directly affected by foreign
cartel activity.  
     It is also the policy of my Administration to enforce the antitrust
laws to meet the challenges posed by new industries and technologies,
including the rise of the dominant Internet platforms, especially as
they stem from serial mergers, the acquisition of nascent competitors,
the aggregation of data, unfair competition in attention markets, the
surveillance of users, and the presence of network effects.  
     Whereas decades of industry consolidation have often led to
excessive market concentration, this order reaffirms that the United
States retains the authority to challenge transactions whose previous
consummation was in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act (26 Stat.
209, 15 U.S.C. 1 *et seq.*) (Sherman Act), the Clayton Antitrust Act
(Public Law 63-212, 38 Stat. 730, 15 U.S.C. 12 *et seq.*) (Clayton Act),
or other laws.  *See* 15 U.S.C. 18; *Standard Oil Co. v. United States*,
221 U.S. 1 (1911).   
     This order reasserts as United States policy that the answer to the
rising power of foreign monopolies and cartels is not the tolerance of
domestic monopolization, but rather the promotion of competition and
innovation by firms small and large, at home and worldwide.  
     It is also the policy of my Administration to support aggressive
legislative reforms that would lower prescription drug prices, including
by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation
caps, and through other related reforms.  It is further the policy of my
Administration to support the enactment of a public health insurance
option.  
     My Administration further reaffirms the policy stated in Executive
Order 13725 of April 15, 2016 (Steps to Increase Competition and Better
Inform Consumers and Workers to Support Continued Growth of the American
Economy), and the Federal Government’s commitment to the principles that
led to the passage of the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, the Packers and
Stockyards Act, 1921 (Public Law 67-51, 42 Stat. 159, 7 U.S.C. 181 *et
seq.*) (Packers and Stockyards Act), the Celler-Kefauver Antimerger Act
(Public Law 81-899, 64 Stat. 1125), the Bank Merger Act (Public Law
86-463, 74 Stat. 129, 12 U.S.C. 1828), and the Telecommunications Act of
1996 (Public Law 104-104, 110 Stat. 56), among others.     
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 2.  The Statutory Basis of
a Whole-of-Government Competition Policy</span>.   
     (a)  The antitrust laws, including the Sherman Act, the Clayton
Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act (Public Law 63-203, 38 Stat.
717, 15 U.S.C. 41 *et seq.*), are a first line of defense against the
monopolization of the American economy.  
     (b)  The antitrust laws reflect an underlying policy favoring
competition that transcends those particular enactments.  As the Supreme
Court has stated, for instance, the Sherman Act “rests on the premise
that the unrestrained interaction of competitive forces will yield the
best allocation of our economic resources, the lowest prices, the
highest quality and the greatest material progress, while at the same
time providing an environment conducive to the preservation of our
democratic political and social institutions.”  *Northern Pac. Ry. Co.
v. United States*, 356 U.S. 1, 4 (1958).  
     (c)  Consistent with these broader policies, and in addition to the
traditional antitrust laws, the Congress has also enacted
industry-specific fair competition and anti-monopolization laws that
often provide additional protections.  Such enactments include the
Packers and Stockyards Act, the Federal Alcohol Administration Act
(Public Law 74-401, 49 Stat. 977, 27 U.S.C. 201 *et seq.*), the Bank
Merger Act, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act
of 1984 (Public Law 98-417, 98 Stat. 1585), the Shipping Act of 1984
(Public Law 98-237, 98 Stat. 67, 46 U.S.C. 40101 *et seq.*) (Shipping
Act), the ICC Termination Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-88, 109 Stat.
803), the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Fairness to Contact Lens
Consumers Act (Public Law 108-164, 117 Stat. 2024, 15 U.S.C. 7601 *et
seq.*), and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act (Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376) (Dodd-Frank Act).  
     (d)  These statutes independently charge a number of executive
departments and agencies (agencies) to protect conditions of fair
competition in one or more ways, including by:  
          (i)    policing unfair, deceptive, and abusive business
practices;  
          (ii)   resisting consolidation and promoting competition
within industries through the independent oversight of mergers,
acquisitions, and joint ventures;  
          (iii)  promulgating rules that promote competition, including
the market entry of new competitors; and  
          (iv)   promoting market transparency through compelled
disclosure of information.  
     (e)  The agencies that administer such or similar authorities
include the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Agriculture,
the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of
Transportation, the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Trade Commission
(FTC), the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, the Federal Communications Commission, the
Federal Maritime Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau, and the Surface Transportation Board.  
     (f)  Agencies can influence the conditions of competition through
their exercise of regulatory authority or through the procurement
process.  *See* 41 U.S.C. 1705.  
     (g)  This order recognizes that a whole-of-government approach is
necessary to address overconcentration, monopolization, and unfair
competition in the American economy.  Such an approach is supported by
existing statutory mandates.  Agencies can and should further the
polices set forth in section 1 of this order by, among other things,
adopting pro‑competitive regulations and approaches to procurement and
spending, and by rescinding regulations that create unnecessary barriers
to entry that stifle competition.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 3.  Agency Cooperation in
Oversight, Investigation, and Remedies</span>.   
     (a)  The Congress frequently has created overlapping agency
jurisdiction in the policing of anticompetitive conduct and the
oversight of mergers.  It is the policy of my Administration that, when
agencies have overlapping jurisdiction, they should endeavor to
cooperate fully in the exercise of their oversight authority, to benefit
from the respective expertise of the agencies and to improve Government
efficiency.  
     (b)  Where there is overlapping jurisdiction over particular cases,
conduct, transactions, or industries, agencies are encouraged to
coordinate their efforts, as appropriate and consistent with applicable
law, with respect to:  
          (i)    the investigation of conduct potentially harmful to
competition;  
          (ii)   the oversight of proposed mergers, acquisitions, and
joint ventures; and  
          (iii)  the design, execution, and oversight of remedies.  
     (c)  The means of cooperation in cases of overlapping jurisdiction
should include, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law:  
          (i)    sharing relevant information and industry data;  
          (ii)   in the case of major transactions, soliciting and
giving significant consideration to the views of the Attorney General or
the Chair of the FTC, as applicable; and  
          (iii)  cooperating with any concurrent Department of Justice
or FTC oversight activities under the Sherman Act or Clayton Act.  
     (d)  Nothing in subsections (a) through (c) of this section shall
be construed to suggest that the statutory standard applied by an
agency, or its independent assessment under that standard, should be
displaced or substituted by the judgment of the Attorney General or the
Chair of the FTC.  When their views are solicited, the Attorney General
and the Chair of the FTC are encouraged to provide a response to the
agency in time for the agency to consider it in advance of any statutory
deadline for agency action.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 4.  The White House
Competition Council</span>.   
    (a)  There is established a White House Competition Council
(Council) within the Executive Office of the President.  
     (b)  The Council shall coordinate, promote, and advance Federal
Government efforts to address overconcentration, monopolization, and
unfair competition in or directly affecting the American economy,
including efforts to:  
          (i)    implement the administrative actions identified in this
order;  
          (ii)   develop procedures and best practices for agency
cooperation and coordination on matters of overlapping jurisdiction, as
described in section 3 of this order;  
          (iii)  identify and advance any additional administrative
actions necessary to further the policies set forth in section 1 of this
order; and  
          (iv)   identify any potential legislative changes necessary to
further the policies set forth in section 1 of this order.  
     (c)  The Council shall work across agencies to provide
a coordinated response to overconcentration, monopolization, and unfair
competition in or directly affecting the American economy.  The Council
shall also work with each agency to ensure that agency operations are
conducted in a manner that promotes fair competition, as appropriate and
consistent with applicable law.  
     (d)  The Council shall not discuss any current or anticipated
enforcement actions.  
     (e)  The Council shall be led by the Assistant to the President for
Economic Policy and Director of the National Economic Council, who shall
serve as Chair of the Council.  
     (f)  In addition to the Chair, the Council shall consist of the
following members:  
          (i)     the Secretary of the Treasury;  
          (ii)    the Secretary of Defense;  
          (iii)   the Attorney General;  
          (iv)    the Secretary of Agriculture;  
          (v)     the Secretary of Commerce;  
          (vi)    the Secretary of Labor;  
          (vii)   the Secretary of Health and Human Services;  
          (viii)  the Secretary of Transportation;  
          (ix)    the Administrator of the Office of Information and
Regulatory Affairs; and  
          (x)     the heads of such other agencies and offices as the
Chair may from time to time invite to participate.  
     (g)  The Chair shall invite the participation of the Chair of the
FTC, the Chair of the Federal Communications Commission, the Chair of
the Federal Maritime Commission, the Director of the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau, and the Chair of the Surface Transportation Board, to
the extent consistent with their respective statutory authorities and
obligations.  
     (h)  Members of the Council shall designate, not later than 30 days
after the date of this order, a senior official within their respective
agency or office who shall coordinate with the Council and who shall be
responsible for overseeing the agency’s or office’s efforts to address
overconcentration, monopolization, and unfair competition.  The Chair
may coordinate subgroups consisting exclusively of Council members or
their designees, as appropriate.  
     (i)  The Council shall meet on a semi-annual basis unless the Chair
determines that a meeting is unnecessary.  
     (j)  Each agency shall bear its own expenses for participating in
the Council.  
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec. 5.  Further Agency
Responsibilities</span>.    
     (a)  The heads of all agencies shall consider using their
authorities to further the policies set forth in section 1 of this
order, with particular attention to:  
          (i)   the influence of any of their respective regulations,
particularly any licensing regulations, on concentration and competition
in the industries under their jurisdiction; and  
          (ii)  the potential for their procurement or other spending to
improve the competitiveness of small businesses and businesses with fair
labor practices.  
     (b)  The Attorney General, the Chair of the FTC, and the heads of
other agencies with authority to enforce the Clayton Act are encouraged
to enforce the antitrust laws fairly and vigorously.  
     (c)  To address the consolidation of industry in many markets
across the economy, as described in section 1 of this order, the
Attorney General and the Chair of the FTC are encouraged to review the
horizontal and vertical merger guidelines and consider whether to revise
those guidelines.  
     (d)  To avoid the potential for anticompetitive extension of market
power beyond the scope of granted patents, and to protect
standard-setting processes from abuse, the Attorney General and the
Secretary of Commerce are encouraged to consider whether to revise their
position on the intersection of the intellectual property and antitrust
laws, including by considering whether to revise the Policy Statement on
Remedies for Standards-Essential Patents Subject to Voluntary F/RAND
Commitments issued jointly by the Department of Justice, the United
States Patent and Trademark Office, and the National Institute of
Standards and Technology on December 19, 2019.  
     (e)  To ensure Americans have choices among financial institutions
and to guard against excessive market power, the Attorney General, in
consultation with the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, the Chairperson of the Board of Directors of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Comptroller of the Currency, is
encouraged to review current practices and adopt a plan, not later than
180 days after the date of this order, for the revitalization of merger
oversight under the Bank Merger Act and the Bank Holding Company Act of
1956 (Public Law 84-511, 70 Stat. 133, 12 U.S.C. 1841 *et seq.*) that is
in accordance with the factors enumerated in 12 U.S.C. 1828(c) and
1842(c).  
     (f)  To better protect workers from wage collusion, the Attorney
General and the Chair of the FTC are encouraged to consider whether to
revise the Antitrust Guidance for Human Resource Professionals of
October 2016.  
     (g)  To address agreements that may unduly limit workers’ ability
to change jobs, the Chair of the FTC is encouraged to consider working
with the rest of the Commission to exercise the FTC’s statutory
rulemaking authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act to curtail
the unfair use of non-compete clauses and other clauses or agreements
that may unfairly limit worker mobility.  
      (h)  To address persistent and recurrent practices that inhibit
competition, the Chair of the FTC, in the Chair’s discretion, is also
encouraged to consider working with the rest of the Commission to
exercise the FTC’s statutory rulemaking authority, as appropriate and
consistent with applicable law, in areas such as:  
          (i)    unfair data collection and surveillance practices that
may damage competition, consumer autonomy, and consumer privacy;  
          (ii)   unfair anticompetitive restrictions on third-party
repair or self-repair of items, such as the restrictions imposed by
powerful manufacturers that prevent farmers from repairing their own
equipment;  
          (iii)  unfair anticompetitive conduct or agreements in the
prescription drug industries, such as agreements to delay the market
entry of generic drugs or biosimilars;  
          (iv)   unfair competition in major Internet marketplaces;  
          (v)   unfair occupational licensing restrictions;  
          (vi)   unfair tying practices or exclusionary practices in the
brokerage or listing of real estate; and  
          (vii)  any other unfair industry-specific practices that
substantially inhibit competition.  
     (i)  The Secretary of Agriculture shall:  
           (i)    to address the unfair treatment of farmers and improve
conditions of competition in the markets for their products, consider
initiating a rulemaking or rulemakings under the Packers and Stockyards
Act to strengthen the Department of Agriculture’s regulations concerning
unfair, unjustly discriminatory, or deceptive practices and undue or
unreasonable preferences, advantages, prejudices, or disadvantages, with
the purpose of furthering the vigorous implementation of the law
established by the Congress in 1921 and fortified by amendments.  In
such rulemaking or rulemakings, the Secretary of Agriculture shall
consider, among other things:  
               (A)  providing clear rules that identify recurrent
practices in the livestock, meat, and poultry industries that are
unfair, unjustly discriminatory, or deceptive and therefore violate the
Packers and Stockyards Act;  
               (B)  reinforcing the long-standing Department of
Agriculture interpretation that it is unnecessary under the Packers and
Stockyards Act to demonstrate industry-wide harm to establish
a violation of the Act and that the “unfair, unjustly discriminatory, or
deceptive” treatment of one farmer, the giving to one farmer of an
“undue or unreasonable preference or advantage,” or the subjection of
one farmer to an “undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any
respect” violates the Act;  
               (C)  prohibiting unfair practices related to grower
ranking systems — systems in which the poultry companies, contractors,
or dealers exercise extraordinary control over numerous inputs that
determine the amount farmers are paid and require farmers to assume the
risk of factors outside their control, leaving them more economically
vulnerable;  
               (D)  updating the appropriate definitions or set of
criteria, or application thereof, for undue or unreasonable preferences,
advantages, prejudices, or disadvantages under the Packers and
Stockyards Act; and  
               (E)  adopting, to the greatest extent possible and as
appropriate and consistent with applicable law, appropriate
anti-retaliation protections, so that farmers may assert their rights
without fear of retribution;  
          (ii)   to ensure consumers have accurate, transparent labels
that enable them to choose products made in the United States, consider
initiating a rulemaking to define the conditions under which the
labeling of meat products can bear voluntary statements indicating that
the product is of United States origin, such as “Product of USA”;  
          (iii)  to ensure that farmers have greater opportunities to
access markets and receive a fair return for their products, not later
than 180 days after the date of this order, submit a report to the Chair
of the White House Competition Council, with a plan to promote
competition in the agricultural industries and to support value-added
agriculture and alternative food distribution systems through such means
as:  
               (A)  the creation or expansion of useful information for
farmers, such as model contracts, to lower transaction costs and help
farmers negotiate fair deals;  
               (B)  measures to encourage improvements in transparency
and standards so that consumers may choose to purchase products that
support fair treatment of farmers and agricultural workers and
sustainable agricultural practices;  
               (C)  measures to enhance price discovery, increase
transparency, and improve the functioning of the cattle and other
livestock markets;  
               (D)  enhanced tools, including any new legislative
authorities needed, to protect whistleblowers, monitor agricultural
markets, and enforce relevant laws;  
                 (E)  any investments or other support that could
bolster competition within highly concentrated agricultural markets;
and  
                 (F)  any other means that the Secretary of Agriculture
deems appropriate;  
          (iv)   to improve farmers’ and smaller food processors’ access
to retail markets, not later than 300 days after the date of this order,
in consultation with the Chair of the FTC, submit a report to the Chair
of the White House Competition Council, on the effect of retail
concentration and retailers’ practices on the conditions of competition
in the food industries, including any practices that may violate the
Federal Trade Commission Act, the Robinson-Patman Act (Public Law
74-692, 49 Stat. 1526, 15 U.S.C. 13 *et seq.*), or other relevant laws,
and on grants, loans, and other support that may enhance access to
retail markets by local and regional food enterprises; and  
          (v)    to help ensure that the intellectual property system,
while incentivizing innovation, does not also unnecessarily reduce
competition in seed and other input markets beyond that reasonably
contemplated by the Patent Act (*see* 35 U.S.C. 100 *et seq.* and 7
U.S.C. 2321 *et seq.*), in consultation with the Under Secretary of
Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States
Patent and Trademark Office, submit a report to the Chair of the White
House Competition Council, enumerating and describing any relevant
concerns of the Department of Agriculture and strategies for addressing
those concerns across intellectual property, antitrust, and other
relevant laws.  
     (j)  To protect the vibrancy of the American markets for beer,
wine, and spirits, and to improve market access for smaller,
independent, and new operations, the Secretary of the Treasury, in
consultation with the Attorney General and the Chair of the FTC, not
later than 120 days after the date of this order, shall submit a report
to the Chair of the White House Competition Council, assessing the
current market structure and conditions of competition, including an
assessment of any threats to competition and barriers to new entrants,
including:  
          (i)    any unlawful trade practices in the beer, wine, and
spirits markets, such as certain exclusionary, discriminatory, or
anticompetitive distribution practices, that hinder smaller and
independent businesses or new entrants from distributing their
products;  
          (ii)   patterns of consolidation in production, distribution,
or retail beer, wine, and spirits markets; and  
          (iii)  any unnecessary trade practice regulations of matters
such as bottle sizes, permitting, or labeling that may unnecessarily
inhibit competition by increasing costs without serving any public
health, informational, or tax purpose.  
     (k)  To follow up on the foregoing assessment, the Secretary of the
Treasury, through the Administrator of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and
Trade Bureau, shall, not later than 240 days after the date of this
order, consider:  
          (i)    initiating a rulemaking to update the Alcohol and
Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s trade practice regulations;    
          (ii)   rescinding or revising any regulations of the beer,
wine, and spirits industries that may unnecessarily inhibit competition;
and  
          (iii)  reducing any barriers that impede market access for
smaller and independent brewers, winemakers, and distilleries.  
     (l)  To promote competition, lower prices, and a vibrant and
innovative telecommunications ecosystem, the Chair of the Federal
Communications Commission is encouraged to work with the rest of the
Commission, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to
consider:  
          (i)    adopting through appropriate rulemaking “Net
Neutrality” rules similar to those previously adopted under title II of
the Communications Act of 1934 (Public Law 73-416, 48 Stat. 1064, 47
U.S.C. 151 *et seq.*), as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996,
in “Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet,” 80 Fed. Reg. 19738
(Apr. 13, 2015);  
          (ii)   conducting future spectrum auctions under rules that
are designed to help avoid excessive concentration of spectrum license
holdings in the United States, so as to prevent spectrum stockpiling,
warehousing of spectrum by licensees, or the creation of barriers to
entry, and to improve the conditions of competition in industries that
depend upon radio spectrum, including mobile communications and
radio-based broadband services;  
          (iii)  providing support for the continued development and
adoption of 5G Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) protocols and software,
continuing to attend meetings of voluntary and consensus-based standards
development organizations, so as to promote or encourage a fair and
representative standard-setting process, and undertaking any other
measures that might promote increased openness, innovation, and
competition in the markets for 5G equipment;  
          (iv)   prohibiting unjust or unreasonable early termination
fees for end-user communications contracts, enabling consumers to more
easily switch providers;  
          (v)    initiating a rulemaking that requires broadband service
providers to display a broadband consumer label, such as that as
described in the Public Notice of the Commission issued on April 4, 2016
(DA 16–357), so as to give consumers clear, concise, and accurate
information regarding provider prices and fees, performance, and network
practices;  
          (vi)   initiating a rulemaking to require broadband service
providers to regularly report broadband price and subscription rates to
the Federal Communications Commission for the purpose of disseminating
that information to the public in a useful manner, to improve price
transparency and market functioning; and  
          (vii)  initiating a rulemaking to prevent landlords and cable
and Internet service providers from inhibiting tenants’ choices among
providers.  
     (m)  The Secretary of Transportation shall:  
          (i)    to better protect consumers and improve competition,
and as appropriate and consistent with applicable law:  
               (A)  not later than 30 days after the date of this order,
appoint or reappoint members of the Advisory Committee for Aviation
Consumer Protection to ensure fair representation of consumers, State
and local interests, airlines, and airports with respect to the
evaluation of aviation consumer protection programs and convene a
meeting of the Committee as soon as practicable;  
               (B)  promote enhanced transparency and consumer
safeguards, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, including
through potential rulemaking, enforcement actions, or guidance
documents, with the aims of:  
                     (1)  enhancing consumer access to airline flight
information so that consumers can more easily find a broader set of
available flights, including by new or lesser known airlines; and  
                     (2)  ensuring that consumers are not exposed or
subject to advertising, marketing, pricing, and charging of ancillary
fees that may constitute an unfair or deceptive practice or an unfair
method of competition;  
               (C)  not later than 45 days after the date of this order,
