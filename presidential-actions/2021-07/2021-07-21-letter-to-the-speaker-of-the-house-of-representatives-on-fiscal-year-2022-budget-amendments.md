title: Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives on Fiscal Year 2022 Budget
  Amendments
---
 
Dear Madam Speaker:

I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 Budget
amendments for the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Education,
Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban
Development, Justice, Labor, and State, and for the District of Columbia
and the United States Agency for International Development.  These
amendments are necessary to correctly reflect policies assumed in my FY
2022 Budget.  The net discretionary budget authority in my FY 2022
Budget would increase by $5 million as a result of these technical
corrections.  
  
The details of these amendments are set forth in the enclosed letter
from the Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget.  
  
                              

Sincerely,  
  
                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
