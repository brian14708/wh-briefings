title: Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to Mali
---
 
On July 26, 2019, by Executive Order 13882, the President declared a
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq*.) to deal with the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the
United States constituted by the situation in Mali.

The situation in Mali, including repeated violations of ceasefire
arrangements made pursuant to the 2015 Agreement on Peace and
Reconciliation in Mali; the expansion of terrorist activities into
southern and central Mali; the intensification of drug trafficking and
trafficking in persons, human rights abuses, and hostage-taking; and the
intensification of attacks against civilians, the Malian defense and
security forces, the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated
Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), and international security
presences, continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the
national security and foreign policy of the United States.  For this
reason, the national emergency declared on July 26, 2019, must continue
in effect beyond July 26, 2021.  Therefore, in accordance with section
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am
continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order
13882 with respect to the situation in Mali.

This notice shall be published in the *Federal Register* and transmitted
to the Congress.          

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
July 20, 2021.
