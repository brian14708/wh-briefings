title: "Executive Order on the Termination of Emergency With Respect To the Situation\
  \ in\_Burundi"

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the
laws of the United States of America, including the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq*.), the National
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq*.) (NEA), section 212(f) of the
Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)), and section
301 of title 3, United States Code,

I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, find
that the situation that gave rise to the declaration of a national
emergency in Executive Order 13712 of November 22, 2015 (Blocking
Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Burundi),
with respect to the situation in Burundi, including the killing of and
violence against civilians, unrest, incitement of imminent violence, and
significant political repression, which threatened the peace, security,
and stability of Burundi, has been significantly altered by events of
the past year, including the transfer of power following elections in
2020, significantly decreased violence, and President Ndayishimiye’s
pursuit of reforms across multiple sectors.  Accordingly, I hereby
terminate the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13712, and
revoke that order, and further order:

Section 1.  In light of the revocation of Executive Order 13712, the
suspension of entry as immigrants and nonimmigrants of individuals
meeting the criteria set forth in section 1(a) of that order will no
longer be in effect as of the date of this order and such individuals
will no longer be treated as persons covered by Presidential
Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens
Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International
Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions).

Sec. 2.  Pursuant to section 202(a) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1622(a)),
termination of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13712
shall not affect any action taken or proceeding pending not finally
concluded or determined as of the date of this order, any action or
proceeding based on any act committed prior to the date of this order,
or any rights or duties that matured or penalties that were incurred
prior to the date of this order.

Sec. 3.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or
otherwise affect:  
          (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department
or agency, or the head thereof; or  
          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.  
     (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law
and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
     (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

THE WHITE HOUSE,  
November 18, 2021.
