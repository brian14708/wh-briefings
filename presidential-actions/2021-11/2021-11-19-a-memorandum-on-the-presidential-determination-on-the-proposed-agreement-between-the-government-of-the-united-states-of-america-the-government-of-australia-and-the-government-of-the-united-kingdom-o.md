Presidential Determination  
No.       2022-05          

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF ENERGY  
  
SUBJECT:       Presidential Determination on the Proposed Agreement
between the Government of the United States of America, the Government
of Australia, and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland for the Exchange of Naval Nuclear Propulsion
Information  
  
I have reviewed and concur in the positions taken in your memorandum of
November 15, 2021, recommending approval of a proposed Agreement between
the Government of the United States of America, the Government of
Australia, and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland for the Exchange of Naval Nuclear Propulsion
Information (the “Agreement”).  I note your recommendation and concur
with your assessment that Australia and the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, by participating with the United States
pursuant to international arrangements, are making substantial and
material contributions to the mutual defense and security.  The
Agreement will permit cooperation, which will further improve our mutual
defense posture and support our interests under the North Atlantic
Treaty; the Australia, New Zealand, and United States Security Treaty;
and the enhanced trilateral security partnership among the three Parties
known as “AUKUS.”   
  
I hereby approve the Agreement, determine that performance of the
Agreement will promote and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to
the common defense and security, and authorize the execution of the
Agreement by the United States Government in a manner specified by the
Secretary of State.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
