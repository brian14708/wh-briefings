title: A Proclamation on Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Certain
  Additional Persons Who Pose a Risk of Transmitting Coronavirus Disease 2019
---
 
The national emergency caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
outbreak in the United States continues to pose a grave threat to our
health and security.  As of November 26, 2021, the United States has
experienced more than 47 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than
773,000 COVID-19 deaths.  It is the policy of my Administration to
implement science-based public health measures, across all areas of the
Federal Government, to act swiftly and aggressively to prevent further
spread of the disease.

On November 24, 2021, the Republic of South Africa informed the World
Health Organization (WHO) of a new B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant of
SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, that was detected in that
country.  On November 26, 2021, the WHO Technical Advisory Group on
SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution announced that B.1.1.529 constitutes a
variant of concern.  While new information is still emerging, the
profile of B.1.1.529 includes multiple mutations across the SARS-CoV-2
genome, some of which are concerning.  According to the WHO, preliminary
evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant,
as compared to other variants of concern.  Further, the WHO reports that
the number of cases of this variant appears to be increasing in almost
all provinces in the Republic of South Africa.  Based on these
developments, and in light of the extensive cross-border transit and
proximity in Southern Africa, the detection of B.1.1.529 cases in some
Southern African countries, and the lack of widespread genomic
sequencing in Southern Africa, the United States Government, including
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), within the
Department of Health and Human Services, has reexamined its policies on
international travel and concluded that further measures are required to
protect the public health from travelers entering the United States from
the Republic of Botswana, the Kingdom of Eswatini, the Kingdom of
Lesotho, the Republic of Malawi, the Republic of Mozambique, the
Republic of Namibia, the Republic of South Africa, and the Republic of
Zimbabwe.  In addition to these travel restrictions, the CDC shall
implement other mitigation measures for travelers departing from the
countries listed above and destined for the United States, as needed.

Given the recommendation of the CDC, working in close coordination with
the Department of Homeland Security, described above, I have determined
that it is in the interests of the United States to take action to
suspend and restrict the entry into the United States, as immigrants and
nonimmigrants, of noncitizens of the United States (“noncitizens”) who
were physically present within the Republic of Botswana, the Kingdom of
Eswatini, the Kingdom of Lesotho, the Republic of Malawi, the Republic
of Mozambique, the Republic of Namibia, the Republic of South Africa,
and the Republic of Zimbabwe during the 14-day period preceding their
entry or attempted entry into the United States.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States,
by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the
United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the
Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), and
section 301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby find that the
unrestricted entry into the United States of persons described in
section 1 of this proclamation would, except as provided for in section
2 of this proclamation, be detrimental to the interests of the
United States, and that their entry should be subject to certain
restrictions, limitations, and exceptions.  I therefore hereby proclaim
the following:

     Section 1.  Suspension and Limitation on Entry.  The entry into the
United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of noncitizens who were
physically present within the Republic of Botswana, the Kingdom of
Eswatini, the Kingdom of Lesotho, the Republic of Malawi, the Republic
of Mozambique, the Republic of Namibia, the Republic of South Africa,
and the Republic of Zimbabwe during the 14-day period preceding their
entry or attempted entry into the United States is hereby suspended and
limited subject to section 2 of this proclamation.    

     Sec. 2.  Scope of Suspension and Limitation on Entry.   
          (a)  Section 1 of this proclamation shall not apply to:  
               (i)     any lawful permanent resident of the
United States;  
               (ii)    any noncitizen national of the United States;  
               (iii)   any noncitizen who is the spouse of a U.S.
citizen or lawful permanent resident;  
               (iv)    any noncitizen who is the parent or legal
guardian of a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident, provided that
the U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident is unmarried and under the
age of 21;  
               (v)     any noncitizen who is the sibling of a U.S.
citizen or lawful permanent resident, provided that both are unmarried
and under the age of 21;  
               (vi)    any noncitizen who is the child, foster child, or
ward of a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident, or who is a
prospective adoptee seeking to enter the United States pursuant to the
IR-4 or IH-4 visa classifications;  
               (vii)   any noncitizen traveling at the invitation of the
United States Government for a purpose related to containment or
mitigation of the virus;  
               (viii)  any noncitizen traveling as a nonimmigrant
pursuant to a C-1, D, or C-1/D nonimmigrant visa as a crewmember or any
noncitizen otherwise traveling to the United States as air or sea
crew;  
               (ix)    any noncitizen  
                    (A)  seeking entry into or transiting the United
States pursuant to one of the following visas:  A-1, A-2, C-2, C-3 (as a

               (x)     any noncitizen who is a member of the U.S. Armed
Forces or who is a spouse or child of a member of the U.S. Armed
Forces;  
               (xi)    any noncitizen whose entry would further
important United States law enforcement objectives, as determined by the
Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or their
respective designees, based on a recommendation of the Attorney General
or his designee; or  
               (xii)   any noncitizen or group of noncitizens whose
entry would be in the national interest, as determined by the Secretary
of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or their designees.  
          (b)  Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to affect
any individual’s eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, or

regulations of the United States.  
  
     Sec. 3.  Implementation and Enforcement.  (a)  The Secretary of

traveling to the United States, to the extent permitted by law.  
          (c)  The Secretary of Homeland Security may establish
standards and procedures to ensure the application of this proclamation
at and between all United States ports of entry.  
          (d)  Where a noncitizen circumvents the application of
this proclamation through fraud, willful misrepresentation of a material
fact, or illegal entry, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall
consider prioritizing such noncitizen for removal.

     Sec. 4.  Relationship to Other Suspensions, Limitations, or
Restrictions on Entry.  Individuals described in section 2 of this

          (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department
or agency, or the head thereof; or  
          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office
of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.  
               (b)  This proclamation shall be implemented consistent
with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
               (c)  This proclamation is not intended to, and does not,

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of
