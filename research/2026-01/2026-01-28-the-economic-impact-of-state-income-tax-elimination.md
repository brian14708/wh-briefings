Executive Summary

For years, no-income-tax states like Texas, Tennessee, and Florida have
often led the pack in attracting and retaining residents looking to put
down roots where they do not have to split ownership over the fruits of
their labor with state government. In particular, of the 9 states that
currently have no personal income tax, 5 of them rank amongst the top 10
states in terms of GDP growth over the past decade and 4 of them rank
amongst the top 10 states in terms of net migration rates from other
states.<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a> At the other end of the
spectrum, high-income-tax states like California, New York, and New
Jersey have suffered a population exodus as people vote with their feet
and wallets. Perhaps seeing Texas, Tennessee, and Florida as models, an
increasing number of states with income taxes have indicated an interest
in transitioning away from the income tax through some combination of
belt-tightening and finding less damaging forms of tax collection.

This paper studies the economic impacts and feasibility of states
phasing out their income tax. Recognizing that states have to collect
tax revenue *somehow*, the analysis here studies two different
scenarios. In the first scenario, the state pursues full revenue
replacement by broadening the sales tax, leaving the baseline forecasted
growth of total tax revenue unchanged. In the second scenario, the
reform combines a broader sales tax base with a limit on spending
*growth* that maintains government services at current levels instead of
allowing their continued expansion.

The quantitative analysis in this paper is done on an individual
state-by-state level, studying the impact of these two reform scenarios
on key economic outcomes like GDP, wages, business startup activity, and
the migration of high-income taxpayers. This paper also reports the
sales tax rate needed to accomplish the reform under each scenario (base
broadening only; base broadening coupled with spending growth limits).

Key insights distilled from the economics literature include:

-   Income taxes are more economically damaging than sales or property
    taxes;
-   The harmful economic effects of state income taxes include
    outmigration, brain drain, stifled innovation and entrepreneurship,
    and reduced GDP;
-   The harmful fiscal effects of state income taxes include revenue
    volatility with “feast and famine” cycles, with states often gaining
    little or no new tax revenue from income tax hikes because of the
    negative economic effects they unleash.

Key findings from CEA’s analysis of state income tax phase-outs include:

-   A 1 to 1.6 percent increase in the level of GDP for the average
    state;
-   A 16 to 19 percent increase in new startups for the average state;
-   A $4,000 increase in the average wage;
-   A significant influx of new high-income taxpayers;
-   An average state sales tax rate of under 8 percent under full
    revenue replacement with no limits on spending growth;
-   An average state sales tax rate of 6.2 percent under a scenario with
    spending growth limits.

Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Wyoming have no state
personal income tax of any sort.  Washington has no state personal
income tax except on capital gains for certain high earners.
