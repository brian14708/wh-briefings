Introduction

For centuries, most of the world’s economies grew at a similarly slow
rate. However, a “Great Divergence” occurred with the Industrial
Revolution, causing industrializing nations to accelerate their growth
relative to the rest of the world.<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a potentially transformative technology
that is often compared to the Industrial Revolution.

However, we are witnessing clear leaders in AI investment, performance,
and adoption metrics across different nations. The Trump administration
is laying the groundwork for American AI dominance by accelerating
innovation, infrastructure development, and deregulation while
establishing global dominance through technology exports. If the AI
revolution is as transformative as the Industrial Revolution, should we
expect this to lead to a second Great Divergence? Of course, the future
impact of AI is uncertain, so in this paper we focus on the empirical
data that can be seen and measured today.

We begin by reviewing analyses of the potential for AI-led economic
growth (Section 2) and then discussing estimates of AI’s impact on both
GDP and the labor force. Recognizing that these impacts are uncertain
and thus need constant monitoring, in Section 3 we highlight metrics for
tracking the breakneck pace of investment, performance, and adoption of
AI. We then discuss how different countries are faring on these metrics
(Section 4). The incredible speed of change cannot be overstated; many
of these metrics are doubling every few months and increasing manyfold
each year. This means that the AI of the future will likely be very
different from the AI of today. We conclude by reviewing the actions
President Trump is taking to ensure that America continues to lead on AI
(Section 5). As the President said: “America is the country that started
the AI race. And as President of the United States, I’m here today to
declare that America is going to win
it.”<a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a>
