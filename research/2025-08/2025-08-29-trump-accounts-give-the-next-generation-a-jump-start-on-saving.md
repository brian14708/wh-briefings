Overview

-   The One Big Beautiful Bill permits Trump Accounts to be established
    for American children who have not reached age 18. 
-   An American child born after December 31, 2024 and before January 1,
    2029 for whom a Trump Account is established will receive an initial
    $1,000 deposit from the government, with the potential for parents
    to contribute up to an additional $5,000 per year initially.
    -   Employers may make an annual contribution of up to $2,500 to a
        Trump Account and that contribution will not impact the
        employee’s taxable income.
-   CEA estimates that, under a scenario of average returns on the U.S.
    stock market, Trump Account balance for a baby born in 2026 will be:
    -   $303,800 by age 18 and $1,091,900 by age 28 if maximum
        contributions are made.
    -   $5,800 by age 18 and $18,100 by age 28 if no contributions are
        made.
