Executive Summary

Amidst changes in the composition of US capital markets and the US
retirement system towards private markets and defined contribution
plans, this paper studies the implications of broadening retail investor
access to “alternative investments” through defined contribution plans.
The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) finds that:

-   Defined contribution (DC) plan allocation to alternative investments
    can have significant benefits to plan participants (retail
    investors), fund managers, private companies (including small
    businesses), financial markets, and the real economy.
-   DC plan participants would benefit from diversification, higher
    risk-adjusted returns, and higher retirement income. Fund managers
    and private companies would benefit from access to a large, growing,
    diversified, and stickier capital base. Financial markets would
    benefit from enhanced liquidity and price discovery. These benefits
    would translate to a higher GDP.
-   Across all age cohorts, we find that an allocation to private equity
    enhances portfolio risk-adjusted return (Sharpe ratio) and increases
    retirement wealth for defined contribution plan participants.
-   Younger cohorts benefit more relative to older cohorts from an
    allocation to private equity. The two youngest cohorts see around a
    2.5 percent increase in annuitized lifetime income while the gain to
    the two oldest cohorts is closer to roughly 0.5 to 1 percent.
-   Overall, we estimate that retail investor access to private equity
    through defined contribution plans can result in a GDP benefit of up
    to $35 billion, or 0.12 percent of GDP. This estimate quantifies the
    benefit from expanding access to private equity only; there may be
    an additional benefit from expanding access to other forms of
    alternative investments such as hedge funds or venture capital.
