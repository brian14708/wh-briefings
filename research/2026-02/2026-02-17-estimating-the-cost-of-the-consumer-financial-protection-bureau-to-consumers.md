Key Takeaways

-   The regulatory burden imposed by the Consumer Financial Protection
    Bureau (CFPB) has increased the compliance and liability costs
    associated with consumer financial products, which financial
    institutions pass on to consumers in the form of higher prices and
    reduced product offerings. **The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA)
    estimates that since 2011, the CFPB has cost consumers between
    $237-$369 billion, including fiscal costs, increased borrowing
    expenses, and reduced originations.**
-   Of the total above, CEA finds that increased borrowing costs amount
    to at least **$222-$350 billion**<sup>\[1\]</sup> ($160-253 per
    borrower) from the CFPB’s inception in 2011 through 2024.
    -   Broken down by loan type, the CFPB’s rulemaking has cost
        consumers $116-$183 billion in higher mortgage costs
        ($1,100-$1,700 per originated loan), $32-$51 billion for auto
        loans ($91-$143 per loan), and $74-$116 billion for credit cards
        ($80-$126 per loan). These costs significantly surpass the
        CFPB’s reported $21 billion returned to consumers (about $15 per
        borrower).
-   In 2024 alone, the CEA estimates the combined annual cost of credit
    for mortgages, autos, and credit cards is between **$24-$38
    billion**.
-   CEA also estimates that the higher borrowing costs from CFPB
    policies significantly reduced loan originations, resulting in an
    economic efficiency loss of between **$1.5-$5.7 billion** to
    consumers.
-   The annual paperwork burden alone from CFPB rules exceeds **29
    million hours** or the equivalent of 14,100 full-time employees
    spending all of their time on documentation and reporting
    requirements at a conservative cost of just under $2.5 billion. From
    2011 to 2024, the Bureau’s paperwork burden costs have  cost
    businesses **$21 billion**.<sup>\[2\]</sup>
-   The CFPB has received $8.9 billion in total transfers from the
    Federal Reserve between 2011 and 2024 when adjusted for inflation.
    Since funds transferred to the CFPB would otherwise have been
    transferred to the US Treasury, the lost revenue results in a
    marginal excess tax burden (METB) of $4.4 billion. Taken together,
    the fiscal cost of the CFPB since inception is over **$13 billion**.
