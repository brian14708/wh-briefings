Summary

State and local economic conditions and policies lead to deviations in
inflation from the national average. For example, if local housing
supply is relatively inelastic, then monetary or fiscal expansions
translate more into local price increases than into quantities
increases, generating more inflation in housing rents than in otherwise
similar locations with more elastic supply.

This report documents that across various measures of inflation,
aggregation, and political categorization, liberal states as well as
cities inside liberal states have observed higher inflation rates in the
past year than their conservative counterparts.
