title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Ensures Military Excellence and Readiness'

**PRIORITIZING SERVICEMEMBER INTEGRITY, LETHALITY, AND HEALTH:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order directing the
Department of Defense to update its guidance regarding trans-identifying
medical standards for military service and to rescind guidance
inconsistent with military readiness.

-   The Executive Order will require the Secretary of Defense to do the
    following:

        all Department of Defense medical standards to ensure they
        prioritize readiness and lethality.</span>
    -   Take action to end the use of invented and identification-based
        pronouns in the Department of Defense.
-   The Executive Order also prohibits males from using or sharing
    sleeping, changing, or bathing in facilities designated for females.
-   The provisions in the Executive Order also apply to the Coast Guard.
-   The Executive Order revokes Biden Administration Executive Order
    14004 and all policies, directives, and guidance pursuant to that
    order.
    -   Executive Order 14004 called for accommodating “gender identity”
        in the military—to the detriment of military readiness and unit
        cohesion.

**RESTORING SANITY IN OUR MILITARY:** During the Biden Administration,
the Department of Defense allowed gender insanity to pervade our
military organizations, family, and culture. This included not only
permitting the military to increase the number of individuals not
physically or mentally prepared to serve, but also ordering the
Department of Defense to pay for servicemembers’ transition surgeries,
as well as those of their dependent children—at a cost of millions of
dollars to the American taxpayer.

-   The United States imposes rigorous standards on all military
    servicemembers to ensure they are prepared to take on the challenges
    required of them.

        military members are able to deploy, fight, and win.</span>
    -   <span
        style="background-color: var(--wp--preset--color--white);color: var(--wp--preset--color--charcoal);font-family: var(--wp--custom--typography--body--font-family);font-size: var(--wp--custom--typography--body--font-size);font-weight: var(--wp--custom--typography--body--font-weight);letter-spacing: var(--wp--custom--typography--body--letter-spacing);text-transform: var(--wp--custom--typography--body--text-transform)">On
        the battlefield there can be no accommodation for anything less
        than resilience, strength, and the ability to withstand
        extraordinary physical demands.</span>
    -   Individuals who are unable to meet these requirements are unable
        to serve in the military. This has been the case for decades.
-   Unit cohesion requires high levels of integrity and stability among
    servicemembers.
    -   <span
        style="background-color: var(--wp--preset--color--white);color: var(--wp--preset--color--charcoal);font-family: var(--wp--custom--typography--body--font-family);font-size: var(--wp--custom--typography--body--font-size);font-weight: var(--wp--custom--typography--body--font-weight);letter-spacing: var(--wp--custom--typography--body--letter-spacing);text-transform: var(--wp--custom--typography--body--text-transform)">It
        can take a minimum of 12 months for an individual to complete
        treatments after transition surgery, which often involves the
        use of heavy narcotics.</span>
    -   During this period, they are not physically capable of meeting
        military readiness requirements and require ongoing medical
        care. This is not conducive for deployment or other readiness
        requirements.

**A LETHAL FIGHTING FORCE:** President Trump’s priority to have a ready,
able, and lethal military will remain a core tenant of his second term.

-   During his first term in 2018, President Trump’s Department of
    Defense took action to ensure trans-identifying servicemembers did
    not serve in capacities that undermined unit cohesion and lethality.
