title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Delivers Emergency Price Relief for
  American Families to Defeat the Cost-of-Living Crisis'
---
 
DELIVERING EMERGENCY PRICE RELIEF: Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed a Presidential Memorandum to deliver emergency price relief for
American families and defeat the cost-of-living crisis.

-   The Presidential Memorandum recognizes a critical component of the
    crushing cost of everyday living. The Biden Administration imposed
    complex regulatory burdens and radical policies designed to weaken
    American production. 
-   President Trump is ordering all Federal agencies to untangle the
    American economy from Biden constraints and improve affordability of
    necessary goods and services and increase the prosperity of the
    American workers.
-   This includes action to:
    -   Drastically lower the cost of housing and expand housing supply;

    <!-- -->

    -   Eliminate unnecessary administrative expenses and rent-seeking
        practices that drive up healthcare costs;

    <!-- -->

    -   Eliminate counterproductive requirements raising the costs of
        home appliances;

    <!-- -->

    -   Create employment opportunities for American workers including
        drawing discouraged workers into the labor force; and

    <!-- -->

    -   Eliminate harmful, coercive “climate” policies driving up the
        costs of food and fuel.

ENDING BIDEN’S WAR ON AFFORDABILITY: The Biden Administration’s
destructive policies inflicted an historic inflation crisis on the
American people. 

-   Hardworking families are overwhelmed today by the cost of fuel,
    food, housing, automobiles, medical care, utilities, and insurance.
-   Unprecedented regulatory oppression from the Biden Administration
    has imposed almost $50,000 in costs on the average American
    household, whereas President Trump’s first-term agenda reduced
    regulatory costs by almost $11,000 per household.
-   Americans are unable to purchase homes at historic rates, in part
    due to regulatory requirements that alone account for 25 percent of
    the cost of constructing a new home.
-   Biden’s assault on plentiful and reliable American energy through
    impossible, unnecessary, and illegal regulatory demands have driven
    up the cost of transportation and manufacturing.
    -   Biden’s war on energy has been a war on American consumers.
        American households are paying an average of $1,200 more per
        year in energy costs under President Biden’s policies. Since he
        took office, total energy costs rose by 36%, gasoline rose 41%,
        home energy costs rose 30%, electricity bills rose 29%, and gas
        bills rose 34%.

    <!-- -->

    -   After averaging just $2.77 per gallon under President Trump, and
        a price of $2.33 upon leaving office, the price of gasoline
        skyrocketed under President Biden, reaching $3.33 a year later.
        It went on to reach a peak at $5.00 per gallon and remains
        elevated today.  
-   The unlawful regulatory mandate on companies to eliminate
    gas-powered vehicles has resulted in artificial price increases in
    order to subsidize electric vehicles, largely disfavored by
    consumers.
