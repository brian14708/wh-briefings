REMOVING BARRIERS TO AMERICAN AI INNOVATION: Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed an Executive Order eliminating harmful Biden Administration
AI policies and enhancing America’s global AI dominance.

-   President Trump is fulfilling his promise to revoke Joe Biden’s
    dangerous Executive Order that hinders AI innovation and imposes
    onerous and unnecessary government control over the development of
    AI.
-   The Biden AI Executive Order established unnecessarily burdensome
    requirements for companies developing and deploying AI that would
    stifle private sector innovation and threaten American technological
    leadership.
-   Today’s executive order:
    -   Revokes the Biden AI Executive Order which hampered the private
        sector’s ability to innovate in AI by imposing government
        control over AI development and deployment.
    -   Calls for departments and agencies to revise or rescind all
        policies, directives, regulations, orders, and other actions
        taken under the Biden AI order that are inconsistent with
        enhancing America’s leadership in AI.

ENHANCING AMERICA’S AI LEADERSHIP: The United States must act decisively
to retain leadership in AI and enhance our economic and national
security.

-   This Executive Order establishes the commitment of the United States
    to sustain and enhance America’s dominance in AI to promote human
    flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security.
-   American development of AI systems must be free from ideological
    bias or engineered social agendas. With the right government
    policies, the United States can solidify its position as the leader
    in AI and secure a brighter future for all Americans.
    -   The order directs the development of an AI Action Plan to
        sustain and enhance America’s AI dominance, led by the Assistant
        to the President for Science & Technology, the White House AI &
        Crypto Czar, and the National Security Advisor.
    -   It further directs the White House to revise and reissue OMB AI
        memoranda to departments and agencies on the Federal
        Government’s acquisition and governance of AI to ensure that
        harmful barriers to America’s AI leadership are eliminated.

CONTINUING PRIORITIZATION OF AI: President Trump has made American
leadership in AI a priority and is now building on his actions during
his first administration.

-   President Trump signed the first-ever Executive Order on AI in 2019
    recognizing the paramount importance of American AI leadership to
    the economic and national security of the United States.
    -   In historic actions, the Trump Administration committed to
        [doubling AI research
        investment](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/president-trumps-fy-2021-budget-commits-double-investments-key-industries-future/),
        established the first-ever [national AI research
        institutes](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/articles/trump-administration-investing-1-billion-research-institutes-advance-industries-future/),
        strengthened American leadership in [AI technical
        standards](https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2019/08/10/ai_standards_fedengagement_plan_9aug2019.pdf),
        and issued the world’s first [AI regulatory
        guidance](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/articles/ai-that-reflects-american-values/)
        to govern AI development in the private sector.
-   President Trump also took executive action in 2020 to establish the
    first-ever guidance for Federal agency adoption of AI to more
    effectively deliver services to the American people and foster
    public trust in this critical technology.
-   Today’s Executive Order builds upon these past successes and clears
    a path for the United States to act decisively to retain leadership
    in AI, rooted in free speech and human flourishing.
