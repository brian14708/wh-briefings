title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Launches Massive 10-to-1 Deregulation
  Initiative'
---
 
**ELIMINATING 10 REGULATIONS FOR EACH NEW REGULATION ISSUED**: Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to unleash
prosperity through deregulation. 

-   The Order requires that whenever an agency promulgates a new rule,
    regulation, or guidance, it must identify at least 10 existing
    rules, regulations, or guidance documents to be repealed.  
-   The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will ensure
    standardized measurement and estimation of regulatory costs.
-   It requires that for fiscal year 2025, the total incremental cost of
    all new regulations, including repealed regulations, be
    significantly less than zero. 

**HALTING THE REGULATORY ONSLAUGHT**: President Trump will halt the job
killing and inflation-driving regulatory blitz of the Biden
Administration.

-   The Biden Administration imposed a historic $1.7 trillion in costs
    on the American people.
-   Overregulation stops American entrepreneurship, crushes small
    business, reduces consumer choice, discourages innovation, and
    infringes on the liberties of American citizens.
    -   It also contributes to the high cost of living, including by
        driving up energy prices.

**BUILDING ON PAST SUCCESS**:  President Trump’s first Administration
undertook the most aggressive and successful regulatory reduction effort
in history. 

-   In his first term, President Trump asked the agencies to eliminate
    two regulations for each one new regulation issued.  Not only was
    this 2-for-1 goal achieved, the first Trump Administration
    eliminated five and a half regulations for everyone new regulation
    issued. 
-   This Executive Order builds on President Trump’s previous success to
    improve daily lives of the American people by reducing unnecessary,
    burdensome, and costly Federal regulations.
