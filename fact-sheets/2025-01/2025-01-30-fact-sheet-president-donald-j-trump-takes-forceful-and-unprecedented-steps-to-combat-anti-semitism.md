title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Takes Forceful and Unprecedented Steps
  to Combat Anti-Semitism'

**COMBATING ANTI-SEMITISM IN THE UNITED STATES:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to Combat Anti-Semitism.

-   Expanding on his Executive Order 13899, President Trump’s new Order
    takes forceful and unprecedented steps to marshal all Federal
    resources to combat the explosion of anti-Semitism on our campuses
    and in our streets since October 7, 2023.
-   Every Federal executive department and agency leader will review and
    report to the White House within sixty days on *all* criminal and
    civil authorities and actions available for fighting anti-Semitism.
-   Immediate action will be taken by the Department of Justice to
    protect law and order, quell pro-Hamas vandalism and intimidation,
    and investigate and punish anti-Jewish racism in leftist,
    anti-American colleges and universities.
-   The Order demands the removal of resident aliens who violate our
    laws.

**GOING ON OFFENSE TO ENFORCE LAW AND ORDER AND TO PROTECT CIVIL
RIGHTS:** Immediately after the jihadist terrorist attacks against the
people of Israel on October 7, 2023, pro-Hamas aliens and left-wing
radicals began a campaign of intimidation, vandalism, and violence on
the campuses and streets of America.

-   Celebrating Hamas’ mass rape, kidnapping, and murder, they
    physically blocked Jewish Americans from attending college classes,
    obstructed synagogues and assaulted worshippers, and vandalized
    American monuments and statues.
-   The Biden Administration turned a blind eye to this coordinated
    assault on public order; it simply refused to protect the civil
    rights of Jewish Americans, especially students. According to a
    December 2024 [U.S. House of Representatives Staff
    Report](https://www.speaker.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/House-Antisemitism-Report.pdf)
    on anti-Semitism, “the failure of our federal government departments
    and agencies is astounding.”

**PRESIDENT TRUMP KEEPS HIS PROMISES AND BUILDS ON HIS SUCCESS:** In his
first term, President Trump kept his biggest promises:

-   He moved the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem: After decades
    of broken promises and despite much criticism, President Trump was
    the President who finally kept his commitment to Israel to move the
    American embassy from Tel-Aviv to Israel’s true and rightful
    capital: Jerusalem.
-   He established the Abraham Accords: President Trump delivered the
    greatest breakthrough for peace in the Middle East in decades by
    brokering the normalization of ties between Israel and the United
    Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco, protecting Israel and
    Jews and spreading security and prosperity to the entire region.

Now, President Trump has promised that the Federal Government will:

-   Protect the civil rights of our Jewish citizens: “My promise to
    Jewish Americans is this: With your vote, I will be your defender,
    your protector, and I will be the best friend Jewish Americans have
    ever had in the White House.”
-   Aggressively enforce the law, protect public order, and prosecute
    anti-Semitic crimes: “I will issue clear orders to my Attorney
    General to aggressively prosecute terroristic threats, arson,
    vandalism and violence against American Jews.”
-   Deport Hamas Sympathizers and Revoke Student Visas: “To all the
    resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you
    on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you. I
    will also quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers
    on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism like
    never before.”
