title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Declares a National Emergency at the
  Southern Border'
---
 
INVOKING A NATIONAL EMERGENCY: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed
an Executive Order invoking the National Emergencies Act regarding the
crisis at the Southern Border of the United States.

-   The Executive Order declares a national emergency at the southern
    border following four years of record-shattering illegal immigration
    into the U.S.
-   It directs the Secretary of Defense to deploy additional personnel
    to the border, including members of the Armed Forces and the
    National Guard.
-   Additionally, it directs the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland
    Security to finish the wall along the southern border and ensures
    that DHS has all the flexibility it needs to operate air missions
    near the border.

TAKING BACK CONTROL: For the past four years, the federal government has
abdicated its responsibility to enforce the border, resulting in a
catastrophic immigration crisis for the United States.

-   When States like Texas took steps to prevent illegal crossings into
    their state, the federal government sought to stop them by cutting
    down their barriers.
-   A record-shattering 8.72 million border encounters have occurred at
    the southern border from FY21-FY24, overwhelming border resources
    and endangering communities.
    -   This has led to untold hundreds of thousands of children being
        trafficked.  Roughly 550,000 unaccompanied alien children have
        been encountered at the border since FY21.  Fentanyl and other
        drugs are pouring over the border and flooding our communities,
        killing roughly 75,000 Americans in 2023—the number one cause of
        death for Americans ages 18-45.
    -   It has allowed dangerous gangs like the Venezuelan Tren de
        Aragua to takeover and terrorize entire American cities.
    -   And it has led to the murders of innocent Americans like Laken
        Riley, Jocelyn Nungaray, Rachel Morin, and many others.

BUILDING ON PAST SUCCESS: America is in a dire situation, and it is past
time for the government to act. President Trump first declared an
emergency at the Southern Border on February 15, 2019, and continued
that emergency on <span style="text-decoration: underline">February 13,
2020.</span>

-   Following the at-the-time historic surges of illegal aliens in 2018,
    President Trump declared a national emergency and successfully
    reduced the number of people seeking to enter the country illegally.
-   In 2024, President Trump promised to declare an emergency to secure
    the border and use the military where necessary to protect Americans
    from foreign threats.
-   This Executive Order will allow the government to gain operational
    control of the border, combat the cartels, and secure our nation.
-   As President Trump described in 2018: “Illegal immigration affects
    the lives of all Americans. Illegal immigration hurts American
    workers; burdens American taxpayers; and undermines public safety;
    and places enormous strain on local schools, hospitals, and
    communities in general, taking precious resources away from the
    poorest Americans who need them most. Illegal immigration costs our
    country billions and billions of dollars each year…And I will
    therefore take every lawful action at my disposal to address this
    crisis. And that’s what we’re doing.”
