title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Expands Educational Opportunities for
  American Families'
---
 
**DEFENDING PARENTAL RIGHTS AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order expanding
educational freedom and opportunity for families. It recognizes that
parents, not the government, play a fundamental role in choosing and
directing the upbringing and education of their children.

-   It directs the Department of Education to issue guidance on how the
    States can use federal funding formulas to support their K-12
    scholarship programs.
-   It directs the Secretary of Education to prioritize school choice
    programs in the Department’s discretionary grant programs.
-   The Order requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
    issue guidance on how states receiving block grants for children and
    families can use those funds to support educational alternatives,
    including private and faith-based options.
-   It directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a plan to the
    President for how military families can use Department of Defense
    funds to send their children to the school of their choice.
-   The Order also directs the Secretary of the Interior to submit a
    plan to the President for how families with students attending
    Bureau of Indian Education schools can use federal funds to send
    their children to the school of their choice.

**EMPOWERING PARENTS AND STUDENTS THROUGH SCHOOL CHOICE:** Every child
deserves the best education available, regardless of their zip code.
However, for generations, our government-assigned education system has
failed millions of parents, students, and teachers. This Executive Order
begins to rectify that wrong by opening up opportunities for students to
attend the school that best fits their needs.

-   According to the latest National Assessment of Educational Progress
    (NAEP), 70% of 8th graders were below proficient in reading and 72%
    were below proficient in math. 40% of 4th graders did not even meet
    the basic reading levels. 
-   Standardized test scores have essentially been flat for over 30
    years, despite hundreds of billions of dollars spent on
    government-run education.
-   A dozen states have universal or near universal school choice
    programs and 33 states have some form of school choice program.
-   School choice programs have a strong record of improving students’
    academic performance.
-   School choice has proven to be cost effective and saves taxpayer
    dollars.
-   Parents report higher levels of school safety for their children who
    participate in school choice programs.
-   Support for school choice is overwhelming, with 70% of Democrats,
    73% of Black Americans, and 69% of Hispanic Americans in favor of
    it.
-   President Trump is dedicated to ensuring every child has the
    opportunity to receive a world-class education.

**FULFILLING THE PROMISE TO STRENGTHEN EDUCATION THROUGH FREEDOM AND
OPPORTUNITY:** President Trump promised to bring school choice to every
family in the Nation. Today’s historic executive order is a critical
step in delivering on that promise, and builds on the long list of
accomplishments from the first Trump Administration, including:

-   Calling on Congress to pass the School Choice Now Act and the
    Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunity Act.
-   Providing in-person learning options for low-income parents forced
    to send their children to virtual school during the pandemic.
-   Re-authorizing the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship program twice.
-   Investing nearly $1.5 billion in the development of public charter
    schools, helping this innovative sector grow to 7,500 charter
    schools serving more than 3 million students.
-   Allowing parents across the nation to withdraw up to $10,000
    tax-free per year from 529 education savings plans to cover public,
    private, or religious K-12 schooling costs, thanks to the
    President’s historic tax cuts.

Parents can be confident that under his Administration, President Trump
will provide every available opportunity for parents to enrich the
education of their children through individual choice.
