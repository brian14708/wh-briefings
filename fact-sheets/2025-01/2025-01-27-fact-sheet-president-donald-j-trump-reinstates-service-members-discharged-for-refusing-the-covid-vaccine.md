title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Reinstates Service Members Discharged
  for Refusing the COVID Vaccine'
---
 
**RESINSTATING THE UNJUSTLY DISCHARGED:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed an Executive Order to reinstate service members who were
dismissed for refusing the COVID vaccine, with full back pay and
benefits.

-   The Executive Order directs the Secretary of Defense to reinstate
    all members of the military (active and reserve) who were discharged
    for refusing the COVID vaccine and who request to be reinstated.
    -   Those who are reinstated will receive their former rank and full
        back pay with benefits.

**CORRECTING AN INJUSTICE:** In spite of the scientific evidence, the
Biden Administration discharged healthy service members—many of whom had
natural immunity and dedicated their entire lives to serving our
country—for refusing the COVID vaccine. Government redress of these
wrongful dismissals is overdue.

-   From 2021 to 2023, the Biden Administration and former Secretary of
    Defense Lloyd Austin discharged over 8,000 troops solely due to
    their COVID-19 vaccination status.

        dismissals likely had a chilling effect on recruitment, with the
        Department of Defense missing its collective recruiting targets
        by around 41,000 recruits in FY2023.</span>
    -   After the vaccine mandate was repealed in 2023, only 43 of the
        more than the 8,000 troops dismissed elected to return to
        service under the Biden Administration and Secretary Austin.

**CHARTING A NEW COURSE FORWARD:** In 2024, President Trump declared
that “there should have never been a \[COVID vaccine\] mandate. That
should have never happened.” 

-   President Trump went on to lament that, due to the mandate, “we’ve
    lost some of our best people in the military too.”
-   President Trump duly promised in 2024 that he “will rehire every
    patriot who was fired from the military with…backpay. They will get
    their backpay…”
