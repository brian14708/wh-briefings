  and Safety within the Federal Aviation Administration'

FLIGHTS SHOULD BE SUPERVISED BY THE BEST EMPLOYEES: President Donald J.
Trump has signed a Presidential Memorandum terminating a Biden
Administration Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) hiring policy that
prioritized diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) over safety and
efficiency.

-   This Presidential Memorandum orders the Secretary of Transportation
    and FAA Administrator to immediately stop Biden DEI hiring programs
    and return to non-discriminatory, merit-based hiring.
-   It also requires the FAA Administrator to review the past
    performance and performance standards of all FAA employees in
    critical safety positions and make clear that any individual who
    fails to demonstrate adequate capability is replaced by someone who
    will ensure Americans’ flight safety and efficiency.

MILLIONS OF AMERICANS RELY ON SAFE, TIMELY AIR TRAVEL EVERY DAY: Safety
and competence should be the only job criteria for FAA employees, yet
the Biden Administration violated the public trust—as well as the law—by
prioritizing illegal DEI hiring.

-   Every day, more than 45,000 flights and 2.9 million airline
    passengers traveling for work or fun or to visit friends and family
    entrust their lives to the FAA.
-   Almost unbelievably, as a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)
    initiative, the Biden FAA specifically recruited and hired
    individuals with “severe intellectual” disabilities, psychiatric
    issues, and complete paralysis over other individuals who sought to
    work for the FAA.
-   President Trump is immediately terminating this illegal and
    dangerous program and requiring that all FAA hiring be based solely
    on ensuring the safety of airline passengers and overall job
    excellence.
    -   On January 11, 2023, two weeks after a major holiday airline
        crisis, an FAA system outage caused by employees missteps
        grounded all flights for the first time since 9/11, an
        illustration of the importance of FAA competence.

FULFILLING PROMISE TO END ILLEGAL DISCRIMINATION AND BRING BACK COMMON
SENSE: This Presidential Memorandum builds on President Trump’s day-one
Executive Order ending the Biden Administration’s illegal and immoral
DEI discrimination programs.

-   In his inaugural address, President Trump promised: ““We will forge
    a society that is colorblind and merit-based.”

President Trump stated in his January 20, 2025 Executive Order on Ending
Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing:
“Americans deserve a government committed to serving every person with
equal dignity and respect, and to expending precious taxpayer resources
only on making America great.”
