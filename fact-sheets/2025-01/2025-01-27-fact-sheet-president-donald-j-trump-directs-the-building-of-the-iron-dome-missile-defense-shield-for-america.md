  Missile Defense Shield for America'

**DEFEND THE UNITED STATES AGAINST MISSILE ATTACK**: Today, President
Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to Build the Iron Dome for
America.

-   The Executive Order directs implementation of a next-generation
    missile defense shield for the United States against ballistic,
    hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation
    aerial attacks.

        the goal of providing for the common defense of American
        citizens, this Order accelerates the development and deployment
        of Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor Layers,
        proliferated space-based interceptors, a Proliferated Warfighter
        Space Architecture, capabilities to defeat salvoes prior to
        launch, non-kinetic missile defense capabilities, and underlayer
        and terminal-phase intercept capabilities.</span>
    -   It also secures the supply chains for all components of the Iron
        Dome.
-   The Executive Order directs a review of theater missile defense
    posture to defend United States troops deployed abroad and an
    increase in cooperation on missile defense technology development,
    capabilities, and operations with partners and allies. 

**ADDRESSING VULNERABILITIES BY MODERNIZING AN OUTDATED SYSTEM**:

-   The threat of attack by ballistic, cruise, and hypersonic missiles
    remains a catastrophic threat facing the United States.
-   Over the past 40 years, rather than lessening, the threat from
    next-generation strategic weapons—including hypersonic—has become
    more complex with the development of next-generation delivery
    systems by our adversaries.
-   Notwithstanding this increasing threat, United States homeland
    missile defense policy has been limited to staying ahead of rogue
    nation threats and accidental or unauthorized missile launches.

**THE IRON DOME WILL FURTHER THE GOALS OF PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH**: By
empowering the United States with a second-strike capability, the Iron
Dome will deter adversaries from attacks on the homeland.

-   President Trump is fulfilling his promises: “I will direct our
    military to begin construction of the great Iron Dome missile
    defense shield, which will be made all in the USA.”
