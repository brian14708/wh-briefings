  in Science and Technology'
---
 
RENEWING AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IN CRITICAL AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES:
Today, President Donald J. Trump announced the establishment of the
President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) to
spearhead American innovation and competitiveness in critical and
emerging technologies.

-   PCAST will include up to 24 members, with representation from
    leading American scientists and technologists from industry,
    academia, and government.
-   The Assistant to the President for Science and Technology and the
    White House A.I. and Crypto Czar will co-chair PCAST.
-   PCAST will provide advice and evidence-based recommendations to the
    President to ensure that policies are informed by the latest
    scientific discoveries and technological advancements.
-   This council will champion bold investments in innovation, the
    elimination of bureaucratic barriers, and actions to help the United
    States remain the world’s premier hub for scientific and
    technological breakthroughs.

FOCUSING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ON EXCELLENCE: President Trump is
refocusing science and technology policy to emphasize results-driven
excellence and merit-based achievement.

-   The United States must leverage its pioneering spirit to lead in
    transformative science and technology, reshaping industries and
    securing the nation’s leadership.
-   The pursuit of scientific truth is under threat from ideological
    agendas that prioritize group identity over individual merit,
    enforce conformity at the expense of innovative ideas, and inject
    politics into the heart of the scientific method.
-   These threats have not only distorted truth, but have eroded public
    trust, undermined the integrity of research, stifled innovation, and
    weakened America’s competitive edge.
-   PCAST will restore excellence by bringing together the brightest
    minds from academia, industry, and government to prioritize
    measurable results, foster innovation, and dismantle barriers to
    scientific progress.

BUILDING ON SIGNIFICANT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
President Trump’s first administration laid a strong foundation for
American technological leadership.

-   Launching national initiatives to drive innovation in critical
    technologies, including the American AI Initiative and the National
    Quantum Initiative, which prioritized research, strategic
    investments, and workforce development in transformative fields.
-   Advancing emerging technologies by crafting regulatory and
    non-regulatory frameworks for areas such as autonomous driving
    systems, unmanned aerial systems, and biotechnology, ensuring a
    balanced approach to innovation and safety.
-   Accelerating groundbreaking research and collaboration through
    initiatives like the National AI Research Resource, spectrum
    auctions to unlock valuable frequencies for 5G and innovation, and
    investments in world-leading supercomputing systems.
