**ELIMINATING RACE- AND SEX-BASED DISCRIMINATION WITHIN THE ARMED
FORCES:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to
restore merit and lethality to America’s fighting force. 

-   The Executive Order bans the use of discriminatory race- or
    sex-based preferences by any element of the Armed Forces, the
    Department of Defense, or the Department of Homeland Security.  
    -   This Order also abolishes any remnant of the Diversity, Equity
        and Inclusion (DEI) bureaucracy within the Department of Defense
        and the Department of Homeland Security.
-   The Secretary of Defense will task the Department of Defense with
    conducting an internal review of all instances of race- or sex-based
    discrimination based on Department of Defense DEI initiatives.
    -   This Order also requires the Secretary of Defense and the
        Secretary of Homeland Security to review the curriculum at the
        United States Service Academies and other academic institutions
        to ensure these institutions eliminate radical DEI and gender
        ideologies.

**ENDING AN ERA OF ASSAULT ON MILITARY DISCIPLINE AND CULTURE:** Foreign
adversaries are strengthening their fighting forces every day while the
United States has deliberately been focused on radical ideology like
DEI. The world is watching. 

-   Prior to harmful changes introduced by the Obama and Biden
    administrations, the United States military offered equality of
    opportunity to every American capable of and interested in serving
    their country. Yet these two administrations exploited the military
    in favor of identity politics—harming our national defense,
    undermining the non-political nature of our military, and eroding
    morale and recruitment.
    -   Due to this “woke” assault, the Services together logged their
        lowest recruiting records since 1940 with a 41,000-troop
        shortfall in 2023.
-   Today’s Order moves our military away from this dark period and
    renews esprit de corps, readiness, and focus. It returns the
    Pentagon to the warfighter.
-   This Order also combats ideologies that seek to divide our Armed
    Forces by race, sex or other immutable characteristics and thus tear
    at cohesion and military efficacy.

**RESTORING A WARFIGHTING MINDSET:** The Armed Forces of the United
States exist to preserve our freedom and the American way of life. 

-   President Trump is committed to a merit-based system of sex-neutral
    policies and colorblind recruitment, promotion, and retention that
    will return our military to greatness.
-   President Trump vowed to get rid of the “woke” generals who
    prioritize social experiments over warfighting. He stated in his
    2024 reelection campaign that “…\[y\]ou can’t have a woke
    military…You need people that want to win. They want to win wars.
    That’s what their purpose is, to win wars, not to be woke… but we do
    have great military.”
