  Terrorist Organization'

REVERSING THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S REMOVAL OF THE HOUTHIS FROM THE
FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION LIST: Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order Re-Designating Ansar Allah (also known as the
Houthis) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.

-   The Executive Order sets in motion a process by which Ansar Allah,
    also known as the Houthis, will be designated as a Foreign Terrorist
    Organization.
    -   President Trump designated the Iranian-backed Houthis as a
        foreign terrorist organization (FTO) in January 2021.
    -   Within one month of taking office, the Biden administration
        reversed the Houthis’ designation.
    -   As a result of the Biden administration’s weak policy, the
        Houthis have fired at U.S. Navy warships dozens of times,
        launched numerous attacks on civilian infrastructure in partner
        nations, and attacked commercial vessels transiting Bab
        al-Mandeb more than 100 times.
    -   The Executive Order directs the Secretary of State, in
        consultation with others, to recommend the re-designation of the
        Houthis within 30 days.
-   Under President Trump, it is now the policy of the United States to
    cooperate with its regional partners to eliminate the Houthis’
    capabilities and operations, deprive them of resources, and thereby
    end their attacks on U.S. personnel and civilians, U.S. partners,
    and maritime shipping in the Red Sea.
-   Following the Houthis’ re-designation as an FTO, the Executive Order
    also directs the Administrator of the United States Agency for
    International Development (USAID) and the Secretary of State to
    jointly review United Nations partners, nongovernmental
    organizations, and contractors operating in Yemen.

<!-- -->

-   Following this review, the President will direct USAID to end its
    relationship with entities that have made payments to the Houthis,
    or which have opposed international efforts to counter the Houthis
    while turning a blind eye towards the Houthis’ terrorism and abuses.
