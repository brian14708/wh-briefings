PROVIDING AMERICANS THE TRUTH AFTER SIX DECADES OF SECRECY: Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order entitled
Declassification of Records Concerning the Assassinations of President
John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and the Reverend Doctor
Martin Luther King Jr.

-   The Executive Order establishes the policy that, more than 50 years
    after these assassinations, the victims’ families and the American
    people deserve the truth.
-   Specifically, the Order directs the Director of National
    Intelligence and other appropriate officials to:
    -   \(1\) Present a plan within 15 days for the full and complete
        release of all John F. Kennedy assassination records; and

    <!-- -->

    -   \(2\) Immediately review the records relating to the Robert F.
        Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. assassinations and present a
        plan for their full and complete release within 45 days.

PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ENDING THE ENDLESS DELAYS: In his first term,
President Trump ordered agencies to move toward disclosing more
information about the John F. Kennedy assassination, and now he is
ordering that the work be completed.

-   The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act
    of 1992 required all records related to the assassination be
    released in 25 years, absent a presidential certification that:
    -   Continued postponement is necessary due to an identifiable harm
        to the military defense, intelligence operations, law
        enforcement, or conduct of foreign relations; and

    <!-- -->

    -   Such identifiable harm is of such gravity that it outweighs the
        public interest in disclosure.
-   In October 2017 and April 2018 certifications, President Trump
    directed agencies to reevaluate redactions and disclose any
    information that no longer warranted withholding.
    -   President Biden delayed disclosure in 2021, 2022, and 2023.
-   In this Order, President Trump finds that continued withholding of
    the John F. Kennedy records is not in the public interest and is
    long overdue. He also concludes that releasing the Robert F. Kennedy
    and Martin Luther King Jr. assassination records is in the public
    interest.

PRESIDENT TRUMP DELIVERS ON PROMISE TO RELEASE ASSASSINATION RECORDS:
President Trump promised during his campaign to release assassination
records to give Americans the truth.

-   President Trump pledged on multiple occasions to release the JFK
    files, specifically stating in June 2024 that he would do so “early
    on.”
-   President Trump: “When I return to the White House, I will
    declassify and unseal all JFK assassination related documents. It’s
    been 60 years, time for the American people to know the TRUTH!”
