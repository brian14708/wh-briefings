title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Enforces Overwhelmingly Popular Demand
  to Stop Taxpayer Funding of Abortion'
---
 
**ENFORCING THE HYDE AMENDMENT:** On Friday, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order to end the use of Federal taxpayer dollars to
fund or promote elective abortion.

-   The Order recognizes that, for nearly five decades, Congress has
    enacted the Hyde Amendment and a series of additional laws to
    protect taxpayers from being forced to pay for abortion. Contrary to
    this longstanding commonsense policy, the previous administration
    embedded federal funding of elective abortion in a wide variety of
    government programs.
-   To restore this longstanding policy, the Order rescinds two
    executive orders from President Biden that violate the Hyde
    Amendment:
    -   Executive Order 14076 imposed a whole-of-government effort to
        promote and fund abortion and to politicize enforcement of the
        Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act.
        -   Federal statutes protecting access to emergency medical care
            for pregnant women under the Emergency Medical Treatment and
            Labor Act (EMTALA) and protecting personal health
            information under the Health Insurance Portability and
            Accountability Act (HIPAA) remain in full effect.

    -   Executive Order 14079 recategorized abortion as “healthcare” in
        order to provide taxpayer funding for elective abortions. This
        included using Medicaid funding to pay for travel costs for
        elective abortions.

**ENDING FEDERAL FUNDING OF ABORTION OVERSEAS:** President Donald J.
Trump also signed a Presidential Memorandum reinstating the Mexico City
Policy to stop the use of federal taxpayer dollars for abortion
overseas.

-   The President’s policy from 2017 is reinstated to ensure that no
    U.S. taxpayer money supports foreign organizations that perform or
    actively promote abortion in other nations.
-   The first Trump Administration also extended this policy to global
    health assistance. A 2020 report by the United States Agency for
    International Development found that this life-affirming policy in
    no way diminished women’s health around the world.

**PROTECTING TAXPAYERS FROM FUNDING ABORTION**: For the first time in
nearly fifty years, President Trump returned the issue of life to a vote
of the people, from within the States.

-   *Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization*, 597 U.S. 215 (2022),
    overturned *Roe v. Wade* and returned the power to regulate issues
    of life and safety to the people. Three of the justices deciding the
    case were appointed by President Trump.
-   Federal overreach and taxpayer dollars will no longer force
    violations of faith and conscience or impede the ability of states
    to determine life policies through a vote of the people.
    -   For example, under President Biden, the Department of Defense
        reimbursed abortion-related travel expenses, the Department of
        Veterans Affairs allowed hospitals to provide abortions, and the
        Department of Health and Human Services paid for abortions for
        illegal immigrants.

**PRESIDENT TRUMP PROMISED AND DELIVERED**: President Trump promised to
protect and defend a vote of the people, from within the states, on the
issue of life. Today’s executive actions build on the long list of
accomplishments from the first Trump Administration to support the
sanctity of every human life and prevent taxpayer funding of abortion.
Select highlights of the first Trump Administration’s work include:

-   Reinstated and expanded the Mexico City Policy, ensuring that
    taxpayer money is not used to fund abortion globally.
-   Issued a rule preventing Title X taxpayer funding from subsiding the
    abortion industry.
-   Cut all funding to the United Nations Population Fund, which
    supports coercive abortion and forced sterilization.
-   Signed legislation overturning the previous administration’s
    regulation that prohibited states from defunding abortion facilities
    as part of their family planning programs.
-   Fully enforced the separate payment requirement for abortion
    coverage in Obamacare exchange plans.
-   Stopped the Federal funding of fetal tissue research.
-   Worked to protect healthcare entities and individuals’ conscience
    rights, ensuring that no medical professional is forced to
    participate in an abortion in violation of their beliefs.
-   Issued an executive order reinforcing the requirement that all
    hospitals in the United States provide medical treatment or an
    emergency transfer for infants who are in need of emergency medical
    care—regardless of prematurity or disability.
-   Led a coalition of countries to sign the Geneva Consensus
    Declaration, declaring that there is no international right to
    abortion and committing to protecting women’s health.
-   First president in history to attend the March for Life.
