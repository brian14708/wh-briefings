  Tribe Recognition'

DIRECTING PLAN FOR RECOGNITION OF LARGEST TRIBE EAST OF MISSISSIPPI
RIVER: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum
to the Secretary of the Interior to submit a plan to advance full
federal recognition of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina.

-   The memorandum establishes that it is the policy of the United
    States to support federal recognition and full tribal benefits for
    the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina.
-   It directs the Secretary of the Interior to submit a plan to assist
    the Lumbee Tribe in obtaining full federal recognition through
    legislation or other available mechanisms, including the right to
    receive full federal benefits.  

FULL FEDERAL RECOGNITION IS LONG OVERDUE:The Lumbee have long been
recognized at the state and federal level, but further federal action is
required for full federal recognition and the accompanying benefits and
protections.

-   The State of North Carolina recognized the Lumbee Tribe in 1885, and
    in 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the 1956 Lumbee Act,
    which recognized the Lumbee but denied them some federal benefits.
-   Tribes can gain federal recognition by: (1) Act of Congress; (2) the
    Department of the Interior’s Office of Federal Acknowledgement
    process; or (3) federal court decision.
    -   President Trump’s memorandum directs the Secretary of the
        Interior to analyze these legal pathways for advancing Lumbee
        recognition.
-   Federal recognition grants tribes’ certain governmental autonomy,
    land protections, and access to federal programs and services, like
    health care through the Indian Health Service.

DELIVERING ON PROMISE TO SUPPORT RECOGNITION: President Trump promised
to support federal recognition of the Lumbee Tribe.

On September 23, 2024, President Trump stated: “Today, I’m officially
announcing that, if I am elected in November, I will sign legislation
granting the great Lumbee Tribe federal recognition that it deserves.”
