title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Ensures Transparency in Higher Education
  Admissions'
---
 
**ENSURING ACCOUNTABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION:** Today, President Donald
J. Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum directing the Secretary of
Education to require higher education institutions receiving Federal
financial assistance to be transparent regarding their admissions
practices.

-   The Memorandum directs the Secretary of Education to revamp the
    online presentation and data collection of the Integrated
    Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) to make it efficient,
    easily accessible, and intelligibly presented for parents and
    students.
-   The Memorandum instructs the Secretary of Education to expand the
    scope of required reporting for institutions’ admissions data in
    order to provide adequate transparency as determined by the
    Secretary of Education.
-   The Memorandum further instructs the Secretary of Education to
    increase accuracy checks for data submitted by institutions through
    IPEDS and take remedial action if institutions fail to submit data
    in a timely manner or submit incomplete or inaccurate data.

**ENDING DISCRIMINATORY RACE-BASED ADMISSIONS:** President Trump is
ending discriminatory practices that are illegal, strip opportunities
and scholarships from hardworking students, and waste taxpayer dollars.

-   In 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that consideration of race in
    higher education admissions violates students’ civil rights.
-   However, the lack of available admissions data from
    universities—paired with the rampant use of “diversity statements”
    and other overt and hidden racial proxies—continues to raise
    concerns about whether race is actually used in admissions decisions
    in practice. 
-   This Memorandum requires higher education institutions to submit the
    data necessary to verify that their admissions do not involve
    unlawful discrimination. It will also provide the public with a more
    holistic view of the factors these institutions consider in
    admissions.
-   American students, parents, and taxpayers should have confidence
    that our Nation’s institutions of higher education are recruiting
    and training our next generations with fairness and integrity.

**ADVANCING REFORMS IN HIGHER EDUCATION**: President Trump is holding
elite universities accountable, ensuring they prioritize fairness,
merit, and American values.

-   In January 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order to end
    the discriminatory and illegal DEI preferences in higher education.
-   In June 2025, President Trump signed a Proclamation to safeguard
    national security by suspending the entry of foreign nationals
    seeking to study or participate in exchange programs at Harvard
    University.
-   In July 2025, the Administration successfully negotiated a
    resolution with the University of Pennsylvania to keep men out of
    women’s sports and restore the trophies and records of women.
-   In July 2025, President Trump secured settlements with Columbia
    University and Brown University that include agreements that the
    universities will provide access to all relevant data and
    information to rigorously assess compliance with their commitments
    to merit-based hiring and admissions.
