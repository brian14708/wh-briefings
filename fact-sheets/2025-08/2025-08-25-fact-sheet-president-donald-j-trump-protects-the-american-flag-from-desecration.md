title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Protects the American Flag from Desecration'
---
 
**COMBATING FLAG DESECRATION:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed
an Executive Order to restore respect, pride, and sanctity to the
American flag and prosecute those who desecrate this symbol of our
freedom, identity, and strength to the fullest extent permissible.

-   The Order directs the Attorney General to vigorously prosecute those
    who violate our laws in ways that involve desecrating the flag, and
    to pursue litigation to clarify the scope of First Amendment in this
    area*.*
-   It also instructs the Attorney General to refer flag desecration
    cases that violate state or local laws to appropriate state or local
    authorities.
-   Finally, the order directs the Secretaries of State and Homeland
    Security and the Attorney General to deny, prohibit, terminate, or
    revoke visas, residence permits, or naturalization proceedings, and
    other immigration benefits, or seek removal from the United States,
    wherever there has been an appropriate determination that flag
    desecration by foreign nationals permits the exercise of those
    remedies under applicable law.

**RESTORING RESPECT FOR THE FLAG:** The American flag is the most sacred
and cherished symbol of the United States of America, and desecrating it
is uniquely and inherently offensive and provocative.  It is a statement
of contempt and hostility toward our Nation, and an act used by groups
of foreign nationals calculated to intimidate and threaten violence
against Americans.

-   Recent protests, including those in Los Angeles in June 2025, have
    featured flag burning alongside violent acts and other conduct
    threatening public safety.
-   Such conduct disrespects the sacrifices of Americans who bled for
    our country, and undermines the flag as a symbol that unites and
    represents all Americans of every background and walk of life.
-   The Supreme Court has never held that flag desecration conducted in
    a manner that is likely to incite imminent lawless action or serve
    as a form of “fighting words” is constitutionally protected. 

**UPHOLDING AMERICAN PRIDE:** President Trump has championed policies to
restore pride in the American flag and the Nation’s history, reinforcing
the values that unite the country.

-   President Trump banned flying any other flags beside the Stars and
    Stripes at State Department facilities around the world.
-   He signed an Executive Order to protect America’s monuments from
    vandalism and revive the National Garden of American Heroes.
-   He launched initiatives like the Great American State Fair and
    America 250 Commission to instill pride in America’s history and
    accomplishments, fostering a renewed sense of patriotism.
-   He issued an Executive Order to ensure that Smithsonian Institution
    museums accurately celebrate American exceptionalism, remove
    divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our
    institutions for the millions of Americans who visit each year and
    recently directed an audit to ensure that its exhibits align with
    this pro-America vision. 
-   President Trump has long condemned the act of burning the American
    flag, calling it “disgraceful.”
