  Architecture Beautiful Again'
---
 
**RESTORING AMERICA’S ARCHITECTURAL GRANDEUR:** Today, President Donald
J. Trump signed an Executive Order mandating that Federal public
buildings, such as courthouses and government office buildings, embrace
classical architecture to honor tradition, foster civic pride, and
inspire the citizenry.

-   The Order ensures that applicable Federal public buildings are
    constructed in a style that uplifts and beautifies public spaces,
    ennobles our Nation, and commands respect from the general public.
-   The Order requires that all Federal public buildings should be
    visually identifiable as civic buildings and respect regional
    architectural heritage.
-   The Order directs that classical architecture serve as the preferred
    architectural style for all Federal public buildings, especially in
    the District of Columbia.
-   The Order emphasizes that designs diverging from classical
    architecture must convey the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and
    stability of the American government and command public respect.
-   The Administrator of the General Services Administration is
    responsible for implementing this Order, which establishes processes
    for ensuring architects and administrators with appropriate training
    are involved in building design.
-   It requires notification to the President through the Assistant to
    the President for Domestic Policy when a building design deviates
    from the preferred style, including where a design embraces
    Brutalist, Deconstructivist, or other modernist architecture.

**ENSURING TAXPAYER-FUNDED BUILDINGS SERVE TAXPAYERS:** President Trump
is committed to ensuring that taxpayer-funded buildings reflect the
values and aesthetic preferences of the American people.

-   The Founding Fathers wanted America’s public buildings to inspire
    the American people and encourage civic virtue.
-   George Washington and Thomas Jefferson personally guided the design
    of iconic structures like the Capitol Building and the White House,
    setting a standard for timeless architecture.
-   In the 1960s, the Federal government largely replaced traditional
    designs with modernist and Brutalist ones—a move that was deeply
    unpopular.
-   A majority of American taxpayers want classical, regionally inspired
    public buildings that beautify public spaces, and their government
    should respect their preferences.

**MAKING AMERICA BEAUTIFUL AGAIN**: President Trump is committed to
revitalizing the beauty of America’s public spaces and restoring the
architectural grandeur that reflects our nation’s heritage.

-   In 2020, President Trump signed an Executive Order on “Promoting
    Beautiful Federal Civic Architecture,” which President Biden
    rescinded in 2021.
-   In 2023, on the campaign trail, President Trump promised to “get rid
    of ugly buildings … and return to the magnificent classical style of
    Western civilization.”
-   In January 2025, President Trump signed a memorandum directing the
    Administrator of the General Services Administration to provide
    recommendations on making Federal civic architecture beautiful
    again.
    -   He also signed an Executive Order to protect America’s monuments
        from vandalism and revive the National Garden of American
        Heroes.

        America 250 Commission to instill pride in America’s history and
        accomplishments, fostering a renewed sense of patriotism.

    Washington, D.C. safe and beautiful, and in August 2025, the
    President took additional measures to restore safety and beauty to
    our Nation’s capital.
-   In July 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order to make
    national parks great again, increasing revenue for conservation
    projects that will improve the majesty and legacy of our national
    parks.
-   In August 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order to restore
    respect, pride, and sanctity to the American flag and prosecute
    those who desecrate this symbol of our freedom, identity, and
    strength to the fullest extent permissible.
