title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Improves our Nation Through Better Design'
---
 
**IMPROVING GOVERNMENT SERVICES:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order to launch the “America by Design” initiative,
establishing the National Design Studio to enhance the usability and
aesthetics of Federal digital and physical services.

-   The Order establishes the National Design Studio and the role of
    Chief Design Officer to facilitate design improvements in both
    digital and physical Federal spaces.
    -   The National Design Studio will work to reduce duplicative
        design costs, leverage standardized design, and dramatically
        improve the quality of public interactions with government
        services.

    -   The Chief Design Officer will help recruit top private-sector
        designers to facilitate this effort.
-   The Order directs agency heads to collaborate with the Chief Design
    Officer to implement the America by Design initiative at their
    respective agencies.
    -   This includes improving websites and physical interfaces,
        updating the United States Web Design System (USWDS), and
        ensuring government-wide compliance with the 21<sup>st</sup>
        Century IDEA Act.

**ADDRESSING OUTDATED FEDERAL INTERFACES:** Federal websites and digital
services aren’t meeting the public’s needs and expectations.

-   There are an estimated 26,000 Federal websites in the U.S.
-   Legacy government systems are costly to maintain and notoriously
    difficult for Americans to navigate, wasting time and resources.
-   Poorly designed digital and physical interfaces undermine public
    trust in high-impact Federal service providers.
-   The current sprawling ecosystem of Federal services lacks the
    usability and aesthetic quality expected by the American public.
-   Only 6% of Federal websites are rated “good” for mobile performance,
    and 45% of Federal websites are not mobile friendly.
-   Less than 20% of Federal websites use code from USWDS, contributing
    to inconsistent and varying user experiences.

**RESTORING AMERICAN EXCELLENCE:** President Trump has consistently
prioritized innovation and efficiency, ensuring Federal services meet
the needs of the American people.

-   Under the Trump Administration, the backlog of veterans waiting for
    benefits has dropped by more than 37%, showcasing how the President
    is making government efficient and responsive to those it serves.
-   President Trump signed an Executive Order to modernize how the
    government handles money, switching from old-fashioned paper-based
    payments to fast, secure electronic payments.
-   After it became widely known that Federal retirement records were
    still being managed in a limestone mine, the Trump Administration
    moved to modernize the process by digitizing Federal retirement
    paperwork.
-   President Trump signed an Executive Order mandating that agencies
    simplify funding opportunity announcements with plain language.
-   President Trump is reducing bureaucratic hurdles, ensuring the
    Federal government works with the speed and efficiency Americans
    deserve.
