title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Takes Steps to End Cashless Bail to
  Protect Americans'
---
 
**PREVENTING FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR SENSELESS CASHLESS BAIL:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to protect Americans
by ensuring Federal policies and resources are not used to support
cashless bail policies across the Nation.

-   The Order directs the Attorney General to submit a list of States
    and local jurisdictions with cashless bail policies.
-   The Order instructs the Administration to identify Federal funds
    currently provided to cashless bail jurisdictions that may be
    suspended or terminated. 

**STOPPING DANGEROUS RELEASE:** Cashless bail policies allow dangerous
individuals to immediately return to the streets and further endanger
law-abiding, hard-working Americans because they know our laws will not
be enforced.

-   A 2023 study out of Yolo County, California found that its “Zero
    Bail” policy resulted in 163% more crime and 200% more violent crime
    compared to those who posted bail.
-   Last year, a suspected Tren de Aragua gang member, freed without
    bail after an attempted murder in New York, was rearrested for drug
    trafficking in Miami and released again, before finally being
    arrested and held for alleged sex-trafficking of a minor.  
-   A repeat offender, arrested six times in a year, was released
    without bail after his most recent arrest. At the time, he had 47
    priors and 28 convictions for preying on New Yorkers.
-   Earlier this year, a homicide suspect in Rockford, Illinois was able
    to walk free under its new no-cash-bail system, endangering the
    community.
-   Just this month, a pair of convicted killers caught dealing drugs in
    broad daylight were released without bail in New York City.
-   Our brave law enforcement officers risk their lives to arrest
    dangerous criminals, only to be forced to arrest the same
    individuals, sometimes for the same crimes, while they await trial
    on the previous charges – a waste of public resources and obvious
    threat to public safety.

**MAKING AMERICA SAFE AGAIN:** The American people elected President
Trump to get tough on crime and restore safety to communities
nationwide.

-   President Trump: “When I’m reelected, I will crack down on the
    left-wing jurisdictions that refuse to prosecute dangerous criminals
    and set loose violent felons on cashless bail… If you kill somebody,
    there’s no bond. Don’t worry about it. Go ahead. Kill somebody else.
    These people are crazy, I’ll tell you.”
-   Earlier this month, President Trump mobilized the national guard and
    took over the D.C. Metro Police Department to restore law and order
    in the District of Columbia.
-   On his first day in office, President Trump sealed the southern
    border and launched the largest deportation operation in history to
    remove criminal illegal aliens.
-   President Trump issued an Executive Order in April directing various
    measures to empower and provide unjust-liability protections to law
    enforcement across the Nation to firmly police dangerous criminal
    behavior and protect innocent citizens.
-   He has consistently pushed for stronger law enforcement policies to
    ensure violent offenders are detained, protecting law-abiding
    Americans from repeat criminals.
