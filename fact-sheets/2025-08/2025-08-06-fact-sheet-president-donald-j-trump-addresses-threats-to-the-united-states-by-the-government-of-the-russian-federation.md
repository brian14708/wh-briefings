title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Addresses Threats to the United States
  by the Government of the Russian Federation'

**ADDRESSING A NATIONAL EMERGENCY:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order imposing tariffs on India in response to its
continued purchase of Russian Federation oil, and establishing a process
for the potential imposition of similar tariffs on other countries that
directly or indirectly import oil from the Russian Federation.

-   The President found that India is currently importing Russian
    Federation oil. Accordingly, to address the national emergency
    stemming from the Government of the Russian Federation’s actions
    taken against Ukraine, he is imposing an additional 25% tariff on
    imports from India, effective August 27, due to India’s direct or
    indirect importation of Russian Federation oil.
    -   This tariff is in addition to any other duties, fees, taxes,
        exactions, and charges applicable to such imports, unless
        subject to existing or future actions under section 232 of the
        Trade Expansion Act of 1962.

    -   This tariff is also in addition to any tariff applicable under
        Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025, as amended, but the
        additional 25% tariff imposed by this order shall not apply to
        articles set forth in Annex II to Executive Order 14257.
-   The Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with the Secretary of
    State, Secretary of the Treasury, and other senior officials, will
    determine whether other countries directly or indirectly import
    Russian Federation oil and recommend further actions to the
    President as needed.

**COUNTERING THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION’S THREAT TO U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY
AND FOREIGN POLICY:** The Russian Federation’s actions in Ukraine pose
an ongoing threat to U.S. national security and foreign policy,
necessitating stronger measures to address the national emergency.

-   India’s importation of Russian Federation oil undermines U.S.
    efforts to counter Russia’s harmful activities.
-   India’s subsequent reselling of this oil on the open market, often
    at significant profit, further enables the Russian Federation’s
    economy to fund its aggression.
-   By imposing a 25% tariff, President Trump aims to deter countries
    from supporting the Russian Federation’s economy through oil imports
    and impose serious economic consequences on the Russian Federation
    for its ongoing aggressions.

**PUTTING AMERICA FIRST:** President Trump has been consistent that he
will not tolerate Russian Federation aggression.

-   President Trump has been transparent that the Russian Federation
    would not be facing these actions if they were to “get a deal where
    people stop getting killed.”
-   President Trump has also been upfront that India would face tariffs
    for buying Russian Federation oil: “India is not only buying massive
    amounts of Russian Oil, they are then, for much of the Oil
    purchased, selling it on the Open Market for big profits …. Because
    of this, I will be substantially raising the Tariff paid by India to
    the USA.”
-   President Trump remains committed to pursuing peace, and these
    actions aim to pressure the Russian Federation toward a resolution
    that ends the conflict and saves lives.
