title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Democratizes Access to Alternative Assets
  for 401(k) Investors'
---
 
**EXPANDING INVESTMENT CHOICES FOR 401(K) PLANS:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to allow 401(k) investors to
access alternative assets for better returns and diversification.

-   The Order directs the Secretary of Labor to reexamine the Department
    of Labor’s guidance on a fiduciary’s duties regarding alternative
    asset investments in ERISA-governed 401(k) and other
    defined-contribution plans.
-   The Order instructs the Secretary of Labor to clarify the Department
    of Labor’s position on alternative assets and the appropriate
    fiduciary process associated with offering asset allocation funds
    containing investments in alternative assets.
-   The Order directs the Secretary of Labor to consult with the
    Secretary of the Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission,
    and other federal regulators to determine whether parallel
    regulatory changes should be made at those agencies to give effect
    to the purpose of the Order.
-   The Order directs the Securities and Exchange Commission to
    facilitate access to alternative assets for participant-directed
    defined-contribution retirement savings plans by revising applicable
    regulations and guidance.

**PROMOTING RETIREMENT SECURITY THROUGH DIVERSIFIED INVESTMENTS:**
President Trump wants to give American workers more investment options
in order to attain stronger and more financially secure retirement
outcomes.

-   More than 90 million Americans participate in employer-sponsored
    defined-contribution plans, and most of those are currently
    restricted from investing in alternative assets, unlike wealthy
    investors and retirement plans for government workers.
-   Alternative assets, such as private equity, real estate, and digital
    assets, offer competitive returns and diversification benefits.
-   Regulatory overreach and litigation risks have limited
    ERISA-governed plan fiduciaries from including alternative assets in
    their investment portfolios, hindering workers’ retirement growth.
-   President Trump is expanding access to these assets to ensure a
    dignified and comfortable retirement for all Americans.

**BUILDING WEALTH AND SECURING RETIREMENT FOR ALL AMERICANS:**
 President Trump is delivering on his promise to enhance financial
opportunities and retirement security for all Americans, ensuring they
can build wealth and thrive.

-   President Trump’s Department of Labor has already rescinded guidance
    put place by the Biden Administration regarding digital assets.
-   President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill delivers on his promise to
    ensure retirees can keep more of their hard-earned benefits.
-   President Trump promised to make the United States the “crypto
    capital of the world,” emphasizing the need to embrace digital
    assets to drive economic growth and technological leadership.
-   Through tax cuts and deregulation, President Trump is delivering on
    his promise to Make America Wealthy Again, empowering workers to
    save and invest more for their retirement.
