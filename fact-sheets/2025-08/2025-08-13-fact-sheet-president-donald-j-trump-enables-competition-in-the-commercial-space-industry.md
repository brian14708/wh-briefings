title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Enables Competition in the Commercial
  Space Industry'
---
 
**PROMOTING COMMERCIAL SPACE INNOVATION:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed an Executive Order to streamline regulations and foster a
competitive commercial space industry, ensuring the United States
maintains its leading role in the commercial use of space.

-   The Order directs the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation
    with the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality, to eliminate
    or expedite environmental reviews for launch and reentry licenses
    and permits.
-   It also directs the Secretary of Transportation to review regulatory
    requirements to eliminate outdated, redundant, or overly restrictive
    rules for launch and reentry vehicles.
-   The Order instructs the Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with
    the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Transportation, and the
    Administrator of NASA, to evaluate State compliance with the Coastal
    Zone Management Act (CZMA) and whether States are hindering
    spaceport infrastructure development under the CZMA, or otherwise
    placing limitations on spaceport development that are inconsistent
    with Federal law.
-   It directs the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of
    Transportation, and the Administrator of NASA to align their review
    processes to eliminate duplicative regulations and expedite
    spaceport development.
-   The Order mandates the creation of a streamlined process for
    authorizing novel space activities (missions not clearly or
    straightforwardly governed by existing regulatory frameworks) with
    the goal of enabling American space competitiveness and superiority
    in new space-based industries.
-   The Order establishes a dedicated position in the Department of
    Transportation to advise on fostering innovation and deregulation in
    the commercial space industry, and directs the appointment of an
    Associate Administrator for Commercial Space Transportation within
    the Federal Aviation Administration to drive regulatory reform.

**STRENGTHENING COMPETITION IN THE INDUSTRY:** It is imperative that new
space-based industries, space exploration capabilities, and cutting-edge
defense systems are pioneered in America rather than by our adversaries.

-   The commercial space industry drives economic growth, supports
    cutting-edge technology, and advances Federal space exploration
    objectives.
-   Inefficient permitting processes discourage investment and
    innovation, limiting the ability of U.S. companies to lead in global
    space markets. Overly complex environmental and other licensing and
    permitting regulations slow down commercial space launches and
    infrastructure development, and benefit entrenched incumbents (who
    can afford to bear the expense of regulatory compliance) over new
    market entrants (who cannot). 
-   Space flights affected are not just human space flights; this
    regulatory regime hampers satellites, aerospace and defense
    technology development, and manufacturing and production activities
    conducted in space, and discourages the development of other
    space-based industries.
-   The United States risks losing its competitive edge in these
    industries (and the benefits of technologies developed in connection
    with them) if regulatory barriers prevent rapid innovation and
    expansion in the space sector.

**MAKING AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IN SPACE GREAT AGAIN:** President Trump is
building on his first term’s transformative actions in the space
industry to maintain U.S. leadership in space.

-   President Trump spearheaded the establishment of the Space Force,
    the first new branch of the Armed Forces since the creation of the
    Air Force more than 70 years ago.
    -   The Space Force is critical to preparing the Department of
        Defense for evolving warfighting conditions and expanding our
        capabilities.
-   President Trump released seven Space Policy Directives instructing
    NASA to return American astronauts to the Moon, reform our Nation’s
    commercial space regulatory framework, establish cybersecurity
    principles for space systems, and much more.
-   In 2020, for the first time ever, a commercial company sent humans
    into orbit as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew program.
-   In his first remarks of his second term, President Trump vowed to
    send astronauts to Mars.
-   This is the latest deregulatory action that President Trump has
    authorized, building on NEPA reform, the elimination of burdensome
    DEI requirements, and other complicated rules that increase the cost
    of operating businesses that benefit Americans.
