  Safety in the District of Columbia'

**RESTORING PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY IN WASHINGTON, D.C.:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order declaring a crime
emergency in the District of Columbia to protect public servants,
citizens, and tourists, and ensure the safe functioning of the Federal
government.

-   The President has determined that special conditions of an emergency
    nature exist, requiring the use of the Metropolitan Police
    Department’s services to maintain law and order, protect Federal
    buildings, national monuments, and other Federal property, and
    ensure the orderly functioning of the Federal Government.
-   The Order invokes the President’s authority under the District of
    Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act to
    require the Mayor to make the services of the Metropolitan Police
    Department available to the President.
-   The Order delegates this authority to the Attorney General, who will
    also monitor the emergency conditions and provide regular updates to
    the President on the status of the emergency.
-   The Attorney General will recommend further actions or the
    termination of the emergency measures as circumstances warrant.

**COMBATING RAMPANT VIOLENCE:** The surge in violent crime in our
Nation’s capital is a national disgrace that threatens public safety and
Federal operations, to the detriment of all Americans.

-   Washington, D.C. has one of the highest robbery and murder rates
    among large U.S. cities nationwide, with a homicide rate exceeding
    27 per 100,000 residents in 2024.
-   Vehicle theft in the District is over three times the national
    average, at 842.4 thefts per 100,000 residents, ranking it among the
    most dangerous cities globally.
-   Rising violence endangers Federal workers, hinders recruitment and
    retention of essential personnel, and undermines confidence in the
    United States as a secure nation. If our Federal Government cannot
    operate safely and effectively, it is a threat not just to the
    District of Columbia, but to the Nation.
-   The city government’s failure to control crime has forced the
    diversion of critical resources, hampering the Federal government’s
    ability to operate efficiently.
-   President Trump has a Constitutional obligation to restore order so
    that citizens, tourists, and staff can live peacefully in the
    Nation’s capital. Our Nation’s capital should be the envy of the
    world, not a disgrace.

**MAKING AMERICA SAFE AGAIN:** President Trump campaigned on the promise
to make America safe again and restore Washington, D.C. to glory.

-   On President Trump’s first return to Washington since leaving office
    in 2021, he lamented “the filth and the decay” that marred the
    Nation’s capital in his absence.
-   President Trump later promised that his Administration would “take
    over the horribly run capital of our nation, Washington, D.C., and
    clean it up, renovate it, and rebuild our capital city so that it is
    no longer a nightmare of murder and crime, but rather it will become
    the most beautiful capital anywhere in the world.”
-   In March, President Trump created a task force to make D.C. safe and
    beautiful, surging law enforcement to restore order and enhance the
    city’s infrastructure.
-   The Administration is committed to reducing violent crime rates,
    improving public safety, and ensuring Washington, D.C. serves as a
    model of prosperity and security for the nation.
-   President Trump: “Just like I took care of the Border, where you had
    ZERO Illegals coming across last month, from millions the year
    before, I will take care of our cherished Capital, and we will make
    it, truly, GREAT AGAIN! Before the tents, squalor, filth, and Crime,
    it was the most beautiful Capital in the World. It will soon be that
    again.”
