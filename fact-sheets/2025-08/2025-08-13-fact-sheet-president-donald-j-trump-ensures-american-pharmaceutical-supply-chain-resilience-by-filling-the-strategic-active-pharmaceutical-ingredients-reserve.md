title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Ensures American Pharmaceutical Supply
  Chain Resilience by Filling the Strategic Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Reserve'
---
 
**BOLSTERING PHARMACEUTICAL SECURITY:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order to fill the Strategic Active Pharmaceutical
Ingredients Reserve (SAPIR) with critical drug components, ensuring a
resilient domestic supply chain for essential medicines.

-   The Order directs the Office of the Assistant Secretary for
    Preparedness and Response (ASPR), within the Department of Health
    and Human Services, to develop a list of approximately 26 critical
    drugs vital to national health and security, and ready the SAPIR
    repository to receive and maintain the Active Pharmaceutical
    Ingredients (APIs) used to make these critical drugs.
-   The Order charges the ASPR with obtaining a 6-month supply of these
    critical APIs, with a preference for obtaining
    domestically-manufactured APIs if possible, and placing them in the
    SAPIR.
-   It further instructs the ASPR to update the 2022 list of 86
    essential medicines and propose a plan to obtain and store a 6-month
    API supply for these drugs.
-   ASPR shall further develop a proposal for opening a second SAPIR
    repository to further enhance pharmaceutical supply chain
    resilience.

**ADDRESSING SUPPLY CHAIN VULNERABILITIES:** Restoring capacity for
domestic production of essential pharmaceutical products is essential to
safeguarding national health and security against global supply chain
disruptions.

-   Only about 10% of APIs for U.S. prescription drugs are manufactured
    domestically, leaving the Nation vulnerable to foreign supply chain
    disruptions.
-   The Biden Administration failed to advance domestic production or
    fill the SAPIR, despite spending billions on supply chain
    initiatives.
-   Overreliance on foreign, sometimes adversarial, nations for Key
    Starting Materials (the materials used to make APIs) and APIs risks
    shortages of essential medicines.
-   Stockpiling APIs, which are lower-cost and have longer shelf lives,
    strengthens the Nation’s ability to ensure access to critical drugs
    during emergencies.

**RESTORING AMERICAN SELF-RELIANCE:** President Trump has consistently
prioritized policies to secure America’s pharmaceutical independence and
ensure access to affordable, domestically produced drugs.

-   In 2020, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing his
    Administration to increase domestic procurement of Essential
    Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs, as well as
    identify supply chain vulnerabilities.  
-   In 2020, President Trump created a SAPIR to stockpile APIs, laying
    the foundation for pharmaceutical resilience.
-   In May 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order to remove
    regulatory barriers and facilitate the restoration of a robust
    domestic manufacturing base for prescription drugs, including key
    ingredients and materials necessary to manufacture prescription
    drugs.
-   In May 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order implementing
    most-favored-nation drug pricing to lower the prices Americans pay,
    and later sent letters to 17 pharmaceutical companies to encourage
    competitive pricing and domestic production.
