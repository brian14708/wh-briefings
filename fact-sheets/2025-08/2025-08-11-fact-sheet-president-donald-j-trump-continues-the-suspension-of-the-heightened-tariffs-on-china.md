title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Continues the Suspension of the Heightened
  Tariffs on China'
---
 
**CONTINUING THE SUSPENSION OF HEIGHTENED TARIFFS ON CHINA:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order continuing the
suspension of heightened tariffs on China. This action is necessary to
facilitate ongoing and productive discussion with China about remedying
trade imbalances, unfair trade practices, expanding market access for
American exports, and aligning with the United States on national
security and economic matters.

-   The United States and China have engaged in multiple rounds of
    productive negotiations to address trade reciprocity and national
    security concerns.
-   The United States will therefore maintain the suspension of
    heightened tariffs on Chinese imports, as outlined in Executive
    Order 14298, until November 10, 2025.
-   The current 10% reciprocal tariff remains in effect during this
    suspension period.
    -   The 10% reciprocal tariff sets a fair baseline to encourage
        domestic production, strengthen our supply chains, and ensure
        that American trade policy supports American workers first,
        instead of undercutting them.

    -   Other U.S. tariff measures with respect to China will remain in
        place.
-   The United States will continue trade talks with China to promote
    fair trade practices and support American workers.

**WORKING TOWARDS BALANCED TRADE:** President Trump is taking action
that he deems necessary to address the national emergency involving our
growing and persistent trade deficit with foreign trading partners, such
as China, and the consequences of that deficit. President Trump is
ensuring that our trade policy works for the American economy, levels
the playing field for American workers and producers, and strengthens
America’s defense industrial base.

-   For too long, unfair trade practices and America’s massive trade
    deficit with China have fueled the offshoring of American jobs and
    the decline of our manufacturing sector.
-   President Trump is ensuring economic cooperation between two of the
    largest economies in order to protect American interests, stop
    unfair trade practices, and strengthen America’s domestic
    manufacturing base.
-   The U.S. goods trade deficit with China was $295.4 billion in
    2024—the largest with any trading partner. On an annual basis, this
    deficit is already decreasing substantially.
-   The U.S. and China are working to address these imbalances to
    deliver real, lasting benefits to American workers, farmers, and
    businesses.

**CONTINUING PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS:** The United States and China are
committed to ongoing negotiations to resolve trade disputes and
strengthen economic ties.

-   Trade discussions with China have been constructive following the
    Administration’s announcement of many successful trade deals.
-   Each round of negotiations with the Chinese has built on each other,
    further strengthening economic cooperation and implementation to
    work toward fair and balanced trade with a key trading partner.
-   President Trump: “We’re getting along with China very well.”
