  of Columbia'

**SECURING THE SAFETY AND PEACEFUL FUNCTIONING OF OUR NATION’S
CAPITAL:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed a Presidential
Memorandum to restore law and order in the District of Columbia.

-   The Memorandum directs the Secretary of Defense to mobilize the
    District of Columbia National Guard to address the epidemic of crime
    in our Nation’s capital.
-   The District of Columbia National Guard will remain mobilized until
    law and order is restored.
-   The Memorandum directs the Secretary of Defense to coordinate with
    State Governors and authorize the orders of any additional National
    Guard units as needed.

**RESTORING LAW AND ORDER:** Washington, D.C. is under siege from
out-of-control violent crime, and Federal intervention is now necessary
to secure the safety and peaceful functioning of our Nation, the Federal
government, and our city.

-   Washington, D.C. is a Federal city because it is the seat of our
    Nation’s government. Violent crime that prevents Federal workers
    from safely performing their duties and prevents Americans from
    safely accessing their elected officials is a threat not just to the
    city, but to the Nation.
-   The local D.C. government has lost control of public safety in the
    city.
    -   In May, two embassy staffers were murdered.

    -   In June, a Congressional intern was fatally shot just a short
        distance from the White House.

    <!-- -->

    -   Just days ago, a Trump Administration staffer was mercilessly
        beaten by a violent mob.
-   Washington, D.C. has a violent crime rate that is higher than some
    of the most dangerous places in the world.
    -   Washington, DC’s 2024 murder rate (27.54 per 100K) is higher
        than Bogota (15.1), Mexico City (10.6), Islamabad (9.2), Lima
        (7.6), and even major capitals like Paris (1.64), London (1.1),
        and Madrid (0.96).

-   President Trump has a Constitutional obligation to restore order so
    that citizens, tourists, and staff can  live peacefully in the
    Nation’s capital. Our Nation’s capital should be the envy of the
    world, not a disgrace.

**MAKING AMERICA SAFE AGAIN:** President Trump campaigned on the promise
to make America safe again and restore Washington, D.C. to glory.

-   On President Trump’s first return to Washington since leaving office
    in 2021, he lamented “the filth and the decay” that marred the
    Nation’s capital in his absence.
-   President Trump later promised that his Administration would “take
    over the horribly run capital of our nation, Washington, D.C., and
    clean it up, renovate it, and rebuild our capital city so that it is
    no longer a nightmare of murder and crime, but rather it will become
    the most beautiful capital anywhere in the world.”
-   In March, President Trump created a task force to make D.C. safe and
    beautiful, surging law enforcement to restore order and enhance the
    city’s infrastructure.
-   The Administration is committed to reducing violent crime rates,
    improving public safety, and ensuring Washington, D.C. serves as a
    model of prosperity and security for the nation.
-   President Trump: “Just like I took care of the Border, where you had
    ZERO Illegals coming across last month, from millions the year
    before, I will take care of our cherished Capital, and we will make
    it, truly, GREAT AGAIN! Before the tents, squalor, filth, and Crime,
    it was the most beautiful Capital in the World. It will soon be that
    again.”
