  the Crime Emergency in the District of Columbia'

**FURTHER ADVANCING LAW AND ORDER:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order directing additional specific actions to
further crack down on crime in Washington, D.C.

-   The Order instructs the National Park Service to hire additional
    United States Park Police officers to support public safety in
    Washington, D.C.
-   It directs the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia
    to hire additional prosecutors to focus on violent and property
    crimes.
-   It establishes an online portal for Americans with law enforcement
    experience or other relevant backgrounds to join Federal law
    enforcement branches to support law enforcement operations in
    Washington, D.C.
-   It instructs law enforcement agencies that are members of the D.C.
    Safe and Beautiful Task Force to create and begin training, manning,
    hiring, and equipping specialized units that are dedicated to
    ensuring public safety and order in the Nation’s capital that can be
    deployed whenever the circumstances necessitate.
-   The Order directs the Secretary of Defense to create a specialized
    D.C. National Guard unit trained to ensure public safety and order
    in the Nation’s capital, when its activation becomes necessary, and
    ensure state National Guards are similarly trained and ready to
    assist in quelling civil disturbances nationwide.  Further, the
    Secretary of Defense will ensure the availability of a National
    Guard quick reaction force for rapid nationwide deployment when
    circumstances warrant.
-   The Order directs the Department of Housing and Urban Development to
    investigate any non-compliance with crime prevention and safety
    requirements in HUD’s agreements with the DC Housing Authority or
    landlords in vouchers to ensure that housing providers are ensuring
    safe, decent, and sanitary conditions in housing and restricting
    tenants who engage in criminal activity like drug distribution,
    violent criminal activity, and domestic violence.
-   It tasks the Secretary of Transportation with conducting inspections
    to address unsafe conditions in D.C.’s federally funded transit
    services and take remedial action as needed.
-   Finally, the Order directs the Attorney General to request
    additional updates and modifications to the Metropolitan Police
    Department General Orders from the Mayor as necessary to address the
    crime emergency and ensure public safety.

**RESTORING SAFETY IN OUR NATION’S CAPITAL:** Washington, D.C. is under
siege from out-of-control violent crime, and additional Federal
intervention is necessary to secure the safety and peaceful functioning
of the Federal government, and therefore, our Nation.

-   Violent crime that prevents Federal workers from safely performing
    their duties and prevents Americans from safely accessing their
    elected officials is a threat not just to Washington, D.C., but to
    the Nation.
-   The local D.C. government has lost control of public safety in the
    city.
    -   In May, two embassy staffers were murdered.
    -   In June, a Congressional intern was fatally shot just a short
        distance from the White House.
    -   Just weeks ago, a Trump Administration staffer was mercilessly
        beaten by a violent mob.
-   Washington, D.C. has a violent crime rate that is higher than some
    of the most dangerous places in the world.
    -   Washington, DC’s 2024 murder rate (27.54 per 100K) is higher
        than Bogota (15.1), Mexico City (10.6), Islamabad (9.2), Lima
        (7.6), and major capitals like Paris (1.64), London (1.1), and
        Madrid (0.96).
-   President Trump has a constitutional obligation to restore order so
    that citizens, tourists, and federal workers can live and work
    peacefully in the Nation’s capital. Our Nation’s capital should be
    the envy of the world, not a disgrace.

**MAKING AMERICA SAFE AGAIN:** President Trump campaigned on the promise
to make America safe again and restore Washington, D.C. to glory.

-   On President Trump’s first return to Washington since leaving office
    in 2021, he lamented “the filth and the decay” that marred the
    Nation’s capital in his absence.
-   President Trump later promised that his Administration would “take
    over the horribly run capital of our nation, Washington, D.C., and
    clean it up, renovate it, and rebuild our capital city so that it is
    no longer a nightmare of murder and crime, but rather it will become
    the most beautiful capital anywhere in the world.”
-   In March, President Trump created a task force to make D.C. safe and
    beautiful, surging law enforcement to restore order and enhance the
    city’s infrastructure.
-   President Trump: “Just like I took care of the Border, where you had
    ZERO Illegals coming across last month, from millions the year
    before, I will take care of our cherished Capital, and we will make
    it, truly, GREAT AGAIN! Before the tents, squalor, filth, and Crime,
    it was the most beautiful Capital in the World. It will soon be that
    again.”
-   Earlier this month, President Trump mobilized the national guard and
    took over the D.C. Metro Police Department to restore law and order
    in the District of Columbia.
    -   As a result of President Trump’s decisive actions, crime in D.C.
        has already started to fall, with robbery down 46% carjacking
        down 83%, and violent crime down 22%.
