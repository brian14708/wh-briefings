title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Exempts Agencies with National Security
  Missions from Federal Collective Bargaining Requirements'

**PROTECTING OUR NATIONAL SECURITY:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order using authority granted by the Civil Service
Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) to end collective bargaining with Federal
unions in the following agencies with national security missions:

-   ***Hydropower Facilities in the Bureau of Reclamation***. Energy
    security is a critical national security mission. The Bureau of
    Reclamation operates 53 hydropower plants that generate enough
    electricity to power 3.8 million homes. These hydropower plants
    provide critical black start capacity (the ability to resume
    operations without requiring external power). This is important for
    restarting the electric grid in case of a major outage.
-   ***National Aeronautics and Space Administration*** ***(NASA)*.**
    NASA develops and operates advanced air and space technologies, like
    satellite, communications, and propulsion systems, that are critical
    for U.S. national security.

-   ***National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service
    (NESDIS) and National Weather Service (NWS), each part of the
    National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration*.** NWS was first
    established as a subdivision of the U.S. Army Signal Service Corps.
    Today NWS and NESDIS provide weather and climate data that inform
    the weather forecasting used to plan U.S. military deployments.
    Weather forecasts have long been critical factor in the success or
    failure of military operations.
-   ***Office of the Commissioner of Patents, Patent and Trademark
    Office (PTO)***. The Invention Secrecy Act tasks the PTO with
    reviewing inventions made in the United States, assessing whether
    their release could harm national security, and if so, issuing
    secrecy orders that prevent public disclosure. Effectively
    performing this work is essential to ensuring U.S. inventions with
    military or other national security applications do not fall into
    enemy hands.
-   ***U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM)***. USAGM is an arm of U.S.
    public diplomacy; supporting U.S. national security is one of its
    key functions.

**ENSURING THAT AGENCIES OPERATE EFFECTIVELY:** Certain procedural
requirements in Federal labor-management relations can create delays in
agency operations. These delays can impact the ability of agencies with
national security responsibilities to implement policies swiftly and
fulfill their critical missions.

-   Collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) remain in effect until their
    expiration, limiting agencies’ ability to modify policies promptly. 
-   Even when changes are permissible under CBAs, agencies must complete
    “midterm” union bargaining, which can delay the implementation of
    time-sensitive national security measures.

**SAFEGUARDING AMERICAN INTERESTS:** President Trump is taking action to
ensure that agencies vital to national security can execute their
missions without delay and protect the American people. The President
needs a responsive and accountable civil service to protect our national
security.
