  and Enforce the Law in Washington, D.C.'

**MEASURES TO END CASHLESS BAIL IN OUR NATION’S CAPITAL:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order taking steps to
ensure that cashless bail in Washington, D.C. is eliminated.

-   The Order tasks the relevant law enforcement agencies and officials
    that are members of the D.C. Safe and Beautiful Task Force to work
    to ensure that arrestees in the District of Columbia are held in
    Federal custody to the fullest extent permissible under applicable
    law, and to pursue Federal charges and pretrial detention for such
    arrestees whenever possible.
-   The Order directs the Attorney General to determine whether the
    District of Columbia continues to maintain its cashless bail policy
    for crimes that pose a clear threat to public safety, including
    murder, rape, carjacking, assault, burglary, looting, and more. 
-   If the District’s cashless-bail policy remains in place, the Order
    instructs the Administration to take appropriate actions, which may
    include Federal funding decisions, services, or approvals, as well
    as actions the Attorney General identifies as necessary and
    appropriate because of the emergency conditions.

**STOPPING DANGEROUS RELEASE POLICIES IN D.C.:** The District of
Columbia’s cashless bail policies allow dangerous individuals to be
released quickly, endangering residents, visitors, and Federal workers,
and force law enforcement to repeatedly arrest the same offenders.

-   Under D.C. law, cash bail is effectively outlawed, meaning that the
    overwhelming majority of individuals arrested and awaiting trial are
    released back onto the streets.
-   A journalist was reportedly injured and sexually abused near Union
    Station by a homeless man, only to be released back onto the streets
    before his trial.
-   A man who threw a Subway sandwich at a Federal officer has been
    released on his own recognizance, despite being charged with a
    sentence that carries up to eight years in Federal prison.
-   A man was released after being charged with inappropriately touching
    three women in Northwest Washington, only to be arrested again just
    two days later for sexually abusing another three women in broad
    daylight.
-   Two days after a man was released from court on a misdemeanor charge
    of assaulting a police officer, he was then charged in a fatal
    stabbing on a Metro train.
-   Under the District’s cashless bail policy, law enforcement officers
    risk their lives to arrest dangerous criminals, only to be forced to
    arrest the same individuals, sometimes for the same crimes, while
    they repeatedly endanger American citizens visiting our Nation’s
    capital and federal workers discharging their duties to our Nation.
-   President Trump must protect our Nation’s capital and Federal
    workers to ensure that the operations and conduct of the
    responsibilities of the Federal government are carried out safely
    and successfully.
-   A 2023 study out of Yolo County, California found that its “Zero
    Bail” policy resulted in 163% more crime and 200% more violent crime
    compared to those who posted bail.

**MAKING AMERICA SAFE AGAIN:** The American people elected President
Trump to get tough on crime and restore safety to communities
nationwide.

-   President Trump: “When I’m reelected, I will crack down on the
    left-wing jurisdictions that refuse to prosecute dangerous criminals
    and set loose violent felons on cashless bail… If you kill somebody,
    there’s no bond. Don’t worry about it. Go ahead. Kill somebody else.
    These people are crazy, I’ll tell you.”
-   Earlier this month, President Trump mobilized the national guard and
    invoked emergency authority over the D.C. Metro Police Department to
    restore law and order in the District of Columbia.
-   On his first day in office, President Trump sealed the southern
    border and launched the largest deportation operation in history to
    remove criminal illegal aliens.
-   He has consistently pushed for stronger law enforcement policies to
    ensure violent offenders are detained, protecting law-abiding
    Americans from repeat criminals.
