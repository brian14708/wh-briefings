title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Prevents Improper Use of Federal Grants
  for Political Lobbying'
---
 
**INVESTIGATIONS INTO USE OF FEDERAL GRANT FUNDS:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum to increase the
integrity of Federal grantmaking by preventing its diversion to
political lobbying activities.

-   The Memorandum directs the Attorney General to investigate whether
    Federal grant funds are being illegally used to support lobbying
    activities and to take appropriate enforcement action.
-   The Memorandum further directs the Attorney General to report to the
    President within 180 days on the progress of her investigation.

**SAFEGUARDING TAXPAYER DOLLARS:** President Trump is enhancing
accountability in Federal spending, including grantmaking, by ensuring
that taxpayer funds aren’t diverted to support political or lobbying
activity.

-   Taxpayer funds are being spent on grants with highly political
    overtones, raising the concern that they are supporting political or
    lobbying activities.
    -   The National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded a grant that
        adapted an LGBTQ+ teen pregnancy prevention program for
        “transgender boys.”

    -   The U.S. National Science Foundation funded a grant on advancing
        racial justice in elementary mathematics. 
-   Federal law strictly limits the use of grant funds for lobbying or
    supporting political candidates or parties for obvious
    reasons—taxpayer funds should be used to benefit the general public,
    not to support political or lobbying activities.  This prohibition
    must be enforced to prevent grantees from using taxpayer funds to
    advocate for more taxpayer funds for themselves.

**PROMOTING EFFICIENCY:** From his very first day in office, President
Trump has been cracking down on waste, fraud, and abuse in the Federal
government.

-   President Trump’s Administration has undertaken myriad actions to
    streamline the Federal government, stop wasteful spending, eliminate
    unnecessary programs, and reduce bureaucratic inefficiency.
-   President Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum to ensure funding
    to Nongovernmental Organizations (NGOs) advances U.S. interests.
-   President Trump launched a 10-to-1 deregulation initiative, ensuring
    every new rule is justified by clear benefits.
-   President Trump required cost-effective commercial solutions in
    Federal contracts.
