title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Stops Wasteful Grantmaking'
---
 
**ENDING GRANT ABUSE:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an
Executive Order stopping unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats from
wasting taxpayer dollars on frivolous grants.

-   Going forward, President Trump’s appointees will review funding
    opportunity announcements and grant awards to verify that each grant
    dollar benefits Americans instead of lining grantees’ pocketbooks or
    furthering causes that damage America.
-   Award decisions will undergo more rigorous evaluation by political
    appointees and subject matter experts to ensure they benefit the
    American public, align with Administration priorities, and are
    coordinated across agencies to avoid duplication.
-   The Order also allows for the termination of future grants that do
    not meet these criteria, including if grantees use their awards in a
    manner that is inconsistent with the policy objectives in the Order.
-   The Order mandates that agencies simplify funding opportunity
    announcements with plain language.
-   The Order directs agencies to award grants to a wide array of
    meritorious grantees, not just the universities and nonprofits that
    have received awards year after year.

**FUNDING PROJECTS THAT BENEFIT AMERICANS:** The Trump Administration
has already terminated many wasteful grants. Today’s Executive Order
helps ensure that bureaucrats can’t make the same mistakes in the
future.

-   Federal grants have funded, for example:
    -   Drag shows in Ecuador;

    <!-- -->

    -   Training doctoral candidates in critical race theory; and

    <!-- -->

    -   Developing transgender-sexual-education programs.
-   Federal grants have supported dangerous, harmful projects that
    undermine national security and fundamental rights.
    -   An unsafe lab in Wuhan, China—the most likely source of the
        COVID-19 pandemic—engaged in gain-of-function research funded by
        the National Institutes of Health.

    <!-- -->

    -   In a direct assault on free speech, the National Science
        Foundation allocated millions to develop AI-powered social media
        censorship tools.

    <!-- -->

    -   Taxpayer-funded grants have supported free services for illegal
        immigrants, as well as organizations that worked against
        American interests abroad.
-   Ideological bias has also long plagued grantmaking.
    -   A 2024 study revealed that over one-quarter of new National
        Science Foundation grants were allocated to DEI and other
        far-left initiatives.
-   This Executive Order provides the oversight required to ensure
    taxpayer dollars are not misused any longer.
-   Moving forward, the Administration is committed to implementing
    robust policies and review processes to prevent the issuance of new
    contracts and grants that do not serve the public interest or align
    with national priorities.

**AWARDING GRANTS BASED ON MERIT:** Federal grant money should be
awarded based on a grantee’s ability to produce results, not based on
its ability to hire lawyers and grant-writing experts.

-   Since Day One, President Trump has prioritized eliminating waste and
    fraud in the Federal government, ensuring Federal spending aligns
    with American interests.
-   President Trump has also prioritized merit-based decisions starting
    with the Merit Hiring Plan for the Federal workforce and further
    prioritizing for grant recipients with this Executive Order.
-   President Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum to ensure funding
    to Nongovernmental Organizations (NGOs) advances U.S. interests and
    multiple Executive Orders to prevent taxpayer dollars from funding
    radical ideologies such as DEI, gender ideology, and the green new
    scam.
-   The Trump Administration has already terminated thousands of
    contracts, saving American taxpayers billions of dollars.
