title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Guarantees Fair Banking for All Americans'
---
 
**PROHIBITING POLITICIZED OR UNLAWFUL DEBANKING:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to ensure that Federal
regulators do not promote policies and practices that allow financial
institutions to deny or restrict services based on political beliefs,
religious beliefs, or lawful business activities, ensuring fair access
to banking for all Americans.

-   The Order directs Federal banking regulators to remove reputational
    risk and other equivalent concepts that enable politicized or
    unlawful debanking from their guidance, examination manuals and
    other materials.
-   The Order instructs the Small Business Administration to require all
    financial institutions subject to its jurisdiction to make
    reasonable efforts to reinstate clients and potential clients
    previously denied services due to unlawful debanking.
-   The Order directs the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation
    with the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, to develop
    a comprehensive strategy to further combat politicized or unlawful
    debanking activities, including potential legislative or regulatory
    solutions.
-   The Order requires Federal banking regulators to review financial
    institutions for past or current policies encouraging politicized or
    unlawful debanking and take remedial actions, including fines or
    consent decrees.
-   The Order further requires Federal banking regulators to review
    supervisory and complaint data for instances of unlawful debanking
    based on religion and refer such cases to the Attorney General.

**ADDRESSING UNFAIR BANKING PRACTICES:** President Trump believes that
no American should be denied access to financial services because of
their political or religious beliefs, and that banking decisions must
solely be made on the basis of individualized, objective, and risk-based
analyses.

-   This Order responds to the systemic abuses by financial institutions
    that undermine free expression and economic opportunity. Individuals
    and businesses that are debanked cannot hold a bank account, process
    everyday transactions, or participate fully in our economy.
-   One major banking institution denied ticket-payment processing
    services for a Republican event, reversing the decision only after
    it received public attention.
-   Federal regulators encouraged banks to flag individuals for
    transactions with companies like Bass Pro Shop or Cabela’s, or for
    using terms like “Trump” or “MAGA” in peer-to-peer payments, without
    evidence of criminal activity.
-   President Trump has stated that two major banks even denied his own
    business.
-   Earlier this year, the Senate Banking Committee held a hearing on
    this issue, with witnesses sharing their own firsthand experiences
    of being debanked.
-   Operation Chokepoint, a well-documented Federal debanking
    initiative, targeted lawful industries for political reasons.
-   The digital assets industry has also been the target of unfair
    debanking initiatives.
-   These practices erode public trust in banking institutions and
    regulators, harm livelihoods, freeze payrolls, and impose
    significant financial burdens on law-abiding Americans.

**UPHOLDING ECONOMIC FREEDOM:** President Trump is committed to
protecting Americans’ constitutional rights and reducing regulatory
overreach that stifles American businesses and individuals.

-   President Trump has expressed that the banks “discriminate against
    many conservatives,” including himself.
-    President Trump: “The banks discriminate against conservatives,
    they discriminate against religion, because they’re afraid of the
    radical left, I suspect. I think the bank regulators are doing a big
    number of the banks because they’re not allowed to do business with
    you. And we’re going to get those banks when we get in office. We’re
    going to get them. Nobody knows the banking industry better than me,
    and I’m not going to let them take advantage of you any longer.
    They’ve taken advantage and what they do to the people in this room,
    and by the way, millions and millions of others, is a disgrace.
    We’re going to end it.”
-   The Trump Administration has already ended Operation Chokepoint 2.0
    once and for all by working to end regulatory efforts that deny
    banking services to the digital assets industry.
