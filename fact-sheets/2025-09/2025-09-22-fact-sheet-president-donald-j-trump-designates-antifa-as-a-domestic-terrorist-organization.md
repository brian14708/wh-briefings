  Organization'
---
 
**DESIGNATING ANTIFA AS A DOMESTIC TERRORIST ORGANIZATION:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Order to designate Antifa as a
domestic terrorist organization.

-   The Order notes that Antifa is a militarist, anarchist enterprise
    that calls for the overthrow of the U.S. government, law enforcement
    authorities, and our system of law—using illegal means, including
    violence and terrorism, to accomplish these goals.
-   The Order directs the Federal government to investigate, disrupt,
    and dismantle all illegal operations conducted by Antifa or any
    person claiming to act on behalf of Antifa. It also calls for
    investigating, disrupting, and dismantling the funding sources
    behind such operations.

**DISMANTLING ANTIFA’S USE OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE:** Antifa engages in
coordinated efforts to obstruct enforcement of Federal laws, with the
goal of achieving policy objectives by coercion and intimidation – this
is domestic terrorism.

-   Antifa has engaged in armed standoffs with law enforcement,
    organized riots, violently assaulted ICE and other law enforcement
    officers, and engages in routine doxing of political figures and
    activists, threatening public safety.
    -   ICE officers are now facing a 1000% increase in assaults against
        them.

    -   An Antifa-affiliated group in Portland, Oregon, doxed ICE
        officers, publishing their names, pictures, and personal
        addresses online.

    -   A journalist was violently assaulted by Antifa protestors while
        reporting on a protest in Portland.

    -   Using pepper spray, baseball bats, and tasers, Antifa members
        violently attacked Trump supporters during a Patriot March in
        Pacific Beach, California.
-   The group recruits and radicalizes young Americans to engage in this
    violence and works to conceal identities of members and funding
    sources, frustrating law enforcement efforts.
-   Antifa’s efforts to advance political violence and suppress lawful
    political speech must be stopped.

**RESTORING LAW AND ORDER:** Every American deserves to be safe, and
President Trump is dedicated to restoring law and order in communities
across the United States.

-   President Trump: “I am pleased to inform our many U.S.A. Patriots
    that I am designating ANTIFA, A SICK, DANGEROUS, RADICAL LEFT
    DISASTER, AS A MAJOR TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. I will also be strongly
    recommending that those funding ANTIFA be thoroughly investigated in
    accordance with the highest legal standards and practices.”
-   President Trump has been relentless in his efforts to combat
    terrorism, from designating cartels as foreign terrorist
    organizations to ordering military strikes on narcoterrorists.
-   President Trump has deployed Federal resources to stop the violence
    in our cities, including sending the National Guard to Los Angeles,
    Washington, D.C., and Memphis.
