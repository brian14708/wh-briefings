title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Announces Actions to Provide Greater
  Transparency and Accuracy in Prescription Drug Advertisements'
---
 
**ADDRESSING MISLEADING PRESCRIPTION DRUG ADVERTISEMENTS:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum to protect
Americans by ensuring direct-to-consumer prescription drug
advertisements are providing consumers with full and accurate
information.

-   The Memorandum directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to
    ensure transparency and accuracy in direct-to-consumer prescription
    drug advertisements, including by increasing the amount of
    information regarding any risks associated with the use of
    prescription drugs.
-   The Memorandum directs the Commissioner of the Food and Drug
    Administration to take action to enforce legal requirements that
    advertisements for prescription drugs be truthful and not
    misleading. 

**PROTECTING PATIENTS:** President Trump is taking action to protect
patients from the negative effects of direct-to-consumer prescription
drug advertising.

-   Pharmaceutical companies spend more money on direct-to-consumer
    advertising than almost any other industry, spending over $10
    billion in 2024.
-   Only one other nation allows prescription drug manufacturers to
    directly influence patients through direct-to-consumer advertising.
-   These ads can mislead the public about the full risks and benefits
    of a drug, encourage medicine over lifestyle changes, and
    inappropriately intervene in the relationship between a patient and
    physician.
-   Advertising, particularly through non-traditional channels such as
    social media influencer campaigns, has not been sufficiently
    monitored for compliance with law.

**DELIVERING ON PROMISES TO PUT AMERICANS FIRST AND PROMOTE RADICAL
TRANSPARENCY:** President Trump is delivering on his promise to put
Americans first and bring radical transparency to the American people.

-   President Trump has been relentless in his efforts to protect
    Americans from the negative consequences of actions taken by
    pharmaceutical manufacturers:
    -   President Trump: “I’ve \[never\] been loyal to the special
        interests; I have been loyal to our patients and our people that
        need drugs — prescription drugs — and devoted myself completely
        to fighting for the American people.”
-   Earlier this year, President Trump signed an Executive Order to
    rapidly implement and enforce the Trump healthcare price
    transparency regulations originally implemented during his first
    term, which were slow walked back by the Biden administration.
-   Additionally, President Trump signed an Executive Order to bring the
    prices Americans pay for prescription drugs in line with those paid
    by other nations, demanding most-favored-nation pricing from drug
    manufacturers.
