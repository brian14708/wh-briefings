title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Launches the Gold Card Program'
---
 
**ESTABLISHING THE GOLD CARD:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed
an Executive Order to create the Gold Card visa program, facilitating
expedited immigration for aliens who make significant financial gifts to
the United States.

-   The Order directs the Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with
    the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security, to establish a “Gold
    Card” program.
    -   The program facilitates expedited immigrant visas for aliens
        donating $1 million individually or $2 million if paid for by a
        corporation or similar entity on behalf of an individual.
-   The Order instructs that these gifts serve as evidence of
    exceptional business ability and national benefit, expediting
    adjudication consistent with legal and security concerns.
-   The Order directs the Secretary of Commerce to deposit the gifts
    into the Treasury and use them to promote commerce and American
    industry.
-   The Order requires the Secretaries to take all necessary and
    appropriate steps to implement the Gold Card program, including
    establishing application processes, fees, and potential expansions
    to other visa categories.

**REFORMING IMMIGRATION FOR NATIONAL BENEFIT:** This Order will realign
Federal immigration policy with the Nation’s interests and bring
prosperity to America.

-   The Biden Administration’s lax immigration policies enabled cartels,
    terrorists, and malign actors to exploit our borders, overwhelming
    our communities and forcing emergency declarations in border towns.
-   The Biden Administration also permitted abuse of the refugee
    process, straining resources without regard for America’s economic
    or security interests.
-   The Gold Card prioritizes entry for high-value contributors to
    American society, including successful entrepreneurs, investors, and
    businessmen.
-   By requiring substantial gifts, the program will generate revenue
    and provide certainty to immigrants who can make significant
    contributions to the American economy.

**BUILDING AMERICA’S FUTURE:** President Trump is working relentlessly
to undo the disastrous policies of the Biden Administration to drive
unprecedented investments to America.

-   Early in his second term, President Trump proposed Gold Cards, a
    vision he is now delivering to attract wealthy investors and
    entrepreneurs. 
-   President Trump’s unwavering commitment to revitalizing American
    industry has spurred trillions of dollars in foreign investment
    pledges. 
-   Additionally, the President’s tough trade negotiations have led to
    massive deals for the United States, such as Japan’s $550 billion
    investment commitment and the European Union’s $600 billion
    investment commitment to the United States.
-   President Trump’s vision is supercharging economic growth and
    positioning the U.S. as the world’s premier hub for entrepreneurs
    and business.
