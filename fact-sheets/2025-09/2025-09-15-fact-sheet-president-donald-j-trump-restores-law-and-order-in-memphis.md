**MAKING MEMPHIS SAFE AGAIN:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed a
Presidential Memorandum to address rampant crime in Memphis, Tennessee.

-   The Memorandum establishes a Memphis Safe Task Force tasked with
    ending street and violent crime in Memphis to the greatest possible
    extent, including by coordinating closely with State and local
    officials in Tennessee, Memphis, and neighboring jurisdictions to
    share information, develop joint priorities, and maximize resources
    to make Memphis safe and restore public order.
    -   The task force will be comprised of members of key government
        agencies and is encouraged to utilize the strategies and
        principles developed during the District of Columbia crime
        crackdown to address violent and property crime in Memphis.

    -   The task force is authorized to request operational assistance
        from and coordinate with the Memphis Police Department, the
        Tennessee Highway Patrol, the Memphis Area Transit Authority, a
        number of other key law enforcement departments and agencies
        throughout Tennessee and in Memphis, and other officials as
        permitted by law.
-   The Memorandum tasks the Secretary of War with requesting the
    Governor of Tennessee make Tennessee National Guard units available
    to support public safety and law enforcement operations in Memphis.
-   The Memorandum also directs the Secretary of War to coordinate with
    State Governors to mobilize National Guard personnel from those
    states to support this effort.

**RESTORING LAW AND ORDER:** Memphis is suffering from tremendous levels
of violent crime that have overwhelmed its local government’s ability to
respond effectively, prompting State and local leaders to request
Federal assistance to restore public safety and order.

-   Memphis is a beacon of American culture that was Elvis’s home, is
    often called the birthplace of rock and roll and the blues, and is
    home to historic landmarks such as Graceland, Beale Street, and the
    Memphis Pyramid.
-   According to FBI data, Memphis had the highest violent crime rate in
    the country in 2024.
-   Memphis has some of the highest rates of murder, robbery, aggravated
    assault, and property crimes in the nation.
-   Memphis’s murder rate is roughly four times higher than that of
    Mexico City, Mexico and 27 times higher than that of communist-run
    Havana, Cuba.
-   This year, Memphis has seen 150 murders so far – far too high a
    number.
-   The Governor of Tennessee has requested the Federal government’s
    assistance to restore order in Memphis.

**MAKING AMERICA SAFE AGAIN:** The American people elected President
Trump to restore law and order in communities across the United States.

-   President Trump established a Make the District of Columbia Safe and
    Beautiful task force and deployed the National Guard to Washington,
    D.C. to rebuild it from a “nightmare of murder and crime” into the
    safest and most beautiful capital in the world.
    -   As a result of the President’s intervention, crime in D.C. has
        fallen dramatically.
-   President Trump mentioned he would “put that early on the list” when
    asked what he could do to help Memphis’s crime problem.
-   Immediately upon taking office, President Trump launched the largest
    deportation operation in our nation’s history to remove criminal
    illegal aliens who threaten public safety and national security. 
-   Every American deserves to be safe, and President Trump is dedicated
    to making cities secure again by deploying Federal resources to stop
    the violence.
