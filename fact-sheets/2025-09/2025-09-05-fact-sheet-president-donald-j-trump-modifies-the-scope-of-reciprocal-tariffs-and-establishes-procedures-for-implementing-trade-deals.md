title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Modifies the Scope of Reciprocal Tariffs
  and Establishes Procedures for Implementing Trade Deals'
---
 
**STRENGTHENING THE ECONOMY AND NATIONAL SECURITY THROUGH TARIFFS AND
TRADE DEALS:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive
Order modifying the scope of the reciprocal tariffs that he first
announced on April 2, 2025, and establishing a framework to implement
agreements with our trading partners.

-   President Trump is strengthening the international economic position
    of the United States and protecting American workers by modifying
    the scope of reciprocal tariffs.
    -   On April 2, the President imposed historic global reciprocal
        tariffs to address the national emergency posed by our large and
        persistent trade deficit, which is driven by the absence of
        reciprocity in our trade relationships and other harmful
        policies perpetuated by other countries, and by the consequences
        of that trade deficit.

    <!-- -->

    -   These tariffs have applied to nearly all imports, except for
        certain classes of products, such as articles subject to 50
        U.S.C. § 1702(b); articles potentially subject to other tariff
        regimes like pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and lumber
        articles; and articles listed in Annex II of Executive Order
        14257.

    <!-- -->

    -   The President has now determined that it is necessary and
        appropriate to modify the scope of the articles listed in Annex
        II to deal with the national emergency and protect America’s
        economic and national security.
        -   Some goods have been added to Annex II, meaning they will no
            longer be subject to reciprocal tariffs. These goods include
            bullion-related articles and certain critical minerals and
            pharmaceutical products subject to pending Section 232
            investigations.

        <!-- -->

        -   Some goods have been removed from Annex II, meaning they are
            now subject to reciprocal tariffs. These goods include
            certain aluminum hydroxide, resin, and silicone products.

    <!-- -->

    -   A modified Annex II is attached to today’s Order, and the
        modifications will take effect on September 8, 2025.
-   President Trump is advancing reciprocal trade by establishing a
    framework to implement existing and future trade deals.
    -   Today’s Order establishes the “Potential Tariff Adjustments for
        Aligned Partners” (PTAAP) Annex, which contains the list of
        products for which the President may be willing to apply only
        the Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) tariff upon the conclusion of any
        future reciprocal trade and security deal. These products fall
        in four categories:
        -   certain aircraft and aircraft parts;

        <!-- -->

        -   certain generic pharmaceuticals and their ingredients;

        <!-- -->

        -   unavailable natural resources and closely related derivative
            products; and

        <!-- -->

        -   certain agricultural products not grown or produced in
            sufficient quantity in the United States to meet domestic
            demand.

    <!-- -->

    -   To earn a reduction of reciprocal tariffs for some or all of the
        products listed in the PTAAP Annex, a trading partner must
        conclude a deal with the United States that helps mitigate the
        national emergency relating to the trade deficit. Additionally,
        the President will evaluate the extent of a trading partner’s
        commitments to address U.S. trade concerns, among other things,
        when determining which products on the PTAAP Annex qualify for a
        tariff reduction.

    <!-- -->

    -   The President delegated to senior officials, including the
        Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade
        Representative, the authority to implement deals with our
        trading partners.

**TAKING DECISIVE ACTION TO ADDRESS A NATIONAL EMERGENCY:** President
Trump is modifying the scope of reciprocal tariffs and streamlining the
implementation of trade deals to protect U.S. national security
interests, reinforce domestic supply chains, and bolster America’s
industrial base.

-   President Trump has taken several tariff actions in the interests of
    the American people, including:
    -   Imposing a 20% tariff on China to address the synthetic opioid
        supply chain, a 25% tariff on Mexico to address the flow of
        illicit drugs across our southern border, and a 35% tariff on
        Canada to address the flow of illicit drugs across our northern
        border.

    <!-- -->

    -   Imposing reciprocal tariffs, with many trading partners subject
        to individualized, *ad valorem* reciprocal tariffs, to rectify
        trade practices that contribute to America’s exploding annual
        goods trade deficit, and to remedy the consequences of the
        United States’ exploding trade deficit.

    <!-- -->

    -   Imposing an additional 40% tariff on Brazil following recent
        actions of the Government of Brazil that threaten the national
        security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.

    <!-- -->

    -   Imposing an additional 25% tariff on imports from India in
        response to its continued purchase of Russian Federation oil.

    <!-- -->

    -   Imposing Section 232 tariffs on imports of automobiles and auto
        parts, copper, steel, and aluminum to protect and strengthen
        America’s industries, which are critical to America’s economic
        welfare and national security.
-   These actions protect national security, strengthen supply chains,
    and support American workers and industries.
-   Today’s Order revises Annex II to more effectively address the
    national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 and establishes
    a process to streamline the implementation of trade deals with
    America’s trading partners.
-   By taking further action today, President Trump is ensuring
    America’s trade policies benefit the American people, strengthen
    national security, and promote economic fairness.

**DELIVERING FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE: **President Trump’s tariff
policies have generated significant investment into the United States,
strengthening the U.S. economy while addressing unfair trade practices
that have disadvantaged American workers for decades.

-   By imposing tariffs on countries with nonreciprocal trade practices,
    President Trump is incentivizing manufacturing on American soil and
    defending our industries.
-   The Trump Administration has worked with America’s trading partners
    to craft tailor-made trade deals designed to eliminate their most
    distortive trade practices and to ensure that trading partners align
    with the United States on key economic and national security
    matters.
    -   In a massive deal with the European Union, the EU has agreed to
        purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and make new investments of
        $600 billion in the United States, all by 2028, while accepting
        a 15% tariff rate, and charging American companies zero.

    <!-- -->

    -   Japan has agreed to invest $550 billion in the United States to
        rebuild and expand core American industries, as well as to
        further open its own market to U.S. exports, all while paying a
        baseline 15% tariff rate.

    <!-- -->

    -   The United States-United Kingdom trade deal includes billions of
        dollars of increased market access for American exports.

    <!-- -->

    -   Additional trade deals with Indonesia, the Philippines, South
        Korea, Vietnam, and others will, among other things, protect our
        industries, open foreign markets, and encourage foreign
        investment in American industries.
-   With billions in reshoring investments already announced, President
    Trump is bringing manufacturing jobs back to America, revitalizing
    communities, and strengthening supply chains.
-   The Administration will continue to use all available tools to
    protect our national security, advance our economic interests, and
    uphold a system of trade based in fairness and reciprocity.
