  of War'

**RESTORING THE DEPARTMENT OF WAR:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order to restore the historic name “Department of
War” as a secondary title for the Department of Defense. This is the
200<sup>th</sup> Executive Order the President has signed since taking
office.

-   The Order authorizes the Secretary of Defense, the Department of
    Defense, and subordinate officials to use secondary titles such as
    “Secretary of War,” “Department of War,” and “Deputy Secretary of
    War” in official correspondence, public communications, ceremonial
    contexts, and non-statutory documents within the executive branch.
-   The Order directs all executive departments and agencies to
    recognize and accommodate these secondary titles in internal and
    external communications.
-   The Order instructs the Secretary of War to recommend actions, to
    include legislative and executive actions, required to permanently
    rename the U.S. Department of Defense to the U.S. Department of War.

**PROJECTING STRENGTH AND RESOLVE:** The United States military is the
strongest and most lethal fighting force in the world, and the President
believes this Department should have a name that reflects its unmatched
power and readiness to protect national interests.

-   The Department of War, established in 1789, led the U.S. to victory
    in the War of 1812, World War I, and World War II, inspiring
    confidence in America’s military strength.
-   On January 8, 1790, President George Washington, in his First Annual
    Address to Congress, stated “To be prepared for war is one of the
    most effective means of preserving peace”.  Our founders knew that
    projecting strength would be the best way to ensure that we would
    rarely need to use it.
-   The name “Department of War” conveys a stronger message of readiness
    and resolve compared to “Department of Defense,” which emphasizes
    only defensive capabilities.
-   Restoring the name “Department of War” will sharpen the focus of
    this Department on our national interest and signal to adversaries
    America’s readiness to wage war to secure its interests.

**ADVANCING PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH:** The American people elected
President Trump to restore an America First approach, prioritizing peace
through strength and ensuring the world respects the United States
again.

-   In his first week in office, President Trump signed an Executive
    Order to prioritize readiness and lethality in our armed forces.
-   President Trump has emphasized restoring national pride in America’s
    military heritage, including honoring historic victories as the
    Nation approaches its 250<sup>th</sup> birthday.
-   To honor the Army’s 250<sup>th</sup> birthday, President Trump held
    a military parade in Washington, D.C., showcasing America’s military
    might and celebrating its storied legacy of valor and victory.
-   Under President Trump’s leadership, the U.S. military delivered a
    decisive and obliterating strike against Iran’s nuclear
    capabilities, demonstrating America’s unmatched military power and
    deterring further aggression.
-   Recruiting is now at its highest in decades, revitalizing the armed
    forces with a new generation of warriors committed to defending
    America’s interests.
