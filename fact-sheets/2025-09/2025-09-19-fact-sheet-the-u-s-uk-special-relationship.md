**COMMEMORATING OUR CLOSE BOND:** As President Donald J. Trump and First
Lady Melania Trump conclude their historic Second State Visit to the
United Kingdom, the United States reaffirms the enduring special
relationship with our closest ally—a partnership rooted in shared
history, common values, and a commitment to a more prosperous future.

-   President Trump is the only American president to have been granted
    two British State Visits.
-   The bond between the United States and the United Kingdom is like no
    other anywhere in the world, and we will always be friends.
-   President Trump: “Over the generations, British and American
    warriors have shed their blood side by side in defense of liberty
    and freedom—and that’s why it’s so imperative that the U.S. and the
    UK stand together for these fundamental rights and values of the
    English-speaking world.”

**SECURING THE TECH PROSPERITY DEAL:** During the visit President Trump
and Prime Minister Keir Starmer signed the Technology Prosperity Deal
(TPD), a landmark science and technology agreement that will propel the
U.S.–UK special relationship to new heights for the technological age.

-   The Deal commits our nations to working together on the cutting-edge
    technologies of the future: AI, quantum computing, and nuclear
    energy.
    -   The TPD establishes a flagship AI for Science research program
        between the U.S. Departments of Energy, Health, and the National
        Science Foundation and its UK counterparts geared towards
        cutting-edge biotechnology research and precision medicine.

-   To secure our supply chains, the United Kingdom will match U.S
    commitments to achieving full independence from Russian nuclear fuel
    by the end of 2028.

    Defence Innovation Organisation (UKDI) signed a joint declaration of
    intent to advance a next generation strategic partnership on defense
    innovation that will build efficiencies through prototyping of
    critical emerging and disruptive technology from the commercial
    sector. 
-   The United States and United Kingdom will pursue joint research and
    development to strengthen our respective defense industrial bases
    and maintain a competitive edge in emerging technologies.
