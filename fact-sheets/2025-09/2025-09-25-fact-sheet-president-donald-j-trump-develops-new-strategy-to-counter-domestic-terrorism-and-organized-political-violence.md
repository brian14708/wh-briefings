title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Develops New Strategy to Counter Domestic
  Terrorism and Organized Political Violence'
---
 
**COUNTERING DOMESTIC TERRORISM:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed a National Security Presidential Memorandum (NSPM) establishing a
comprehensive strategy to investigate, disrupt, and dismantle all stages
of organized political violence and domestic terrorism.

-   The NSPM directs the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Joint
    Terrorism Task Force (JTTFs) to coordinate this national strategy to
    investigate, prosecute, and disrupt entities and individuals engaged
    in political violence and intimidation designed to suppress lawful
    activity or obstruct the rule of law.
    -   This approach will focus on all aspects of the organized
        strategy that results in political violence and intimidation,
        including radicalization, recruitment, funding mechanisms,
        non-governmental organization involvement, related financial
        crimes, and the ultimate acts of political violence and
        intimidation themselves, using authorities across the entire
        Federal government and a broader investigative focus.
-   The NSPM requires the Attorney General to prosecute all Federal
    crimes related to organized political violence. The Attorney General
    is also directed to issue guidance that ensures domestic terrorism
    priorities include politically motivated terrorist acts like
    organized doxing campaigns, swatting, rioting, and property crimes.
    The guidance will also identify behaviors, fact patterns, and
    recurrent motivations common to organizations and entities that
    coordinate these acts in order to stop political violence before it
    occurs.
-   The NSPM instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to identify and
    disrupt financial networks that fund domestic terrorism and
    political violence, and directs the IRS Commissioner to ensure
    tax-exempt entities do not directly or indirectly finance political
    violence or domestic terrorism, referring violators to the
    Department of Justice.
-   It instructs the Attorney General to recommend groups or entities
    who meet specific criteria for potential designation as “domestic
    terrorist organizations.”
-   It directs the Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security
    to designate domestic terrorism a “National Priority Area,” in order
    to allocate funds and resources to protect against this threat.

**DISRUPTING ORGANIZED POLITICAL VIOLENCE:** The surge in political
violence in the United States is not random, but rather part of
sophisticated, organized campaigns of targeted intimidation and violence
requiring a new law enforcement strategy to fully address and prevent.

-   On September 10, beloved conservative leader Charlie Kirk was
    assassinated while speaking to college students at Utah Valley
    University in a horrific act of political violence.
-   This assassination is just the latest alarming escalation in an
    unmistakable pattern of political violence and domestic terrorism.
    -   The attempted assassination of Supreme Court Justice Brett
        Kavanaugh, the two attempts on President Trump’s life in 2024,
        and the 2024 assassination of a senior healthcare executive are
        just a few examples of this rampant and escalating threat to
        public order and a functioning democratic society.
-   Anti-police and “criminal justice” riots have left many dead and
    injured, and have inflicted over $2 billion in property damage
    nationwide.
-   Attacks on ICE officers have increased by more than 1,000% since
    January 21, 2025.
    -   Just yesterday, a shooting targeting an ICE facility in Dallas
        resulted in multiple casualties.
-   This political violence emerges from coordinated efforts to isolate
    and dehumanize specific targets to justify murder or violent action,
    obstruct law enforcement and the operations of the Federal
    government, and radicalize and recruit participants, all under the
    umbrella of self-described “anti-fascism” and anti-American
    principles.
-   A new law enforcement strategy that investigates all participants in
    these criminal and terroristic conspiracies, including the organized
    structures, networks, entities, organizations, funding sources, and
    predicate actions behind them, is required in order to prevent this
    violence and fully address this threat to the Nation.

**UPHOLDING AMERICAN VALUES:** Political violence has hurt too many
innocent people and taken too many lives, undermining our American
values of free speech, citizenship, the rule of law, patriotic and
familial devotion, and love of God.

-   President Trump: “For years, those on the radical left have compared
    wonderful Americans like Charlie \[Kirk\] to Nazis and the world’s
    worst mass murderers and criminals. This kind of rhetoric is
    directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our
    country today, and it must stop right now. My administration will
    find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity,
    and to other political violence, including the organizations that
    fund it and support it, as well as those who go after our judges,
    law enforcement officials, and everyone else who brings order to our
    country.”
-   President Trump has promoted patriotism through initiatives like the
    America 250 Task Force and expanded civics education to foster
    national pride and unity.
-   President Trump has strengthened free speech protections by
    directing agencies to combat censorship and ensure all Americans can
    speak their minds without fear of political or violent retribution.
-   President Trump restored order in the nation’s capital by declaring
    a crime emergency in Washington, D.C., ensuring the protection of
    residents, Federal workers, and institutions of democracy.
-   President Trump designated Antifa a domestic terrorist organization,
    directing the Federal government to investigate, disrupt, and
    dismantle all illegal operations conducted by Antifa or any person
    claiming to act on behalf of Antifa.
