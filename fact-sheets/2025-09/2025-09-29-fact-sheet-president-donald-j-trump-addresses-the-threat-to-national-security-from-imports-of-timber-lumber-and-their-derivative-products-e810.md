title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Addresses the Threat to National Security
  from Imports of Timber, Lumber, and Their Derivative Products'
---
 
**SUPPORTING AMERICA’S LUMBER INDUSTRY:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed a Proclamation invoking Section 232 of the Trade Expansion
Act of 1962 (Act) to impose tariffs on imports of timber, lumber, and
their derivative products (wood products) to bolster American industry
and protect national security.

-   The Proclamation imposes a 10% global tariff on imports of softwood
    lumber.
-   The Proclamation imposes a 25% global tariff on certain upholstered
    furniture, which will increase to 30% on January 1.
-   The Proclamation imposes a 25% global tariff on kitchen cabinets and
    vanities, which will increase to 50% on January 1.
-   Trading partners who negotiate with the United States to address the
    threat of wood imports to the national security of the United States
    may be able to secure an alternative to the pending tariff
    increases.
-   The United Kingdom, the European Union, and Japan will enjoy more
    favorable treatment that reflects the terms of their trade deals
    with the United States.
    -   The Section 232 tariff on subject wood imports from the United
        Kingdom will not exceed 10%.

    <!-- -->

    -   The combined Section 232 tariff and most-favored nation tariff
        on subject wood imports from the European Union and Japan will
        not exceed 15%.
-   Products that are not subject to these Section 232 tariffs will
    generally be subject instead to reciprocal tariffs.
-   The treatment of products on the list of Potential Tariff
    Adjustments for Aligned Partners (PTAAP) remains unchanged unless an
    antidumping or countervailing duty order applies.

**ADDRESSING THE THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY:** The Proclamation follows
the Secretary of Commerce’s completion of a Section 232 investigation
under the Act, which found that the present quantities and circumstances
of the imports of wood products threaten to impair the national
security.

-   President Trump recognizes that an overreliance on foreign timber,
    lumber, and their derivative products could jeopardize the United
    States’ defense capabilities, construction industry, and economic
    strength.
-   Wood products serve as essential inputs across multiple sectors,
    supporting national defense, critical infrastructure, economic
    stability, and industrial resilience in the United States.   
    -   Lumber plays a vital role in civilian construction and military
        infrastructure.

    <!-- -->

    -   The U.S. military spends over ten billion dollars annually on
        construction and is testing innovative wood products such as
        cross-laminated timber.

    <!-- -->

    -   It is vital for the United States to possess manufacturing
        capabilities in the wood and lumber sector to ensure readiness
        and guarantee the national security.
-   The United States has been a net importer of lumber since 2016,
    despite having the practical production capacity to supply 95% of
    the United States’ 2024 softwood consumption.
-   Foreign supply chains and major exporters increasingly fill U.S.
    demand, creating vulnerabilities to disruptions.
-   America’s reliance on imported lumber is exacerbated by foreign
    government subsidies and predatory trade practices, which undermine
    the competitiveness of the U.S. wood products industry.
-   By imposing tariffs on wood products, President Trump is countering
    foreign subsidies and predatory practices that distort markets,
    making imported lumber less competitive and incentivizing the growth
    of domestic wood production to achieve self-sufficiency and mitigate
    supply chain risks to national security. 

**BUILDING ON A RECORD OF SECURING CRITICAL INDUSTRIES AND SUPPLY
CHAINS:** This Proclamation builds on previous actions taken by the
Trump Administration to ensure U.S. trade and industrial policies serve
the national interest.

-   On Day One, President Trump established his America First Trade
    Policy to make America’s economy great again.
-   President Trump has repeatedly used Section 232 tariffs to protect
    against threats to our national security and to strengthen
    manufacturing critical for our national and economic security,
    including on steel, aluminum, copper, and autos.
    -   The Department of Commerce is currently conducting additional
        investigations, including on semiconductors, pharmaceuticals,
        commercial aircraft, wind turbines, robotics, unmanned aircraft
        systems, and personal protective equipment.
-   President Trump imposed reciprocal tariffs to take back America’s
    economic sovereignty, address nonreciprocal trade relationships that
    threaten our economic and national security, and to remedy the
    consequences of nonreciprocal trade.
-   President Trump has issued several Executive Orders, Proclamations,
    and Presidential Memoranda to boost mining, manufacturing, and
    investment in domestic industry, including by reducing regulations
    and eliminating bureaucracy.
