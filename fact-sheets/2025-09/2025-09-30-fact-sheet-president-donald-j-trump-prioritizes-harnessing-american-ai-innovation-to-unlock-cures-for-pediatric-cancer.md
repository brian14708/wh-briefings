title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Prioritizes Harnessing American AI Innovation
  to Unlock Cures for Pediatric Cancer'
---
 
**HARNESSING AMERICAN AI INNOVATION:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order to harness American AI innovation to unlock
cures and prevention strategies for pediatric cancer, and realize the
potential of health data, together with AI, to transform clinical
research and practice.

-   The Order instructs the MAHA Commission to work with the Assistant
    to the President for Science and Technology (APST) and the Special
    Advisor for AI and Crypto to develop innovative ways to use advanced
    technologies such as AI to unlock improved diagnoses, treatments,
    cures, and prevention strategies for pediatric and young adulthood
    cancer.
    -   They will identify opportunities for the Childhood Cancer Data
        Initiative (CCDI) at the National Cancer Institute, which
        President Trump launched in 2019, to collect, generate, and
        analyze childhood cancer data.
    -   They will also seek ways to improve data infrastructure, enhance
        data analysis of complex biologic systems, and improve clinical
        trial design, access, and outcomes with AI tools.
-   The Order also directs increased investment from existing Federal
    funds for the CCDI to ensure that the Federal government has the
    best available data for this initiative, and private sector
    engagement to ensure that advanced technologies, including AI, are
    used to unlock cures for pediatric cancer to the maximum possible
    extent.
-   The Secretary of Health and Human Services will fully integrate AI
    into current work on interoperability to provide data to inform
    research and clinical trial design in the private sector and
    academia, while ensuring that patients and parents control their
    health information.

**ADVANCING SCIENCE THAT WILL SAVE LIVES:** President Trump believes it
is vital we prioritize investment in AI-enabled science, build
world-class scientific datasets, and empower researchers and clinicians
with the AI capabilities needed to translate the data into improved care
for our children.

-   For too long, we have watched our children and their families battle
    cancer and its long-term chronic effects while healthcare systems
    often rely on outdated technologies and can be slow to adopt certain
    innovations.
-   Pediatric cancer remains the leading cause of disease-related death
    for children in the United States, and its incidence has increased
    by more than 40% since 1975.
-   AI has the potential to transform the current care and research
    approach for pediatric cancer by building on CCDI’s foundational
    data infrastructure, aggregating and generating new data, and using
    this data to make new discoveries—all secured with appropriate
    individual privacy protections.

**MAKING OUR CHILDREN HEALTHY AGAIN:** President Trump is committed to
reversing the chronic disease crisis and building a healthier future for
America, starting with our youngest generation. 

-   In the President’s first term, he established the CCDI to address
    the critical need to collect, generate, and analyze childhood cancer
    data.
    -   He also signed the Childhood Cancer STAR (Survivorship,
        Treatment, Access, Research) Act to advance childhood and young
        adult cancer research, enhance surveillance, and provide support
        for survivors and those affected by childhood cancer.
-   In February, President Trump signed an Executive Order establishing
    the President’s MAHA Commission, tasking the Commission with
    investigating and addressing the root causes of America’s escalating
    health crisis—with an initial focus on childhood chronic diseases.
-   In May, the MAHA Commission released the *Make Our Children Healthy
    Again Assessment* summarizing what is known and what questions
    remain regarding the childhood chronic disease crisis.
-   In July, President Trump signed an Executive Order revitalizing the
    President’s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition, and
    reestablishing the Presidential Fitness Test, with the aim of
    fostering a new generation of healthy, active citizens.
-   In July, President Trump released America’s AI Action Plan which
    called for investing in AI-enabled science and creating high-quality
    AI-ready scientific datasets.
-   In September, the MAHA Commission released *the Make Our Children
    Healthy Again Strategy*, a sweeping plan with more than 120
    initiatives to reverse the failed policies that fueled America’s
    childhood chronic disease epidemic.
