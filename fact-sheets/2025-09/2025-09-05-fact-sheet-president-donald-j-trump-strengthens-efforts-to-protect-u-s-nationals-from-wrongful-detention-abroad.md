title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Strengthens Efforts to Protect U.S.
  Nationals from Wrongful Detention Abroad'

**COUNTERING WRONGFUL DETENTIONS:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order to enhance efforts to protect U.S. nationals
from wrongful detention abroad by authorizing robust responses against
foreign governments engaging in such practices.

-   The Order empowers the Secretary of State to designate any foreign
    country as a State Sponsor of Wrongful Detention based on their
    involvement in or support for wrongful detentions of U.S. nationals.
-   It directs the Secretary of State to take appropriate actions with
    respect to designated countries, including sanctions,
    inadmissibility of nationals from those countries, travel
    restrictions, export controls, and other measures under existing
    laws, to deter and respond to wrongful detentions.
-   The Order allows the Secretary of State to terminate a designation
    if the foreign government releases wrongfully detained U.S.
    nationals, has demonstrated changes in leadership or policies with
    respect to wrongful detention, and provides credible assurances
    against future violations.
-   The Order also applies to entities controlling significant
    territory, even if not recognized as governments, to address
    non-state actors involved in wrongful detentions.

**SAFEGUARDING AMERICAN CITIZENS:** President Trump is addressing the
growing use of wrongful detentions by foreign adversaries as a coercive
tactic to undermine U.S. sovereignty and leadership.

-   Under the Biden Administration, our adversaries learned that they
    could take Americans as bargaining chips and that little to nothing
    would be done about it.
-    Biden’s weakness resulted in 24 more Americans taken captive than
    rescued in four years.
-   Wrongful detentions violate the rule of law and exploit American
    citizens, with cases like Marc Fogel’s detention in Russia lasting
    over three years.
-   This Order gives the Secretary of State the ability to leverage
    existing tools against those adversaries to protect Americans abroad
    and proactively combat this coercive tactic.

**UPHOLDING AMERICAN SOVEREIGNTY:** President Trump is committed to
bringing every American that is wrongfully detained abroad home.

-   President Trump has consistently advocated for a strong, America
    First foreign policy that deters adversaries from targeting U.S.
    nationals.
-   Since returning to office, President Trump and his Administration
    have secured the release of 72 detained Americans abroad, including:
    -   Marc Fogel—an American teacher who was wrongfully detained in a
        Russian prison for years—returned home in February, making good
        on a promise President Trump made to Fogel’s 95-year-old mother,
        Malphine.

        Trump’s inauguration.
