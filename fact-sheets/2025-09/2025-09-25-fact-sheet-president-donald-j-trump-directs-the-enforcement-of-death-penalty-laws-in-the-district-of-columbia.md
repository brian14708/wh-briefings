  Laws in the District of Columbia'

**DETERRING AND PUNISHING HEINOUS CRIMES:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum directing the Attorney General
and the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia to fully enforce
Federal capital punishment laws to deter and punish the most heinous
crimes in our Nation’s capital.

-   The Order directs these Federal prosecutors to seek the death
    penalty in all appropriate cases in the District of Columbia where
    the evidence and applicable facts justify such a sentence.
-   It directs the Attorney General and U.S. Attorney for the District
    of Columbia to pursue Federal jurisdiction to the maximum extent
    practicable for death-penalty-eligible crimes in Washington, D.C.

**PROTECTING PUBLIC SAFETY:** By enforcing the death penalty law against
D.C.’s worst offenders, President Trump underscores his determination to
protect our Nation’s capital for all Americans who visit and reside
there and ensure violent criminals face the toughest consequences under
law.

-   Enforcing Federal capital punishment—despite efforts by some
    politicians, lawyers, and non-governmental organizations to oppose
    it—has been a priority for President Trump, who signed Executive
    Order 14164 to restore proper enforcement of the federal death
    penalty on Day One.
-   Today’s Memorandum builds on this Order, directing the use of
    capital punishment in our Nation’s capital as a critical tool for
    protecting public safety, ensuring the worst criminals receive the
    worst punishment.
-   The District of Columbia’s lenient policies in recent years has
    fueled a crime emergency, endangering residents, visitors, and
    Federal operations.
-   Washington, D.C. has been among the Nation’s most dangerous
    cities—with a homicide rate of 27.3 per 100,000 residents in 2024.
    -   That was the fourth-highest homicide rate in the country—nearly
        six times higher than New York City and also higher than
        Atlanta, Chicago, and Compton.

**MAKING OUR NATION’S CAPITAL SAFE AGAIN:** President Trump campaigned
on the promise to make America safe again and restore Washington, D.C.
to glory.

-   On President Trump’s first return to Washington since leaving office
    in 2021, he lamented “the filth and the decay” that marred the
    Nation’s capital in his absence.
-   President Trump later promised that his Administration would “take
    over the horribly run capital of our nation, Washington, D.C., and
    clean it up, renovate it, and rebuild our capital city so that it is
    no longer a nightmare of murder and crime, but rather it will become
    the most beautiful capital anywhere in the world.”
-   In March, President Trump created a task force to make D.C. safe and
    beautiful, surging law enforcement to restore order and enhance the
    city’s infrastructure.
-   In August, President Trump mobilized the National Guard and utilized
    Section 740 of the Home Rule Act to restore law and order in the
    District of Columbia.
-   In late August, President Trump signed an Executive Order taking
    steps to ensure that cashless bail in Washington, D.C. is
    eliminated.
