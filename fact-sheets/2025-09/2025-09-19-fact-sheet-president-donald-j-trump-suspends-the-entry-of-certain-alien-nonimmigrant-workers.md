title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Suspends the Entry of Certain Alien
  Nonimmigrant Workers'
---
 
## Protecting American Jobs

Today, President Donald J. Trump signed a Proclamation to restrict the
entry into the United States of certain H-1B aliens as nonimmigrant
workers, requiring a $100,000 payment to accompany or supplement H-1B
petitions for new applications to curb abuses that displace U.S. workers
and undermine national security.

-   The Proclamation restricts entry for aliens as nonimmigrants to
    perform services in specialty occupations in the H-1B program unless
    their petition is accompanied by a $100,000 payment.
-   It directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to restrict approvals
    for petitions from aliens that are currently outside the United
    States that are not accompanied by the payment, and allows
    case-by-case exemptions if in the national interest.
-   The Proclamation requires employers to retain documentation of
    payment remittance, with the Secretary of State verifying payment
    during the petition process and the Departments of State and
    Homeland Security denying entry for non-payment for the relevant
    aliens and taking other relevant steps needed to implement the
    Proclamation.
-   It requires the Departments of Labor and Homeland Security to issue
    joint guidance for verification, enforcement, audits, and penalties.
-   The Proclamation directs the Secretary of Labor to initiative
    rulemaking to revise the prevailing wage levels for the H-1B program
    and directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to initiate
    rulemaking to prioritize high-skilled, high-paid H-1B workers.

## Combating H-1B Abuses

American workers are being replaced with lower-paid foreign labor,
creating an economic and national security threat to the nation.

-   The share of IT workers with H-1B visas has risen from 32% in FY
    2003 to over 65% in recent years.
-   Unemployment among recent computer science graduates has reached
    6.1% and 7.5% for computer engineering graduates — more than double
    the rates for biology or art history majors. The number of foreign
    STEM workers in the United States has more than doubled between 2000
    and 2019, while overall STEM employment only increased 44.5% during
    that time.
-   American companies are laying off their American technology workers
    and seemingly replacing them with H-1B workers:
    -   One company was approved for 5,189 H-1B workers in FY 2025,
        while laying off roughly 16,000 U.S. employees this year.

    -   Another company was approved for 1,698 H-1B workers in FY 2025,
        yet announced it was laying off 2,400 U.S. workers in Oregon in
        July.

    -   A third company has reduced its U.S. workforce by 27,000 since
        2022 while receiving 25,075 H-1B approvals.

    <!-- -->

    -   Yet another company reportedly cut 1,000 American jobs in
        February despite receiving 1,137 H-1B approvals for FY 2025.
-   American IT workers have even been reportedly forced to train their
    foreign replacements under nondisclosure agreements.
-   The H-1B program is creating disincentives for future American
    workers to choose STEM careers, which threatens our national
    security.
-   President Trump is imposing higher costs on companies seeking to use
    the H-1B program in order to address the abuse of the program, stop
    the undercutting of wages, and protect our national security.

## Prioritizing American Workers

Voters gave President Trump a resounding mandate to put American workers
first, and he has worked every day to deliver on that commitment.

-   President Trump has aggressively and successfully negotiated new
    trade deals to bring manufacturing jobs back home and attract new
    investments to the U.S.
-   President Trump is using tariffs as a strategic tool to rebuild
    American manufacturing, secure our supply chains, and protect U.S.
    national security.
    -   President Trump has implemented several Section 232 tariffs to
        protect manufacturing that has been undermined by unfair trade
        practices and global excess capacity.
-   Since President Trump returned to office, all employment gains have
    gone to American-born workers—unlike last year during the same
    period under President Biden, when all employment gains went to
    foreign-born workers.
-   The Trump Administration issued new guidance to ensure illegal
    aliens are not allowed access to federal workforce development
    resources and related grants, protecting job trainings for American
    workers.
