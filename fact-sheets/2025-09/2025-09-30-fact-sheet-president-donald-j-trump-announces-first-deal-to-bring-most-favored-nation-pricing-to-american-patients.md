title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Announces First Deal to Bring Most-Favored-Nation
  Pricing to American Patients'
---
 
**ADVANCING MOST-FAVORED-NATION PRICING: **Today, President Donald J.
Trump announced the first agreement with a major pharmaceutical company,
Pfizer, to bring American drug prices in line with the lowest paid by
other developed nations (known as the most-favored-nation, or MFN,
price).

-   The agreement will provide every State Medicaid program in the
    country access to MFN drug prices on Pfizer products, resulting in
    many millions of dollars in savings and continuing President Trump’s
    historic efforts to strengthen the program for the most vulnerable.
-   The agreement ensures foreign nations can no longer use price
    controls to freeride on American innovation by guaranteeing MFN
    prices on all new innovative medicines Pfizer brings to market. 
-   The agreement requires Pfizer to repatriate increased foreign
    revenue on existing products that Pfizer realizes as a result of the
    President’s strong America First U.S. trade policies for the benefit
    of American patients. 
-   The agreement requires Pfizer to offer medicines at a deep discount
    off the list price when selling directly to American patients.

   
**DELIVERING REDUCED COSTS: **Today’s actions will result in tangible
cost savings to American patients and the healthcare system as a whole.
Taken together, more than 100 million patients are impacted by the
diseases Pfizer’s medicines treat, and many of those will benefit from
the President’s successful negotiation of lower prices for Americans.
Examples include:

-   Eucrisa, a topical ointment for atopic dermatitis, will be made
    available at an 80% discount to patients purchasing directly.
-   Xeljanz, a widely used oral medication for rheumatoid arthritis,
    psoriatic arthritis, and ulcerative colitis, will be available at a
    40% discount to patients purchasing directly.
-    Zavzpret, a commonly utilized treatment for migraines, will be sold
    directly to patients at a 50% discount.

   
**ENDING GLOBAL FREELOADING ON AMERICAN PHARMACEUTICAL
INNOVATION:  **President Trump is taking decisive action to rebalance a
system that allows pharmaceutical manufacturers to offer low prices to
other wealthy nations while charging Americans significantly higher
prices.  

-   According to recent data, the prices Americans pay for brand-name
    drugs are more than three times the price other Organization for
    Economic Cooperation and Development nations pay, even after
    accounting for discounts manufacturers provide in the U.S. 
-   The United States has less than five percent of the world’s
    population, yet roughly 75% of global pharmaceutical profits come
    from American taxpayers.
-   Drug manufacturers benefit from generous research subsidies and
    enormous healthcare spending by the U.S. Government. Instead of
    passing that benefit through to American consumers, drug
    manufacturers then discount their products abroad to gain access to
    foreign markets and subsidize those discounts through high prices
    charged in America. Americans are subsidizing drug-manufacturer
    profits and foreign health systems, both in development and once the
    drugs are sold. 

   
**DELIVERING ON PROMISES TO PUT AMERICAN PATIENTS FIRST: **President
Trump is delivering on promises for American patients that the political
establishment did not believe were possible.

-   On May 12, 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order titled:
    “Delivering Most-Favored-Nation Prescription Drug Pricing to
    American Patients” directing the Administration to take numerous
    actions to bring American drug prices in line with those paid by
    similar nations.
-   On July 31, 2025, President Trump sent letters to leading
    pharmaceutical manufacturers outlining the steps they must take to
    bring down the prices of prescription drugs in the United States to
    match the lowest price offered in other developed nations 
-   President Trump has been relentless in his effort to address the
    unfair and outrageous prices Americans pay for prescription drugs:
    -   President Trump: “In case after case, our citizens pay massively
        higher prices than other nations pay for the same exact pill,
        from the same factory, effectively subsidizing socialism aboard
        \[abroad\] with skyrocketing prices at home. So we would spend
        tremendous amounts of money in order to provide inexpensive
        drugs to another country. And when I say the price is different,
        you can see some examples where the price is beyond anything —
        four times, five times different.”
