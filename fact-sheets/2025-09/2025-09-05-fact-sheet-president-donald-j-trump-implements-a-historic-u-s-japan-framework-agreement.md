title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Implements A Historic U.S.-Japan Framework
  Agreement'
---
 
**A NEW ERA OF U.S.-JAPAN TRADE RELATIONS:** Yesterday, President Donald
J. Trump signed an Executive Order implementing the framework agreement
between the United States and Japan that he announced on July 22, 2025.

-   The framework agreement provides American producers and
    manufacturers well over $15 billion of unprecedented access to
    Japanese markets while still accounting for U.S. national security
    needs.
    -   American farmers and producers will immediately benefit from the
        deal with Japan’s commitment to purchase $8 billion of U.S.
        agricultural goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizers,
        bioethanol, and sustainable aviation fuel.

    <!-- -->

    -   Japan will make stable and long-term incremental purchases of
        U.S. energy, including liquified natural gas, totaling $7
        billion per year.

    <!-- -->

    -   Japan will expedite implementation of a 75% increase in
        purchases of American rice.

    <!-- -->

    -   Japan will now recognize U.S. automotive standards and lift
        longstanding restrictions on U.S. car and truck imports,
        creating billions of dollars in increased market access for U.S.
        automakers. 

    <!-- -->

    -   Japan will provide Clean Energy Vehicle Introduction Promotion
        Subsidies for American cars.
-   Under the framework agreement, the United States will apply a
    baseline 15 percent tariff on nearly all Japanese imports entering
    the United States, including automobiles and auto parts, with
    separate sector-specific tariff treatment for steel and aluminum,
    copper, certain aerospace products, generic pharmaceuticals, generic
    pharmaceutical ingredients, and unavailable natural resources.

**INVESTING IN AMERICA:** Japan committed to provide President Trump
$550 billion to invest into the United States towards critical
industries of importance to our national and economic security.

-   Japan’s historic $550 billion investment commitment to President
    Trump will be invested in U.S. projects selected by President Trump,
    creating hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs, dramatically expanding
    domestic manufacturing, and securing American prosperity for
    generations.
-   The investments will fund projects in sectors across the United
    States to advance U.S. national and economic security, including
    semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, metals, critical minerals,
    shipbuilding, energy (including pipelines) and artificial
    intelligence/quantum computing.  
-   The United States and Japan are committed to enhancing economic and
    national security alignment to bolster supply chain resilience and
    innovation through complementary action to address non-market
    policies of third parties, as well as to combat duty evasion and
    cooperate on investment security and export controls.

**ADVANCING RECIPROCAL TRADE:** American products will no longer suffer
from inconsistent standards and trade barriers that prevent seamless and
fair trade.

-   Since Day One, President Trump challenged the assumption that
    American workers and businesses must tolerate unfair trade practices
    that have disadvantaged them for decades and contributed to our
    historic trade deficit.
-   President Trump’s bold trade strategy has yielded historic
    agreements with major trading partners, unlocking unprecedented
    investments in the United States and expanding market access for
    American goods. These deals strengthen America’s economic and
    security positions and create opportunities for American workers,
    farmers, and businesses.
    -   In a massive deal with the European Union, the EU has agreed to
        purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and make new investments of
        $600 billion in the United States, all by 2028, while accepting
        a 15% tariff rate, and charging American companies zero.

    <!-- -->

    -   The United States-United Kingdom trade deal includes billions of
        dollars of increased market access for American exports.

    <!-- -->

    -   Additional trade deals with Indonesia, the Philippines, South
        Korea, Vietnam, and others will protect our industries, open
        foreign markets, and encourage foreign investment in American
        industries.
-   These investments position the United States as the world’s premier
    destination for innovation, manufacturing, and economic growth.
