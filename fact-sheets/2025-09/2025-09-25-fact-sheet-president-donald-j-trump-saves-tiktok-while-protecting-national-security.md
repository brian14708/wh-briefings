title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Saves TikTok While Protecting National
  Security'
---
 
**SAVING TIKTOK FROM GOING DARK:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order saving TikTok from a ban while protecting
America’s national security.

-   President Trump has determined that the divestiture outlined in a
    proposed framework agreement, in which TikTok’s U.S. application
    would be operated by a new joint-venture company based in the United
    States, is a “qualified divestiture.”
    -   It will be majority-owned by U.S. investors, operated in the
        U.S. by a board of directors with national security and
        cybersecurity credentials, and subject to strict rules to
        protect Americans’ data and our national security.

    -   ByteDance will hold less than 20% of the stock as required by
        law, choose only one director of the seven-seat board, and be
        excluded from the company’s security committee.

    <!-- -->

    -    Oracle—one of the nation’s leading technology companies—will
        act as TikTok’s security provider and independently monitor and
        assure the safety of all operations in the U.S.
-   The proposed divestiture resolves the national security concerns and
    complies with the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary
    Controlled Applications Act (Act) by removing TikTok in the United
    States from China’s control.
    -   The divestiture puts the operation of the algorithm, code, and
        content moderation decisions under the control of the new joint
        venture.

    <!-- -->

    -   The divestiture prohibits the storage of sensitive U.S. user
        data in a manner that would allow such data to be under the
        control of a foreign adversary. All U.S. user data will be
        stored in a trusted, secure, and purpose-built cloud environment
        in the United States run by Oracle.

    <!-- -->

    -   The divestiture includes intense monitoring of software updates,
        the algorithm, and data flows, and it requires all
        recommendation models, including algorithms, that use U.S. user
        data to be retrained and monitored by America’s trusted security
        partners. This ensures U.S. content is free from improper
        manipulation.
-   The Order directs the Attorney General not to take action to enforce
    the Act for 120 days to allow the divestiture to be completed. 

**ENSURING AMERICANS BENEFIT:** President Trump found a solution for the
170 million Americans who use TikTok, ensuring users will be able to
safely enjoy the same global TikTok experience and view content from
around the world with the confidence that their data is secure in the
United States.

-   American content creators rely on TikTok for their livelihood, using
    it to build audiences, share their talents, and generate income in
    an increasingly digital economy.
-   Similarly, American businesses—large and small alike—depend on
    TikTok’s vast reach for advertising, connecting with customers, and
    driving economic growth.
-   Through this deal, President Trump has found a way to keep TikTok
    operational while resolving these national security issues with new
    American investment and control.
-   Preserving TikTok’s business will generate $178 billion in economic
    activity in the U.S. over the next four years and sustain thousands
    of U.S. jobs and businesses.

**THE ART OF THE DEAL:** President Trump has demonstrated time and again
his ability to close deals that put America and its citizens first.

-   President Trump has a long track record of national security and
    foreign policy successes, including enacting the Abraham Accords,
    replacing NAFTA with USMCA, and brokering the Phase One China Trade
    Deal.
-   Since returning to office, President Trump and his Administration
    have secured the release of 72 detained Americans abroad.
-   President Trump’s bold trade strategy has yielded historic
    agreements with major trading partners—including the European Union,
    United Kingdom, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea, Vietnam,
    and more—unlocking unprecedented investments in the United States
    and expanding market access for American goods.
-   President Trump’s pressure led Panama to exit China’s Belt and Road
    Initiative, a debt-trap diplomacy scheme the Chinese Communist Party
    uses to gain influence over developing nations.
-   President Trump: “And if we can save it, I think that would be a
    very good thing. And I think it would be economically good for
    America.”
