title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Unleashes American Drone Dominance'
---
 
**UNLEASHING AMERICAN DRONE DOMINANCE:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed an Executive Order to ensure continued American leadership
in the development, commercialization, and export of unmanned aircraft
systems (UAS)—otherwise known as drones. 

-   The Order directs the Administrator of the Federal Aviation
    Administration (FAA) to expand drone operations by enabling routine
    “Beyond Visual Line of Sight” drone operations for commercial and
    public safety missions, and to accelerate the development, testing,
    and scaling of American drone technologies, including advanced air
    mobility and autonomous operations.
-   The Order establishes an electric “Vertical Takeoff and Landing”
    integration pilot program to accelerate the deployment of safe and
    lawful vertical operations in the United States, selecting at least
    five pilot projects to advance applications like cargo transport and
    medical response.
-   It directs the FAA Administrator to deploy artificial intelligence
    (AI) tools to streamline and expedite UAS waiver reviews.
-   The Order directs the FAA Administrator to publish an updated
    roadmap for the integration of civil UAS into the National Airspace
    System.
-   It strengthens the domestic drone industrial base by prioritizing
    U.S.-manufactured UAS, promoting their export and taking action to
    ensure our technology remains secure from undue foreign influence
    and exploitation.
-   It enhances global competitiveness by streamlining regulations,
    expanding market access, and utilizing federal financing tools.
-   The Order supports the warfighter by expanding access to
    U.S.-manufactured high-performing drones while streamlining airspace
    and spectrum access.

**DRIVING INNOVATION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH:** President Trump is
harnessing the potential of drones to boost American productivity and
global leadership.

-   Drones enhance U.S. productivity, create high-skilled jobs, and are
    reshaping the future of aviation in areas such as logistics,
    infrastructure inspection, precision agriculture, emergency
    response, and public safety.
-   Emerging technologies, such as vertical takeoff and landing
    aircraft, promise to modernize methods for cargo delivery, passenger
    transport, and other advanced air mobility capabilities.
-   For too long, unfair foreign competition has posed a national
    security risk, disincentivizing our drone industrial base. This
    order is removing regulatory barriers and directing federal agencies
    to prioritize U.S.-manufactured drones, secure our supply chains,
    and promote American leadership in production, certification, and
    export.

**ADVANCING DRONE TECHNOLOGIES:** President Trump is advancing drone
technologies for economic, security, and public safety benefits.

-   In his first term, President Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum
    to speed up commercial drone integration, launching a UAS
    Integration Pilot Program to test innovative applications with
    State, local, and tribal partners.  
-   President Trump has deployed UAS to patrol the southern border,
    strengthening national security through advanced surveillance and
    monitoring capabilities.
-   President Trump has advanced cutting-edge drone technologies through
    smart, targeted regulation, unlocking economic growth while
    strengthening safety, security, and innovation.
