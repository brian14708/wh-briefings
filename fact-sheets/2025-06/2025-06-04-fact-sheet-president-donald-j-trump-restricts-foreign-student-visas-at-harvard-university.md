title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Restricts Foreign Student Visas at Harvard
  University'
---
 
**RESTRICTING FOREIGN STUDENT VISAS AT HARVARD:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump signed a Proclamation to safeguard national security by
suspending the entry of foreign nationals seeking to study or
participate in exchange programs at Harvard University. 

-   The Proclamation suspends the entry into the United States of any
    new Harvard student as a nonimmigrant under F, M, or J visas.
-   It directs the Secretary of State to consider revoking existing F,
    M, or J visas for current Harvard students who meet the
    Proclamation’s criteria.
-   The Proclamation does not apply to aliens attending other U.S.
    universities through the Student Exchange Visa Program (SEVP) and
    exempts aliens whose entry is deemed in the national interest.

**HARVARD HAS A DEMONSTRATED HISTORY OF CONCERNING FOREIGN TIES AND
RADICALISM:**

-   The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has long warned that
    foreign adversaries take advantage of easy access to American higher
    education to steal information, exploit research and development,
    and spread false information.
-   The University has seen a drastic rise in crime in recent years,
    while failing to discipline at least some categories of conduct
    violations on campus.
-   Harvard has failed to provide sufficient information to the
    Department of Homeland Security (DHS) about foreign students’ known
    illegal or dangerous activities, reporting deficient data on only
    three students.
-   Harvard is either not fully reporting its disciplinary records for
    foreign students or is not seriously policing its foreign students.
-   Harvard has also developed extensive entanglements with foreign
    adversaries, receiving more than $150 million from China alone. In
    exchange, Harvard has, among other things, hosted Chinese Communist
    Party paramilitary members and partnered with China-based
    individuals on research that could advance China’s military
    modernization.
    -   The Chinese Communist Party has sent thousands of mid-career and
        senior bureaucrats to study at U.S. institutions, with Harvard
        University considered the top “party school” outside the
        country. Xi Jinping’s own daughter attended Harvard as an
        undergraduate in the early 2010s.
-   Harvard has failed to adequately address violent anti-Semitic
    incidents on campus, with many of these agitators found to be
    foreign students.
-   Harvard has persisted in prioritizing diversity, equity, and
    inclusion (DEI) in its admissions, denying hardworking Americans
    equal opportunities by favoring certain groups, despite the U.S.
    Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling against its race-based practices.
-   These concerns have compelled the Federal government to conclude
    that Harvard University is no longer a trustworthy steward of
    international student and exchange visitor programs.

**HOLDING HARVARD ACCOUNTABLE:** President Trump wants our institutions
to have foreign students, but believes that the foreign students should
be people that can love our country.  

-   President Trump: “The students? Well, we want to have great students
    here. We just don’t want students that are causing trouble. We want
    to have students. I want to have foreign students.”
-   President Trump: “We have people who want to go to Harvard and other
    schools, they can’t get in because we have foreign students there.
    But I want to make sure that the foreign students are people that
    can love our country.”
-   President Trump: “We are still waiting for the Foreign Student Lists
    from Harvard so that we can determine, after a ridiculous
    expenditure of BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, how many radicalized lunatics,
    troublemakers all, should not be let back into our Country. Harvard
    is very slow in the presentation of these documents, and probably
    for good reason!”
