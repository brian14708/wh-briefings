  Sanctions'

**TERMINATING SANCTIONS ON SYRIA:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed a historic Executive Order terminating the Syria sanctions
program to support the country’s path to stability and peace.

-   The Order removes sanctions on Syria while maintaining sanctions on
    Bashar al-Assad, his associates, human rights abusers, drug
    traffickers, persons linked to chemical weapons activities, ISIS or
    its affiliates, and Iranian proxies.
-   The Order directs the Secretary of State to evaluate suspending
    sanctions, either in whole or in part if specific criteria are met,
    under the Caesar Act, a law that sanctions the Assad regime for
    atrocities.
-   The Order permits the relaxation of export controls on certain goods
    and waives restrictions on certain foreign assistance to Syria.
-   The Order directs the Secretary of State to review Hay’at Tahrir
    al-Sham’s (HTS) designation as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.
-   The Order directs the Secretary of State to review HTS and Ahmed
    al-Sharaa’s designations as Specially Designated Global Terrorists.
-   The Order directs the Secretary of State to review Syria’s
    designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism.
-   The Order directs the Secretary of State to explore avenues for
    sanctions relief at the United Nations to support stability in
    Syria.

**GIVING SYRIA A CHANCE TO SUCCEED:** President Trump is committed to
supporting a Syria that is stable, unified, and at peace with itself and
its neighbors.

-   President Trump wants Syria to succeed—but not at the expense of
    U.S. interests. While seeking to reengage constructively, this
    Administration will continue to guard against all threats and
    monitor progress on key priorities: taking concrete steps toward
    normalizing ties with Israel, addressing foreign terrorists,
    deporting Palestinian terrorists and banning Palestinian terrorist
    groups, helping the United States prevent a resurgence of ISIS, and
    assuming responsibility for ISIS detention centers in northeast
    Syria.
-   U.S. sanctions were imposed in response to the Assad regime’s brutal
    actions against the Syrian people and their direct support for
    terrorism in the region.
-   Recent positive changes and actions taken by the Government of
    Syria, after the fall of the brutal Assad Regime, demonstrate
    promise for a stable and peaceful future.
-   Removing sanctions will support Syria’s efforts to rebuild and
    counter terrorism without empowering harmful actors.
-   A unified Syria that protects its people and rejects extremism
    strengthens security and prosperity in the Middle East.
-   This policy aligns with U.S. goals to promote peace and stability in
    the region while holding accountable those responsible for past
    atrocities or terrorism.

**PROMISE MADE, PROMISE KEPT:** President Trump is delivering on his
commitment to give Syria a chance to rebuild and thrive by lifting
sanctions and ensuring accountability for harmful actors.

-   On May 13, President Trump announced he would be lifting sanctions
    on Syria to “give them a chance at greatness.”
    -   President Trump: “The sanctions were brutal and crippling and
        served as an important — really an important function —
        nevertheless, at the time. But now it’s their time to shine …
        So, I say, ‘Good luck, Syria.’ Show us something very special.”
-   The Treasury Department quickly took the first step in lifting
    sanctions on Syria by issuing a general license, known as GL25, to
    authorize transactions involving the interim Syrian government, its
    central bank, and state-owned enterprises. Simultaneously, the State
    Department issued a 180-day waiver of sanctions under the Caesar
    Act. 
-   President Trump is now fully delivering on that promise by taking
    bold action to implement the termination of the Syria sanctions
    program.
-   The world should take notice—if you want to take meaningful steps
    towards peace and stability, then the United States is willing to
    move rapidly to support you. 
-   President Trump hopes that Syria’s new government “will hopefully
    succeed in stabilizing the country in keeping peace.”
-   President Trump believes “there is great potential in working with
    Syria to stop Radicalism, improve Relations, and secure Peace in the
    Middle East.”
