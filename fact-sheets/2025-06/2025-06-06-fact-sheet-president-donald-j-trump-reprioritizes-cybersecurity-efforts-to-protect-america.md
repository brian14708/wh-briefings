title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Reprioritizes Cybersecurity Efforts
  to Protect America'
---
 
**STRENGTHENING THE NATION’S CYBERSECURITY:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed an Executive Order to strengthen the nation’s cybersecurity
by focusing on critical protections against foreign cyber threats and
enhancing secure technology practices.

-   The Order amends problematic elements of Obama and Biden-era
    Executive Orders (14144 and 13694).
-   The Order directs the Federal government to advance secure software
    development.
-   It directs department and agency level action on border gateway
    security to defeat hijacking of network interconnections.
-   The Order directs department and agency level actions on
    post-quantum cryptography to ensure protection against threats that
    may leverage next generation compute architectures.
-   The Order directs adoption of the latest encryption protocols.
-   It refocuses artificial intelligence (AI) cybersecurity efforts
    towards identifying and managing vulnerabilities, rather than
    censorship.
-   The Order directs technical measures to promulgate cybersecurity
    policy, including machine readable policy standards and formal trust
    designations for “Internet of Things” as a way to ensure that
    Americans can know that their personal and home devices meet basic
    security engineering principles.
-   It limits the application of cyber sanctions only to foreign
    malicious actors, preventing misuse against domestic political
    opponents and clarifying that sanctions do not apply to
    election-related activities.
-   The Order strips away inappropriate measures outside of core
    cybersecurity focus, including removing a mandate for U.S.
    government issued digital IDs for illegal aliens that would have
    facilitated entitlement fraud and other abuse.

**REPRIORITIZING CYBERSECURITY EFFORTS:** President Trump is taking
decisive action to address real technical challenges and enduring cyber
security threats.

-   Just days before President Trump took office, the Biden
    Administration attempted to sneak problematic and distracting issues
    into cybersecurity policy. This included:
    -   Introducing digital identity mandates that risked widespread
        abuse by enabling illegal immigrants to improperly access public
        benefits.

    -   Imposing unproven and burdensome software accounting processes
        that prioritized compliance checklists over genuine security
        investments.

    <!-- -->

    -   Micromanaging technical cybersecurity decisions better handled
        at the department and agency level, where budget tradeoffs and
        innovative solutions can be more effectively evaluated and
        implemented.
-   Cybersecurity is too important to be reduced to a mere political
    football.
-   Adversaries routinely threaten our critical infrastructure, personal
    devices, and the fabrics of our digital lives.

**ADVANCING NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY:** President Trump is advancing
cybersecurity for the safety of all Americans.

-   President Trump has made it clear that this Administration will do
    what it takes to make America cyber secure—including focusing
    relentlessly on technical and organizational professionalism to
    improve the security and resilience of the nation’s information
    systems and networks.
-   Since the first day he entered office, President Trump has been
    steadfast in his commitment to eliminate fraud and abuse across the
    Federal Government.
-   President Trump has already taken action to remove barriers to AI
    innovation, ensuring that our technology sector remains competitive
    at the cutting edge of new developments and free from ideological
    bias.
