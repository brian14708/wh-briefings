title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Increases Section 232 Tariffs on Steel
  and Aluminum'
---
 
**COUNTERING TRADE PRACTICES THAT UNDERMINE NATIONAL SECURITY:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed a Proclamation to increase the tariff
to 50% on steel and aluminum.

-   President Trump is taking action to protect America’s critical steel
    and aluminum industries, which have been harmed by unfair trade
    practices and global excess capacity.
-   President Trump is raising the tariff on steel and aluminum imports
    from 25% to 50%, with the higher tariff set to go into effect on
    June 4, 2025.
    -   Tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the United Kingdom
        will remain at 25%, with possible changes or quotas starting
        July 9, 2025, depending on the status of the U.S.-UK Economic
        Prosperity Deal.

    -   The steel and aluminum tariffs will apply only to the steel and
        aluminum contents of imported products, whereas the non-steel
        and non-aluminum contents of imported products will be subject
        to other applicable tariffs.
-   President Trump is cracking down on false import declarations by
    requiring strict reporting of steel and aluminum content, with tough
    penalties like fines or loss of import rights for violators.
-   President Trump is exercising his authority under Section 232 of the
    Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to adjust imports of steel and aluminum
    to protect our national security.
    -   This statute provides the President with authority to adjust
        imports being brought into the United States in quantities or
        under circumstances that threaten to impair national security.

**RESTORING FAIRNESS TO STEEL AND ALUMINUM MARKETS:** President Trump is
taking action to end unfair trade practices and the global dumping of
steel and aluminum.

-   Foreign nations have been flooding the United States market with
    cheap steel and aluminum, often subsidized by their governments.
-   A report from the first Trump Administration found that steel import
    levels and global excess were weakening our domestic economy and
    threatening to impair national security.
    -   The report found that excess production and capacity has been a
        major factor in the decline of domestic aluminum production.
-   While the domestic steel industry briefly achieved 80% capacity
    utilization in 2021, subsequent trade pressure has depressed
    domestic production.  In 2022 and 2023, capacity utilization fell to
    77.3% and 75.3%, respectively.  High import volumes from sources
    exempt from Section 232 tariffs were a major factor in depressing
    domestic production volumes. 
-   For aluminum, there was an increase in the capacity utilization rate
    between 2017 and 2019, from 40% to 61% during that period. But since
    2019, the aluminum capacity utilization has once again seen a steady
    decline, falling from 61% to 55% between 2019 and 2023.  
-   The United States does not want to be in a position where it would
    be unable to meet demand for national defense and critical
    infrastructure in a national emergency.

**STRENGTHENING AMERICA’S MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY:** President Trump’s
decision to close existing loopholes and exemptions will strengthen
United States’ steel and aluminum industries.

-   In his first term, President Trump imposed Section 232 tariffs to
    protect the American steel and aluminum industries from unfair
    foreign competition.
-   The steel tariffs that President Trump implemented led to thousands
    of jobs gained and higher wages in the metals industry.
    -   These tariffs were hailed as a “boon” for Minnesota’s iron ore
        industry, with state officials crediting tariffs for bolstering
        the local economy.

    -   Steel and aluminum imports drastically decreased under President
        Trump, falling by nearly a third from 2016 to 2020.

    <!-- -->

    -   The tariffs led to a wave in investment across the United
        States, with more than $10 billion committed to build new mills.
-   Earlier this year, President Trump restored and strengthened Section
    232 tariffs on steel and aluminum, widely celebrated by the American
    steel and aluminum industries.
-   Now, President Trump is once again being praised by our steel and
    Aluminum industries for his decision to raise tariffs on foreign
    steel and aluminum even higher and protect American workers.

**TARIFFS WORK:** Studies have repeatedly shown that contrary to public
rhetoric, tariffs can be an effective tool for achieving economic and
strategic objectives.

-   A 2024 study on the effects of President Trump’s tariffs in his
    first Administration found that they “strengthened the U.S.
    economy,” and “led to significant reshoring” in industries like
    manufacturing and steel production.
-   A 2023 report by the U.S. International Trade Commission that
    analyzed the effects of Section 232 and 301 tariffs on more than
    $300 billion of U.S. imports found that the tariffs reduced imports
    from China, effectively stimulated more U.S. production of the
    tariffed goods, with very minor effects on prices.
-   According to the Economic Policy Institute, the tariffs implemented
    by President Trump during his first Administration “clearly
    show\[ed\] no correlation with inflation” and only had a temporary
    effect on overall price levels.
-   An analysis from the Atlantic Council found that “tariffs would
    create new incentives for US consumers to buy US-made products.”
-   Former Biden Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen affirmed last year that
    tariffs do not raise prices: “I don’t believe that American
    consumers will see any meaningful increase in the prices that they
    face.”
-   A 2024 economic analysis found that a global tariff of 10% would
    grow the economy by $728 billion, create 2.8 million jobs, and
    increase real household incomes by 5.7%.
