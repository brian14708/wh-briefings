title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Empowers Commonsense Wildfire Prevention
  and Response'
---
 
**STRENGTHENING WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order returning common sense to
wildfire prevention and response.

-   The Order directs the Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of
    Agriculture to consolidate their wildland fire programs.
-    The Order supports local wildfire preparedness and response by
    improving Federal partnerships, as well as driving responsible land
    management and prevention at the State and local level.
-   The Order directs the use of available technology, including AI,
    data sharing, innovative mapping, and weather forecasting, to
    enhance State and local wildfire identification and response
    capabilities.
-   The Order directs Federal agencies to modify rules to facilitate
    preventive prescribed fires and appropriate fire-retardant use,
    promote innovative use of woody biomass and other forest products to
    reduce fuel loads that strengthen fires, and minimize wildfire
    ignition risks from the bulk-power system.
-   The Order modernizes wildfire prevention and response by instructing
    Federal agencies to declassify historical satellite data to improve
    wildfire prediction and revise or eliminate rules that impede
    wildfire detection, prevention, and response.
-   The Order directs the Secretary of Defense to prioritize the sale of
    excess aircraft and aircraft parts to support wildfire mitigation
    and response.

**EMPOWERING STATE AND LOCAL LEADERS:** President Trump is empowering
State and local leaders to combat wildfires effectively.

-   For too long, State and local wildfire responses have been slow and
    inadequate due to reckless mismanagement and lack of preparedness.
-   Wildfires threaten every region, yet many local government entities
    continue to disregard commonsense preventative measures.
-   Firefighters are forced to rely on outdated technology and face
    challenges in quickly responding to wildfires because of unnecessary
    regulation and bureaucracy.
-   Immediate action is essential to ensure the devastation of the Los
    Angeles wildfires never occurs again.
-   By streamlining Federal wildfire capabilities, States can leverage
    an efficient and straightforward approach concerning wildfire
    response and mitigation.

**RESTORING COMMON SENSE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT:** President Trump
has consistently demonstrated a commonsense approach to safeguard and
protect the environment and American communities.

-   On Day One, President Trump signed a Memorandum to prioritize
    routing water to Southern California in the wake of the destructive
    wildfires.
-   In President Trump’s first week back in office, he and First Lady
    Melania Trump visited Los Angeles to inspect wildfire damage,
    promising immediate Federal support and relief.
-   Upon visiting Los Angeles, President Trump immediately issued
    measures to provide increased water resources in California and
    promote expedited recovery procedures for Californians after their
    State government’s disastrous mishandling and misuse of resources
    and lack of preparation for the January 2025 wildfires.
-   In March 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order to enhance
    forest management, promoting responsible use of American timber to
    reduce wildfire risks.
