title: 'Fact Sheet: President Trump Is Delivering Historic Permitting Wins Across
  the Federal Government'
---
 
**ACCOMPLISHING PERMITTING REFORM IN RECORD TIME:**  Today, President
Donald J. Trump delivered on his promise to fix a broken permitting
system, ensuring that burdensome Federal environmental reviews cannot be
weaponized to stall the growth of the American economy or halt energy
infrastructure construction.

-   The White House, through the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ),
    coordinated a historic effort to dramatically reduce the burdens of
    National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance across the
    Federal government so that America can get back to building again.
-   In consultation with CEQ, the Department of Agriculture, the
    Department of Commerce (including the National Oceanic and
    Atmospheric Administration), the Department of the Interior, the
    Department of Energy, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the
    Department of Transportation, the Department of Defense, and the
    U.S. Army Corps of Engineers updated their respective NEPA
    implementing procedures to  simplify this overly burdensome process
    and ensure efficient and timely environmental reviews.
-   These historic reforms:
    -   Implement deadlines and page limits on environmental reviews
        required under recent amendments to NEPA, in order to expedite
        infrastructure development and reduce costs.

    <!-- -->

    -   Provide clarification that NEPA does not apply to every action
        that a Federal agency takes, but only to Federal actions where
        the agency has sufficient control and discretion to take
        environmental effects into account.

    <!-- -->

    -   Ensure simple and expeditious processes to create categorical
        exclusions (CEs), adopt other agencies’ CEs to minimize
        repetitive NEPA analyses, and focus their attention on actions
        with truly significant environmental effects.

**CUTTING UNNECESSARY RED TAPE:** All three branches of the Federal
government have recently directed reforms to the NEPA process: President
Trump, in his [*Unleashing American
Energy*](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/29/2025-01956/unleashing-american-energy)
Executive Order; the United States Congress, in its [BUILDER Act
amendments](https://www.congress.gov/118/plaws/publ5/PLAW-118publ5.pdf)
as part of the 2023 Fiscal Responsibility Act; and the United States
Supreme Court in its recent landmark decision in [*Seven County
Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle
County*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/23-975_m648.pdf).

-   NEPA directs all agencies to maintain their own, agency-level NEPA
    implementing procedures.
-   Most of those procedures had not been modernized to reflect any of
    the recent reforms. Some agencies were still using outdated NEPA
    regulations from the 1980s.
-   Under President Trump’s leadership, the endless cycle of regulatory
    back-and-forth and excessive environmental reviews that produced
    little benefit for the American people has come to a halt.
-   Federal agencies are cutting unnecessary layers of bureaucracy in
    record time by implementing the unmistakable direction from all
    three branches of the Federal government. 

**BUILDING ON PAST SUCCESS:** The Trump Administration has taken
decisive action to reform, modernize, and expedite the Federal
environmental review, eliminating unnecessary delays that are holding
back the growth of secure and reliable infrastructure projects across
the Nation.

-   On January 20, 2025, President Trump signed the Executive Order,
    [*Unleashing American
    Energy*](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/29/2025-01956/unleashing-american-energy),
    which called for unleashing American energy dominance through
    efficient permitting.
    -   The E.O. directed CEQ to provide
        [guidance](https://ceq.doe.gov/docs/ceq-regulations-and-guidance/CEQ-Memo-Implementation-of-NEPA-02.19.2025.pdf)
        on implementing NEPA to expedite and simplify the permitting
        process – and propose rescinding CEQ’s regulations.

    <!-- -->

    -   CEQ responded to President Trump’s direction by [rescinding its
        NEPA
        regulations](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/25/2025-03014/removal-of-national-environmental-policy-act-implementing-regulations),
        creating a clear path for agencies to expeditiously reform their
        own NEPA procedures and allow America to build again.
    -   President Trump’s action to restore CEQ to its core statutory
        mission of coordinating and consulting, providing guidance to
        Federal agencies as they revise their NEPA procedures, will
        ensure timely reviews and consistency across agencies and enable
        CEQ to coordinate this monumental deregulatory effort.
