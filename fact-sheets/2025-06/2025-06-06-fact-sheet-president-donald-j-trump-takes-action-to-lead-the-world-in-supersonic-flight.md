title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Takes Action to Lead the World in Supersonic
  Flight'
---
 
**LEADING THE WORLD IN SUPERSONIC FLIGHT:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed an Executive Order to promote supersonic aviation in the
United States.

-   America once led the world in supersonic aviation, but decades of
    stifling regulations grounded progress. This Order removes
    regulatory barriers so that U.S. companies can dominate supersonic
    flight once again.
-   The Order directs the Administrator of the Federal Aviation
    Administration (FAA) to repeal the prohibition on overland
    supersonic flight, establish an interim noise-based certification
    standard, and repeal other regulations that hinder supersonic
    flight.
-   The Order instructs the FAA Administrator to establish a standard
    for supersonic aircraft noise certification that considers community
    acceptability, economic reasonableness, and technological
    feasibility.
-   The Order advances the coordination of supersonic research,
    development, test and evaluation efforts through the National
    Science and Technology Council with leadership from the Office of
    Science and Technology Policy.
-   It promotes international engagement through the FAA and other
    agencies to align global supersonic flight regulations and secure
    bilateral agreements for international operations.

**USHERING IN A NEW CHAPTER IN AEROSPACE INNOVATION:** President Trump
is launching a historic national effort to reestablish the United States
as the undisputed leader in high-speed aviation.

-   For more than fifty years, outdated and overly restrictive
    regulations have grounded the promise of supersonic flight, stifling
    American ingenuity and weakening our global competitiveness in
    aviation.
-   Advances in aerospace engineering, materials science, and noise
    reduction now make supersonic flight not just possible, but safe,
    sustainable, and commercially viable.
-   American companies developing supersonic aircraft have already
    entered into government contracts and agreements with major
    commercial airlines, such as United Airlines and American Airlines,
    who have committed to purchase supersonic jets to enhance their
    fleets with faster travel options.
-   By removing decades-old regulatory barriers and promoting
    cutting-edge supersonic technology, President Trump is Making
    Aviation Great Again.

**ADVANCING AMERICA’S TECHNOLOGICAL LEADERSHIP:** President Trump is
ensuring U.S. dominance in cutting-edge technologies, prioritizing
innovation and global competitiveness.

-   President Trump signed Executive Orders to enhance America’s global
    artificial intelligence (AI) dominance and advance AI education for
    America’s youth.
-   He signed multiple Executive Orders to advance nuclear technologies
    and ensure a reliable, clean, and affordable domestic energy supply.
-   The President signed an Executive Order to restore Gold Standard
    Science as the cornerstone of Federal scientific research and ensure
    that Federal decision-making is informed by the most credible,
    reliable, and impartial scientific evidence available. 
-   President Trump has prioritized deregulation to spur innovation and
    economic growth.
    -   This includes issuing Executive Orders mandating the repeal of
        10 regulations for each new one proposed, requiring the
        automatic rescission of outdated regulations, and eliminating
        anti-competitive regulations.
