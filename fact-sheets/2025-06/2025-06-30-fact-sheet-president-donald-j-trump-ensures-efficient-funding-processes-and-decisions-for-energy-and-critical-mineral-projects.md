title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Ensures Efficient Funding Processes
  and Decisions for Energy and Critical Mineral Projects'

**STREAMLINING FUNDING APPLICATIONS AND ENSURING EFFICIENT USE OF
TAXPAYER FUNDS FOR ENERGY AND CRITICAL MINERAL PROJECTS:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum that fosters
interagency coordination when funding energy and critical mineral
projects to better prioritize the use of taxpayer funds and end wasteful
duplicative processes.

-   The Memorandum encourages agencies to share information with the
    National Energy Dominance Council (NEDC) regarding both pending
    applications for funding and existing funding commitments for
    energy, critical mineral, or critical material-related projects.
    -   This gives the NEDC insight as to whether funds across the
        Federal government are utilized appropriately and where they are
        most needed, without redundancies, and the ability to
        communicate suggestions on fund deployment to agencies.

    -   This also enables the NEDC to serve a coordinating function
        between agencies that are evaluating potential funding
        recipients, eliminating the need for duplicative diligence
        workstreams across agencies.
-   The Memorandum further directs the development of a common
    application for Federal funding opportunities in the energy and
    critical mineral space to allow for applicants to apply
    simultaneously to multiple funding programs using one streamlined
    application.

**CUTTING BUREAUCRATIC RED TAPE:** This Memorandum fulfills President
Trump’s broader commitment to make government more efficient and support
our domestic energy industries.

-   Agencies currently engage in duplicative diligence processes when
    reviewing funding applications for energy infrastructure and
    critical mineral and critical material projects.
-   Applicants are burdened with requirements to complete multiple,
    complex, and substantially similar applications. Agencies conduct
    substantially the same diligence redundantly in order to make
    funding decisions.
-   Streamlining this application process and increasing
    information-sharing across agencies will enable the Federal
    government to make faster, better funding decisions.

**UNLEASHING AMERICAN ENERGY:** President Trump is cutting red tape to
unleash American energy.

-   On Day One, President Trump declared a National Energy Emergency to
    eliminate bureaucratic barriers, unleash innovation, and restore
    America’s position as the world’s leading energy producer.
-   He established the NEDC to advise on strategies for improving the
    processes for permitting, production, generation, distribution,
    regulation, and transportation across all forms of American energy.
-   His Administration has cut down significant regulatory barriers in
    the energy space already by reforming NEPA, deregulating under the
    Endangered Species Act, granting regulatory relief under the Clean
    Air Act, and more.
