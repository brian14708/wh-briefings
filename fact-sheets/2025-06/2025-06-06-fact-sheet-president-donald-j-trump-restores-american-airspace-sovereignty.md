title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Restores American Airspace Sovereignty'
---
 
**ENSURING AMERICAN SOVEREIGNTY OVER ITS SKIES:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to ensure American sovereignty
over its skies and a safe and secure airspace.

-   Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), otherwise known as drones, pose a
    growing threat as criminals, terrorists, and hostile foreign actors
    increasingly weaponize these technologies to endanger public safety
    and national security. 
-   The Order establishes the Federal Task Force to Restore American
    Airspace Sovereignty to review and propose solutions to UAS threats.
-   It directs the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration
    (FAA) to establish a process to restrict drone flights over critical
    infrastructure and other public facilities.  
-   It instructs the FAA Administrator to make Notices to Airmen and
    Temporary Flight Restrictions freely available online for drone
    geofencing and Aircraft Navigation and Guidance system purposes.
-   The Order requires the Attorney General and FAA Administrator to
    increase enforcement of civil and criminal laws against drone
    operators endangering the public, violating airspace restrictions,
    or committing a crime.
-   It authorizes Federal agencies to use existing authorities to
    detect, track, and identify drones and drone signals, and enables
    state, local, tribal, and territorial  law enforcement agencies to
    access grant programs for similar equipment.
-   The Order mandates the publication of guidance to help private
    critical infrastructure owners and operators employ drone detection
    technologies.
-   It calls for a risk-based assessment to designate borders, large
    airports, Federal facilities, critical infrastructure, and military
    installations as protected areas.
-   The Order directs the Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland
    Security to explore integrating counter-UAS operation responses as
    part of Joint Terrorism Task Forces that are stood up for mass
    gathering events.
-   It also directs the Administration to create a National Training
    Center for Counter-UAS to build the needed counter-UAS capacity to
    secure major events like the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2028 Summer
    Olympics.  

**ADDRESSING GROWING DRONE THREATS:** President Trump is taking decisive
action to counter the escalating misuse of drones.

-   Criminals, terrorists, and hostile foreign actors have intensified
    their weaponization of drone technologies, creating new and serious
    threats to our homeland.
-   Drug cartels use drones to smuggle fentanyl across our borders,
    deliver contraband into prisons, surveil law enforcement, and
    otherwise endanger the public.
-   Mass gatherings are vulnerable to disruptions and threats by
    unauthorized drone flights.
-   Critical infrastructure, including military bases, is subject to
    frequent—and often unidentified—drone incursions.

**ADVANCING NATIONAL SECURITY:** President Trumphas consistently
prioritized making America safe and secure. 

-   Immediately upon taking office, President Trump fulfilled his
    promise to address the mysterious drone sightings in New Jersey by
    clarifying that these were FAA-authorized flights, not a national
    security threat.
-   President Trump has deployed drones to patrol the southern border,
    strengthening national security through advanced surveillance and
    monitoring capabilities.
-   President Trump has advanced cutting-edge drone technologies through
    smart, targeted regulation, unlocking economic growth while
    strengthening safety, security, and innovation.
