title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Directs Review of Certain Presidential
  Actions'
---
 
**INVESTIGATING EXECUTIVE ACTIONS UNDER BIDEN’S PRESIDENCY:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum directing an
investigation into who ran the United States while President Biden was
in office.

-   The Memorandum directs an investigation into whether certain
    individuals conspired to deceive the public about Biden’s mental
    state and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and
    responsibilities of the President.
-   The Memorandum also mandates an investigation into the circumstances
    surrounding Biden’s purported execution of the numerous executive
    actions during his final years in office, examining policy documents
    signed with an autopen, who authorized its use, and the validity of
    the resulting Presidential policy decisions.

**QUESTIONING WHO WIELDED THE EXECUTIVE POWER DURING THE BIDEN
ADMINISTRATION:** The combined nature of Biden’s documented cognitive
decline and the repeated use of an autopen raises serious concerns about
the legitimacy of his actions.

-   Reports indicate that, for years, Biden suffered from serious
    cognitive decline.
    -   For example, although the Department of Justice found that Biden
        had violated the law by willfully retaining and disclosing
        classified materials, it ultimately concluded that Biden was
        unfit to stand trial given his incompetent mental state.
-   Biden’s cognitive issues and apparent mental decline were reportedly
    even “worse” in private, with those closest to him attempting to
    conceal it from the public.
    -   Biden’s advisors severely restricted his news conferences and
        media appearances, scripting his conversations with lawmakers,
        government officials, and donors.
-   Despite Biden’s cognitive deficiencies, the White House issued over
    1,200 Presidential documents, appointed 235 judges to the Federal
    bench, and issued more pardons and commutations than any
    Administration in U.S. history.
    -   Just two days before Christmas in 2024, Biden commuted the
        sentences of 37 of the 40 most vile and monstrous criminals on
        Federal death row, including several child killers and mass
        murderers.
-   The authority to take these executive actions is constitutionally
    reserved for the President, yet the Biden White House used an
    autopen to execute the vast majority of Biden’s executive actions,
    particularly during the second half of his Presidency.

**RESTORING PRESIDENTIAL ACCOUNTABILITY:** President Trump believes
Americans deserve answers as to whether President Biden signed these
documents, and if not, who signed them, and under what circumstances.

-   President Trump: “And you know what, they ought to find out who was
    using that autopen. Because whoever that person was, he or she was
    like the President of the United States … I think a President should
    sign it, not use an autopen. And we’re going to find out whether or
    not he knew what the hell he was doing. … So I think it’s something
    that we should really look at because that’s so important.”
-   President Trump: “The real question – who ran the autopen, OK? Who
    ran the autopen? Because the things that were signed were signed
    illegally, in my opinion.”
-   Since returning to office, President Trump has held numerous
    open-press signing events where the American public can witness
    President Trump’s signature and knowledge regarding the matters in
    question with their own eyes.
-   Even the legacy media admits that President Trump is on track to
    becoming the most-accessible President in modern history.
