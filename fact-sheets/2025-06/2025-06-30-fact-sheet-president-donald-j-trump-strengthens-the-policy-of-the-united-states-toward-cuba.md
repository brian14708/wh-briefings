  States Toward Cuba'

**STRENGTHENING THE POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES TOWARD CUBA:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed a National Security Presidential
Memorandum (NSPM) to strengthen the policy of the United States toward
Cuba.

-   This NSPM restores and strengthens the robust Cuba policy from the
    President’s first term, reversing the Biden Administration’s
    revocation that eased pressure on the Cuban regime.
-   The NSPM ends economic practices that disproportionately benefit the
    Cuban government, military, intelligence, or security agencies at
    the expense of the Cuban people.
    -   Direct or indirect financial transactions with entities
        controlled by the Cuban military, such as Grupo de
        Administracion Empresarial S.A. (GAESA), and its affiliates are
        prohibited, with exceptions for transactions that advance U.S.
        policy goals or support the Cuban people.
-   It enforces the statutory ban on U.S. tourism to Cuba and ensures
    compliance through regular audits and mandatory record-keeping of
    all travel-related transactions for at least five years.
-   The NSPM supports the economic embargo of Cuba and opposes calls in
    the United Nations and other international forums for its
    termination.
-   The NSPM amplifies efforts to support the Cuban people through the
    expansion of internet services, free press, free enterprise, free
    association, and lawful travel.
-   It ensures the “Wet Foot, Dry Foot” policy remains terminated to
    discourage dangerous, unlawful migration.
-   The NSPM ensures that engagement between the United States and Cuba
    advances the interests of the United States and the Cuban people,
    including through promoting human rights, fostering a private sector
    independent of government control, and enhancing national security.
-   The NSPM mandates a review of human rights abuses in Cuba, including
    unlawful detentions and inhumane treatment, and requires a report on
    fugitives from American justice living in Cuba or being harbored by
    the Cuban government.

**PROMOTING A STABLE, PROSPEROUS, AND FREE CUBA:** President Trump is
committed to fostering a free and democratic Cuba, addressing the Cuban
people’s long-standing suffering under a Communist regime.

-   The Cuban people have long suffered under a Communist regime that
    suppresses their legitimate aspirations for freedom and prosperity,
    arbitrarily detains dissidents, and holds political prisoners in
    inhumane conditions.
-   Violence and intimidation against dissidents occur with impunity,
    while families of political prisoners face retaliation for their
    advocacy.
-   The regime harasses worshippers, blocks free association by civil
    society organizations, and denies free speech, including through
    limited internet access and the absence of a free press.
-   The Cuban government harbors fugitives of American justice and fails
    to meet the basic requirements of a free and just society.

**HOLDING THE CUBAN REGIME ACCOUNTABLE:** President Trump is continuing
efforts from his first term to stand with the Cuban people and hold the
regime accountable.

-   In his first term, President Trump implemented a robust policy
    towards Cuba, reversing the Obama Administration’s one-sided deal
    that eased restrictions without securing meaningful reforms for the
    Cuban people.
-   Now, President Trump is once again implementing a firm policy
    stance.
    -   President Trump is fulfilling his campaign promise: “As
        president, I will again stand with the people of Cuba in their
        long quest for justice, liberty and freedom.”
-   President Trump also recently implemented a new travel ban that
    applies to Cuba.
    -   It lists Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism and cites its
        failure to cooperate or share sufficient law enforcement
        information with the United States, its historical refusal to
        accept back its removable nationals, and its high visa overstay
        rate.
