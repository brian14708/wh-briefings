  to Protect the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security
  and Public Safety Threats'

**COMBATING TERRORISM THROUGH COMMON SENSE SECURITY STANDARDS:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed a Proclamation to protect the nation
from foreign terrorist and other national security and public safety
threats from entry into the United States.

-   Pursuant to President Trump’s Executive Order 14161, issued on
    January 20, 2025, titled “Protecting the United States from Foreign
    Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats,”
    national security agencies engaged in a robust assessment of the
    risk that countries posed to the United States, including regarding
    terrorism and national security.
-   In *Trump v. Hawaii*, the Supreme Court upheld the President’s
    authority to use section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality
    Act to protect the United States through entry restrictions.
-   The Proclamation fully restricts and limits the entry of nationals
    from 12 countries found to be deficient with regards to screening
    and vetting and determined to pose a very high risk to the United
    States: Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial
    Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen.
-   The Proclamation partially restricts and limits the entry of
    nationals from 7 countries who also pose a high level of risk to the
    United States: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo,
    Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.
-   The Proclamation includes exceptions for lawful permanent residents,
    existing visa holders, certain visa categories, and individuals
    whose entry serves U.S. national interests.

**SECURING OUR BORDERS AND INTERESTS:** The restrictions and limitations
imposed by the Proclamation are necessary to garner cooperation from
foreign governments, enforce our immigration laws, and advance other
important foreign policy, national security, and counterterrorism
objectives.

-   It is the President’s sacred duty to take action to ensure that
    those seeking to enter our country will not harm the American
    people.
-   After evaluating a report submitted by the Secretary of State, in
    coordination with other cabinet officials, President Trump has
    determined that the entry of nationals from certain countries must
    be restricted or limited to protect U.S. national security and
    public safety interests.
-   The restrictions are country-specific in order to encourage
    cooperation with the subject countries in recognition of each
    country’s unique circumstances.
-   Some of the named countries have inadequate screening and vetting
    processes, hindering America’s ability to identify potential
    security threats before entry.
-   Certain countries exhibit high visa overstay rates, demonstrating a
    disregard for U.S. immigration laws and increasing burdens on
    enforcement systems.
-   Other countries lack cooperation in sharing identity and threat
    information, undermining effective U.S. immigration vetting.
-   Some countries have a significant terrorist presence or
    state-sponsored terrorism, posing direct risks to U.S. national
    security.
-   Several countries have historically failed to accept back their
    removable nationals, complicating U.S. efforts to manage immigration
    and public safety.

**MAKING AMERICA SAFE AGAIN:** President Trump is keeping his promise to
restore the travel ban and secure our borders.

-   President Trump: “We will restore the travel ban, some people call
    it the Trump travel ban, and keep the radical Islamic terrorists out
    of our country that was upheld by the Supreme Court.”
-   In his first term, President Trump successfully implemented a travel
    ban that restricted entry from several countries with inadequate
    vetting processes or significant security risks.
-   The Supreme Court upheld the travel ban, ruling that it “is squarely
    within the scope of Presidential authority” and noting that it is
    “expressly premised on legitimate purposes.”
-   This Proclamation builds on President Trump’s first-term travel ban,
    incorporating an updated assessment of current global screening,
    vetting, and security risks.

**JUSTIFICATION FOR FULL SUSPENSION BY COUNTRY**

***Afghanistan***

-   The Taliban, a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) group,
    controls Afghanistan.  Afghanistan lacks a competent or cooperative
    central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it
    does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures.  According
    to the Fiscal Year 2023 Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
    Entry/Exit Overstay Report (“Overstay Report”), Afghanistan had a
    business/tourist (B1/B2) visa overstay rate of 9.70 percent and a
    student (F), vocational (M), and exchange visitor (J) visa overstay
    rate of 29.30 percent.

***Burma***

-   According to the Overstay Report, Burma had a B1/B2 visa overstay
    rate of 27.07 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 42.17
    percent.  Additionally, Burma has historically not cooperated with
    the United States to accept back their removable nationals.

***Chad***

-   According to the Overstay Report, Chad had a B1/B2 visa overstay
    rate of 49.54 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 55.64
    percent.  According to the Fiscal Year 2022 Overstay Report, Chad
    had a B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 37.12 percent.  The high visa
    overstay rate for 2022 and 2023 is unacceptable and indicates a
    blatant disregard for U.S. immigration laws.  

***Republic of the Congo***

-   According to the Overstay Report, the Republic of the Congo had a
    B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 29.63 percent and an F, M, and J visa
    overstay rate of 35.14 percent.

***Equatorial Guinea***

-   According to the Overstay Report, Equatorial Guinea had a B1/B2 visa
    overstay rate of 21.98 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate
    of 70.18 percent.

***Eritrea***

-   The United States questions the competence of the central authority
    for issuance of passports or civil documents in Eritrea. Criminal
    records are not available to the United States for Eritrean
    nationals.  Eritrea has historically refused to accept back its
    removable nationals.  According to the Overstay Report, Eritrea had
    a B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 20.09 percent and an F, M, and J visa
    overstay rate of 55.43 percent.

***Haiti***

-   According to the Overstay Report, Haiti had a B1/B2 visa overstay
    rate of 31.38 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 25.05
    percent.  Additionally, hundreds of thousands of illegal Haitian
    aliens flooded into the United States during the Biden
    Administration.  This influx harms American communities by creating
    acute risks of increased overstay rates, establishment of criminal
    networks, and other national security threats. As is widely known,
    Haiti lacks a central authority with sufficient availability and
    dissemination of law enforcement information necessary to ensure its
    nationals do not undermine the national security of the United
    States. 

***Iran***

-   Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism.  Iran regularly fails to
    cooperate with the United States Government in identifying security
    risks, is the source of significant terrorism around the world, and
    has historically failed to accept back its removable nationals. 

***Libya***

-   There is no competent or cooperative central authority for issuing
    passports or civil documents in Libya.  The historical terrorist
    presence within Libya’s territory amplifies the risks posed by the
    entry into the United States of its nationals.

***Somalia***

-   Somalia lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for
    issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have
    appropriate screening and vetting measures.  Somalia stands apart
    from other countries in the degree to which its government lacks
    command and control of its territory, which greatly limits the
    effectiveness of its national capabilities in a variety of
    respects.  A persistent terrorist threat also emanates from
    Somalia’s territory.  The United States Government has identified
    Somalia as a terrorist safe haven.  Terrorists use regions of
    Somalia as safe havens from which they plan, facilitate, and conduct
    their operations.  Somalia also remains a destination for
    individuals attempting to join terrorist groups that threaten the
    national security of the United States.  The Government of Somalia
    struggles to provide governance needed to limit terrorists’ freedom
    of movement.  Additionally, Somalia has historically refused to
    accept back its removable nationals.

***Sudan***

-   Sudan lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing
    passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate
    screening and vetting measures.  According to the Overstay Report,
    Sudan had a B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 26.30 percent and an F, M,
    and J visa overstay rate of 28.40 percent. 

***Yemen***

-   Yemen lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing
    passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate
    screening and vetting measures.  The government does not have
    physical control over its own territory.  Since January 20, 2025,
    Yemen has been the site of active U.S. military operations.

**JUSTIFICATION FOR PARTIAL SUSPENSION BY COUNTRY (Immigrants and
Nonimmigrants on B-1, B-2, B-1/B-2, F, M, and J Visas)**

***Burundi***

-   According to the Overstay Report, Burundi had a B1/B2 visa overstay
    rate of 15.35 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 17.52
    percent. 

***Cuba***

-   Cuba is a state sponsor of terrorism.  The Government of Cuba does
    not cooperate or share sufficient law enforcement information with
    the United States.  Cuba has historically refused to accept back its
    removable nationals.  According to the Overstay Report, Cuba had a
    B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 7.69 percent and a F, M, and J visa
    overstay rate of 18.75 percent.

***Laos***

-   According to the Overstay Report, Laos had a B1/B2 visa overstay
    rate of 34.77 percent and a F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 6.49
    percent.  Laos has historically failed to accept back its removable
    nationals. 

***Sierra Leone***

-   According to the Overstay Report, Sierra Leone had a B1/B2 visa
    overstay rate of 15.43 percent and a F, M, and J visa overstay rate
    of 35.83 percent.  Sierra Leone has historically failed to accept
    back its removable nationals. 

***Togo***

-   According to the Overstay Report, Togo had a B1/B2 visa overstay
    rate of 19.03 percent and a F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 35.05
    percent. 

***Turkmenistan***

-   According to the Overstay Report, Turkmenistan had a B1/B2 visa
    overstay rate of 15.35 percent and a F, M, and J visa overstay rate
    of 21.74 percent. 

***Venezuela***

-   Venezuela lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for
    issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have
    appropriate screening and vetting measures.  Venezuela has
    historically refused to accept back its removable nationals. 
    According to the Overstay Report, Venezuela had a B1/B2 visa
    overstay rate of 9.83 percent.
