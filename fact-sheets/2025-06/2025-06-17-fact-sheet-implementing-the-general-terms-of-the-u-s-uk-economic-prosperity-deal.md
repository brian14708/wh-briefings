  Deal'

**IMPLEMENTING A HISTORIC TRADE DEAL:** Yesterday, President Donald J.
Trump signed an Executive Order implementing American commitments under
the General Terms of the United States-United Kingdom Economic
Prosperity Deal.

-   This historic trade deal provides American companies unprecedented
    access to British markets while bolstering U.S. national security.
-   The deal will include billions of dollars of increased market access
    for American exports, especially for beef, ethanol, and certain
    other American agricultural exports.
-   The UK will reduce or eliminate numerous non-tariff barriers that
    unfairly discriminate against American products, hurt the U.S.
    manufacturing base, and threaten our national security.
-   The U.S. and UK will negotiate preferential treatment outcomes for
    UK pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients contingent on the
    findings of a Section 232 investigation.
-   The U.S. and UK have also committed to adopting a structured,
    negotiated approach to addressing U.S. national security concerns
    regarding sectors that may be subject to future Section 232
    investigations and UK compliance with certain supply chain security
    standards.
-   This Executive Order addresses automobiles, aerospace, and steel and
    aluminum.
-   For automobiles, the Order provides that the first 100,000 vehicles
    imported into the U.S. by UK car manufacturers each year will be
    subject to a total tariff rate of 10% (7.5% plus 2.5%
    most-favored-nation rate) and any additional imported vehicles each
    year will be subject to the automobile Section 232 tariff rate of
    25%.
    -   Additionally, automotive parts that are products of the UK and
        are for use in UK vehicles will be subject to a total tariff
        rate of 10%.
-   For aerospace, the Order provides that certain UK products will no
    longer be subject to tariffs, thus strengthening aerospace and
    aircraft manufacturing supply chains.
-   For steel and aluminum articles and their derivatives, the Order
    provides that the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the
    U.S. Trade Representative, will establish tariff-rate quotas for UK
    products consistent with the General Terms of the Economic
    Prosperity Deal and pursuant to certain principles outlined in the
    Order. Products outside those quotas or that do not meet certain
    requirements will remain subject to existing Section 232 tariffs.
-   Today’s action strengthens our bilateral relationship with the UK
    and sets the tone for other trading partners to promote reciprocal
    trade with the United States.

**ADVANCING RECIPROCAL TRADE:** This U.S.-UK trade deal will usher in a
golden age of new opportunity for U.S. exporters and level the playing
field for American producers.

-   On April 2, 2025, Liberation Day, President Trump imposed a 10%
    tariff on all countries to address unfair trade practices that have
    contributed to America’s trade deficit in order to better protect
    American workers, manufacturers, and our national security. 
    -   In 2024, the U.S. total goods trade with the UK was an estimated
        $148 billion.

    -   The UK average applied agricultural tariff was 9.2%, while the
        U.S. average applied agricultural tariff (prior to April 2) was
        5%.
-   On April 18, President Trump had a call with Prime Minister Starmer
    to discuss our bilateral trade relationship.
-   On May 8, President Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced
    this historic Economic Prosperity Deal.

**USHERING IN A NEW ERA OF PROSPERITY:** Since Day One, President Trump
has challenged the assumption that American workers and businesses must
tolerate unfair trade practices that disadvantage our workers and
businesses and contribute to our historic trade deficit.

-   President Trump continues to advance the interests of the American
    people, enhancing market access for American exporters and lowering
    tariff and non-tariff barriers to protect our economic and national
    security.

-   The Economic Prosperity Deal with the United Kingdom is a critical
    step toward promoting reciprocal trade with a key ally and partner.
-   President Trump: “The deal includes billions of dollars of increased
    market access for American exports, especially in agriculture,
    dramatically increasing access for American beef, ethanol, and
    virtually all of the products produced by our great farmers.”
    -   “The UK will reduce or eliminate numerous non-tariff barriers
        that unfairly discriminated against American products.”

    <!-- -->

    -   “This is now turning out to be, really, a great deal for both
        countries.”
-   Prime Minister Starmer: “This is going to boost trade between and
    across our countries. It’s going to not only protect jobs, but
    create jobs, opening market access.”
