title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Stops the Green Agenda in the Columbia
  River Basin'
---
 
**STOPPING RADICAL ENVIRONMENTALISM:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed a Presidential Memorandum revoking an executive action issued by
the prior administration that called for “equitable treatment for fish.”

-   Today’s Memorandum revokes the Biden Administration’s “Restoring
    Healthy and Abundant Salmon, Steelhead, and Other Native Fish
    Populations in the Columbia River Basin” Memorandum, which placed
    concerns about climate change above the Nation’s interests in
    reliable energy resources.
-   This Memorandum directs the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of
    the Interior, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Assistant Secretary
    of the Army for Civil Works to withdraw from agreements stemming
    from Biden’s misguided executive action, including the December 14,
    2023 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) filed in connection with
    related litigation.
-   The specified agencies will coordinate with the Council on
    Environmental Quality to review and revise environmental review
    processes related to the matters in the MOU, save Federal funds, and
    withdraw from the MOU.

**RESTORING AMERICAN ENERGY DOMINANCE AND SECURING AMERICAN
PROSPERITY:** President Trump continues to prioritize our Nation’s
energy infrastructure and use of natural resources to lower the cost of
living for all Americans over speculative climate change concerns.

-   President Trump recognizes the importance of ensuring the future of
    wildlife populations in the Columbia River Basin, while also
    advancing the country’s energy creation to benefit the American
    public.
-   The MOU required the Federal government to spend millions of dollars
    and comply with 36 pages of onerous commitments to dam operations on
    the Lower Snake River. 
-   Dam breaching would have resulted in reduced water supply to
    farmers, eliminated several shipping channels, had devastating
    impacts to agriculture, increased energy costs, and eliminated
    recreational opportunities throughout the region.  
-   The dam breaches would have eliminated over 3,000 megawatts of
    secure and reliable hydroelectric generating capacity—which is
    enough generation to power 2.5 million American homes.

**PUTTING AMERICA FIRST:** President Trump continues to deliver on his
promise to end the previous administration’s misplaced priorities and
protect the livelihoods of the American people. Unlike the previous
administration, the Trump Administration understands that policies that
promote environmental quality and economic growth are not mutually
exclusive.

-   President Trump champions the needs of the American people and
    prioritizes U.S. interests in reliable, affordable energy resources.
    -   President Trump signed an Executive Order reinvigorating
        America’s beautiful clean coal industry to support grid
        stability and hundreds of thousands of U.S.  jobs.
-   President Trump is committed to unleashing American energy
    dominance, reversing all executive actions that impose undue burdens
    on energy production and use.
    -   On Day One, President Trump declared a National Energy Emergency
        to unlock domestic energy production and bring down costs for
        everyday Americans.
-   President Trump’s commonsense approach to environmental conservation
    empowers the American people to take full advantage of our nation’s
    vast and great natural resources.
    -   President Trump reversed the burdensome regulations that impeded
        Alaska’s ability to develop its vast natural resources,
        unleashing the state’s potential to create a safe and prosperous
        future for the entire Nation.
