    Celebrates the Great, Historic Investment in Rural Health</span>

**MAKING A HISTORIC INVESTMENT IN RURAL HEALTHCARE:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump celebrated the largest ever investment in rural
healthcare, enacted in his signature Working Families Tax Cuts Act.

-   On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed the Working Families Tax
    Cuts Act into law, which created the Rural Health Transformation
    Program and invested $50 billion spread over five years to
    transparently and efficiently transform rural health access.
-   On December 29, 2025, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
    (CMS) announced funding awards to all 50 states.  

**PROVIDING UNPRECEDENTED FUNDING LEVELS FOR RURAL HEALTHCARE:** The
President believes that access to quality care should not be determined
by your zip code.

-   The Rural Health Transformation Program is providing unprecedented
    levels of new funding to states for a range of uses designed to make
    rural healthcare more effective and sustainable for the long term.
-   The CMS Office of the Actuary estimates Medicaid in total spent $19
    billion on rural hospitals in 2024.
-   The Rural Health Transformation Program will provide an additional
    $10 billion each year from 2026 through 2030, representing a
    substantial increase in overall funding for rural hospitals and
    communities.
-   The Trump Administration is committed to strengthening the rural
    health workforce, modernizing facilities and technology, and
    deploying innovative care models that bring high-quality health
    services to rural communities nationwide.

**CORRECTING THE MISTAKES OF THE PAST:** The Rural Health Transformation
Program takes a new approach to actually meet the healthcare needs of
rural communities instead of doubling down on the failed approaches of
the past.

-   Unlike smaller programs that have traditionally been the main
    mechanisms to support rural care, the Rural Health Transformation
    Program is uniquely designed to promote innovation and long-term
    sustainability of rural healthcare.
-   Rural hospitals suffer from chronic challenges with extremely low
    patient volume—they have both smaller bed counts than urban
    hospitals and occupancy rates that are much lower (37%) than those
    of their urban counterparts (62%).
-   Therefore, when legacy programs link funding to reimbursements for
    services provided, they do not promote long-term sustainability as
    the overall volume of services provided in these facilities remains
    low. In other words, these programs do not actually provide
    hospitals with investments that would help them sustain themselves.
-   Distinct from these other programs, the Rural Health Transformation
    Program is designed to promote innovation in payment and
    flexibility. These funds can be used to help these facilities make
    investments necessary to better meet the needs of the communities
    they serve and become more sustainable over the long term.

**DELIVERING FOR RURAL AMERICA:** President Trump has consistently
delivered for the health of rural America, taking decisive action to
lower healthcare costs and improve access to care for millions of
hardworking Americans.  

-   On May 12, 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order titled
    “Delivering Most-Favored-Nation Prescription Drug Pricing to
    American Patients” directing the Administration to take numerous
    actions to bring American drug prices in line with those paid by
    similar nations. Since that time, the Administration has secured 16
    deals with major pharmaceutical manufacturers to bring prices in
    line with those paid in other developed nations, providing
    substantial price relief on numerous products taken by millions of
    Americans.
-   Shortly after returning to office, President Trump signed an
    Executive Order titled “Making America Healthy Again by Empowering
    Patients with Clear, Accurate, and Actionable Healthcare Pricing
    Information,” directing the Administration to, after years of
    neglect by the Biden Administration, promote universal access to
    clear and accurate healthcare prices. Since that time, CMS has
    ramped up enforcement against hospitals out of compliance with price
    transparency rules, finalized improvements to hospital price
    transparency rules, and proposed significant improvements to price
    transparency rules for insurance companies.
-   In his historic Working Families Tax Cuts Act, President Trump
    expanded access to health savings accounts for up to ten million
    people on Obamacare and took the most significant actions to reduce
    healthcare fraud and abuse in history, enabling the largest
    investment in rural healthcare ever.
-   On January 15, 2026, President Trump called on Congress to enact The
    Great Healthcare Plan, which would lower drug prices, lower
    insurance premiums, hold insurance companies accountable, and
    maximize price transparency.
