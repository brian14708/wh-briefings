title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Establishes New Department of Justice
  Division for National Fraud Enforcement'
---
 
**FIGHTING CRIMINAL FRAUD NATIONWIDE:** Today, the Trump Administration
is announcing the upcoming creation of the Department of Justice’s new
division for national fraud enforcement.

-   To combat the rampant and pervasive problem of fraud in the United
    States, the DOJ’s new division for national fraud enforcement will
    enforce the Federal criminal and civil laws against fraud targeting
    Federal government programs, Federally funded benefits, businesses,
    nonprofits, and private citizens nationwide.
-   The Assistant Attorney General for this new division will be
    responsible for leading the Department’s efforts to investigate,
    prosecute, and remedy fraud affecting the Federal government,
    Federally funded programs, and private citizens. This role will
    oversee multi-district and multi-agency fraud investigations;
    provide advice, assistance, and direction to the United States
    Attorneys’ Offices on fraud-related issues; and work closely with
    Federal agencies and Department components to identify, disrupt, and
    dismantle organized and sophisticated fraud schemes across
    jurisdictions.
    -   The new Assistant Attorney General will also help develop and
        set national enforcement priorities, and propose legislative and
        regulatory reforms as necessary to close systematic
        vulnerabilities and prevent future abuses.

    <!-- -->

    -   The Assistant Attorney General will also advise the Attorney
        General and Deputy Attorney General on issues involving
        significant, high-impact fraud investigations and prosecutions
        and related policy matters.

**HERE ARE THE ACTIONS THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ALREADY TAKEN TO END
MINNESOTA’S FRAUD EPIDEMIC:**

-   The Department of Justice is currently engaged in multiple active,
    ongoing, and extensive investigations into the fraudulent activity
    that has occurred in various Minnesota programs, including the
    State’s Feeding Our Future, Housing Stabilization Services, Early
    Intensive Developmental and Behavioral Intervention programs.
    Department lawyers are also leading the prosecution of the Evergreen
    Recovery Medicaid fraud defendants.
    -   The DOJ has charged 98 defendants in Minnesota fraud-related
        cases — 85 of whom are of Somali descent. 64 of the defendants
        have already been convicted.

    <!-- -->

    -   The DOJ has already issued over 1,750 subpoenas, executed over
        130 search warrants, and conducted over 1,000 witness interviews
        as part of its ongoing investigation.

    <!-- -->

    -   Many of the facilities and schemes visited in Nick Shirley’s
        viral video are currently under active investigation by the DOJ;
        in fact, one of the buildings prominently featured in the video
        has already had 13 defendants charged for fraud.

    <!-- -->

    -   The DOJ is surging prosecution resources to Minnesota, doubling
        the number of attorneys handling these matters.
-   The Federal Bureau of Investigation is conducting investigations
    into dozens of the State’s health care and home care providers
    accused of fraud, deploying forensic accountants and data analytics
    teams, and investigating potential links to elected officials and
    terrorist financing.
-   The Department of Homeland Security has sent roughly 2,000 agents to
    Minnesota and is conducting targeted, door-to-door investigations at
    locations suspected of fraud.
    -   DHS has arrested over 1,000 criminal illegal aliens in just the
        past few weeks as immigration enforcement operations continue.
        Additionally, as part of Operation Twin Shield earlier this
        year, DHS identified over 1,300 fraud findings based on site
        visits in Minneapolis and Saint Paul, and is currently in the
        process of determining which cases require additional vetting,
        including for refugee status and potential denaturalization.
-   The Department of Health and Human Services has frozen childcare
    payments and started requiring a justification, receipt, or photo
    evidence for all childcare-related payments nationwide. HHS is also
    enforcing a long-ignored Federal law to demand immigration sponsors
    repay Medicaid benefits used by sponsored immigrants. And HHS is
    investigating Minnesota’s Head Start programs over allegations of
    fraud by illegal aliens.
    -   The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services notified
        Minnesota Governor Tim Walz they are pressing pause on Medicaid
        payments to the 14 programs the State previously flagged for
        fraud, waste, and abuse until auditors can verify which claims
        are legitimate. This follows CMS’ determination that the
        Minnesota Medicaid agency is operating its program in
        substantial noncompliance with Federal requirements.

    <!-- -->

    -   HHS cut off an additional $10 billion in five Democrat-run
        states, including Minnesota.
-   The Small Business Administration has halted all annual grant
    payments to Minnesota. The agency also suspended 6,900 borrowers in
    the State due to approximately $400 million in suspected fraudulent
    activity — banning the individuals from all further loan programs,
    including disaster loans.
-   The Department of Housing and Urban Development has dispatched a
    team to Minnesota to investigate possible housing-assistance fraud.
-   The Department of Labor is currently conducting a targeted review of
    Minnesota’s Unemployment Insurance program.
-   The Department of Agriculture has demanded Minnesota conduct
    recertification for its SNAP recipients to ensure the program
    complies with eligibility requirements — a commonsense move
    inexplicably challenged in court by state officials.
