  Contracting'

**PUTTING OUR WARFIGHTERS FIRST:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order to stop defense contractors from putting stock
buybacks and excessive corporate distributions ahead of production
capacity, innovation, and on-time delivery for America’s military.

-   The Order directs the Secretary of War to identify defense
    contractors that underperform, fail to invest their own capital in
    production capacity, insufficiently prioritize U.S. government
    contracts, or maintain inadequate production speed while spending
    money that could be spent on those critical needs on stock buybacks
    or corporate distributions.
-   Identified contractors have the opportunity to submit a remediation
    plan or otherwise engage with the Secretary of War to resolve the
    issues; if the Secretary of War determines the plan is inadequate or
    the dispute remains unresolved after mutual discussions, the
    Secretary is authorized to immediately pursue remedies including
    mutually agreeing to amend the underlying contract, exercising
    authorities under the Defense Production Act, or pursuing other
    available contract enforcement mechanisms.
-   The Order directs the Secretary of War to take steps to ensure that
    future contracts prohibit stock buybacks and corporate distributions
    during periods of underperformance, non-compliance, insufficient
    prioritization or investment, or insufficient production speed.
-   The Secretary shall further take steps to ensure that future
    contracts permit the Secretary to, upon determining that a
    contractor is experiencing such issues, cap executive base salaries
    at current levels (with inflation adjustments permitted) while
    scrutinizing executive incentives to ensure they are directly,
    fairly, and tightly tied to prioritizing the needs of the
    warfighter.
-   The Order requires that executive incentive compensation under
    future contracts be tied to on-time delivery, increased production,
    and necessary operating improvements rather than short-term
    financial metrics.

-   The Order directs the Secretary of War, in consultation with the
    Secretaries of State and Commerce, to consider halting advocacy
    efforts or denying new advocacy cases for underperforming
    contractors competing for international Foreign Military or Direct
    Commercial Sales.
-   The Order also directs the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange
    Commission to reconsider safe-harbor protections for underperforming
    defense contractors.

**ENSURING OUR CONTRACTORS DO THEIR BEST FOR THE GOVERNMENT:** As Chief
Executive and Commander in Chief, President Trump is holding
underperforming defense contractors accountable to ensure the United
States military maintains the most lethal warfighting capabilities in
the world.

-   After years of misplaced priorities, many defense contractors have
    been incentivized to prioritize investor returns over the Nation’s
    warfighters.
-   These firms spend billions on stock buybacks and excessive dividends
    while falling behind on critical weapon systems and production
    timelines.
-   Some firms have pursued newer, more lucrative contracts while
    failing to deliver on existing ones and sacrificed production
    capacity, innovation, and on-time delivery for stock buybacks and
    non-ordinary-course dividends to shareholders. These actions have
    left troops without the equipment they need.
-   This behavior weakens military readiness, delays vital capabilities,
    and betrays the American people, who fund the defense budget.
-   Although the United States produces the world’s best military
    equipment, it does not manufacture enough quickly enough to meet the
    needs of our military and our partners; therefore, in these
    dangerous times, it is imperative that defense contractors be held
    to the highest standards to ensure timely, high-quality delivery in
    support of core national interests.
-   Every firm has a right to profit from prudent investment and hard
    work, but America’s defense industrial base has a responsibility to
    ensure America’s warfighters have the best possible equipment and
    weapons—these two objectives are not mutually exclusive.

**PRIORITIZING U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY:** President Trump has always put
the warfighter first and demanded accountability from every part of the
defense enterprise.

-   President Trump has eliminated wasteful spending to focus every
    defense dollar on lethality and readiness.
-   He signed an Executive Order to modernize defense acquisitions and
    spur innovation in the defense industrial base, ensuring red tape is
    no longer slowing defense acquisitions.
-   He signed an Executive Order directing the Department of Defense to
    update medical standards to prioritize readiness and lethality.
-   He signed an Executive Order to improve speed and accountability in
    the foreign defense sales system.
-   He restored the historic name “Department of War” as a secondary
    title for the Department of Defense, signaling America’s resolve to
    maintain peace through overwhelming strength.
-   He reinstated GI Bill education benefits to Veterans discharged
    under the Biden Administration for refusing the COVID vaccine.
