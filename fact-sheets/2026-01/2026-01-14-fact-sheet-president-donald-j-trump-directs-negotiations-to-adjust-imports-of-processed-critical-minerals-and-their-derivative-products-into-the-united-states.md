title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Directs Negotiations to Adjust Imports
  of Processed Critical Minerals and Their Derivative Products into the United States'
---
 
**SUPPORTING AMERICAN INDUSTRY:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed a Proclamation pursuant to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act
of 1962 (Act) ordering the U.S. Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade
Representative to jointly negotiate agreements with trading partners to
address the threatened impairment of national security with respect to
imports of processed critical minerals and their derivative products
(PCMDPs) from any country.

-   In negotiating, the Administration will, working with our allies,
    promote the adoption of price floors for trade in PCMDPs.
-   The Secretary of Commerce will inform the President of any
    circumstances that might indicate the need for further action under
    Section 232 with respect to PCMDPs.
-   The President may also take other actions he deems necessary to
    adjust imports of PCMDPs and eliminate the related threats to
    national security, including if the agreements directed to be
    negotiated are not entered into within 180 days of the proclamation,
    are not being carried out, or are ineffective. 

**ADDRESSING THE THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY:** President Trump
recognizes that PCMDPs are indispensable to almost every industry,
including national defense programs and critical infrastructure, and
recognizes the need to create diverse and more resilient supply chains
to counterbalance the influence of non-market practices by foreign
actors.

-   This action follows the Secretary of Commerce’s completion of a
    Section 232 investigation, which found that the present quantities
    and circumstances of the imports of processed critical minerals and
    their derivative products threaten to impair national security.
-   Despite increasing demand, critical mineral production in the United
    States has been declining.
-   Weakened domestic production and a lack of access to secure and
    reliable supply chains for critical minerals affect the production
    of advanced weapons systems, energy infrastructure, and everyday
    consumer goods while making America vulnerable to exploitation by
    foreign actors.
-   It is vital that the United States have sufficient domestic mining
    and processing of critical minerals to reduce import reliance on
    foreign countries.

**BUILDING ON A RECORD OF SECURING CRITICAL INDUSTRIES:** President
Trump has long recognized that America’s national security and economic
strength depend on securing reliable supplies of critical minerals.

-   In April, President Trump signed the Executive Order that launched
    this investigation into the national security risks posed by U.S.
    reliance on imported processed critical minerals and their
    derivative products.
-   President Trump has also worked tirelessly to restore American
    dominance in critical minerals and resources, including by:
    -   Unleashing America’s offshore critical minerals and resources.

    -   Increasing efficiency for federally funded critical mineral
        projects.

    -   Approving the Ambler Road Project to enable access to large
        deposits of critical minerals located in a
        currently-inaccessible area of Alaska.
-   While prioritizing domestic production, today’s action will also
    build upon the landmark critical minerals agreements President Trump
    has secured with key allies and partners, including Australia, Saudi
    Arabia, Malaysia, Thailand, Japan, and others, to diversify global
    supply chains and reduce dependence on adversarial nations.
