  \ Chips to Protect America\u2019s Economic and National Security"

**SUPPORTING AMERICA’S SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY:** Today, President Donald
J. Trump signed a Proclamation invoking Section 232 of the Trade
Expansion Act of 1962 (Act) to address national security concerns with
respect to imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing
equipment, and their derivative products.

-   The President directed the U.S. Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade
    Representative to jointly negotiate agreements, or continue any
    current negotiations of agreements, to address the threatened
    impairment of the national security with respect to imports of
    semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their
    derivative products from any country.
-   The President also imposed a 25% tariff on certain advanced
    computing chips, such as the NVIDIA H200 and AMD MI325X. This tariff
    will not apply to chips that are imported to support the buildout of
    the U.S. technology supply chain and the strengthening of domestic
    manufacturing capacity for derivatives of semiconductors.
-   In the near future, President Trump may impose broader tariffs on
    imports of semiconductors and their derivative products, as well as
    an accompanying tariff offset program to incentivize domestic
    manufacturing as previously announced.

**ADDRESSING THE THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY:** President Trump
recognizes that restoring capacity for domestic production of
semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their
derivative products is critical for economic and national security.

-   This action follows the Secretary of Commerce’s completion of a
    Section 232 investigation under the Act, which found that the
    present quantities and circumstances of the imports of
    semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their
    derivative products threaten to impair national security.
-   The United States’ capacity to produce semiconductors, certain
    semiconductor manufacturing equipment such as advanced lithography
    and etching tools, and their derivative products is insufficient to
    meet domestic demand. This has led the United States to be dependent
    on foreign sources to meet domestic demand. 
-   Semiconductors are essential to the United States’ economic,
    industrial, and military strength, and a disruption of
    import-reliant supply chains could strain the nation’s industrial
    and military capabilities.
-   Today’s action will address the threat to national security by,
    among other things, incentivizing domestic production of
    semiconductors and reducing our nation’s reliance on foreign sources
    and foreign supply chains.

**BUILDING ON A RECORD OF SECURING CRITICAL INDUSTRIES:** This
Proclamation builds upon previous actions taken by the Trump
Administration to ensure U.S. trade and industrial policies put America
first.

-   On Day One, President Trump established his America First Trade
    Policy to make America’s economy great again.
-   President Trump has repeatedly used Section 232 tariffs to protect
    against threats to our national security and to strengthen
    manufacturing sectors critical for our national and economic
    security, including steel, aluminum, copper, autos, and lumber.
-   Throughout his first year back in office, President Trump has
    announced many historic international trade deals to defend domestic
    production while expanding market access with America’s partners.
