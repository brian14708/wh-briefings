title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Addresses Threats to the United States
  by the Government of Cuba'
---
 
**CONFRONTING THE CUBAN REGIME:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order declaring a national emergency and
establishing a process to impose tariffs on goods from countries that
sell or otherwise provide oil to Cuba, protecting U.S. national security
and foreign policy from the Cuban regime’s malign actions and policies.

-   The Order imposes a new tariff system that allows the United States
    to impose additional tariffs on imports from any country that
    directly or indirectly provides oil to Cuba.
-   The Order authorizes the Secretary of State and Secretary of
    Commerce to take all necessary actions, including issuing rules and
    guidance, to implement the tariff system and related measures.
-   The President may modify the Order if Cuba or affected countries
    take significant steps to address the threat or align with U.S.
    national security and foreign policy objectives.

**COUNTERING CUBA’S MALIGN INFLUENCE:** The President is addressing the
depredations of the communist Cuban regime by taking decisive action to
hold the Cuban regime accountable for its support of hostile actors,
terrorism, and regional instability that endanger American security and
foreign policy.

-   The Cuban regime aligns itself with numerous hostile countries and
    malign actors, hosting their military and intelligence capabilities.
    For example, Cuba hosts Russia’s largest overseas signals
    intelligence facility focused on stealing sensitive national
    security information from the United States.
-   Cuba provides safe haven for transnational terrorist groups, such as
    Hezbollah and Hamas, and supports adversaries in the Western
    Hemisphere, undermining U.S. sanctions and regional stability.
-   The regime persecutes and tortures political opponents, denies free
    speech and press, profits corruptly from the Cuban people’s misery,
    and incites chaos by spreading communist ideology across the region.
-   These actions constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to U.S.
    national security and foreign policy, requiring immediate response
    to protect American citizens and interests.

**PUTTING AMERICA FIRST:** President Trump has consistently confronted
regimes that threaten U.S. security and interests, delivering where
others have failed to hold adversaries accountable.

-   President Trump is continuing efforts from his first term to stand
    with the Cuban people and hold the regime accountable.
    -   In his first term, President Trump implemented a robust policy
        toward Cuba, reversing the Obama Administration’s one-sided deal
        that eased restrictions without securing meaningful reforms for
        the Cuban people.
-   In June 2025, President Trump implemented partial travel
    restrictions on nationals from Cuba due to its role as a state
    sponsor of terrorism, its failure to cooperate or share sufficient
    law enforcement information with the United States, its historical
    refusal to accept back its removable nationals, and its high visa
    overstay rate.
-   In June 2025, President Trump signed a National Security
    Presidential Memorandum (NSPM) to strengthen the policy of the
    United States toward Cuba.
-   This is not the first time President Trump has taken a tough stance
    against hostile regimes—in just the past few months, he has ordered
    strikes on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure and authorized operations
    to remove Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro from power, making clear that
    dictators and state sponsors of terrorism will be held to account.
