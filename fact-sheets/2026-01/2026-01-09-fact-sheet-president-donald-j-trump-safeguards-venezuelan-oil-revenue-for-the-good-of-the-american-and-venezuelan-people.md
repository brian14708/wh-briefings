title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Safeguards Venezuelan Oil Revenue for
  the Good of the American and Venezuelan People'
---
 
**PROTECTING VENEZUELAN OIL REVENUE:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order declaring a national emergency to safeguard
Venezuelan oil revenue held in U.S. Treasury accounts from attachment or
judicial process, ensuring these funds are preserved to advance U.S.
foreign policy objectives.

-   The Order blocks any attachment, judgment, decree, lien, execution,
    garnishment, or other judicial process against Foreign Government
    Deposit Funds.
    -   Foreign Government Deposit Funds are defined as the Venezuelan
        oil revenues and diluent sales held in U.S. Treasury accounts.
-   The Order prohibits transfers or dealings in these funds except as
    authorized, superseding any prior Orders that might block or
    regulate them.
-   The Order affirms the funds are sovereign property of Venezuela held
    in U.S. custody for governmental and diplomatic purposes, not
    subject to private claims.

**ADVANCING U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN POLICY:** President Trump
is preventing the seizure of Venezuelan oil revenue that could undermine
critical U.S. efforts to ensure economic and political stability in
Venezuela.

-   Allowing attachment of these funds would directly jeopardize U.S.
    objectives, including stemming the influx of illegal aliens and
    disrupting the flood of illicit narcotics, which has resulted in the
    death of countless thousands of American citizens.
-   Loss of control over these revenues would empower malign actors like
    Iran and Hezbollah while weakening efforts to bring peace,
    prosperity, and stability to the Venezuelan people and to the
    Western Hemisphere as a whole.
-   The funds are held solely for sovereign purposes, and their
    protection reinforces U.S. compliance with international obligations
    and supports broader diplomatic objectives.

**PUTTING AMERICA FIRST:** President Trump has relentlessly confronted
threats from the Maduro regime and its enablers to defend American
interests and strengthen hemispheric security.

-   On Day One, President Trump designated eight cartels, including Tren
    de Aragua, as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) and Specially
    Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs) to combat their violence and
    drug trafficking.
-   President Trump authorized lethal force against narcoterrorists to
    stop the flow of deadly drugs into this country.
-   President Trump ordered a total and complete blockade of all
    sanctioned oil tankers going in and out of Venezuela.
-   President Trump offered multiple off ramps to Maduro and his
    illegitimate regime, but he was clear that the drug trafficking must
    stop.
-   Last week, U.S. armed forces conducted an extraordinary military
    operation in support of law enforcement to bring outlaw dictator
    Maduro to justice.
-   It is in the national interest of the United States to be surrounded
    by safe, secure, and stable countries; The President’s actions
    reestablish deterrence in the Western hemisphere.
-   By safeguarding these oil revenues, President Trump is promoting
    stability in Venezuela while advancing America First objectives:
    stopping illegal immigration, blocking deadly narcotics, and
    countering malign foreign influence.
