title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Launches the Great American Recovery
  Initiative to Address the Addiction Crisis'
---
 
**LAUNCHING THE GREAT AMERICAN RECOVERY INITIATIVE:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order creating the White House Great
American Recovery Initiative to coordinate a national response to the
disease of addiction across government, healthcare, faith communities,
and the private sector in order to save lives, restore families,
strengthen our communities, and build the Great American Recovery.

-   The Order establishes the Initiative, co-chaired by the Secretary of
    Health and Human Services and the Senior Advisor for Addiction
    Recovery.
    -   Additional members of the Initiative include an executive
        director, cabinet secretaries, and senior administration
        leaders, some with deeply personal ties to the addiction crisis
        who are committed to ensuring Americans get the help they need.
-   The Order directs the Initiative to:
    -   Recommend all necessary steps to coordinate the Federal
        Government’s response to the addiction crisis, including by
        better aligning relevant Federal programs, setting clear
        objectives, and providing data-driven updates to the public on
        progress towards meeting these objectives;

    <!-- -->

    -   Take appropriate actions to increase awareness of the disease of
        addiction, help Americans receive the treatment they need, and
        foster a culture that celebrates recovery;

    <!-- -->

    -   Advise agencies on how to implement programs that integrate
        prevention, early intervention, treatment, recovery support, and
        re-entry;

    <!-- -->

    -   Advise agencies on directing appropriate grants to support
        addiction recovery, with a focus on prevention, treatment, and
        long-term resilience; and

    <!-- -->

    -   Consult with States, tribal nations, local jurisdictions,
        community-based organizations, faith-based organizations, the
        private sector, and philanthropic entities on the best
        strategies to ensure more Americans receive the treatment they
        need and celebrate individuals going through the recovery
        process.

**MAKING PROGRESS ON THE DISEASE OF ADDICTION:** The disease of
addiction, also known as substance use disorder, is a crisis that
touches families in every community in our Nation. 

-   Addiction is a chronic, treatable disease with relapse rates similar
    to other chronic diseases.
-   48.4 million Americans, or 16.8% of our Nation’s population, suffer
    from addiction, yet very few who need treatment receive it or
    believe they need it.
-   Among the 40.7 million adults with a substance use disorder in 2024
    who did not receive treatment, 95.6% (or 38.1 million people) did
    not perceive they needed it.
-   Addiction contributes to declining workforce participation,
    increased healthcare costs, homelessness, family instability, and
    lost productivity that together cost the United States hundreds of
    billions of dollars each year.
-   The framework for addiction treatment should parallel that of other
    chronic diseases – utilizing evidence-based care, scientific
    advancement, continuous support, and community connection.

**DELIVERING ON PROMISES TO ADDRESS THE ADDICTION CRISIS:** President
Trump is committed to ending the addiction crisis and ensuring every
American can access the help they need.

-   He signed the SUPPORT Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act
    of 2025, strengthening Federal programs that address substance use
    disorders, overdoses, and mental health.
-   He has taken aggressive action to stop the flow of deadly drugs into
    the United States, determined to save lives from the devastation
    caused by illicit narcotics crossing the border.
-   He signed into law the HALT Fentanyl Act to permanently place
    Fentanyl-related substances into Schedule I of the Controlled
    Substances Act.
-   His Administration is working to prevent drug use before it starts,
    strengthen treatment that leads to long-term recovery, and advance
    research and data to support effective drug control strategies.
-   These efforts build on historic actions from President Trump’s first
    term, when he:
    -   Declared the opioid crisis a nationwide public health emergency.
