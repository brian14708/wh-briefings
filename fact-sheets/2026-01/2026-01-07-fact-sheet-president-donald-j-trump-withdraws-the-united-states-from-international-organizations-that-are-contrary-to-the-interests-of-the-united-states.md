title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Withdraws the United States from International
  Organizations that Are Contrary to the Interests of the United States'
---
 
**WITHDRAWING FROM INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum directing the
withdrawal of the United States from 66 international organizations that
no longer serve American interests.

-   The Memorandum orders all Executive Departments and Agencies to
    cease participating in and funding 35 non-United Nations (UN)
    organizations and 31 UN entities that operate contrary to U.S.
    national interests, security, economic prosperity, or sovereignty.
-   This follows a review ordered earlier this year of all international
    intergovernmental organizations, conventions, and treaties that the
    United States is a member of or party to, or that the United States
    funds or supports.
-   These withdrawals will end American taxpayer funding and involvement
    in entities that advance globalist agendas over U.S. priorities, or
    that address important issues inefficiently or ineffectively such
    that U.S. taxpayer dollars are best allocated in other ways to
    support the relevant missions.

**RESTORING AMERICAN SOVEREIGNTY:** President Trump is ending U.S.
participation in international organizations that undermine America’s
independence and waste taxpayer dollars on ineffective or hostile
agendas.

-   Many of these bodies promote radical climate policies, global
    governance, and ideological programs that conflict with U.S.
    sovereignty and economic strength.
-   American taxpayers have spent billions on these organizations with
    little return, while they often criticize U.S. policies, advance
    agendas contrary to our values, or waste taxpayer dollars by
    purporting to address important issues but not achieving any real
    results.
-   By exiting these entities, President Trump is saving taxpayer money
    and refocusing resources on America First priorities.

**PUTTING AMERICA FIRST ON THE GLOBAL STAGE:** President Trump has
consistently fought to protect U.S. sovereignty and ensure international
engagements serve American interests.

-   Immediately upon returning to office, President Trump initiated the
    withdrawal of the United States from the World Health Organization
    and the Paris Climate Agreement.
-   On Day One of his Administration, President Trump also signed a
    Presidential Memorandum to notify the Organization for Economic
    Co-operation and Development that its Global Tax Deal has no force
    or effect in the United States, and direct an investigation into
    whether foreign countries have tax rules in place that are
    extraterritorial or disproportionately affect American companies.
-   Just weeks later, President Trump signed an Executive Order
    withdrawing the United States from the UN Human Rights Council
    (UNHRC) and prohibiting any future funding for the UN Relief and
    Works Agency for the Near East (UNRWA).
-   He has prioritized American interests by redirecting focus and
    resources toward domestic priorities such as infrastructure,
    military readiness, and border security, and acting swiftly to
    protect American companies from foreign interference.
