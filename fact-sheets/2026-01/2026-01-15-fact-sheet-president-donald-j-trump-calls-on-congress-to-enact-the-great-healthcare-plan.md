  Healthcare Plan'

**CALLING ON CONGRESS TO LOWER HEALTHCARE COSTS:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump called on Congress to enact the Great Healthcare Plan, a
comprehensive plan to lower drug prices, lower insurance premiums, hold
big insurance companies accountable, and maximize price transparency.

**LOWERING DRUG PRICES:** The Great Healthcare Plan lowers prescription
drug prices for all Americans by building on President Trump’s historic
actions to reduce costs for American patients.

-   The Great Healthcare Plan calls for codifying the Trump
    Administration’s Most-Favored-Nation deals to get Americans the same
    low prices for prescription drugs that people in other countries
    pay. This would build off President Trump’s landmark actions that
    made insulin more affordable in his first term and the successful
    voluntary negotiations following his recent Executive Order to lower
    drug prices. Voluntarily negotiated deals with HHS/CMS will be
    grandfathered
    in.                                                      
-   The Great Healthcare Plan makes more verified safe pharmaceutical
    drugs available for over-the-counter purchase. This will lower
    healthcare costs and increase consumer choice by strengthening price
    transparency, increasing competition, and reducing the need for
    costly and time-consuming doctor’s visits.                      

**LOWERING INSURANCE PREMIUMS:** The Great Healthcare Plan would execute
the President’s vision to send money directly to the American people,
lower health insurance premiums, and cut kickbacks that raise insurance
premiums. 

-   The Great Healthcare Plan stops sending big insurance companies
    billions in extra taxpayer-funded subsidy payments and instead send
    that money directly to eligible Americans to allow them to buy the
    health insurance of their
    choice.                                                                                    
                                                   
-   The Great Healthcare Plan funds a cost-sharing reduction program for
    healthcare plans which would save taxpayers at least $36 billion and
    reduce the most common Obamacare plan premiums by over 10% according
    to the Congressional Budget Office.
-   The Great Healthcare Plan will end the kickbacks paid by pharmacy
    benefit managers (PBMs) to the large brokerage middlemen that
    deceptively raise the cost of health insurance.

**HOLDING BIG INSURANCE COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE:** The Great Healthcare
Plan ends the days of insurance companies using complexity to make it
difficult for Americans to hold them to account by creating the “Plain
English” insurance standard and requiring insurance companies to
prominently post the profits they take out of premiums as well as
information on the frequency with which they deny care.

-   The Great Healthcare Plan creates the “Plain English” insurance
    standard by requiring health insurance companies to publish rate and
    coverage comparisons upfront on their websites in plain English—not
    industry jargon—so consumers can make better insurance purchasing
    decisions.                                                  
-   The Great Healthcare Plan will require health insurance companies to
    publish the percentage of their revenues that are paid out to claims
    versus overhead costs and profits on their websites.
-   The Great Healthcare Plan will require health insurance companies to
    publish the percentage of insurance claims they reject and average
    wait times for routine care on their websites.

**MAXIMIZING PRICE TRANSPARENCY:** The Great Healthcare Plan requires
any healthcare provider or insurer who accepts Medicare or Medicaid to
prominently post their pricing and fees in their place of business and
ensure insurance companies are complying with price transparency
requirements.

-   In President Trump’s first term, he issued historic regulations
    requiring hospitals and insurance companies to post prices in
    various forms.
-   The Biden Administration failed to enforce these requirements and
    took no actions to help patients access actual prices.
-   The Great Healthcare Plan requires all healthcare providers and
    insurers to answer to their patients up front on the prices they
    will be charged—restoring accountability, transparency, and rightly
    giving power back to patients.

**DELIVERING ON PROMISES TO LOWER THE COST OF HEALTHCARE:** President
Trump promised to lower healthcare costs for ALL Americans and The Great
Healthcare Plan will build off of critical actions already taken in his
second term to help Americans afford high-quality healthcare.

-   On May 12, 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order titled
    “Delivering Most-Favored-Nation Prescription Drug Pricing to
    American Patients” directing the Administration to take numerous
    actions to bring American drug prices in line with those paid by
    similar nations. Since that time, the Administration has secured 16
    deals with major pharmaceutical manufacturers to bring prices in
    line with those paid in other developed nations, providing
    substantial price relief on numerous products taken by millions of
    Americans.
-   Shortly after returning to office, President Trump signed an
    Executive Order titled “Making America Healthy Again by Empowering
    Patients with Clear, Accurate, and Actionable Healthcare Pricing
    Information,” directing the Administration to, after years of
    neglect by the Biden Administration, promote universal access to
    clear and accurate healthcare prices. Since that time, the Centers
    for Medicare and Medicaid Services has ramped up enforcement against
    hospitals out of compliance with price transparency rules, finalized
    improvements to hospital price transparency rules, and proposed
    significant improvements to price transparency rules for insurance
    companies.
-   In his historic Working Families Tax Cuts law, President Trump
    expanded access to health savings accounts for up to ten million
    people on Obamacare, took the most significant actions to reduce
    healthcare fraud and abuse in history, and made the largest
    investment in rural healthcare ever.
