title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Addresses State and Local Failures to
  Rebuild Los Angeles After Wildfire Disasters'
---
 
**ACCELERATING REBUILDING IN WILDFIRE-DEVASTATED LOS ANGELES:** On
Friday, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to cut
through bureaucratic red tape and speed up reconstruction in the Pacific
Palisades and Eaton Canyon areas one year after devastating wildfires
destroyed nearly 40,000 acres of homes and businesses.

-   The Order directs the Administrator of the Federal Emergency
    Management Agency (FEMA) and the Administrator of the Small Business
    Administration (SBA) to issue regulations that preempt State and
    local procedural permitting requirements and enable builders to
    self-certify to a Federal agency designee that they have complied
    with State and local substantive health, safety, and building
    standards.
-   The Order directs agencies to use all available authorities under
    Federal environmental, historic preservation, and natural resource
    laws, including the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA),
    Endangered Species Act, and the National Historic Preservation Act,
    to expedite waivers, permits, and approvals that may be required
    from the Federal government.
-   The Order further directs the development of legislative proposals
    that would enable FEMA and the SBA to address situations in which
    State or local governments are not enabling timely recovery after
    disasters.
-   It orders FEMA to determine whether any of California’s nearly $3
    billion in unspent Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funds were
    awarded arbitrarily or contrary to law, and to conduct a full audit
    of California’s use of those funds.

**OVERCOMING STATE AND LOCAL OBSTRUCTION:** President Trump is taking
decisive action to overcome California and Los Angeles’s permitting
failures that have left numerous families, businesses, and houses of
worship displaced and unable to rebuild a year after the wildfires.

-   Despite billions of dollars in Federal recovery awards and the
    fastest Federal debris removal in American history, only about 2,500
    of the tens of thousands of homes and businesses destroyed have
    received permits to rebuild.
    -   Now a year after the fires, less than 10 homes have been
        rebuilt.
-   Overly burdensome, confusing, and inconsistent permitting
    requirements, duplicative permitting reviews, procedural
    bottlenecks, and administrative delays have effectively stalled
    recovery efforts.
-   Even expedited reviews promised by local leaders have taken months,
    with processing times averaging 93 days for the Palisades.
-   Permit fees and environmental reviews add further delays and costs.
-   State and local barriers prevent survivors from returning home,
    reopening businesses, and restoring communities, prolonging hardship
    and economic loss.

**RESTORING COMMON SENSE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT:** President Trump
has consistently demonstrated a commonsense approach to safeguard and
protect the environment and American communities.

-   On Day One, President Trump signed a Memorandum to prioritize
    routing water to Southern California in the wake of the destructive
    wildfires.
-   In President Trump’s first week back in office, he and First Lady
    Melania Trump visited Los Angeles to inspect wildfire damage,
    promising immediate Federal support and relief.
-   Upon visiting Los Angeles, President Trump immediately issued
    measures to provide increased water resources in California and
    promote expedited recovery procedures for Californians after their
    State government’s disastrous mishandling and misuse of resources
    and lack of preparation for the January 2025 wildfires.
-   In March 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order to enhance
    forest management, promoting responsible use of American timber to
    reduce wildfire risks. 
-   In June 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order returning
    common sense to wildfire prevention and response.
