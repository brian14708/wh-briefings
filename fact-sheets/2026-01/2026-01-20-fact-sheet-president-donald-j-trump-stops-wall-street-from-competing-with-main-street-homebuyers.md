  Main Street Homebuyers'

**STOPPING WALL STREET FROM COMPETING WITH MAIN STREET HOMEBUYERS:**
Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to protect
the American Dream by making sure that large institutional investors do
not buy single-family homes that could otherwise be purchased by
families.

-   The Order directs key agencies to issue guidance preventing relevant
    Federal programs from approving, insuring, guaranteeing,
    securitizing, or facilitating sales of single-family homes to
    institutional investors.
-   The Order instructs key agencies to promote sales to individual
    owner-occupants through first-look policies (which give individuals
    and other non-institutional investors the opportunity to buy
    foreclosed properties before investors do), disclosure requirements,
    and anti-circumvention measures.
-   The Order directs the Secretary of the Treasury to review rules and
    guidance that relate to large institutional investors acquiring or
    holding single-family homes.
-   It directs the Attorney General and the Chairman of the Federal
    Trade Commission to review acquisitions by large institutional
    investors for anti-competitive practices and prioritize enforcement
    against certain of those practices by institutional investors in the
    single-family home rental market.
-   The Order directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to
    identify potential large institutional investor involved in Federal
    housing assistance programs by demanding disclosure of ownership in
    single-family rentals. 
-   The Order tasks the White House with preparing legislative
    recommendations to codify these policies so that large institutional
    investors do not acquire single-family homes.

**PUTTING AMERICAN FAMILIES FIRST IN THE HOUSING MARKET:** President
Trump is working to make homeownership affordable again after years of
Wall Street crowding out first-time buyers and young families.

-   For many, homeownership is considered the pinnacle of the American
    dream and a way to invest and build lifetime wealth.
-   However, high inflation and interest rates caused by the Biden
    Administration have put starter homes out of reach for millions,
    while large Wall Street investors have snapped up single-family
    homes in many communities.
-   Institutional buyers with vast resources outbid hardworking
    families, turning neighborhoods into investor rental portfolios
    instead of communities.
-   Large institutional buying and leverage have reduced the supply of
    homes for owner-occupants and driven up prices in many locales,
    making it harder for Americans to build wealth through
    homeownership.
-   This Order ensure that Federal housing programs prioritize families,
    not Wall Street, and sets the stage for legislation to ensure that
    large institutional investors do not acquire single-family homes.
-   People live in homes, not corporations.

**DELIVERING ON PROMISES TO AMERICAN FAMILIES:** President Trump has
undertaken an aggressive agenda to tackle the housing challenges facing
American families and make the dream of homeownership accessible again.

-   This Executive Order fulfills President Trump’s promise to
    “immediately \[take\] steps to ban large institutional investors
    from buying more single-family homes.”
-   President Trump has also directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to
    purchase $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities to further drive
    down borrowing costs.
-   These targeted housing and affordability initiatives build on
    actions President Trump has already taken to put more money in
    Americans’ pockets.
    -   Upon taking office, President Trump blocked all unfinalized
        Biden era rules, saving the average family $2,100.

    <!-- -->

    -   He signed the Working Families Tax Cuts into law – delivering
        the largest tax cut in American history and increasing paychecks
        by over $10,000 for a typical family.
    -   His America First, pro-growth, energy dominance, and
        deregulatory agenda has cut red tape, lowered inflation,
        mortgage rates, and gas prices, boosted GDP growth, and brought
        trillions in investments to the United States.
-   President Trump continues to focus on ways to provide more relief to
    Americans from the economic and financial mismanagement of the Biden
    era, so families can prosper and achieve the American Dream of
    owning a home.
