  Drug Prices to American Patients'

**HISTORIC LAUNCH TO LOWER DRUG PRICES FOR AMERICAN PATIENTS:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump announced the launch of
*[TrumpRx.gov](https://trumprx.gov/)*. Through the website, patients
will be able to access large discounts on many of the most popular and
highest-priced medicines in the country, paying prices in line with the
lowest paid by other developed nations (known as the
most-favored-nation, or MFN, price).

-   Today’s launch features drugs made by the first five manufacturers
    to reach MFN pricing deals with the Trump Administration:
    AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly, EMD Serono, Novo Nordisk, and Pfizer.
-   Additional drugs from other companies that have signed MFN pricing
    deals will be made available through *TrumpRx.gov* in the coming
    months.
-   *TrumpRx.gov* provides patients with access to a world-class
    experience for accessing deep discounts on the medicines they need.
    Depending on the manufacturer of a given drug, patients with valid
    prescriptions will be able to access savings through user-friendly
    coupons that can be printed or downloaded onto their phones or
    through channels set up by the manufacturer and integrated into
    *TrumpRx.gov*.

**DELIVERING LOWER COSTS ON THE MOST POPULAR DRUGS:** As of today,
patients purchasing directly through *TrumpRx.gov* will be able to see
massive price reductions on 40 of the most popular and expensive branded
medicines in the nation. Select examples include:

-   Historic price reductions for Americans on the two drugs with the
    highest annual expenditures in the United States, which help adults
    struggling with diabetes, heart disease (Ozempic and Wegovy only),
    obesity, and other conditions.
    -   The monthly prices of Ozempic and injectable Wegovy will fall
        from $1,028 and $1,349, respectively, to an average price of
        $350 and as low as $199, depending on dosage strength.The

    medications in the country to help families grow. Many patients
    struggling with infertility pay for their medicines out-of-pocket,
    meaning they will stand to save more than $2,000 per cycle of
    fertility drugs, on average.

**DELIVERING ON PROMISES TO PUT AMERICAN PATIENTS FIRST:** President
Trump is delivering on promises to ensure American patients no longer
pay high prices to subsidize low prices in the rest of the world,
something the political establishment did not believe was possible.

-   On May 12, 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order titled:
    “Delivering Most-Favored-Nation Prescription Drug Pricing to
    American Patients” directing the Administration to take numerous
    actions to bring American drug prices in line with those paid by
    similar nations.
-   On July 31, 2025, President Trump sent letters to leading
    pharmaceutical manufacturers outlining the steps they must take to
    bring down the prices of prescription drugs in the United States to
    match the lowest price offered in other developed nations.
-   Since September 30, 2025, President Trump has announced 16 deals
    with major pharmaceutical manufacturers to bring prices in line with
    those paid in other developed nations, which will provide
    substantial price relief on numerous products taken by millions of
    Americans.
-   On December 1, 2025, the Office of the United States Trade
    Representative, the Department of Commerce, and the Department of
    Health and Human Services announced an agreement with the United
    Kingdom (U.K.) that will increase the net price of new prescription
    drugs by 25% in the U.K., helping ensure that they pay their fair
    share for innovative medicines.
-   On January 15, 2026, President Trump called on Congress to enact The
    Great Healthcare Plan, which would lower drug prices by codifying
    the savings from his Most-Favored-Nation pricing initiative, lower
    insurance premiums, hold insurance companies accountable, and
    maximize price transparency.
