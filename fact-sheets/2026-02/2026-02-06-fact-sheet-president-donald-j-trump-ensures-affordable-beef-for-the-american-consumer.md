title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Ensures Affordable Beef for the American
  Consumer'
---
 
**SUPPLEMENTING OUR BEEF SUPPLY:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed a Proclamation temporarily increasing the U.S. tariff-rate quota
for lean beef trimmings to boost supply and make ground beef affordable
for American consumers despite current supply challenges.

-   The Proclamation permits an additional 80,000 metric tons of lean
    beef trimmings per year from Argentina to be imported tariff-free in
    four quarterly tranches of 20,000 metric tons each.
-   The Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the United States
    Trade Representative, will continue monitoring domestic lean beef
    supplies and related imports and will advise on any additional
    actions needed to ensure an adequate domestic supply.

**RESPONDING TO LOWER GROUND BEEF AVAILABILITY:** President Trump is
responding to market challenges and ensuring a plentiful ground beef
supply for American families at affordable prices by taking action on
multiple fronts.  

-   The U.S. cattle herd has fallen to a record low of 86.2 million head
    as of January 2026, with beef cow inventory down by 8.6% since 2020.
-   Years of drought and widespread wildfires have affected grazing
    lands, reduced feed supplies, and forced ranchers to adapt, sharply
    reducing domestic beef production.
-   Restrictions on cattle imports from Mexico, enacted following
    detections of New World Screwworm, were essential to prevent the
    spread of this livestock disease but have also constrained feedlot
    stock supplies, exacerbating shortages.
-   As a result, ground beef prices reached an average of $6.69 per
    pound in December 2025, the highest since tracking began in the
    1980s.
-   The United States is the world’s largest consumer of beef by volume
    and ranks second globally in per capita beef consumption,
    underscoring beef’s importance to the American diet.
-   The President is taking action to strengthen the nation’s supply of
    affordable beef for American consumers while these challenges
    persist.

**DELIVERING LOWER COSTS FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES WHILE SUPPORTING OUR
RANCHERS:** President Trump is fighting every day to reverse Biden’s
inflation crisis, and strengthen the backbone of our food supply.

-   In July 2025, President Trump signed the largest tax cuts in
    American history, providing families with thousands more in their
    pockets each year.
    -   The One Big Beautiful Bill’s various tax provisions also make
        the ranching industry more attractive for investment, boosting
        profitability for ranchers now and into the future.
-   In October 2025, the Trump Administration announced a suite of
    actions to strengthen the American beef industry, reinforcing and
    prioritizing the American rancher’s critical role in the national
    security of the United States.
-   In December 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order to stop
    price fixing, anti-competitive behavior, and foreign influence that
    drives up grocery prices and threatens the security of America’s
    food supply.
-   By halting proposed Biden-era regulations, President Trump has
    already saved Americans over $180 billion, or $2,100 per family of
    four.
-   Under four years of Biden, workers lost nearly $3,000 in purchasing
    power — meaning inflation rose faster than wages. Under President
    Trump, even after accounting for higher prices, real wages are on
    track to grow by $1,100 after his first full year.
-   The Administration is committed to reducing risk for cattle
    producers, supporting new ranchers across the country, and ensuring
    ranchers are prosperous now and into the future.
