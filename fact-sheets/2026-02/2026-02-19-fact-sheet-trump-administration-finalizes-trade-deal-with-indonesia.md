**ACHIEVING RECIPROCAL TRADE: **Today, the Trump Administration
finalized a landmark trade agreement with Indonesia that will provide
Americans with unprecedented market access and unlock major
breakthroughs for America’s manufacturing, agriculture, and digital
sectors.

-   President Donald J. Trump and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto
    also signed a document today confirming their strong commitment to
    implementing this agreement.
-   Key terms of the U.S.-Indonesia Agreement on Reciprocal Trade
    include:
    -   Indonesia will eliminate tariff barriers on over 99% of U.S.
        products exported to Indonesia across all sectors, including for
        agricultural products, health products, seafood, information and
        communications technology, automotive products, and chemicals.

    <!-- -->

    -   Indonesia will address a range of non-tariff barriers, such as
        exempting U.S. companies and originating goods from local
        content requirements, accepting U.S. federal motor vehicle
        safety and emission standards, accepting FDA standards for
        medical devices and pharmaceuticals, removing burdensome
        certification and labeling requirements, eliminating
        pre-shipment requirements, and taking steps to resolve many
        long-standing intellectual property issues.

    <!-- -->

    -   Indonesia will address and prevent barriers to U.S. agricultural
        products being sold in the Indonesian market, including by
        exempting food and agricultural products from all of Indonesia’s
        import licensing regimes and ensuring transparency and fairness
        with respect to geographical indications, including meats and
        cheeses, and more.

    <!-- -->

    -   Indonesia has committed to eliminate barriers for digital trade,
        including eliminating existing HTS tariff lines on “intangible
        products”; supporting a permanent moratorium on customs duties
        on electronic transmissions at the World Trade Organization
        immediately and without conditions; and ensuring a level playing
        field for U.S. electronic payment service companies.

    <!-- -->

    -   Indonesia has committed to join the Global Forum on Steel Excess
        Capacity and take actions to address global excess capacity in
        the steel sector and its impacts.

    <!-- -->

    -   The United States and Indonesia will cooperate to increase
        supply chain resilience, address duty evasion, and ensure
        adequate export controls and investment security. Indonesia will
        remove restrictions on exports to the United States for all
        industrial commodities, including critical minerals.

    <!-- -->

    -   Indonesia has committed to adopt and implement a forced labor
        import ban and remove provisions from its labor laws that
        restrict workers and unions from fully exercising freedom of
        association and collective bargaining rights.

    <!-- -->

    -   The United States and Indonesia commend the massive commercial
        deals reached of approximately $33 billion worth of investment
        in agriculture, aerospace, and energy in the United States –
        further increasing U.S. exports to Indonesia. This includes:
        -   <span style="letter-spacing: 0.2px">Purchases of
            approximately $15 billion of U.S. energy commodities</span>.
        -   <span style="letter-spacing: 0.2px">Procurement of
            commercial aircraft and aviation-related goods and
            services of approximately $13.5 billion, including from
            Boeing.</span>
        -   Purchases of over $4.5 billion of U.S. agricultural
            products.

-   Freeport-McMoRan signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Indonesia
    to extend its mining license and expand operations in the Grasberg
    minerals district, the world’s second largest copper mine. This deal
    will generate an expected $10 billion in annual revenue and will
    further strengthen U.S. supply chains for critical minerals.
-   President Trump has delivered a forward-looking, expansive trade
    deal in one of the biggest markets in Southeast Asia, benefitting
    American workers, exporters, farmers, and digital innovators.

**THE PROSPEROUS PATH FORWARD: **In the coming weeks, the United States
and Indonesia will undertake applicable domestic procedures to make the
Agreement effective.

-   The United States will maintain a 19% reciprocal tariff rate for
    imports from Indonesia, except for certain identified products which
    will receive a 0% reciprocal tariff rate.
    -   The United States committed to establish a mechanism allowing
        certain textile and apparel goods from Indonesia to receive a 0%
        reciprocal tariff rate for a to-be-specified volume of apparel
        and textile imports. This volume will be determined in relation
        to the quantity of exports of textiles produced from American
        cotton and man-made fiber textile inputs from the United States.
-   The United States may positively consider the effect that the
    Agreement has on national security, including taking the Agreement
    into consideration when taking trade action under section 232 of the
    Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862).
-   The United States currently runs its 15<sup>th</sup> largest goods
    trade deficit with Indonesia.
    -   The U.S. total goods trade deficit with Indonesia was $23.7
        billion in 2025.
    -   Before this deal, Indonesia’s simple average applied tariff was
        8% while the U.S. average applied tariff was 3.3%. 

**LIBERATING AMERICA FROM UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES: ** President Trump has
challenged the assumption that American workers and businesses must
tolerate unfair trade practices that have disadvantaged them for decades
and contributed to our historic global trade deficit.

-   On April 2, 2025, President Trump declared a national emergency in
    response to the large and persistent U.S. goods trade deficit caused
    by a lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships,
    unfair tariff and non-tariff barriers, and U.S. trading partners’
    economic policies that suppress domestic wages and consumption.
-   President Trump continues to advance the interests of the American
    people by removing tariff and non-tariff barriers and expanding
    market access for American exporters.
-   The United States has reached trade agreements with major U.S.
    trading partners covering more than half of global GDP.
-   Today’s announcement shows that America can defend its domestic
    production and strengthen its defense industrial base while
    obtaining expansive market access with our trading partners.
