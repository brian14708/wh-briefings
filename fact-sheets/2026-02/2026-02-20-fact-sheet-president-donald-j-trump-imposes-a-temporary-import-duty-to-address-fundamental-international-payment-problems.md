title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Imposes a Temporary Import Duty to Address
  Fundamental International Payment Problems'
---
 
**PROTECTING THE U.S. ECONOMY AND NATIONAL INTERESTS:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump signed a Proclamation imposing a temporary import duty
to address fundamental international payments problems and continue the
Administration’s work to rebalance our trade relationships to benefit
American workers, farmers, and manufacturers.

-   President Trump is invoking his authority under section 122 of the
    Trade Act of 1974, which empowers the President to address certain
    fundamental international payment problems through surcharges and
    other special import restrictions.
    -   By taking this action, the United States can stem the outflow of
        its dollars to foreign producers and incentivize the return of
        domestic production. By increasing its domestic production, the
        United States can correct its balance-of-payments deficit, while
        also creating good paying jobs, and lowering costs for
        consumers.
-   The Proclamation imposes, for a period of 150 days, a 10% *ad
    valorem* import duty on articles imported into the United States.
    -   The temporary import duty will take effect February 24 at 12:01
        a.m. eastern standard time.
-   Some goods will not be subject to the temporary import duty because
    of the needs of the U.S. economy or in order to ensure the duty more
    effectively addresses the fundamental international payments
    problems facing the United States, including:
    -   certain critical minerals, metals used in currency and bullion,
        energy, and energy products;

    <!-- -->

    -   natural resources and fertilizers that cannot be grown, mined,
        or otherwise produced in the United States or grown, mined, or
        otherwise produced in sufficient quantities to meet domestic
        demand;

    <!-- -->

    -   certain agricultural products, including beef, tomatoes, and
        oranges;

    <!-- -->

    -   pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients;

    <!-- -->

    -   certain electronics;

    <!-- -->

    -   passenger vehicles, certain light trucks, certain medium and
        heavy-duty vehicles, buses, and certain parts of passenger
        vehicles, light trucks, heavy-duty vehicles, and buses;

    <!-- -->

    -   certain aerospace products; and

    <!-- -->

    -   informational materials (*e.g.*, books), donations, and
        accompanied baggage.
-   In addition, the following goods will not be subject to the
    temporary import duty:
    -   all articles and parts of articles that currently are or later
        become subject to section 232 actions;

    <!-- -->

    -   USMCA compliant goods of Canada and Mexico; and

    <!-- -->

    -   textiles and apparel articles that enter duty-free as a good of
        Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala,
        Honduras, or Nicaragua under the Dominican Republic-Central
        America Free Trade Agreement.
-   In a separate Executive Order, President Trump also reaffirmed and
    continued the suspension of duty-free *de minimis* treatment for
    low-value shipments, including goods shipped through the
    international postal system, which will also be subject to the
    temporary import duty imposed under section 122.
-   In addition to today’s actions, the President has directed the
    Office of the United States Trade Representative to use its section
    301 authority to investigate certain unreasonable and discriminatory
    acts, policies, and practices that burden or restrict U.S. commerce.

**ADDRESSING FUNDAMENTAL INTERNATIONAL PAYMENT PROBLEMS:** The United
States faces fundamental international payment problems, in particular a
large and serious balance-of-payments deficit.

-   As a result of its loss of domestic production, the United States
    must import much of what it consumes, sending U.S. dollars out of
    our own economy and overseas.
-   A measurement for the U.S. balance-of-payments is the current
    account, which tracks the three ways a country can make money: (1)
    selling goods and services overseas, or the “trade balance of goods
    and services”; (2) return on investment or labor, or the “balance on
    primary income”; and (3) voluntary transfers, like remittances, or
    the “balance on secondary income.”
-   The United States not only runs an overall current account deficit,
    but also a deficit in each component of the current account.
    -   The annual U.S. goods trade deficit exploded by over 40% during
        the Biden Administration, reaching $1.2 trillion in 2024.

    <!-- -->

    -   In 2024, for the first time in more than 60 years, the United
        States made less on the capital and labor it deployed abroad
        than foreigners made on the capital and labor they deployed in
        the United States.

    <!-- -->

    -   At present, more money is transferred out of the United States
        through remittances than money is transferred in.
-   The situation is getting worse.
    -   In 2024, the United States maintained a current account deficit
        of -4.0% of gross domestic product (GDP), almost double the
        current account deficit of approximately -2.0% that prevailed
        between 2013 and 2019, and larger than 2019 to 2024.

    <!-- -->

    -   As a share of GDP, the 2024 current account deficit represented
        the biggest annual current account deficit since 2008.
-   Compounding these challenges is the decline in the U.S. net
    international investment position.
    -   At the end of 2024, the U.S. net international investment
        position was $26 trillion, which was 89% of U.S. GDP. This means
        that if all of the obligations to foreigners that the United
        States has incurred were to come due today, and even if all of
        the foreign assets that the U.S. owns could be instantly
        deployed as payment, the United States would still end up
        needing to make payments equal to 89% of its annual economic
        output in order to meet its obligations. This represents the
        most negative net international investment position of any
        country on Earth.
-   If left unaddressed, these fundamental international payment
    problems can, among other things, endanger the ability of the United
    States to finance its spending, erode investor confidence in the
    economy, distress the financial markets, and endanger U.S. economic
    and national security. 

**CONTINUING TO UTILIZE TARIFFS TO PROTECT U.S. INTERESTS:** Tariffs
will continue to be a critical tool in President Trump’s toolbox for
protecting American businesses and workers, reshoring domestic
production, lowering costs, and raising wages.

-   The Supreme Court’s disappointing decision today will not deter the
    President’s effort to reshape the long-distorted global trading
    system that has undermined the economic and national security of our
    country, and contributed to fundamental international payment
    problems.
-   Since Day One, President Trump has challenged the assumption that
    the United States must tolerate the distorted and imbalanced global
    trading system.
-   The President’s trade policy brought the world to the negotiating
    table on our terms.
    -   As a result of the President’s tariffs, major U.S. trading
        partners covering more than half of global GDP have agreed to
        historic trade and investment deals to open new markets for U.S.
        exports, promote manufacturing reshoring, and bring reciprocity
        and balance to our trade relations.

    <!-- -->

    -   These deals are creating high-paying American jobs, boosting
        U.S. manufacturing and technological leadership, and will
        deliver massive returns for American workers and families for
        decades to come.

    <!-- -->

    -   In particular, the United States will continue to honor its
        legally binding Agreements on Reciprocal Trade. The United
        States expects the same commitment from its trading partners.
        While the domestic legal authorities to impose future tariffs
        will change, the overall direction of travel for the United
        States—reshoring domestic production and expanding market access
        abroad through a combination of tariffs and deals—will not.
-   Today’s action will continue to protect the national interests of
    the United States by addressing the balance-of-payments deficit to
    further usher in America’s Golden Age.
