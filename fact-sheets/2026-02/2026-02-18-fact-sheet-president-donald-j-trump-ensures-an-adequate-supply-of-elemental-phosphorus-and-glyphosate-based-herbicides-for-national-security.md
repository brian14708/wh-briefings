title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Ensures an Adequate Supply of Elemental
  Phosphorus and Glyphosate-Based Herbicides for National Security'

**BOLSTERING NATIONAL SECURITY BY PRESERVING CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAINS:**
Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order mobilizing
the Defense Production Act to protect domestic production of elemental
phosphorus and glyphosate-based herbicides — two critical inputs
essential to military readiness and America’s agricultural strength,
respectively.

-   The Order finds that any interruption of supply of either of these
    critical materials could leave our defense industrial base and food
    supply vulnerable to hostile foreign actors.
-   The Order delegates the President’s authority under the Defense
    Production Act to the Secretary of Agriculture to require the
    performance of contracts or orders related to these materials to
    promote the national defense, and to determine the proper allocation
    of materials, services, and facilities necessary to ensure a
    continued and adequate supply of these products. It directs the
    Secretary of Agriculture to exercise that authority in consultation
    with the Secretary of War.
-   The Order directs the Secretary of Agriculture to issue orders and
    regulations as needed for implementation.

**COUNTERING THREATS TO AMERICA’S DEFENSE AND FOOD SECURITY:** President
Trump is acting to ensure domestic production of elemental phosphorus
and glyphosate-based herbicides, the loss of which would cripple
critical supply chains.

-   Elemental phosphorus is a key input in defense supply chains —
    crucial for smoke, illumination, and incendiary devices,
    semiconductors in radar, solar cells, sensors, and optoelectronics,
    and modern lithium-ion battery chemistries used in weapon system
    supply chains.
-   Elemental phosphorus is also a critical precursor element for the
    production of glyphosate-based herbicides, which are the most widely
    used crop-protection tools in U.S. agriculture — enabling efficient
    food and livestock feed production that protects food supply chains
    and ensures the availability of healthy, affordable food options
    within reach for American families.
-   With only one domestic producer of elemental phosphorus and
    glyphosate-based herbicides, and U.S. needs far exceeding current
    output, the threat of reduced or ceased production gravely endangers
    national security and defense, which includes food-supply security.
-   The Administration continues to support research and investment into
    next-generation crop protection technologies, but ensuring a stable
    supply of existing critical inputs remains essential to safeguarding
    food security and national defense.

**ADVANCING AMERICA FIRST INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH:** President Trump has
consistently prioritized policies that secure domestic supply chains,
protect national defense, and support American agriculture and families.

-   In March 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order allowing
    the Defense Production Act to be used to expand domestic mineral
    production capacity.
-   In April 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order to
    revitalize America’s maritime industry to strengthen the nation’s
    economic and national security.
-   In May 2025, President Trump leveraged the Defense Production Act to
    enhance domestic capability to manage spent nuclear fuel, as part of
    the Administration’s push to expedite and promote the production and
    operation of nuclear energy.
-   President Trump has repeatedly used Section 232 tariffs to protect
    against threats to our national security and to strengthen
    manufacturing sectors critical for our national and economic
    security.
-   President Trump has also secured billions of dollars in
    private-sector and foreign investments to expand domestic
    manufacturing capacity and strengthen America’s industrial base.
