title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Addresses Threats to the United States
  by the Government of Iran'

**CONFRONTING THE IRANIAN REGIME:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order reaffirming the ongoing national emergency
with respect to Iran and establishing a process to impose tariffs on
countries that acquire any goods or services from Iran to protect the
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.

-   The Order imposes a system that allows the United States to impose
    additional tariffs on imports from any country that directly or
    indirectly purchases, imports, or otherwise acquires any goods or
    services from Iran.
-   The President may modify the Order if circumstances change, in
    response to retaliation, or if Iran or an affected country takes
    significant steps to address the national emergency and align with
    the United States on national security, foreign policy, and economic
    matters.
-   The Order authorizes the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce,
    and United States Trade Representative to take all necessary
    actions, including issuing rules and guidance, to implement the
    tariff system and related measures.

**COUNTERING IRAN’S MALIGN INFLUENCE:** The President is holding Iran
accountable for its pursuit of nuclear capabilities, support for
terrorism, ballistic missile development, and regional destabilization
that endanger American security, allies, and interests.

-   Iran — the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism — supports
    proxy terrorist groups and militias across the Middle East,
    including those who have killed and wounded Americans and are
    actively targeting U.S. forces, regional partners, and allies.
-   The mismanagement of Iran’s resources is clear: the regime has
    chosen to spend them on nuclear and missile programs while its
    infrastructure and people struggle.
-   The regime brutally represses its own people, killing thousands of
    protesters, denying human rights, and using violence to maintain
    power, while spreading extremism and undermining U.S. efforts for
    peace and stability.
-   These actions constitute a continuing unusual and extraordinary
    threat to the United States, requiring a sustained and intensified
    response to protect American citizens, allies, and interests.

**PUTTING AMERICA FIRST:** President Trump has never wavered in his
stance that Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon — a pledge
he has made repeatedly, both in office and on the campaign trail.

-   President Trump is building on his strong record from his first
    term, when he withdrew from the flawed Iran nuclear deal, imposed
    maximum pressure, and designated Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard
    Corps (IRGC) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.
-   Upon returning to office, President Trump restored maximum pressure
    on Iran to deny it all paths to a nuclear weapon and counter its
    malign influence abroad.
-   In June, after Iran refused to reach a deal with the United States,
    President Trump authorized Operation Midnight Hammer which
    obliterated Iran’s nuclear facilities and significantly set back
    Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.
-   President Trump recently deployed a massive armada to the region,
    urging Iran to come to the table and negotiate a fair, equitable
    deal with no nuclear weapons, or face even stronger consequences.
-   This is not the first time President Trump has taken a tough stance
    against regimes hostile to core U.S. national security interests. In
    just this past month, he authorized operations to remove Venezuela’s
    Nicolas Maduro from power and imposed tariffs on countries that
    provide oil to Cuba, making clear that dictators and state sponsors
    of terrorism will be held to account.
