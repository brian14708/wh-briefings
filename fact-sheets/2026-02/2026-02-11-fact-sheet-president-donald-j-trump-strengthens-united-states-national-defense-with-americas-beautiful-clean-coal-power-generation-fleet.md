  \ with America\u2019s Beautiful Clean Coal Power Generation Fleet"

**STRENGTHENING NATIONAL DEFENSE WITH RELIABLE COAL POWER:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order directing the
Department of War to prioritize long-term Power Purchase Agreements with
America’s beautiful, clean coal fleet to ensure military installations
and critical defense facilities have uninterrupted, on-demand baseload
power.

-   The Order directs the Secretary of War, in coordination with the
    Secretary of Energy, to approve long-term Power Purchase Agreements
    or similar contracts with coal-fired energy production facilities to
    serve Department of War installations and other mission-critical
    facilities.
-   Priority will be given to projects that enhance grid reliability and
    blackout prevention, on-site fuel security, and mission assurance
    for defense and intelligence capabilities.

**ENSURING A RESILIENT GRID:** President Trump is committed to
strengthening the electric grid and believes that beautiful, clean coal
plays a critical role in ensuring reliable energy, national security,
and economic stability.

-   Baseload power and a reliable grid are vital to powering military
    installations, operations, defense-industrial production, and
    ensuring the safety of the American people; any prolonged disruption
    threatens operational readiness and national security.
-   It is imperative that the Department of War strategically utilize
    America’s vast coal resources that have proven reliability in
    providing continuous, on-demand baseload power.
-   Intermittent sources like wind and solar are unreliable in extreme
    weather, leaving the grid and our defense installations that rely on
    them vulnerable to interruptions in power.

**MAKING AMERICA ENERGY DOMINANT:** President Trump believes it is vital
for America to be energy dominant and energy secure.

-   On the campaign trail, President Trump warned, “you have a grid
    system in this country that’s obsolete and a disaster,” underscoring
    his urgency to act.
-   On Day One, President Trump declared a National Energy Emergency to
    ensure that the Administration can bring all available authorities
    to bear to improve the integrity of our Nation’s electrical grid. 
-   He is revitalizing America’s beautiful clean coal industry in order
    to provide Americans with access to reliable, affordable power and
    support the thousands of American jobs that depend on the industry.
-   In April 2025, President Trump signed a series of Executive Orders
    to designate coal as a mineral, lift barriers to coal mining on
    Federal lands, and grant regulatory relief from burdensome Biden-era
    restrictions on certain coal-fired power plants.
-   President Trump’s actions have stopped the closure of 17 gigawatts
    of coal power and resulted in new investments and build of
    affordable, baseload power generation across the country.
-   President Trump is cutting red tape and rolling back regulations
    that hinder coal, oil, and natural gas production.
-   Last summer, the Administration renewed the charter for the National
    Coal Council (NCC)—a Federal Advisory Committee terminated during
    the Biden Administration—and convened its first meeting just last
    month.
