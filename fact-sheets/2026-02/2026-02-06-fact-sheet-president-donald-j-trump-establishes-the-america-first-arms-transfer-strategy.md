title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Establishes the America First Arms Transfer
  Strategy'
---
 
**REINDUSTRIALIZING AMERICA THROUGH ARMS TRANSFERS:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order establishing the America First
Arms Transfer Strategy. This strategy will ensure that the American
industrial base remains the Arsenal of Freedom for the United States and
all of our partners and allies.

-   Through the establishment of the America First Arms Transfer
    Strategy, the United States Government is tasked with ensuring that
    U.S. arms transfers must: (1) build production capacity for weapons
    that are most operationally relevant for the execution of the
    National Security Strategy; (2) support domestic reindustrialization
    and improve the resiliency of our defense industrial base; (3)
    strengthen critical supply chains; and (4) prioritize partners that
    have invested in their own self-defense and have a critical role or
    geography for executing the National Security Strategy.
-   The Order directs the Secretaries of War, State, and Commerce
    to: (1) develop a sales catalog of prioritized platforms and systems
    that support the goals of the America First Arms Transfer
    Strategy; (2) enhance advocacy efforts for U.S. arms transfers that
    are in line with the Strategy’s objectives; and (3) work with
    industry to ensure robust collaboration and coordination.
-   The Order establishes the Promoting American Military Sales Task
    Force which will oversee Strategy implementation and monitor major
    defense sales progress.
-   To reduce delays and cumbersome bureaucracy, the Order instructs the
    Secretaries of War, State, and Commerce to immediately work to find
    efficiencies in the Enhanced End Use Monitoring criteria, the
    Third-Party Transfer process, and the Congressional Notification
    process.
-   To increase transparency in our defense sales process, the Order
    directs the Secretaries of War, State, and Commerce to publish
    aggregate quarterly performance metrics on defense sales case
    execution.
-   This groundbreaking Strategy will leverage America’s record-breaking
    defense sales to revitalize the defense industrial base, rapidly
    deliver American-manufactured weapons so our partners and allies can
    assume responsibility for the security of their region, and foster a
    more intentional and transparent arms transfer enterprise.

**PUTTING AMERICA FIRST IN ARMS TRANSFERS:** Thanks to President Trump’s
leadership, the United States is selling more defense equipment than
ever before.

-   America’s old arms transfer paradigm failed to strategically
    prioritize our industrial base in connection with these sales.
    -   Instead of leveraging our foreign defense sales to actively grow
        and shape our industrial base, our defense sales have
        historically been shaped by the priorities of our partners. This
        has resulted in an industrial base that does not function as
        effectively for the security of the American public as it could.

    <!-- -->

    -   This previous partner-first arms sales approach represented a
        missed opportunity to expand our own manufacturing capabilities
        in a manner that puts America First.

    <!-- -->

    -   This approach also resulted in production backlogs, cost
        overruns, and years-long delivery delays for partners and allies
        to receive critical weapons and platforms, as orders were
        mismatched to production capabilities.
-   The America First Arms Transfer Strategy will now leverage over $300
    billion in annual defense sales to strategically reindustrialize the
    United States and rapidly deliver American-manufactured weapons to
    help our partners and allies establish deterrence and defend
    themselves.
-   Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, our partners and allies are
    beginning to take on more responsibility for the security of their
    region. To ensure they are able to do this effectively, the United
    States must be able to reliably and rapidly deliver them the best
    military equipment in the world.
-   The America First Arms Transfer Strategydemands a fundamental shift
    in the United States Government’s approach to arms transfers that
    will benefit America, our industrial base, and our partners and
    allies.

**ACCELERATING SALES OF AMERICAN MANUFACTURED EQUIPMENT:**  President
Trump is committed to ensuring America maintains the world’s strongest
and most technologically advanced military, supported by a robust
network of capable partners and allies.

-   In January 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order to
    modernize defense acquisitions and spur innovation in the defense
    industrial base, ensuring red tape is no longer slowing the defense
    industrial base’s ability to respond to emerging global threats and
    even basic requirements.
-   In April 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order to improve
    speed and accountability in the foreign defense sales system. The
    America First Arms Transfer Strategy announced today builds on the
    successful implementation of the April Executive Order.
-   In January 2026, President Trump signed an Executive Order to stop
    defense contractors from putting stock buybacks and excessive
    corporate distributions ahead of production capacity, innovation,
    and on-time delivery for America’s military.
