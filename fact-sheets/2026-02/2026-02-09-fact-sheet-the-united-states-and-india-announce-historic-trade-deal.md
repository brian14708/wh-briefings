title: 'Fact Sheet: The United States and India Announce Historic Trade Deal'
---
 
**ACHIEVING RECIPROCAL TRADE:** Last Friday, in a Joint Statement,
President Donald J. Trump announced a trade deal between the United
States and India that will open up India’s market of over 1.4 billion
people to American products. 

-   Friday’s Joint Statement follows a call between President Trump and
    Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week, in which the leaders
    reached a framework for an Interim Agreement on reciprocal trade and
    reaffirmed their commitment to broader U.S.-India Bilateral Trade
    Agreement (BTA) negotiations.  
-   Also on the call, President Trump agreed to remove the additional
    25% tariff on imports from India in recognition of India’s
    commitment to stop purchasing Russian Federation oil. Accordingly,
    the President signed an Executive Order last Friday removing that
    additional 25% tariff.
-   Given India’s willingness to align with the United States to
    confront systemic imbalances in the bilateral trade relationship and
    shared national security challenges, the United States will lower
    the Reciprocal Tariff on India from 25% to 18%.
-   The key terms of the Agreement include:
    -   India will eliminate or reduce tariffs on all U.S. industrial
        goods and a wide range of U.S. food and agricultural products,
        including dried distillers’ grains (DDGs), red sorghum, tree
        nuts, fresh and processed fruit, certain pulses, soybean oil,
        wine and spirits, and additional products.

    -   India committed to buy more American products and purchase over
        $500 billion of U.S. energy, information and communication
        technology, agricultural, coal, and other products. 

    <!-- -->

    -   India will address non-tariff barriers that affect bilateral
        trade in priority areas. 

    <!-- -->

    -   The United States and India will negotiate rules of origin that
        ensure that the agreed benefits accrue predominately to the
        United States and India.

    <!-- -->

    -   India will remove its digital services taxes and committed to
        negotiate a robust set of bilateral digital trade rules that
        address discriminatory or burdensome practices and other
        barriers to digital trade, including rules that prohibit the
        imposition of customs duties on electronic transmissions. 

    <!-- -->

    -   The United States and India committed to strengthen economic
        security alignment to enhance supply chain resilience and
        innovation through complementary actions to address non-market
        policies of third parties as well as cooperating on inbound and
        outbound investment reviews and export controls.

    <!-- -->

    -   The United States and India will significantly increase
        bilateral trade in technology products and expand joint
        technology cooperation.

**THE PROSPEROUS PATH FORWARD:**  President Trump continues to advance
the interests of the American people, enhancing market access for
American exporters and lowering tariff and non-tariff barriers to
protect our economic and national security.

-   India has maintained some of the highest tariffs on the United
    States of any major world economy, with tariffs as high as an
    average of 37% for agricultural goods and more than 100% on certain
    autos.
-   India also has a history of imposing highly protectionist non-tariff
    barriers that have banned and prohibited many U.S. exports to India.
-   In the coming weeks, the United States and India will promptly
    implement this framework and work toward finalizing the Interim
    Agreement with a view to concluding a mutually beneficial BTA to
    lock in benefits for American workers and businesses.
-   In line with the roadmap set out in the Terms of Reference for the
    BTA, the United States and India will continue negotiations to
    address the remaining tariff barriers, additional non-tariff
    barriers, technical barriers to trade, customs and trade
    facilitation, good regulatory practices, trade remedies, services
    and investment, intellectual property, labor, environment,
    government procurement, and trade-distorting or unfair practices of
    state-owned enterprises.

**LIBERATING AMERICA FROM UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES:** President Trump has
challenged the assumption that American workers and businesses must
tolerate unfair trade practices that have disadvantaged them for decades
and contributed to our historic global trade deficit.

-   On April 2, 2025, President Trump declared a national emergency in
    response to the large and persistent U.S. goods trade deficit caused
    by a lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships,
    unfair tariff and non-tariff barriers, and U.S. trading partners’
    economic policies that suppress domestic wages and consumption.
-   President Trump continues to advance the interests of the American
    people by removing tariff and non-tariff barriers and expanding
    market access for American exporters, including in the agricultural
    sector.
-   Today’s announcement provides a tangible path forward with India
    that underscores the President’s dedication to realizing balanced,
    reciprocal trade with an important trading partner.
