title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Unleashes Commercial Fishing in the
  Atlantic'
---
 
**UNLEASHING OPPORTUNITY IN THE ATLANTIC:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed a proclamation to unleash commercial fishing in the
Atlantic, advancing the America First Fishing Policy.

-   The proclamation restores commercial fishing access to all 4,913
    square miles of the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National
    Monument, located off the coast of New England.

**EMPOWERING AMERICAN COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN: **President Trump is
committed to removing unnecessary restrictions on American fishermen in
order to strengthen the U.S. economy, support coastal communities, and
restore fairness to an industry disadvantaged by overregulation and
unfair foreign competition.

-   The Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument,
    established by President Obama in 2016, prohibited commercial
    fishing within its boundaries.
-   In his first term, President Trump lifted these restrictions to
    unlock economic opportunities for American fishermen.
-   In 2021, President Biden reinstated the Obama-era prohibitions on
    commercial fishing within the Monument.
-   Prohibiting commercial fishing is not necessary for the proper care
    and management of the Monument, as many fish species are highly
    migratory, not unique to the area, and are already protected through
    existing laws, such as the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and
    Management Act.
-   By revoking the Obama-Biden restrictions, President Trump’s
    proclamation supports New England’s fishing communities, in turn
    fostering economic growth and job creation in coastal regions.
-   This proclamation will support the vital longline fishing and Maine
    lobster industries by ensuring unfettered access to the coastal
    waters of the United States.

**ADVANCING THE AMERICA FIRST FISHING POLICY:** This proclamation builds
on President Trump’s commitment to revitalizing the U.S. fishing
industry. Since returning to office, President Trump has:

-   Signed a Proclamation to unleash commercial fishing in the Pacific
    Ocean, opening the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument
    (PRIMNM) to U.S.-flagged vessels.
-   Signed an Executive Order to restore American seafood
    competitiveness by reducing regulatory burdens, combating unfair
    foreign trade practices, and enhancing domestic seafood production
    and exports.
-   Implemented tariffs to protect America’s fishing industry—praised as
    a lifeline for the shrimping industry.
-   Signed an Executive Order halting offshore wind projects to preserve
    a robust U.S. fishing industry for future generations.
