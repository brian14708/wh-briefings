  Regulations'

**EASING THE REGULATORY BURDEN:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order to ease the regulatory burden on everyday
Americans and ensure no American is transformed into a criminal for
violating a regulation they have no reason to know exists.

-   The Order discourages criminal enforcement of regulatory offenses,
    prioritizing prosecutions only for those who knowingly violate
    regulations and cause significant harm.
    -   Strict liability offenses, which don’t require proof of bad
        intent, are generally disfavored.
-   The Order requires each agency, in consultation with the Attorney
    General, to provide to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a
    list of all enforceable criminal regulatory offenses, the range of
    potential criminal penalties, and applicable state of mind required
    for liability.
    -   Agencies must post these reports publicly and update them
        annually.
-   Criminal enforcement of offenses not publicly posted is strongly
    discouraged, and the Attorney General must consider the amount of
    public notice provided regarding an offense before pursuing
    investigations or charges.
-   The Order instructs agencies to explore adopting a guilty-intent
    standard for criminal regulatory offenses and cite the authorizing
    statute.
-   Agencies must publish guidance on referring violations for criminal
    enforcement, factoring in harm, defendant’s gain, and awareness of
    unlawfulness.
-   The Order does not apply to immigration law enforcement or national
    security functions.

**FIGHTING OVERCRIMINALIZATION IN FEDERAL REGULATIONS:** President Trump
believes that the United States is drastically overregulated and is
taking action to protect Americans from unjust criminalization.  

-   The Code of Federal Regulations contains over 48,000 sections,
    stretching over 175,000 pages – far too vast for any citizen to
    fully comprehend, much less be criminally convicted over violations.
-   Many regulations carry criminal penalties for violations, including
    “strict liability” offenses that do not require proof of intent,
    meaning Americans can be convicted without knowing they violated a
    rule.
-   No one knows how many separate criminal offenses are contained in
    the Code of Federal Regulations, with at least one source estimating
    hundreds of thousands of such crimes.
-   The situation is absurd, unjust, and ripe for abuse, enabling
    government officials to target unwitting individuals and weaponize
    regulations against them.
-   Overregulation privileges large corporations, which can afford
    expensive legal teams to navigate complex regulatory schemes, while
    disadvantaging small businesses and individual Americans and
    stifling new market entrants.

**CUTTING RED TAPE AND DISMANTLING BUREAUCRACY:** Since returning to
office, President Trump has worked at lightning speed to slash
regulations, streamline government, reduce the Federal bureaucracy, and
drain the swamp.

-   President Trump established the “Department of Government
    Efficiency” to examine how to streamline the Federal Government,
    eliminate unnecessary programs, and reduce bureaucratic
    inefficiency.
-   President Trump launched a 10-to-1 deregulation initiative, ensuring
    every new rule is justified by clear benefits.
-   President Trump authorized buyout programs to encourage federal
    employees to leave voluntarily.
-   President Trump simplified the Federal procurement process.
-   President Trump required cost-effective commercial solutions in
    Federal contracts.
