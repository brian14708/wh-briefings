**STRENGTHENING STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS FOR ECONOMIC PROSPERITY:**  
Today in Saudi Arabia, President Donald J. Trump announced Saudi
Arabia’s $600-billion commitment to invest in the United States,
building economic ties that will endure for generations to come. The
first deals under the announcement strengthen our energy security,
defense industry, technology leadership, and access to global
infrastructure and critical minerals. 

-   The deals celebrated today are historic and transformative for both
    countries and represent a new golden era of partnership between the
    United States and Saudi Arabia.
-   From day one, President Trump’s America First Trade and Investment
    Policy has put the American economy, the American worker, and our
    national security first.
-   The following represent just a few of the many transformative deals
    secured in Saudi Arabia:
    -   Saudi Arabian DataVolt is moving forward with plans to invest
        $20 billion in AI data centers and energy infrastructure in the
        United States.
    -   Google, DataVolt, Oracle, Salesforce, AMD, and Uber are
        committing to invest $80 billion in cutting-edge transformative
        technologies in both countries.
    -   Iconic American companies including Hill International, Jacobs,
        Parsons, and AECOM are building key infrastructure projects like
        King Salman International Airport, King Salman Park, The Vault,
        Qiddiya City, and much more totaling $2 billion in U.S. services
        exports.
    -   Additional major exports include GE Vernova’s gas turbines and
        energy solutions totaling $14.2 billion and Boeing 737-8
        passenger aircraft for AviLease totaling $4.8 billion.
    -   In the healthcare sector, Shamekh IV Solutions, LLC will be
        investing $5.8 billion, including a plant in Michigan to launch
        a high-capacity IV fluid facility.
    -   Investment partnerships include several sector-specific funds
        with a strong emphasis on U.S. deployment—such as the $5 billion
        Energy Investment Fund, the $5 billion New Era Aerospace and
        Defense Technology Fund, and the $4 billion Enfield Sports
        Global Sports Fund—each channeling substantial capital into
        American industries, driving innovation, and creating
        high-quality jobs across the United States.
-   Underscoring our commitment to strengthening our defense and
    security partnership, the United States and Saudi Arabia signed the
    largest defense sales agreement in history—nearly $142 billion,
    providing Saudi Arabia with state-of-the-art warfighting equipment
    and services from over a dozen U.S. defense firms.
    -   The sales that we intend to complete fall into five broad
        categories: (1) air force advancement and space
        capabilities, (2) air and missile defense, (3) maritime and
        coastal security, (4) border security and land forces
        modernization, and (5) information and communication systems
        upgrades. 
    -   The package also includes extensive training and support to
        build the capacity of the Saudi armed forces, including
        enhancement of Saudi service academies and military medical
        services.
    -   This deal represents a significant investment in Saudi Arabia’s
        defense and regional security, built on American systems and
        training.
-   The United States and Saudi Arabia celebrate these and many other
    deals today as a result of the growing momentum of the last four
    months. The total package has quickly built to more than $600
    billion–the largest set of commercial agreements on record between
    the two countries.

**UNLOCKING NEW OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH DEEPER ALLIANCES: **The strategic
partnership between the United States and Saudi Arabia has grown
increasingly robust over the past eight decades since the meeting
between King Abdulaziz Al Saud and President Franklin D. Roosevelt on
board the USS Quincy, the 80th anniversary of which was celebrated
earlier this year.

-   Saudi Arabia is one of the United States’ largest trading partners
    in the Middle East.
    -   Saudi direct investment in the United States totaled $9.5
        billion in 2023, focused on the transportation, real estate, and
        automotive sectors.
    -   In 2024, U.S.-Saudi Arabia goods trade totaled $25.9 billion,
        with U.S. exports at $13.2 billion, imports at $12.7 billion,
        and a trade surplus in goods of $443 million. 
-   The United States and Saudi Arabia share a commitment to deeper
    economic integration, underscoring the Kingdom’s pledge of expanding
    cooperation in critical sectors such as health, energy, and science.
    -   The U.S. Department of Energy and the Ministry of Energy of the
        Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have concluded an agreement for
        cooperation in the field of energy.  This agreement builds upon
        their strong existing relationship; it will focus collaboration
        on examining the potential for innovation, development,
        financing, and deployment of energy infrastructure.
    -   The Ministry of Industry and Mineral Resources in the Kingdom of
        Saudi Arabia and the Department of Energy of the United States
        of America have signed a Memorandum of Cooperation to
        collaborate on mining and mineral resources.  The agreement
        contributes to economic development and the diversification and
        resilience of critical mineral supply chains.
    -   NASA and the Saudi Space Agency have signed an agreement for a
        CubeSat to fly on NASA’s Artemis II test flight. Saudi Arabia’s
        CubeSat will measure aspects of space weather at a range of
        distances from Earth and deploy in high Earth orbit from a
        spacecraft adapter on the Space Launch System rocket after the
        Orion spacecraft is safely flying on its own with its crew of
        four astronauts.
    -   The United States and Saudi Arabia recently agreed to modernize
        the Air Transport Agreement to allow U.S. airlines to carry
        cargo between Saudi Arabia and third countries without needing
        to stop in the United States, an important right for cargo hub
        operations. Saudi carriers will have the same rights to serve
        the United States.
-   The United States and Saudi Arabia further underscored their
    commitment to deeper cultural, educational, and scientific
    partnerships through the signing of agreements between the
    Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Asian Art and the Royal
    Commission for AlUla on collaborative research and an exhibition
    focused on artifacts from ancient Dadan in AlUla, and between the
    Smithsonian’s National Zoo and the Royal Commission for AlUla to
    support the conservation of the endangered Arabian leopard through
    creation of a dedicated exhibit in Washington, D.C.
-   Saudi Arabia remains our largest Foreign Military Sales partner with
    active cases valued at more than $129 billion.
    -   Our defense relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is
        stronger than ever under President Trump’s leadership, and the
        package signed today, the largest defense cooperation deal in
        U.S. history, is a clear demonstration of our commitment to
        strengthening our partnership.
    -   The agreement opens the door for expanded U.S. defense industry
        participation and long-term sustainment partnerships with Saudi
        entities.
-   The deepening United States-Saudi Arabia partnership reflects a
    joint vision for long-term prosperity and employment opportunities
    in both nations.

**BUILDING ON A RECORD OF WINNING AT HOME AND ABROAD: **President Trump
is delivering on his promise to Make America Great Again by catalyzing
investment and negotiating fair trade deals to accelerate American
employment and prosperity.

-   President Trump is the dealmaker in chief, and he has once again
    secured a historic deal that strengthens America’s economic
    dominance and global influence. 
-   This comes just one week after President Trump announced a U.S.-UK
    trade agreement that levels the playing field, creates jobs, and
    opens market access with the United Kingdom.
-   Leading up to this historic deal, President Trump had already
    secured trillions in U.S.-based investments, setting the stage for a
    new era of American prosperity.
-   The $600 billion in Saudi investment in the United States builds on
    President Trump’s record in 2017 of securing billions in commercial
    deals and agreements with Saudi Arabia for the defense, energy,
    technology, and infrastructure sectors.
