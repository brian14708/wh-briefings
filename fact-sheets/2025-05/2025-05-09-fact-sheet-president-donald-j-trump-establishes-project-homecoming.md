title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Establishes Project Homecoming'
---
 
**ESTABLISHING PROJECT HOMECOMING:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed a proclamation establishing Project Homecoming to encourage
illegal aliens to voluntarily depart the United States.

-   The proclamation offers illegal aliens a choice: leave voluntarily
    with Federal support and financial assistance or face strict
    enforcement and penalties.
-   It creates a streamlined process for departure using the CBP Home
    app, provides government-funded flights at no cost to illegal
    aliens, facilitates travel for those lacking valid travel documents,
    and offers a concierge service at airports to assist with booking
    travel and claiming an exit bonus. 
-   The proclamation establishes an “exit bonus” as a financial
    incentive for illegal aliens who agree to voluntarily and
    permanently depart the United States.
-   It launches a nationwide communications campaign to inform illegal
    aliens of the Project Homecoming program and of the consequences of
    remaining, including removal, prosecution, fines, wage garnishment,
    and property confiscation.
-   It directs a full-scale, aggressive deportation surge, including
    with an additional 20,000 officers, for illegal aliens who do not
    depart voluntarily.

**SHRINKING THE ILLEGAL ALIEN POPULATION IN THE UNITED STATES:**
President Trump is fulfilling his legal obligation to end this invasion
and protect the American people.

-   Under the previous administration, the southern border was overrun
    by cartels, criminal gangs, suspected terrorists, human traffickers,
    smugglers, and illicit narcotics.
-   The Biden Administration’s lenient border policies allowed thousands
    of illegal aliens to enter the United States daily, with 40% of
    catch-and-release migrants totally disappearing.
-   At one point in 2024, illegal aliens made up 75% of arrests in
    Midtown Manhattan for crimes like assault, robbery, and domestic
    violence.
-   Illegal immigration strains American schools and hospitals, limiting
    their capacity to serve citizens, and diverts billions of dollars in
    Federal, state, and local social services from Americans in need.
-   In fiscal year 2023, the fiscal burden of illegal aliens was
    estimated to exceed $150 billion in taxpayer dollars, covering costs
    like health care, food stamps, housing, education, and emergency
    services.
-   By incentivizing voluntary departure, Project Homecoming aims to
    reduce these costs and restore resources for American citizens.

**ENDING THE INVASION:** President Trump has delivered on his promise to
secure the border and prioritize the needs of American citizens, taking
immediate action to put an end to the previous Administration’s border
crisis. Since taking office, President Trump has:

-   Declared a national emergency at the southern border.
-   Deployed additional personnel to the border, including members of
    the Armed Forces and the National Guard.
-   Restarted border wall construction.
-   Designated international cartels and other criminal organizations –
    such as MS-13 and Tren de Aragua – as Foreign Terrorist
    Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists.
-   Suspended the entry of aliens into the U.S.
-   Called for enhanced vetting and screening of aliens.
-   Required the identification of countries that warrant a partial or
    full suspension on the admission of nationals.
-   Restarted the detention and removal of aliens who are in violation
    of Federal law.
-   Directed the Administration to resume the Migrant Protection
    Protocols – also known as “Remain in Mexico.”
-   Ended the use of the CBP One app.
-   Terminated all categorical parole programs, such as the “Processes
    for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans,” that are
    contrary to President Trump’s immigration agenda.
-   Ended automatic citizenship for children of illegal aliens.
-   Paused the operation of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP).
-   Ended catch-and-release policies.
-   Revoked Biden’s disastrous executive actions that essentially opened
    our southern border.
-   Detained the most dangerous illegal criminal aliens in Guantanamo
    Bay and El Salvador’s prisons.  
-   Removed the monetary incentive for illegal aliens to come to the
    United States in the first place by ensuring they do not receive
    taxpayer-funded resources.
