title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Protects the Great Lakes from Invasive
  Carp'

**STOPPING INVASIVE CARP:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed a
presidential memorandum to protect the Great Lakes from invasive carp.

-   The memorandum directs his administration to expeditiously implement
    the most effective mechanisms, barriers, and other measures to
    prevent the migration and expansion of invasive carp in the Great
    Lakes Basin and the surrounding region.
-   It supports construction of the Brandon Road Interbasin Project,
    which would provide multiple layers of innovative technological
    deterrents designed to prevent invasive carp from reaching the Great
    Lakes, provided that the states involved are willing to cooperate
    and meet deadlines so that the federal investment pays off and the
    project can be completed in a timely, effective fashion.  This
    project was authorized in the Water Resources Development Act of
    2020 but has recently been delayed by Illinois Governor J.B.
    Pritzker.
    -   It sets a deadline of July 1, 2025, for Illinois to acquire
        necessary land to begin construction and 30-day deadlines for
        local permits to be granted to facilitate Army Corps
        construction.

    -   Federal agencies are similarly directed to streamline their
        permitting and environmental reviews.
-   It instructs the Environmental Protection Agency to prioritize
    infrastructure projects to remove invasive carp from the Upper
    Illinois Waterway near Lake Michigan and maintain existing barriers
    to prevent their entry into the Great Lakes Basin.
-   It tasks NOAA and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to prioritize
    research and management for the prevention, removal, and control of
    invasive carp and other aquatic invasive species in the Great Lakes.

**PROTECTING THE GREAT LAKES:** President Trump understands that swift
action is essential to safeguard the Great Lakes from the growing threat
of invasive carp.

-   The Great Lakes are the world’s largest surface freshwater system,
    and a highly valued shipping avenue, resource for fishing and
    recreation, and source of high-quality drinking water.
-   For several decades, invasive species of Asian carp have steadily
    migrated and expanded from the Southeast northward through streams,
    rivers, and lakes, nearing the Great Lakes entry point.
-   Asian carp, which can exceed 100 pounds in weight, spread rapidly by
    outcompeting native fish populations for food and space, threatening
    species like walleye, yellow perch, and lake whitefish.
-   Their potential entry into the Great Lakes would irreparably damage
    fishing, boating, recreation, and tourism, which supports tens of
    thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in commerce annually.
-   Immediate action is needed as the Federal Government has already
    invested $274 million in the Brandon Road project, but Illinois’
    recent delays in land acquisition and permitting threaten this
    critical defense against an ecological and economic disaster.

**SAFEGUARDING AMERICA’S NATURAL ABUNDANCE:** President Trump has
consistently demonstrated a commonsense dedication to protecting
America’s natural resources, environment, and outdoor recreation areas.

-   President Trump has championed improved forest management in order
    to prevent forest fires that are devastating communities and
    ecosystems across the country.
-   By pausing the expansion of windmills, President Trump recognized
    their detrimental environmental impact, particularly on wildlife,
    often outweighs their benefits.
-   President Trump signed the Save Our Seas Act to preserve and protect
    our beautiful waters and oceans from being littered with garbage. 
-   President Trump stands committed to sportsmen and anglers, ensuring
    they have access to thriving natural lands and waters for hunting
    and fishing.
