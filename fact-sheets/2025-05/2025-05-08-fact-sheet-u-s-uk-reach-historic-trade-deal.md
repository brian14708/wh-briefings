**ESTABLISHING A NEW PARADIGM FOR OUR SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP:** Today, on
the 80th anniversary of Victory Day for World War II, President Donald
J. Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a historic trade
deal, providing American companies unprecedented access to the UK
markets while bolstering U.S. national security. This is a great deal
for America.

-   President Trump: “The deal includes billions of dollars of increased
    market access for American exports, especially in agriculture,
    dramatically increasing access for American beef, ethanol, and
    virtually all of the products produced by our great farmers.”
    -   “The UK will reduce or eliminate numerous non-tariff barriers
        that unfairly discriminated against American products.”

    <!-- -->

    -   “This is now turning out to be, really, a great deal for both
        countries.”
-   Prime Minister Starmer: “This is going to boost trade between and
    across our countries. It’s going to not only protect jobs, but
    create jobs, opening market access.”
-   This trade deal will significantly expand U.S. market access in the
    UK, creating a $5 billion opportunity for new exports for U.S.
    farmers, ranchers, and producers.
    -   This includes more than $700 million in ethanol exports and $250
        million in other agricultural products, like beef.

    <!-- -->

    -   It commits the countries to work together to enhance industrial
        and agricultural market access.

    <!-- -->

    -   It closes loopholes and increases U.S. firms’ competitiveness in
        the UK’s procurement market.

    <!-- -->

    -   It ensures streamlined customs procedures for U.S. exports.

    <!-- -->

    -   It establishes high standard commitments in the areas of
        intellectual property, labor, and environment.

    <!-- -->

    -   It maximizes the competitiveness and secures the supply chain of
        U.S. aerospace manufacturers through preferential access to
        high-quality UK aerospace components.

    <!-- -->

    -   It creates a secure supply chain for pharmaceutical products.
-   The reciprocal tariff rate of 10%, as originally announced on
    Liberation Day, is in effect.
-   The United States will agree to an alternative arrangement for the
    Section 232 tariffs on UK autos.
    -   Under the deal, the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the
        U.S. by UK car manufacturers each year are subject to the
        reciprocal rate of 10% and any additional vehicles each year are
        subject to 25% rates.
-   The United States also recognizes the economic security measures
    taken by the UK to combat global steel excess capacity and will
    negotiate an alternative arrangement to the Section 232 tariffs on
    steel and aluminum.
    -   This deal creates a new trading union for steel and aluminum.
-   This U.S.-UK trade deal will usher in a golden age of new
    opportunity for U.S. exporters and level the playing fields for
    American producers.
-   Today’s action also sets the tone for other trading partners to
    promote reciprocal trade with the United States.

**A FRAMEWORK TO BOLSTER ECONOMIC SECURITY:** President Trump continues
to advance the interests of the American people, enhancing market access
for American exporters and lowering tariff and non-tariff barriers to
protect our economic and national security.

-   On April 18, President Trump had a call with Prime Minister Starmer
    to discuss our bilateral trade relationship.
-   U.S. total goods trade with the UK was an estimated $148 billion in
    2024.
-   The UK average applied agricultural tariff is 9.2% while the U.S.
    average applied agricultural tariff (prior to April 2) was 5%.
-   The UK maintains certain tariff and non-tariff barriers that
    restrict market access and create an unfair playing field for
    American workers and businesses.
    -   For example, the UK imposes tariffs that can exceed 125% on
        meat, poultry, and dairy products on top of maintaining
        non-science-based standards that adversely affect U.S. exports.
-   On April 2, 2025, Liberation Day, President Trump imposed a 10%
    tariff on all countries to address unfair trade practices that have
    contributed to America’s trade deficit and imbalances in order to
    better protect American workers and our national security. 

**A MILESTONE IN ADVANCING AN AMERICA FIRST TRADE POLICY:** Since Day
One, President Trump challenged the assumption that American workers and
businesses must tolerate unfair trade practices that have disadvantaged
our workers and businesses for decades and contributed to our historic
trade deficit.

-   Reversing these conditions and addressing the lack of reciprocity in
    America’s trade relationships will bring about a new Golden Age and
    Make America Great Again.
-   President Trump continues to advance the interests of the American
    people, enhancing market access for American exporters and lowering
    tariff and non-tariff barriers.
-   The Economic Prosperity Deal with the United Kingdom is a critical
    step forward in a special relationship to promote reciprocal trade
    with a key ally and partner.
