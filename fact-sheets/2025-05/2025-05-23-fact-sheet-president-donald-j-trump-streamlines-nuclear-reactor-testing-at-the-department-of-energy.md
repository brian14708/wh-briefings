  at the Department of Energy'

**STREAMLINING NUCLEAR REACTOR TESTING:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed an Executive Order to reform and streamline National
Laboratory processes for reactor testing at the Department of Energy.

-   The Order finds that the design, construction, and operation of
    advanced reactors under sufficient Department of Energy (DOE)
    control are, for the time being, for research purposes, and thus
    fall within DOE jurisdiction.
-   The Order tasks the Secretary of Energy with:
    -   Issuing guidance on what counts as a qualified test reactor and
        taking steps to expeditiously process applications for such
        reactors.

    <!-- -->

    -   Taking action to revise regulations, guidance, and procedures to
        significantly expedite the review, approval, and deployment of
        advanced reactors under DOE jurisdiction in order to enable
        operational test reactors within two years following a completed
        application.

    <!-- -->

    -   Creating a pilot program for the construction and operation of
        at least three reactors outside of the National Laboratories,
        but under contract with and for the account of DOE, with the
        goal of achieving criticality by July 4, 2026.

    <!-- -->

    -   Eliminating or expediting internal environmental review for
        authorizations, permits, approvals, and other activities related
        to reactor testing.

**FOSTERING NUCLEAR INNOVATION:** President Trump is committed to
re-establishing the United States as a global leader in nuclear energy
and securing a reliable, diversified, and affordable energy supply to
drive American prosperity and technological advancement.

-   While the United States led the development of civilian nuclear
    power through the Atomic Energy Commission, the National Reactor
    Testing Station (now Idaho National Laboratory), and other Federal
    entities, the commercial deployment of new nuclear technologies has
    all but stopped in recent decades.
-   Overregulation by the Federal government has stifled the domestic
    development and deployment of advanced reactors.
-   While the United States cultivated the effort to design and build
    the first Generation IV reactor for commercial use, we have since
    ceded the initiative to foreign nations in building these advanced
    reactors.
-   Advanced reactors have revolutionary potential, opening a range of
    new applications to support data centers, microchip manufacturing,
    petrochemical production, healthcare, desalination, hydrogen
    production, and other industries.
-   By maximizing DOE’s jurisdiction over next-generation nuclear
    technologies that are still in development, this Executive Order
    ensures that America’s innovators have clear pathways to create
    nuclear technologies that will propel economic prosperity and
    bolster national security.

**UNLEASHING AMERICAN ENERGY:** President Trump believes in all forms of
reliable, dispatchable energy, harnessing nuclear, fossil fuels, and
emerging technologies to secure American energy independence and fuel
economic growth.

-   On Day One, President Trump declared a National Energy Emergency to
    eliminate bureaucratic barriers, unleash innovation, and restore
    America’s position as the world’s leading energy producer.

Unleashing American energy will create jobs and economic prosperity,
improve the United States’ trade balance, help our country compete with
hostile foreign powers, strengthen relations with allies and partners,
and support international peace and security.
