  States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund'

**A FIRST-OF-ITS-KIND HISTORIC PARTNERSHIP**: Under the leadership of
President Donald J. Trump, the US and Ukraine entered into a historic
agreement on April 30, launching a first-of-its-kind partnership for the
reconstruction and long-term economic success of Ukraine.

-   From start to finish, this agreement is a fully collaborative
    partnership between our nations, that both the United States and
    Ukraine will benefit from.
    -   This partnership represents the United States taking an economic
        stake in securing a free, peaceful, and sovereign future for
        Ukraine.
    -   This agreement will also strengthen the strategic partnership
        between the United States and Ukraine for long-term
        reconstruction and modernization, in response to the large-scale
        destruction caused by Russia’s full-scale invasion.
-   The Treasury Department and the U.S. International Development
    Finance Corporation (DFC) will work together with the Government of
    Ukraine to finalize governance and advance this important
    partnership.
    -   The United States’ DFC will work together with Ukraine’s State
        Organization Agency on Support Public-Private Partnership, both
        of which are backed by the full faith and credit of their
        respective nations.

**LONG TERM RETURNS FOR BOTH COUNTRIES**: President Trump envisioned
this partnership between the Americans and the Ukrainians to show both
sides’ commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine

-   This partnership between the United States and Ukraine establishes a
    fund that will receive 50% of royalties, license fees, and other
    similar payments from natural resource projects in Ukraine.
    -   That money will be invested in new projects in Ukraine, which
        will generate long term returns for both the American and
        Ukrainian peoples.
        -   As new projects are identified, resources in the fund can be
            quickly allocated towards economic growth, job creation, and
            other key Ukrainian development priorities.
        -   Indirect benefits will include a stronger private sector and
            more robust, lasting infrastructure for Ukraine’s long-term
            success.
-   The partnership will be controlled by a company with equal
    representation of three Ukrainian and three American board members,
    who will work together through a collaborative process to make
    decisions for allocation of fund resources, such as investment and
    distributions.
    -   The partnership will also bring the highest levels of
        transparency and accountability to ensure that the people of
        Ukraine and the United States are able to enjoy the benefits of
        Ukraine’s reconstruction.
-   Natural resource projects will include minerals, hydrocarbons, and
    related infrastructure development.
    -   If the United States decides to acquire these resources for
        ourselves, we will given first choice to either acquire them or
        designate the purchaser of our choice.
    -   Economic security is national security, and this important
        safeguard prevents critical resources from falling into the
        wrong hands.
-   Importantly, this partnership sends a strong message to Russia – the
    United States has skin in the game and is committed to Ukraine’s
    long-term success.

No state, company, or person who financed or supplied the Russian war
machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine,
including participation in projects supported by fund resources.
