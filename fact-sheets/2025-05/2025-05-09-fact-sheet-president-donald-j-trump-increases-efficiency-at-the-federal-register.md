  Register'

**ACCELERATING DEREGULATION:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed
an Executive Order directing a little-known but critically important
federal entity, the Office of the Federal Register, to speed up
publishing time and decrease costs. These changes will enable agencies
to more quickly and effectively restore freedom through President
Trump’s deregulatory agenda.

-   The order directs that the Archivist of the United States and Office
    of the Federal Register review current practices, modernize and
    streamline processes to reduce delays, and ensure that costs at the
    Federal Register are limited to actual costs.

**21st CENTURY PUBLISHING:** The Federal Register must modernize its
operations, including its technology, and streamline its operations.

-   The Federal Register has a crucial role in the regulatory process:
    it publishes proposed and final agency actions, including
    deregulatory actions that eliminate regulations.
-   Importantly, every notice that the Federal Register receives has
    already been approved by the originating agency.
    -   There is no reason it should take days, or even weeks, to simply
        publish these notices.

    -   On top of these delays, the Government Publishing Office charges
        agencies $151+ per column of text to publish documents in the
        Federal Register.
-   By eliminating bureaucratic red tape and increasing efficiency, the
    Office of the Federal Register will catch up to the rest of the
    Administration and facilitate, rather than slow, the President’s
    deregulatory agenda.

**MODERNIZING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT:  **This EO is part of several
initiatives this administration has taken to improve how the Federal
Government functions. President Trump understands that to shrink
bureaucracy and increase efficiency, the Federal Government needs to
modernize.

-   President Trump signed an Executive Order to modernize how the
    government handles money, switching from old-fashioned paper-based
    payments to fast, secure electronic payments.
-   The Trump Administration is working to digitize federal retirement
    paperwork rather than continue to process it manually in a
    Pennsylvania limestone mine.
