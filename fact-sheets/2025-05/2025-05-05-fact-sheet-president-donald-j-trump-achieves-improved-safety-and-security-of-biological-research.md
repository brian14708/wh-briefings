  of Biological Research'

**PROTECTING AMERICANS FROM DANGEROUS GAIN OF FUNCTION RESEARCH**:
Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to improve
the safety and security of biological research in the United States and
around the world. This Executive Order:

-   Ends any present and all future Federal funding of dangerous
    gain-of-function research in countries of concern like China and
    Iran and in foreign nations deemed to have insufficient research
    oversight.
-   Empowers American research agencies to identify and end Federal
    funding of other biological research that could pose a threat to
    American public health, public safety, or national security.
-   Prohibits Federal funding from contributing to foreign research
    likely to cause another pandemic. These measures will drastically
    reduce the potential for lab-related incidents involving
    gain-of-function research, like that conducted on bat coronaviruses
    in China by the EcoHealth Alliance and Wuhan Institute of Virology.
-   Protects Americans from lab accidents and other biosecurity
    incidents, such as those that likely caused COVID-19 and the 1977
    Russian flu.

**ESTABLISHING SAFE AND SECURE OVERSIGHT OF DANGEROUS GAIN OF FUNCTION
RESEARCH IN THE UNITED STATES:** This Executive Order will increase the
safety and security of biological research for Americans without
impeding U.S. innovation.

-   For decades, policies overseeing gain-of-function research on
    pathogens, toxins, and potential pathogens have lacked adequate
    enforcement, transparency, and top-down oversight. Researchers have
    not acknowledged the legitimate potential for societal harms that
    this kind of research poses.
-   The Biden Administration allowed dangerous gain-of-function research
    with insufficient levels of oversight and actively approved Federal
    life-science research funding in China and other countries.
-   The 2024 United States Government Policy for Oversight of Dual Use
    Research of Concern and Pathogens with Enhanced Pandemic Potential
    (“DURC/PEPP”) and the 2024 Framework for Nucleic Acid Synthesis
    Screening are the latest examples of inadequate policies that rely
    on self-reporting and fail to protect Americans from dangerous
    research practices.
-   This Order pauses research using infectious pathogens and toxins in
    the United States that may pose a danger to American citizens until
    a safer, more enforceable, and transparent policy governing such
    research can be developed and implemented. It directs the Director
    of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the
    National Security Advisor (NSA) to work with funding agencies to
    develop such a policy within 120 days.
-   Unlike previous policies, this Order contains enforcement and
    reporting mechanisms that will strengthen oversight and discourage
    subjective interpretation of policies that researchers have used in
    the past to evade biosafety and biosecurity oversight.

**SAFEGUARDING THE FUTURE AND PROMOTING AMERICAN BIOTECHNOLOGY
DOMINANCE:** President Trump is driving us into the Golden Age of
American Innovation that will lead us to a safer, healthier, and more
prosperous America.

-   This Order protects Americans from dangerous gain-of-function
    research that manipulates viruses and other biological agents and
    toxins, but it does not impede productive biological research that
    will ensure the United States maintains readiness against biological
    threats and continues to drive global leadership in biotechnology,
    biosecurity, and health research.
-   President Trump has long theorized that COVID-19 originated from a
    lab leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and has consistently
    pushed for transparency in investigating its origins.
