  Base'
---
 
**REINVIGORATING THE NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed an Executive Order to expedite and promote the production
and operation of nuclear energy, which is necessary to power the next
generation technologies that secure our global industrial, digital, and
economic dominance, achieve energy independence, and protect our
national security.

-   This Order tasks the Secretary of Energy, in coordination with the
    Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Transportation, and the
    Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to report on
    a recommended national policy to support spent nuclear fuel
    management, an evaluation of policies regarding commercial recycling
    and reprocessing of nuclear fuels, and recommendations for the
    efficient use of nuclear waste materials.
-   The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Chair of the
    Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Director of OMB, will develop a
    plan to expand domestic uranium conversion capacity and enrichment
    capabilities to meet projected civilian and defense reactor needs.
-   This Order directs the Secretary of Energy to create a program to
    dispose of surplus plutonium by processing and making it available
    for advanced reactor fuel fabrication, stopping the surplus
    plutonium disposition program other than with respect to existing
    legal obligations.
-   President Trump is leveraging the Defense Production Act to seek
    voluntary agreements with domestic nuclear energy companies for the
    procurement of enriched uranium and for consultation regarding
    methods to enhance domestic capability to manage spent nuclear fuel.
-   The Secretary of Energy is authorized to support the establishment
    of nuclear industry consortia by ensuring offtake for newly
    established domestic fuel supply across milling,
    conversion/deconversion, enrichment, fabrication, and recycling and
    reprocessing.

**ACCELERATING NEW NUCLEAR ENERGY PRODUCTION:** President Trump is
leveraging the full suite of Federal financial resources to support the
restart, completion, uprate, and construction of nuclear plants.

-   The Department of Energy will prioritize the facilitation of 5 GW of
    power uprates to existing nuclear reactors and construction on 10
    new large reactors by 2030.
-   Federal loans and loan guarantees will be prioritized to support
    increased nuclear energy, including restarting closed nuclear power
    plants and completing construction of prematurely suspended plants.
-   The Order tasks the Secretary of Energy, in coordination with the
    Administrator of the Small Business Administration, to prioritize
    funding for companies with potential for near-term deployment of
    advanced nuclear technologies.

**EXPANDING THE AMERICAN NUCLEAR WORKFORCE:** President Trump is taking
action to expand pathways for Americans to gain employment in the
domestic nuclear workforce.

-   Nuclear engineering and nuclear energy-related careers will be
    considered priority areas for actions directed pursuant to Executive
    Order 14278.
-   The Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Education will increase
    participation in nuclear energy-related registered apprenticeships
    and career and technical education programs.
-   The Secretary of Energy will increase access to R&D infrastructure,
    workforce, and expertise at Department of Energy National
    Laboratories for college and university nuclear engineering
    students.

**STRENGTHENING THE DOMESTIC NUCLEAR FUEL SUPPLY CHAIN:** To enable the
long-term expansion of nuclear energy, the Federal government shall
pursue policies to maximize the value of nuclear fuel and expand the
domestic nuclear fuel supply chain.

-   The Nation’s nuclear fuel cycle infrastructure has severely
    atrophied, with domestic fuel sources supplying only about 5% of the
    fuel used in U.S. reactors. In addition to permitting challenges in
    mining the relevant minerals, in 1977 the Federal government
    introduced a policy that did not allow reprocessing of used fuel for
    commercial reactors, leaving the United States heavily dependent on
    foreign sources of uranium as well as uranium enrichment and
    conversion services. 
-   The United States possesses ample deposits of uranium and thorium
    that can power advanced nuclear reactors. The President has already
    taken decisive action to advance mining activities relevant to these
    minerals pursuant to his Executive Order “Immediate Measures to
    Increase Domestic Mineral Production.”
-   This Executive Order supplements the Administration’s actions on
    mineral production to ensure that we can not only mine, but also
    process and refine, nuclear fuel domestically. This is crucial for
    energy independence and national security.
-   Treatment of nuclear waste is one of the most difficult problems in
    the nuclear supply chain, and this Order brings together all
    relevant Federal agencies to develop implementable solutions.
-   60% of the nuclear workforce is between the ages of 30 and 60, and
    this Order takes decisive action to generate a pipeline of workers
    to supply the demand for this crucial industry.

**UNLEASHING AMERICAN ENERGY:** President Trump believes in supporting
all forms of reliable, dispatchable energy, harnessing nuclear, fossil
fuels, and emerging technologies to secure American energy independence
and fuel economic growth.

-   On Day One, President Trump declared a National Energy Emergency to
    eliminate bureaucratic barriers, unleash innovation, and restore
    America’s position as the world’s leading energy producer.
-   Unleashing American energy will create jobs and economic prosperity,
    improve the United States’ trade balance, help our country compete
    with hostile foreign powers, strengthen relations with allies and
    partners, and support international peace and security.
