**BUILDING LASTING PROSPERITY FOR AMERICA AND OUR ALLIES:** Today in Abu
Dhabi, President Donald J. Trump announced over $200 billion in
commercial deals between the United States and the United Arab
Emirates—bringing the total of investment agreements in the Gulf region
to over $2 trillion.

-   President Trump continues to advance the interests of the American
    people, enhancing market access for American exporters to strengthen
    our economic and national security.
-   These deals will significantly expand investment in the United
    States and U.S. market access in the United Arab Emirates.
-   The following represent just a few of the many transformative deals
    secured in the United Arab Emirates:
    -   Boeing and GE Aerospace secured a $14.5 billion commitment from
        Etihad Airways to invest in 28 American-made Boeing 787 and 777X
        aircraft powered by GE engines. With the inclusion of the
        next-generation 777X in its fleet plan, the investment deepens
        the longstanding commercial aviation partnership between the UAE
        and the United States, fueling American manufacturing, driving
        exports, and supporting 60,000 U.S. jobs.

    -   In line with President Trump’s executive order to unleash
        American energy leadership worldwide, ExxonMobil, Occidental
        Petroleum, and EOG Resources are partnering with the Abu Dhabi

        semiconductors and defense technologies, the partnership
        strengthens America’s supply security, supports high-tech
        manufacturing, and creates jobs across the U.S. critical
        minerals and defense industrial base.

        launched a Sovereign Cloud Launchpad to accelerate public cloud

        contribute $181 billion to the UAE’s digital economy by 2033 and
        includes a new UAE cybersecurity technology Innovation center.
        This collaboration expands demand for U.S.–developed cloud
        infrastructure and cybersecurity technologies, supporting
        high-skilled jobs in the United States and reinforcing U.S.
        leadership in secure digital innovation globally.
-   These deals lay the foundation for investment, innovation and
    good-paying U.S. jobs, including in frontier technologies,
    aerospace, energy, and critical minerals.
-   Today’s deals strengthen the U.S.-UAE investment and trade
    relationship and build on the UAE’s landmark commitment to a
    10-year, $1.4 trillion investment framework that will contribute to
    the U.S. boom in AI infrastructure, semiconductors, energy, quantum
    computing, biotechnology, and manufacturing. 
    -   The U.S. and UAE signed an AI agreement today that supports the
        $1.4 trillion investment commitment secured in March. This
        includes the UAE committing to invest in, build, or finance U.S.
        data centers that are at least as large and as powerful as those
        in the UAE. The agreement also contains historic commitments by
        the UAE to further align their national security regulations
        with the United States, including strong protections to prevent
        the diversion of U.S.-origin technology.

    -   The U.S.-UAE AI agreement strengthens bilateral investment
        partnerships, ensuring U.S. security interests and dominance in
        AI while extending the American tech stack to an important
        strategic partner. 

**ACCELERATING TRADE AND INVESTMENT IN STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP:**  The
strategic partnership between the United States and the United Arab
Emirates has spanned decades and supported the prosperity and security
of Americans and Emiratis. This partnership encompasses strategic
cooperation in defense, trade, energy, space and diplomacy, reflecting
shared interests and mutual respect.

-   This partnership is particularly significant thanks to the historic
    achievement of the Abraham Accords announced during President
    Trump’s first term.
-   The UAE stands as a significant commercial partner for the United
    States in the Middle East.  Bilateral trade and investment have
    flourished, with the UAE serving as a hub for American businesses
    seeking opportunities in the region.

        United States, supporting over 33,000 American jobs in 2023.

        billion in 2024, with a U.S. trade surplus of $19.5 billion, the

-   President Trump’s historic visit to the United Arab Emirates is
    another opportunity to welcome new partnerships in frontier
    technologies, health and life sciences, mobility, entertainment, and
    many other fields.

**NEVER TIRED OF WINNING:** President Trump keeps scoring great deals
for the American people, securing over $2 trillion in investment
agreements with Middle Eastern nations for a more safe and prosperous
future.

    and $1.2 trillion in Qatar the President secured on behalf of the
    American people.
-   This comes days after President Trump announced the U.S.-UK trade
    agreement and a joint agreement with China in pursuit of more fair,
    reciprocal trade that grows good-paying jobs and prosperity in
    America.
-   While it took President Biden nearly four years to secure $1
    trillion in investments, President Trump achieved this in his first
    month, with additional investment commitments continuing to roll in.
-   President Trump is accelerating investment in America and securing
    fair trade deals around the world, paving the way for a new Golden
    Age of lasting prosperity for generations to come.
