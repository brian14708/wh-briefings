**MAKING AMERICAN MANUFACTURING AND INNOVATION GREAT AGAIN:** Today in
Qatar, President Donald J. Trump signed an agreement with Qatar to

between the United States and Qatar, including an historic sale of
Boeing aircraft and GE Aerospace engines to Qatar Airways.   

-   The landmark deals celebrated today will drive innovation and
    prosperity for generations, bolster American manufacturing and
    technological leadership, and put America on the path to a new
    Golden Age.
-   Since President Trump took office, his commitment to American
    manufacturing and innovation has attracted trillions of dollars in
    investments and global commercial deals. Allies like Qatar are
    partnering in the United States’ success. 
-   The following represent just a few of the many groundbreaking deals
    secured in Qatar:
    -   Boeing and GE Aerospace secured a landmark order from Qatar
        Airways, a $96 billion agreement to acquire up to 210
        American-made Boeing 787 Dreamliner and 777X aircraft powered by
        GE Aerospace engines. This is Boeing’s largest-ever widebody
        order and largest-ever 787 order. This historic agreement will
        support 154,000 U.S. jobs annually, totaling over 1 million jobs
        in the United States during the course of production and
        delivery of this deal.
    -   McDermott has a strong partnership with Qatar Energy in
        advancing critical energy infrastructure, with seven active
        projects worth $8.5 billion. As the sole provider of offshore
        components for Qatar’s major LNG expansion, McDermott’s work
        directly supports thousands of U.S. energy sector jobs.
    -   Parsons has successfully won 30 projects worth up to $97
        billion. These high-value engagements have fueled significant
        company growth, supporting thousands of jobs across the United

        engineering and innovation.
    -   Quantinuum finalized a Joint Venture Agreement with Al Rabban

        billion in state-of-the-art quantum technologies and workforce
        development provided by the Joint Venture, supporting U.S. and
        Qatari jobs and leadership in this critical emerging technology.
         
-   Today’s signings mark President Trump’s intent to accelerate Qatar’s
    defense investment in the U.S.-Qatar security  partnership—enhancing
    regional deterrence and benefitting the U.S. industrial base.
    -   The defense deals secured today lock in Qatar’s procurement of
        state-of-the-art military equipment from two leading U.S.
        defense companies.
    -   Raytheon, an RTX business, secured a $1 billion agreement for
        Qatar’s acquisition of counter-drone capabilities, signed by the
        U.S. and Qatari governments. This deal establishes Qatar as the
        first international customer for Raytheon’s Fixed Site – Low,
        Slow, Small Unmanned Aerial System Integrated Defeat System
        (FS-LIDS) designed to counter unmanned aircraft. The deal
        directly supports high-skilled manufacturing and engineering
        jobs in the United States and reinforces America’s leadership in
        innovative defense technologies.
    -   General Atomics secured a nearly $2 billion agreement for
        Qatar’s acquisition of the MQ-9B remotely piloted aircraft
        system, signed by the U.S. and Qatari governments. This deal
        will strengthen the U.S.-Qatar bilateral relationship and
        provide the Qatari Armed Forces with the most advanced
        multi-mission remotely piloted aircraft in the world, powered by
        U.S. products made in America.
    -   The United States and Qatar also signed a statement of intent to
        further strengthen our security partnership, outlining over $38
        billion in potential investments including support for
        burden-sharing at Al Udeid Air Base and future defense
        capabilities related to air defense and maritime security.
-   These new agreements and instruments aim to drive the growth of the
    U.S.-Qatar bilateral commercial relationship, create thousands of
    well-paying jobs, and open new trade and investment opportunities
    for both countries over the coming decade and beyond.

United States and Qatar have a long history of trade and a strong
commercial relationship, including significant long-term aviation,
critical infrastructure, information technology, and consulting deals.

        across hotels and tourism, financial services, technology,
        healthcare, and energy, with plans to invest even more over the
        next five years. These investments strengthen the U.S. economy

        expanding U.S. exports, and funding research and development. 
    -   Qatar has the third largest proven reserves of natural gas in
        the world, and has invested in American energy infrastructure,
        directly contributing to U.S. energy security and industrial
        resilience.
    -   Starting in 2019, QatarEnergy initiated $18 billion in
        investments in the U.S. energy sector with ExxonMobil’s Golden

        Texas Gulf Coast.

    cases valued at more than $26 billion.
-   Qatar’s expansive investment in and trade with the United States
    contribute to U.S. and Qatari economic growth and prosperity, and
    Qatar’s choice of U.S. industry’s best-fit solutions supports the
    U.S. strategic goal of growing our industrial presence throughout
    the Gulf and the region as a whole.   

   
**THE ART OF THE DEAL:** President Trump is securing billions in
investments to revitalize American manufacturing, delivering on his
promise to bring back “Made in America” and usher in a new Golden Age of
prosperity.

-   Today’s announcement builds on yesterday’s $600 billion investment
    commitment secured in Saudi Arabia.
-   It also follows the announcement of an historic trade agreement with
    the United Kingdom and a joint agreement with China to reduce
    reciprocal tariffs. 
-   By securing these investments, President Trump is spurring a
    manufacturing renaissance, driving economic growth, and creating
    high-paying jobs across the nation.
-   Prior to this historic deal, President Trump had already attracted
    trillions in U.S.-based investments, laying the foundation for an
    era of unprecedented American prosperity.
-   President Trump is building on his record of success with Qatar,
    exemplified by his leadership in the 2019 GE Aerospace GEnx engine
    sale to power Qatar Airways’ then-newly acquired Boeing 787-9
    aircraft—a monumental purchase in the history of both companies.
-   As the dealmaker in chief, President Trump’s latest achievement in
    Qatar is another win for America.
