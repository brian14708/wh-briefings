title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump is Restoring Gold Standard Science in
  America'
---
 
**RESTORING GOLD STANDARD SCIENCE IN AMERICA:** Today, President Donald
J. Trump signed an Executive Order to restore Gold Standard Science as
the cornerstone of Federal scientific research and rebuild public trust
in science.

-   Gold Standard Science is:
    -   Reproducible, transparent, and falsifiable;

    <!-- -->

    -   Subject to unbiased peer review;

    <!-- -->

    -   Clear about errors and uncertainties;

    <!-- -->

    -   Skeptical of assumptions;

    <!-- -->

    -   Collaborative and interdisciplinary;

    <!-- -->

    -   Accepting of negative results as positive outcomes; and

    <!-- -->

    -   Free from conflicts of interest.
-   With this Executive Order, President Trump is directing Federal
    agencies to align new and existing programs and activities with Gold
    Standard Science principles.
-   This Order reinstates the scientific integrity policies of the first
    Trump Administration and ensures that science is no longer
    manipulated or misused to justify political ends, ensures agencies
    prioritize data transparency, acknowledges scientific uncertainties,
    remains transparent about the likelihood of future scenarios,
    evaluates scientific findings objectively, and communicates
    scientific data accurately.
-   The EO charges the Director of the Office of Science and Technology
    Policy to work with agency heads to issue guidance for adopting Gold
    Standard Science principles in 30 days and report their
    implementation progress within 60 days.
-   Agencies will publicly share data, analyses, models, and conclusions
    associated with scientific and technological information produced or
    used by the agency.
-   Agencies will also transparently acknowledge and document
    uncertainties, apply a “weight of scientific evidence” approach to
    decisionmaking, and ensure that scientific communication aligns with
    rigorous analysis.

**A CALL TO EXCELLENCE FOR AMERICA’S RESEACHERS:** The Trump
Administration encourages American research organizations across
academia, industry, and philanthropy to return to core principles of
scientific inquiry and align their activities to Gold Standard Science.

-   For too long, bureaucratic agendas, political interference, and
    inconsistent standards have eroded the American people’s trust in
    science.
-   Under the Biden Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention (CDC) incorporated edits by a teachers’ union into its
    school reopening guidance, which discouraged in-person learning.
    This was despite the best available scientific evidence at the time
    showing that the COVID-19 risk for children was minimal, leading to
    prolonged closures that harmed students’ education.
-   The National Marine Fisheries Service adopted an admittedly flawed
    “worst-case scenario” projection for the North Atlantic right whale
    population, which could have devastated the historic Maine lobster
    fishery had the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals not overturned the
    opinion for skewing evidence analysis.
-   Agencies have relied on the Representative Concentration Pathway
    (RCP) 8.5 to justify climate change policies that hamper the
    American energy industry, an unrealistic worst-case climate scenario
    with exaggerated coal use assumptions, which scientists have
    criticized as misleading.
-   The Biden Administration manipulated science to achieve political
    ends, and conducted subpar science designed to support predetermined
    outcomes instead of objective science that informed well-designed
    policies.
-   President Trump’s restoration of Gold Standard Science will rebuild
    the nation’s confidence in science and its use in Federal
    decisionmaking, and ensure continued American strength and global
    leadership in technology.
-   New scientific integrity policies will:
    -   Encourage the open exchange of ideas;

    <!-- -->

    -   Ensure consideration of different or dissenting viewpoints; and

    <!-- -->

    -   Protect employees from efforts to dissuade or prevent
        consideration of alternative scientific opinions.

**USHERING IN AMERICA’S GOLDEN AGE OF INNOVATION:** This Executive Order
is another step forward in President Trump’s agenda to ensure
unquestioned American scientific and technological global dominance.

This Order imposes the highest standards of scientific rigor on both the
development and use of science by Federal agencies to restore public
trust and ensure that policymaking follows, or adequately addresses,
scientific findings, for demonstratable positive outcomes for the
American public.

Since inauguration, the President has taken significant action to:

-   Define America’s key scientific priorities in artificial
    intelligence, quantum information science, nuclear technology, and
    biotechnology.

<!-- -->

-   Secure trillions of dollars in U.S.-based technology and research &
    development investments.

<!-- -->

-   Create new educational and workforce development opportunities in
    artificial intelligence technology for America’s youth.

Improve the safety and security of biological research.
