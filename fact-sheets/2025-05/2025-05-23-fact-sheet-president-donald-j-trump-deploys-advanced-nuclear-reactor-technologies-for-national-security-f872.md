title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Deploys Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies
  for National Security'
---
 
**DEPLOYING NUCLEAR REACTORS FOR NATIONAL SECURITY:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to rapidly deploy advanced
nuclear technologies to support national security objectives, including
powering artificial intelligence (AI) computing infrastructure and
national security installations.

-   The Order directs the Secretary of the Army to establish a program
    of record to build a nuclear reactor at a domestic military
    installation to commence operations within the next three years.
-   The Order directs the Secretary of Energy to designate AI data
    centers, located at or operated in coordination with Department of
    Energy (DOE) facilities, as critical defense facilities, and the
    nuclear reactors powering them as defense critical electric
    infrastructure.
-   The Secretary of Energy will designate DOE sites, and work with the
    private sector, to deploy advanced nuclear technology to power AI
    infrastructure and meet other national security objectives within 30
    months.
-   The Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of
    Energy, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and the
    Secretaries of the military departments, is tasked with making
    legislative and regulatory recommendations regarding the operation
    of advanced nuclear reactors on military installations.

**SUPPORTING NUCLEAR PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR:** President
Trump is taking comprehensive actions to remove government barriers to
private sector investment and deployment of advanced nuclear
technologies at Federal sites.

-   The Order directs the Secretary of Energy to release at least 20
    metric tons of high-assay low-enriched uranium into a readily
    available fuel bank for private sector projects operating nuclear
    reactors to power AI infrastructure at DOE sites.
-   The Secretaries of Energy and Defense shall utilize their
    authorities to enable the construction and operation of
    privately-funded nuclear fuel recycling, reprocessing, and
    fabrication capabilities at Federal sites.
-   The Order directs the Secretaries of Energy and Defense to explore
    using categorical exclusions under the National Environmental Policy
    Act for the construction of advanced nuclear reactor technologies on
    Federal sites.
-   Federal departments will prioritize the issuance of security
    clearances to support the rapid distribution and use of nuclear
    energy and fuel cycle technologies.

**PROMOTING AMERICAN NUCLEAR EXPORTS:** President Trump is fully
leveraging the resources of the Federal government to promote the U.S.
nuclear industry in the development of commercial civil nuclear projects
worldwide.

-   The Order tasks the Secretary of State or his delegee to lead
    diplomatic engagement and negotiations for agreements under section
    123 of the Atomic Energy Act to enable the U.S. nuclear industry to
    access new markets in partner countries.
-   Within 90 days, the Federal government will produce strategies to:
    -   Increase financing for U.S. nuclear projects and promote nuclear
        trade; and

    <!-- -->

    -   Make financial and technical support available to support
        foreign adoption of nuclear energy.
-   The Order directs the Secretary of State to implement a program to
    enhance the global competitiveness of American nuclear companies by
    expediting agreements and removing burdens on American exports.

**POWERING CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND NATIONAL SECURITY SYSTEMS:**
President Trump recognizes the need to power and operate critical
defense facilities and computing infrastructure for AI capabilities.

-    Military installations, including those in locations that are not
    well-served by other types of power due to complex supply chains
    required to reach them, require uninterruptible, dispatchable,
    high-density power of the type that advanced nuclear reactors can
    provide because of their unique size and generation capabilities.
    This is critical for readiness and national security.
-   The Federal Government’s advanced computing AI infrastructure will
    require a substantial increase in scalable power solutions, which
    advanced nuclear reactors are well-positioned to provide. This will
    ensure our technological supremacy in the emerging technologies of
    both AI and nuclear power.
-   By empowering the Department of Energy and Department of Defense to
    expand utilization of advanced nuclear power and instructing each to
    reduce regulatory red tape hampering use of nuclear power at their
    sites, this Order enhances our national security and reduces
    reliance on foreign sources of energy for our military and AI
    operations.
-   87% of new reactor builds worldwide are based on foreign designs,
    and the majority of the world’s nuclear fuel comes from foreign
    sources. By instructing the Department of State and other agencies
    to aggressively pursue export opportunities, this Order will
    strengthen our relationships with our allies and disrupt potential
    industry control by adversaries.

**UNLEASHING AMERICAN ENERGY:** President Trump believes in supporting
all forms of reliable, dispatchable energy, harnessing nuclear, fossil
fuels, and emerging technologies to secure American energy independence
and fuel economic growth.

-   On Day One, President Trump declared a National Energy Emergency to
    eliminate bureaucratic barriers, unleash innovation, and restore
    America’s position as the world’s leading energy producer.
-   Unleashing American energy will create jobs and economic prosperity,
    improve the United States’ trade balance, help our country compete
    with hostile foreign powers, strengthen relations with allies and
    partners, and support international peace and security.
