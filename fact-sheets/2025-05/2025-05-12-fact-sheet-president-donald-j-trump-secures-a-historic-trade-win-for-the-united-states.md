title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Secures a Historic Trade Win for the
  United States'
---
 
**SECURING ANOTHER HISTORIC DEAL:** Today, on the heels of the brand-new
deal with the United Kingdom, President Donald J. Trump reached an
agreement with China to reduce China’s tariffs and eliminate
retaliation, retain a U.S. baseline tariff on China, and set a path for
future discussions to open market access for American exports.

-   Today, the United States issued the first joint statement on trade
    in many years with China after successful negotiations over the
    weekend in Geneva, Switzerland.
-   Both parties affirmed the importance of the critical bilateral
    economic and trade relationship between both countries and the
    global economy.
-   For too long, unfair trade practices and America’s massive trade
    deficit with China have fueled the offshoring of American jobs and
    the decline of our manufacturing sector.
-   In reaching an agreement, the United States and China will each
    lower tariffs by 115% while retaining an additional 10% tariff.
    Other U.S. measures will remain in place.
-   Both sides will take these actions by May 14, 2025.
-   This trade deal is a win for the United States, demonstrating
    President Trump’s unparalleled expertise in securing deals that
    benefit the American people.

**CHINESE ACTIONS:** China will remove the retaliatory tariffs it
announced since April 4, 2025, and will also suspend or remove the
non-tariff countermeasures taken against the United States since April
2, 2025.

-   China will also suspend its initial 34% tariff on the United States
    it announced on April 4, 2025 for 90 days, but will retain a 10%
    tariff during the period of the pause.

**AMERICAN ACTIONS:** The United States will remove the additional
tariffs it imposed on China on April 8 and April 9, 2025, but will
retain all duties imposed on China prior to April 2, 2025, including
Section 301 tariffs, Section 232 tariffs, tariffs imposed in response to
the fentanyl national emergency invoked pursuant to the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act, and Most Favored Nation tariffs. 

-   The United States will suspend its 34% reciprocal tariff imposed on
    April 2, 2025 for 90 days, but retain a 10% tariff during the period
    of the pause.
-   The 10% tariff continues to set a fair baseline that encourages
    domestic production, strengthens our supply chains and ensures that
    American trade policy supports American workers first, instead of
    undercutting them.
-   By imposing reciprocal tariffs, President Trump is ensuring our
    trade policy works for the American economy, addresses our national
    emergency brought on by our growing and persistent trade deficit,
    and levels the playing field for American workers and producers.
-   Unlike previous administrations, President Trump took a tough,
    uncompromising stance on China to protect American interests and
    stop unfair trade practices.

**WORKING TOWARDS A REBALANCING:** When these changes come into effect,
both nations agreed to establish a mechanism to continue important
discussions about trade and economics.

-   The U.S. goods trade deficit with China was $295.4 billion in
    2024—the largest with any trading partner.
-   Today’s agreement works toward addressing these imbalances to
    deliver real, lasting benefits to American workers, famers, and
    businesses.
-   As our nations continue these discussions, China will be represented
    by He Lifeng, Vice Premier of the State Council.
-   The United States will be represented by Scott Bessent, Secretary of
    the Treasury, and Jamieson Greer, United States Trade
    Representative.

**ADDRESSING THE FENTANYL CRISIS:** The United States and China will
take aggressive actions to stem the flow of fentanyl and other
precursors from China to illicit drug producers in North America.
