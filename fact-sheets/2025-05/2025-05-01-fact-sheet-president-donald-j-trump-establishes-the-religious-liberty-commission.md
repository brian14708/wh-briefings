---
 
**ESTABLISHING THE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY COMMISSION:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order establishing the Religious
Liberty Commission to safeguard and promote America’s founding principle
of religious freedom.

-   The Religious Liberty Commission will be comprised of a Chairman and
    Vice Chairman designated by the President, ex officio government
    officials, and additional members from diverse religious and
    professional backgrounds, including clergy, legal experts,
    academics, and public advocates.
-   The Commission is tasked with producing a comprehensive report on
    the foundations of religious liberty in America, strategies to
    increase awareness of and celebrate America’s peaceful religious
    pluralism, current threats to religious liberty, and strategies to
    preserve and enhance protections for future generations.
    -   Key focus areas include parental rights in religious education,
        school choice, conscience protections, attacks on houses of
        worship, free speech for religious entities, and institutional
        autonomy.
-   The Commission will advise the White House Faith Office and the
    Domestic Policy Council on religious-liberty policies and recommend
    executive or legislative actions to protect these freedoms.
-   Advisory boards of religious leaders, lay leaders, and legal experts
    will provide specialized guidance as subcomponents of the
    commission.

**PROTECTING AMERICA’S FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT:** President Trump is
addressing emerging threats to religious liberty to ensure Americans can
freely practice their faith without government interference.

-   The United States Constitution enshrines the fundamental right to
    religious liberty in the First Amendment.
-   Recent Federal and State policies have undermined this right by
    targeting conscience protections, preventing parents from sending
    their children to religious schools, threatening funding and
    non-profit status for faith-based entities, and excluding religious
    groups from government programs.
-   The previous administration’s Department of Justice targeted
    peaceful Christians while ignoring violent, anti-Christian offenses.
-   This Commission will investigate and recommend policies to restore
    and safeguard religious liberty for all Americans.

**STANDING UP FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM:** President Trump has a proven
record of defending religious liberty and is committed to preserving
this cornerstone of American democracy.

-   In his first term, President Trump signed an Executive Order on
    “Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty.”
    -   He also protected conscience rights, ensured equal access to
        funding for religious institutions, and defended faith
        communities against government overreach.
-   On the campaign trail, President Trump reaffirmed his commitment to
    protecting America’s religious freedoms.
-   Since returning to office, President Trump has signed several
    executive actions to strengthen religious liberty, including:
    -   Marshalling all Federal resources to combat the explosion of
        anti-Semitism on our campuses and in our streets since October
        7, 2023.  

    <!-- -->

    -   Establishing a White House Faith Office to bring faith leaders
        from across the nation to the table and ensure their voices are
        heard at the highest levels of our government.
    -   Creating the “Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias” at
        the Department of Justice to end the anti-Christian
        weaponization of government and unlawful targeting of
        Christians.
