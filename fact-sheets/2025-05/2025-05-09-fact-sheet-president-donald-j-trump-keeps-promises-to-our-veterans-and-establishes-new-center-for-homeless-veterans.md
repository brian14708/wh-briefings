  New Center for Homeless Veterans'

**KEEPING OUR PROMISE TO OUR VETERANS:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed an Executive Order to provide better care to our veterans,
improve accountability for such care, and establish a National Center
for Warrior Independence for homeless veterans.

-   The Order directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish the
    National Center for Warrior Independence on the Veterans Affairs
    West Los Angeles Campus.
    -   Homeless veterans in the Los Angeles metropolitan area and
        around the nation can avail themselves of this Center to seek
        and receive the care, benefits, and services to which they are
        entitled.

    <!-- -->

    -   Funds previously spent on housing or other services for illegal
        aliens will be redirected to construct, establish, and maintain
        this Center.

    <!-- -->

    -   The Center will promote self-sufficiency through housing,
        substance abuse treatment, and support for productive work for
        the veterans housed there.

    <!-- -->

    -   The goal is to house up to 6,000 homeless veterans at this
        Center by 2028.
-   The Order directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to
    use vouchers to support homeless veterans with respect to this
    effort.
-   It instructs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to restore
    accountability at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). This
    includes taking action against individuals who have committed
    misconduct and investigating and rectifying the previous
    administration’s decision to rehire and reinstate back pay for
    employees previously fired for misconduct.
-   The Order ensures that veterans will have access to increased
    options for care, benefits, and services.
    -   This includes reduced wait times for Veterans Health
        Administration appointments through options such as expanded
        hours, weekend appointments, and virtual healthcare.

    -   It orders a feasibility study at the Manchester VA Medical
        Center to expand services to support a full-service medical
        center in New Hampshire.

**TREATING VETERANS LIKE THE HEROES THEY ARE:** President Trump strongly
believes that every veteran deserves our gratitude, and that the federal
government should treat veterans like the heroes they are.  

-   Previous administrations have failed veterans by allowing the West
    Los Angeles Veterans Affairs Medical Center—hundreds of acres in Los
    Angeles given to the Federal Government more than a century ago to
    help veterans—to fall apart.
    -   Parts of the property are leased to a private school, private
        companies, and the baseball team of the University of
        California, Los Angeles—sometimes at rock-bottom prices.
-   Los Angeles has approximately 3,000 homeless veterans—more than any
    other city in the country and accounting for about 10% of all
    homeless veterans in America.
-   Many of these heroes live in squalor in Los Angeles’s infamous “skid
    row.”
-   The new National Center for Warrior Independence will help them and
    other veterans like them rebuild their lives.

**CONTINUING A RECORD OF REFORM:** This Executive Order builds on the
historic reforms and achievements of President Trump’s first term, which
transformed the Department of Veterans Affairs and expanded care and
opportunities for our nation’s heroes.

-   During President Trump’s first term, he signed legislation to
    increase accountability and expand benefits and choices for veterans
    in accessing care.
-   He also signed legislation to remove thousands of VA workers who
    failed to give our vets the care they so richly deserve.
-   President Trump improved the efficiency of the VA and modernized
    medical records.
-   President Trump signed and implemented the Forever GI bill, allowing
    veterans to use their benefits to get an education at any point in
    their lives.
-   He eliminated every penny of federal student loan debt owed by
    American veterans who are completely and permanently disabled.
