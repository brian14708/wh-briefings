title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Directs Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory
  Commission'
---
 
**MODERNIZING NUCLEAR REGULATION:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order directing the reform of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) in order to reduce our dependence on foreign
technologies, decrease regulatory barriers, and support our domestic
nuclear industry.

-   This Order directs the NRC to complete rulemakings within 18 months
    to comprehensively revise its regulations and guidance documents,
    with a focus on balancing safety concerns with the benefits of
    nuclear energy for our economy and national security. The revisions
    will include:
    -   Establishing fixed deadlines for evaluation and approval of
        licenses, including an 18-month deadline for construction and
        operation of new reactors and a 12-month deadline for continued
        operation of an existing reactor.

    -   Adopting science-based radiation limits, instead of relying on
        flawed radiation exposure models.

    <!-- -->

    -   Revising regulations governing compliance with the National
        Environmental Policy Act.

    <!-- -->

    -   Establishing an expedited pathway for approving reactor designs
        that have been safely tested by the Department of Defense or
        Department of Energy.

    <!-- -->

    -   Establishing a process for high-volume licensing of
        microreactors and modular reactors, including allowing for
        standardized applications.

    <!-- -->

    -   Reconsidering regulations limiting license terms, extending
        those terms as appropriate.

**REALIGNING NRC CULTURE AND PERSONNEL:** President Trump is directing
the NRC to reform its culture and realign its organization to reflect
Congress’ directive to rapidly promote nuclear power while ensuring
reactor safety.

-   When licensing and regulating civilian nuclear power, the NRC is
    directed to consider the benefits of nuclear power to our economic
    and national security in addition to traditional concerns regarding
    safety, health, and environmental factors.
-   This Order directs a reorganization of the NRC to promote the
    expeditious processing of license applications and the adoption of
    innovative technology.
-   The NRC will create a dedicated team to draft the new regulations
    directed by the Order.

**REFORMING THE NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION:** President Trump is
committed to reestablishing the United States as a global leader in
nuclear energy, which will create tens of thousands of high-paying jobs
and generate American-led prosperity and resilience.

-   Since 1978, only two new nuclear reactors have begun construction
    and entered into commercial operation. Meanwhile, in just a single
    day, President Trump is signing twice as many Executive Orders to
    start a nuclear renaissance in the United States.
-   Due to an overly risk-averse culture that requires, for example,
    nuclear facilities to emit as little radiation as possible,
    including below naturally-occurring levels, the NRC has failed to
    license new reactors even as technological advances promise to make
    nuclear power safer, cheaper, more adaptable, and more abundant than
    ever. 
-   The Order establishes that U.S. policy will seek to facilitate the
    increased deployment of new nuclear reactor technologies and expand
    American nuclear energy capacity from around 100 GW today to 400 GW
    by 2050.
-   Energy independence, deregulation, and reducing barriers to building
    infrastructure have been hallmarks of President Trump’s second term,
    and reforming the NRC will represent a significant milestone across
    these critical policy areas.

**UNLEASHING AMERICAN ENERGY:** President Trump believes in supporting
all forms of reliable, dispatchable energy, harnessing nuclear, fossil
fuels, and emerging technologies to secure American energy independence
and fuel economic growth.

-   On Day One, President Trump declared a National Energy Emergency to
    eliminate bureaucratic barriers, unleash innovation, and restore
    America’s position as the world’s leading energy producer.
-   Unleashing American energy will create jobs and economic prosperity,
    improve the United States’ trade balance, help our country compete
    with hostile foreign powers, strengthen relations with allies and
    partners, and support international peace and security.
