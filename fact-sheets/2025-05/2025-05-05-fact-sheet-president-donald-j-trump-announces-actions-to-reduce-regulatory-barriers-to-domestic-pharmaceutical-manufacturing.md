title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Announces Actions to Reduce Regulatory
  Barriers to Domestic Pharmaceutical Manufacturing'
---
 
**PROMOTING AMERICAN-MADE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS:** Today, President Donald
J. Trump signed an Executive Order to facilitate the restoration of a
robust domestic manufacturing base for prescription drugs, including key
ingredients and materials necessary to manufacture prescription drugs.

-   The Order directs the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to
    reduce the amount of time it takes to approve domestic
    pharmaceutical manufacturing plants by eliminating duplicative and
    unnecessary requirements, streamlining reviews, and working with
    domestic manufacturers to provide early support before facilities
    come online.
    -   The Order directs the FDA to increase fees for and inspections
        of foreign manufacturing plants.

    -   President Trump is directing the FDA to improve enforcement of
        active pharmaceutical ingredient source reporting by foreign
        drug producers and consider publicly displaying a list of
        facilities that do not comply.
-   The Order directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to
    accelerate the construction of facilities designed to manufacture
    prescription drugs, active pharmaceutical ingredients, and other
    necessary raw materials.
-   The Order ensures that federal agencies issuing permits for a
    domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing facility designate a single
    point-of-contact to coordinate permit applications with interagency
    support from the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
    to ensure an efficient and coordinated process.

**UNLEASHING PROSPERITY AND PROTECTING NATIONAL SECURITY THROUGH
PERMITTING REFORM:** President Trump is clearing bureaucratic obstacles
to critical domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing in order to usher in
America’s new Golden Age by ensuring access to the medicines Americans
need.

-   Critical barriers and gaps still exist in establishing a domestic,
    resilient, and affordable pharmaceutical supply chain for American
    patients.
    -   New construction must navigate myriad Federal, State, and local
        requirements ranging from building standards and zoning
        restrictions to environmental protocols that together diminish
        the certainty needed to generate investment for large
        manufacturing projects.
-   Estimates suggest that building new manufacturing capacity for
    pharmaceuticals and critical inputs may take as long as five to ten
    years, which is unacceptable from a national-security standpoint.
-   This Order will speed up timelines for building domestic
    pharmaceutical manufacturing site by reducing regulatory barriers to
    construction.

**DELIVERING ON PROMISES TO PUT AMERICA FIRST:** President Trump is
delivering on his promise to once again put America first by ensuring
the FDA prioritizes American manufacturing facilities over foreign
facilities.

-   President Trump: “We don’t want to be buying our pharmaceuticals
    from other countries because if we’re in a war, we’re in a problem,
    we want to be able to make our own.”
-   President Trump: “As we invest in the future, we will permanently
    bring our medical supply chains back home. We will produce our
    medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, and treatments right here in the
    United States.”
-   This Order builds on actions from President Trump’s first term to
    re-shore production of essential medicines and cut down our reliance
    on foreign producers.
