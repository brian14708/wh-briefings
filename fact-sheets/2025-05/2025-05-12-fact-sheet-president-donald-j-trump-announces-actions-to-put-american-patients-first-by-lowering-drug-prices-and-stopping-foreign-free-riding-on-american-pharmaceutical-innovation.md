  First by Lowering Drug Prices and Stopping Foreign Free-riding on American Pharmaceutical
  Innovation'

**REDUCING DRUG PRICES FOR AMERICANS AND TAXPAYERS:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to bring the prices Americans
and taxpayers pay for prescription drugs in line with those paid by
similar nations.

-   The Order directs the U.S. Trade Representative and Secretary of
    Commerce to take action to ensure foreign countries are not engaged
    in practices that purposefully and unfairly undercut market prices
    and drive price hikes in the United States.
-   The Order instructs the Administration to communicate price targets
    to pharmaceutical manufacturers to establish that America, the
    largest purchaser and funder of prescription drugs in the world,
    gets the best deal.
-   The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a
    mechanism through which American patients can buy their drugs
    directly from manufacturers who sell to Americans at a
    “Most-Favored-Nation” price, bypassing middlemen.
-   If drug manufacturers fail to offer most-favored-nation pricing, the
    Order directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1)
    propose rules that impose most-favored-nation pricing; and (2) take
    other aggressive measures to significantly reduce the cost of
    prescription drugs to the American consumer and end anticompetitive
    practices.

**GETTING A BETTER DEAL FOR AMERICANS:** President Trump is once again
taking action to keep pharmaceutical manufacturers from charging
Americans high drug prices while giving steep discounts to other wealthy
nations.

-   According to recent data, the prices Americans pay for brand-name
    drugs are more than three times the price other OECD nations pay,
    even after accounting for discounts manufacturers provide in the
    U.S.
-   The United States has less than five percent of the world’s
    population, yet funds roughly 75% of global pharmaceutical profits.
-   Drug manufacturers discount their products to gain access to foreign
    markets and then subsidize those discounts through high prices
    charged in America—in essence, Americans are subsidizing
    drug-manufacturer profits and foreign health systems, despite drug
    manufacturers benefiting from generous research subsidies and
    enormous healthcare spending by the U.S. Government.
-   In his first term, President Trump took historic action to keep
    Medicare and seniors from paying more for drugs than economically
    comparable countries, which the Biden Administration rescinded
    before it could take effect.
-   Instead of fixing this problem, the Biden Administration’s greatest
    achievement was to negotiate prices that were, on average, 78
    percent higher than in 11 comparable countries as part of Biden’s
    effort to “beat Medicare.”

**DELIVERING ON PROMISES TO PUT AMERICAN PATIENTS FIRST:** President
Trump is delivering on his promise to once again put America first by
furthering efforts to get American patients and taxpayers a fair deal
for prescription drugs.

-   This Order builds on actions from President Trump’s first term to
    make progress on reducing price disparities at home and expands
    those efforts by including Medicaid in addition to Medicare. 
-   President Trump recently signed an Executive Order to take
    additional action to lower drug prices, including by providing
    massive discounts to low-income patients for lifesaving medicines,
    facilitating importation programs, and increasing the availability
    of generic and biosimilar medicines.
-   President Trump is also working to make drug prices radically
    transparent, as he recently signed an Executive Order to build on
    his historic price transparency efforts undertaken during his first
    term.
-   President Trump has been relentless in his effort to address the
    unfair and outrageous prices Americans pay for prescription drugs:
    -   President Trump: “In case after case, our citizens pay massively
        higher prices than other nations pay for the same exact pill,
        from the same factory, effectively subsidizing socialism aboard
        \[abroad\] with skyrocketing prices at home. So we would spend
        tremendous amounts of money in order to provide inexpensive
        drugs to another country. And when I say the price is different,
        you can see some examples where the price is beyond anything —
        four times, five times different.”
