title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Rescinds Useless Water Pressure Standards'
---
 
**RESCINDING BURDENSOME WATER RULES:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed a memorandum to eliminate restrictive water pressure and
efficiency rules that make household appliances less effective and more
expensive. The memorandum directs the Secretary of Energy to:

-   Review and rescind—or revert to the minimum standards required by
    statute—rules that limit water use in showerheads, faucets,
    dishwashers, toilets, urinals, and washing machines.  
-   Publish in the Federal Register a notice clarifying the scope of
    federal preemption of state rules for water use in showerheads,
    faucets, toilets, and urinals.
-   Pause enforcement any of rules mentioned in the memorandum until
    they are rescinded or revised.
-   Work with the Director of the Office of Legislative Affairs to
    recommend to Congress any water pressure or related energy
    efficiency laws, including the Energy Policy Act of 1992, that
    should be repealed or amended.

**RESTORING CONSUMER CHOICE AND AFFORDABILITY:** President Trump
believes that the Federal Government should not impose or enforce
regulations that make taxpayers’ lives worse.

-   Water conservation requirements for faucets, showers, bathtubs, and
    toilets make bathroom appliances more expensive and less functional.
-   Efficiency standards render other American appliances, like clothes
    washers and dishwashers, less useful, more breakable, and more
    expensive to repair.
    -   Ultra-efficient washing machines cost at least $100 more
        according to the Department of Energy.

    -   Updated dishwasher regulations caused those appliances to take
        two hours or more to complete a normal load of dishes—about
        twice the time of pre-standards models.

**FREEING HOUSEHOLDS FROM BAD REGULATIONS:** President Trump if
fulfilling his promise to free Americans from costly and ineffective
appliance rules.

-   On his first day in office, President Trump signed an Executive
    Order to “safeguard the American people’s freedom to choose from a
    variety of goods and appliances, including but not limited to
    lightbulbs, dishwashers, washing machines, gas stoves, water
    heaters, toilets, and shower heads…”
-   President Trump also signed a Day One Presidential Memorandum
    directing agencies to “eliminate counterproductive requirements that
    raise the costs of home appliances.”
-   Under President Trump’s leadership, the Department of Energy has
    already withdrawn or postponed numerous energy efficiency rules on
    key home appliances.
