  Center Infrastructure'

**ACCELERATING DATA CENTER INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to facilitate the
rapid and efficient buildout of data center infrastructure.

-   The Order directs the Secretary of Commerce to launch an initiative
    to provide financial support, such as loans, grants, and tax
    incentives, for Qualifying Projects.
    -   These Qualifying Projects include data centers that require
        greater than 100 megawatts of new load, infrastructure projects
        related to data center energy needs, semiconductor facilities,
        networking equipment, or other data center or related
        infrastructure projects selected by the Secretary of Defense,
        Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Commerce, or Secretary
        of Energy.
-   The Order revokes a Biden-era Executive Order that would have
    saddled AI data center development on Federal lands with pages of
    DEI and climate requirements.
-   The Order instructs agencies to streamline environmental reviews and
    permitting for data centers and related infrastructure by leveraging
    existing exemptions and creating new ones to expedite the
    construction of Qualifying Projects.
-   The Order enhances transparency and efficiency by designating
    Qualified Projects for expedited permitting under the FAST-41
    framework.
-   The Order promotes the use of Brownfield and Superfund sites for
    data center development, repurposing these lands for productive use.
-   The Order directs the Department of the Interior, the Department of
    Energy and the Department of Defense to authorize data center
    construction on appropriate Federal lands.

**STRENGTHENING AMERICA’S AI AND MANUFACTURING LEADERSHIP:** President
Trump is promoting the rapid buildout of AI data centers and critical
infrastructure to secure economic prosperity, national security, and
scientific leadership.

-   AI data centers and supporting infrastructure, such as energy
    systems and semiconductors, are essential for powering America’s
    technological and industrial future.
-   Lengthy and complex Federal regulations can delay critical projects,
    hindering America’s ability to lead in AI and manufacturing.
-   By streamlining permitting and providing financial support, the U.S.
    will accelerate the development of data centers and enable our
    global dominance in AI, which will in turn create jobs and enhance
    national security.
-   This initiative ensures American leadership in AI and critical
    technologies, positioning the U.S. to outpace global competitors and
    drive innovation for decades to come.

**USHERING IN A GOLDEN AGE FOR AMERICAN TECHNOLOGICAL DOMINANCE:**
President Trump has made American leadership in AI a national priority.

-   President Trump signed the first-ever Executive Order on AI in 2019
    recognizing the paramount importance of American AI leadership to
    the economic and national security of the United States.
    -   In historic actions, the Trump Administration established the
        first-ever national AI research institutes, strengthened
        American leadership in AI technical standards, and issued the
        world’s first AI regulatory guidance to govern AI development in
        the private sector.
-   President Trump also took executive action in 2020 to establish the
    first-ever guidance for Federal agency adoption of AI to more
    effectively deliver services to the American people and foster
    public trust in this critical technology.
-   In January 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order to
    reverse harmful Biden Administration AI policies and enhance
    America’s global AI dominance.
-   In April 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order to advance
    AI education for America’s youth.
-   The Administration is capitalizing on other permitting successes
    that will also enable data center development, such as dramatically
    reducing NEPA’s impact on critical infrastructure projects,
    developing emergency NEPA procedures that can permit major mining
    projects in under 28 days at the Department of the Interior,
    revising NOAA’s deep sea mining regulations, and more.
