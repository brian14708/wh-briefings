title: "Fact Sheet: The President\u2019s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets Releases\
  \ Recommendations to Strengthen American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology"
---
 
**USHERING IN THE GOLDEN AGE OF CRYPTO:** When President Trump took
office in January, he promised to make America the “crypto capital of
the world.” Today, the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset
Markets is releasing a report that provides a roadmap to make that
promise a reality.

-   Established by President Trump’s Executive Order 14178
    *Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology*,
    the Working Group consists of officials throughout the Federal
    government and was tasked with submitting a report that recommends
    regulatory and legislative proposals to advance the policies
    established in the Order.
-   By implementing these recommendations, policymakers can ensure that
    the United States leads the blockchain revolution and ushers in the
    Golden Age of Crypto.

**POSITIONING AMERICA AS THE LEADER IN DIGITAL ASSET MARKETS:**The
Working Group determined that a fit-for-purpose market structure
framework is essential to support growth and innovation in the digital
assets industry, protect consumers, and keep the United States at the
forefront of digital asset development. The Working Group recommends
that:

-   Congress build on the massive bipartisan House of Representatives
    vote for CLARITY by enacting legislation that:
    -   Eliminates existing gaps in regulatory oversight by providing
        the CFTC authority to oversee spot markets for non-security
        digital assets.

    <!-- -->

    -   Embraces DeFi technology and recognizes the potential of
        integrating such technology into mainstream finance.
-   The SEC and CFTC use their existing authorities to:
    -   Immediately enable the trading of digital assets at the Federal
        level by providing clarity to market participants on issues such
        as registration, custody, trading, and recordkeeping.

    <!-- -->

    -   Allow innovative financial products to reach consumers without
        bureaucratic delays through the use of tools like safe harbors
        and regulatory sandboxes.  

**MODERNIZING BANK REGULATION FOR DIGITAL ASSETS**: The Trump
Administration has already ended Operation Choke Point 2.0 once and for
all by working to end regulatory efforts that deny banking services to
the digital assets industry. A sound and predictable banking regulatory
framework that embraces the promise of blockchain technology will allow
depository institutions to meet customer demand for core banking
services for digital assets, and make it easier for those customers to
access digital asset markets. The Working Group recommends that
regulators take additional actions to:

-   Relaunch crypto innovation efforts to clarify permissible bank
    activities in custody, tokenization, stablecoin issuance, and the
    use of blockchains.
-   Promote transparency regarding the process for institutions to
    obtain bank charters or Reserve Bank master accounts.
-   Ensure that bank capital rules are aligned with the actual risks
    associated with digital assets, not simply the fact of their
    presence on a distributed ledger.

**STRENGTHENING THE ROLE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR**: The widespread adoption
of dollar-backed stablecoins will modernize payments infrastructure and
allow the United States to move away from costly and outdated legacy
systems. On July 18, 2025, President Trump signed the historic GENIUS
Act into law, which creates the first-ever Federal regulatory framework
for stablecoins. The Working Group recommends that:

-   Treasury and the banking agencies faithfully and expeditiously
    implement the GENIUS Act.
-   Congress take additional action to protect privacy and civil
    liberties by passing the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act to codify
    the provisions of the President’s Executive Order banning Central
    Bank Digital Currencies in the United States.

**COMBATING ILLICIT FINANCE** **IN THE DIGITAL AGE:** By modernizing our
anti-money laundering rules, the United States can be a leader in
financial innovation while protecting our national security interests.
The Working Group recommends that:

-   Treasury and the appropriate regulators provide clarity regarding
    BSA obligations and reporting.
-   Congress reinforce the importance of self-custody and clarify the
    AML/CFT obligations of actors within the decentralized finance
    ecosystem.
-   Regulators work to prevent the misuse of authorities to target
    lawful activities of law-abiding citizens and protect citizens’
    privacy.

**ENSURING FAIRNESS AND PREDICTABILITY IN DIGITAL ASSET TAXATION**: Our
tax rules must align with new technologies and eliminate compliance
hurdles for both individuals and businesses engaged in activities
involving digital assets. The Working Group recommends that:

-   Treasury and the IRS reduce burdens on taxpayers by publishing
    guidance on topics related to CAMT, wrapping transactions, and de
    minimis receipts of digital assets.
-   Treasury and the IRS review previously issued guidance on the tax
    treatment of activities like mining and staking.
-   Congress enact legislation that treats digital assets as a new class
    of assets subject to modified versions of tax rules applicable to
    securities or commodities for Federal income tax purposes and add
    digital assets to the list of assets subject to wash sale rules.
