**SAVING COLLEGE SPORTS:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an
Executive Order to protect student-athletes and collegiate athletic
scholarships and opportunities, including in Olympic and non-revenue
programs, and the unique American institution of college sports.

-   The Order requires the preservation and, where possible, expansion
    of opportunities for scholarships and collegiate athletic
    competition in women’s and non-revenue sports.
-   The Order prohibits third-party, pay-for-play payments to collegiate
    athletes.  This does not apply to legitimate, fair-market-value
    compensation that a third party provides to an athlete, such as for
    a brand endorsement.
-   The Order provides that any revenue-sharing permitted between
    universities and collegiate athletes should be implemented in a
    manner that protects women’s and non-revenue sports.
-   The Order directs the Secretary of Labor and the National Labor
    Relations Board to clarify the status of student-athletes in order
    to preserve non-revenue sports and the irreplaceable educational and
    developmental opportunities that college sports provide.
-   The Order directs the Attorney General and the Federal Trade
    Commission to take appropriate actions to protect student-athletes’
    rights and safeguard the long-term stability of college athletics
    from endless, debilitating antitrust and other legal challenges.
-   The Order directs the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy
    and the Director of the White House Office of Public Liaison to
    consult with the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Teams and other
    organizations to protect the role of college athletics in developing
    world-class American athletes.

**RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF COLLEGE SPORTS:** President Trump
recognizes the critical role of college sports in fostering leadership,
education, and community pride, the need to address urgent threats to
its future, including endless litigation seeking to eliminate the basic
rules of college sports, escalating private-donor pay-for-play payments
in football and basketball that divert resources from other sports and
reduce competitive balance, and the commonsense reality that college
sports are different than professional sports.

-   College sports, a uniquely American institution, support over
    500,000 student-athletes with nearly $4 billion in scholarships
    annually, forging America’s future leaders, driving local economies
    and shaping national culture.
-   The collegiate athletic system produced 75% of the 2024 U.S. Olympic
    Team and has yielded countless business and civic leaders.
-   Recent litigation, including a 2021 Supreme court ruling on name,
    image, and likeness (NIL) payments and subsequent cases dismantling
    NCAA transfer and recruiting rules, has created a chaotic
    environment that threatens the financial and structural viability of
    college athletics.
    -   Ongoing lawsuits seek to tear down the foundational elements of
        college sports that distinguish it from professional sports and
        protect non-revenue sports, such as that student-athletes are
        different than professional employees and that there are limits
        on how many seasons student-athletes can play.
-   The lack of enforceable rules has turned what were supposed to be
    legitimate, third-party NIL opportunities for players into
    pay-for-play bidding wars amongst university boosters, with some
    universities and their outside supporters reportedly spending more
    than $50 million per year on fielding rosters, mostly for the
    revenue-generating sports like football.  Football players on one
    team will receive $35-40 million in 2025 alone. 
-   Given these enormous, escalating demands on resources to compete in
    the revenue-generating sports, there are serious concerns regarding
    the future of non-revenue sports, women’s sports, and Olympic
    sports, as private-donor money is increasingly concentrated in these
    third-party, pay-for-play deals.  This dynamic also reduces
    competition and parity by creating an oligarchy of teams that can
    buy the best players—including the best players from less-wealthy
    programs at the end of each season, given the lack of restrictions
    on transferring teams each year.
-   Over 30 states have passed conflicting NIL laws, leading to a
    race-to-the-bottom that risks exploiting student-athletes and
    creating competitive imbalances among universities.
-   Without Federal action to restore order, ongoing lawsuits and a
    patchwork of state NIL laws risk exploiting student-athletes and
    eroding the opportunities provided by collegiate sports.

**PROMOTING A LEGACY OF ATHLETIC EXCELLENCE:** This Executive Order
builds on President Trump’s longstanding commitment to showcasing
American greatness through sports and recognition of its value in
forging American leaders and culture.

-   President Trump signed an Executive Order to keep men out of women’s
    sports, ensuring equal opportunities for women in sports.
-   President Trump played a pivotal role in securing the United States’
    bid for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and the United
    States’ bid for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.
-   President Trump has attended countless sporting events and hosted
    numerous teams at the White House.
