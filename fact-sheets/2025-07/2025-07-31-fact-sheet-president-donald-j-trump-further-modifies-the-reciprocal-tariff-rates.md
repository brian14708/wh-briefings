title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Further Modifies the Reciprocal Tariff
  Rates'
---
 
**RESTRUCTURING GLOBAL TRADE TO BENEFIT AMERICAN WORKERS:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order modifying the
reciprocal tariff rates for certain countries to further address our
exploding, annual U.S. goods trade deficits. This decisive action
reflects the President’s continued efforts to protect the United States
against foreign threats to the national security and economy of the
United States by securing fair, balanced, and reciprocal trade
relationships to benefit American workers, farmers, and manufacturers
and to strengthen the United States’ defense industrial base.

-   On April 2, President Trump announced an additional 10% tariff on
    all countries, and for countries with which the United States has
    large trade deficits, he announced higher additional tariffs
    individualized to each country, effective April 9.
-   A lot has happened since then. For example: 
    -   Several countries have agreed to, or are on the verge of
        agreeing to, meaningful trade deals and security agreements with
        the United States.

    <!-- -->

    -   Some countries, through negotiations, have offered terms that,
        in the President’s judgment, do not sufficiently address the
        national emergency he declared on April 2.

    <!-- -->

    -   Some countries have not negotiated at all with the United
        States.
-   Based on this additional information and recommendations from senior
    officials, among other things, the President has determined that it
    is necessary and appropriate to modify the reciprocal tariff rates
    for certain countries.
    -   Countries listed in Annex I of the Executive Order will be
        subject to the tariff specified therein.

    <!-- -->

    -   Countries not listed in Annex I will be subject to a 10% tariff.

**STRENGTHENING AMERICA’S POSITION IN THE GLOBAL MARKET:** President
Trump has reset decades of failed trade policy. Today’s Order
underscores President Trump’s commitment to take back America’s economic
sovereignty by addressing the many nonreciprocal trade relationships
that impact foreign relations, threaten our economic and national
security, and disadvantage American workers.

-   President Trump’s bold trade strategy has yielded historic
    agreements with major trading partners, unlocking unprecedented
    investments in the United States and expanding market access for
    American goods. These deals strengthen America’s economic and
    security positions and create opportunities for American workers,
    farmers, and businesses.
    -   In a massive deal with the European Union, the EU has agreed to
        purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and make new investments of
        $600 billion in the United States, all by 2028, while accepting
        a 15% tariff rate.
    -   Japan has agreed to invest $550 billion in the United States to
        rebuild and expand core American industries, as well as to
        further open its own market to U.S. exports, all while paying a
        baseline 15% tariff rate.
    -   The United States-United Kingdom trade deal includes billions of
        dollars of increased market access for American exports.
    -   Additional trade deals with Indonesia, the Philippines, South
        Korea, Vietnam, and others will protect our industries, open
        foreign markets, and encourage foreign investment in American
        industries.
-   These investments position the United States as the world’s premier
    destination for innovation, manufacturing, and economic growth.
-   President Trump is using tariffs as a necessary and powerful tool to
    put America First after many years of unsustainable trade deficits
    that threaten our economy and national security. 
-   President Trump encourages businesses to build and manufacture on
    American soil: as these countries are aware, they will face no
    tariff if they decide to build or manufacture products in our
    country.
    -   President Trump has committed that the United States will do
        everything possible to get approvals quickly, professionally,
        and routinely to bring back manufacturing jobs for Americans.

**DELIVERING FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE:** President Trump’s tariff
policies have generated significant investment into the United States,
strengthening the U.S. economy while addressing unfair trade practices
that have disadvantaged American workers for decades.

-   By imposing tariffs on countries with nonreciprocal trade practices,
    President Trump is incentivizing manufacturing on American soil and
    defending our industries.
-   With billions in reshoring investments already announced, President
    Trump is bringing manufacturing jobs back to America, revitalizing
    communities, and strengthening supply chains.
-   The Administration will continue to use all available tools to
    protect our national security, advance our economic interests, and
    uphold a system of trade based in fairness and reciprocity.
