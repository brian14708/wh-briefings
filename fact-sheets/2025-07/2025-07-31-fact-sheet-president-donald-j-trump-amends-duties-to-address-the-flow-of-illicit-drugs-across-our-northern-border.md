title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Amends Duties to Address the Flow of
  Illicit Drugs Across our Northern Border'
---
 
**ADDRESSING A NATIONAL EMERGENCY:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order increasing the tariff on Canada from 25% to
35%, with the higher tariff set to go into effect on August 1, 2025.

-   Shortly after returning to office, President Trump declared a
    national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers
    Act (IEEPA) to address, among other things, the public health crisis
    caused by fentanyl and illicit drugs flowing across the northern
    border into the United States.
-   Canada has failed to cooperate in curbing the ongoing flood of
    fentanyl and other illicit drugs, and it has retaliated against the
    United States for the President’s actions to address this unusual
    and extraordinary threat to the United States.
-   In response to Canada’s continued inaction and retaliation,
    President Trump has found it necessary to increase the tariff on
    Canada from 25% to 35% to effectively address the existing
    emergency.
-   Goods qualifying for preferential tariff treatment under the United
    States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) continue to remain not
    subject to the IEEPA Canada tariffs.
-   Goods transshipped to evade the 35% tariff will be subject, instead,
    to a transshipment tariff of 40%.

**COMBATING CANADA’S CONTINUED ROLE IN THE OPIOID CRISIS:** Given
Canada’s continued failure to arrest traffickers, seize illicit drugs,
or coordinate with U.S. law enforcement and Canada’s retaliation against
the United States for the President’s actions to address the unusual and
extraordinary threat to America, further presidential action is
necessary and appropriate to protect American lives and the national
security and foreign policy of the United States.

-   Mexican cartels are increasingly operating fentanyl- and
    nitazene-synthesis labs in Canada. 
-   A recent study highlighted Canada’s heightened domestic production
    of fentanyl, and its growing footprint within international
    narcotics distribution.
-   Canada-based drug trafficking organizations maintain robust “super
    labs,” mostly in rural and dense areas in western Canada, some of
    which can produce 44 to 66 pounds of fentanyl weekly.
-   Fentanyl seizures at the northern border this fiscal year, with two
    months remaining, have surpassed total seizures of the past three
    years combined, underscoring Canada’s escalating role in this
    crisis.
-   The amount of fentanyl seized at the northern border to date this
    fiscal year could have killed more than 16 million Americans due to
    the drug’s potency.
-   Canada’s retaliatory trade measures against the United States
    further complicate bilateral efforts to address this escalating drug
    crisis.

**PUTTING AMERICA FIRST:** President Trump is keeping his promise to
stop the flood of illegal aliens and drugs into the United States.

-   Last November, President Trump promised to “sign all necessary
    documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff” on their imports
    “into the United States, and \[their\] ridiculous Open Borders.”
-   In February, President Trump signed Executive Order 14193 to impose
    an *ad valorem* duty rate of 25% on imports from Canada in response
    to the national emergency.
    -   President Trump then provided Canada ample opportunity to curb
        the dangerous cartel activity and influx of lethal drugs flowing
        into our country.
-   In March, the President determined that Canada had failed to
    adequately address the situation and proceeded with the imposition
    of the 25% tariff.
-   Now, President Trump is taking further action to hold Canada
    accountable for its continued role in the illicit drug crisis.
