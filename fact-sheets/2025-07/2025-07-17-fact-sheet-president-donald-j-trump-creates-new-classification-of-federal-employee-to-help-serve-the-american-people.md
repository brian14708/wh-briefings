title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Creates New Classification of Federal
  Employee to Help Serve the American People'

**CREATING NEW NON-CAREER, POLICY-ORIENTED EMPLOYEES IN THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order
creating a new classification of non-career federal workers, “Schedule
G” employees, to better serve Americans’ needs by focusing on
implementing Administration policies.

-   The Order amends Civil Service Rule VI to fill an existing gap in
    federal employee classifications by creating a new type of hire,
    Schedule G, for employees who engage in policy-making or
    policy-advocating work.
-   Schedule G positions will be non-career positions, meaning
    incumbents will generally be expected to leave when the President
    who appointed them leaves office. Schedule G will not apply to
    career positions or career employees.  
-   Schedule G employees will be hired to help faithfully implement the
    President’s policy agenda.

**ADDRESSING GAPS IN GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY:** President Trump believes
creating non-career Schedule G positions will enhance government
efficiency and accountability and improve services provided to taxpayers
by increasing the horsepower for agency implementation of Administration
policy.

-   Congress has recognized that some Federal positions, due to their
    confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or
    policy-advocating character, should be exempt from the
    career-employee protections that make it difficult to remove corrupt
    or poor performing workers.
-   Existing types of employees, like Schedule C and Schedule
    Policy/Career, do not provide for non-career appointments to
    policy-making or policy-advocating roles, leaving a gap in Federal
    hiring categories.
-   Creating Schedule G fills this gap and facilitates appointments of
    non-career federal employees who will serve temporarily and
    implement the policy agenda prescribed by the American people
    through our elections. This will improve operations, particularly in
    agencies like the Department of Veterans Affairs, by streamlining
    appointments for key policy roles.

**REFORMING THE BUREAUCRACY:** President Trump is delivering on his
promise to dismantle the deep state and reclaim our government from
Washington corruption.

-   In April, President Trump created a new Federal employee category,
    Schedule Policy/Career, to enhance accountability for career Federal
    employees in policy-related roles.
-   President Trump is reducing bureaucratic inefficiencies by ensuring
    Federal agencies prioritize the will of the American people over
    entrenched interests. 
-   The Administration has taken steps to review and eliminate
    unnecessary regulations, aligning with the goal of making our
    government more responsive and effective.
