title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Addresses Threats to the United States
  from the Government of Brazil'
---
 
**ADDRESSING A NATIONAL EMERGENCY:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order implementing an additional 40% tariff on
Brazil, bringing the total tariff amount to 50%, to deal with recent
policies, practices, and actions by the Government of Brazil that
constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security,
foreign policy, and economy of the United States.

-   The Order declares a new national emergency using the President’s
    authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of
    1977 (IEEPA) and establishes an additional 40% tariff to address the
    Government of Brazil’s unusual and extraordinary policies and
    actions harming U.S. companies, the free speech rights of U.S.
    persons, U.S. foreign policy, and the U.S. economy.
-   The Order finds that the Government of Brazil’s politically
    motivated persecution, intimidation, harassment, censorship, and
    prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and
    thousands of his supporters are serious human rights abuses that
    have undermined the rule of law in Brazil.

**USING LEVERAGE TO SAFEGUARD OUR INTERESTS:** President Trump has
consistently reaffirmed his commitment to defending the United States’
national security, foreign policy, and economy against foreign threats,
including by safeguarding free speech, protecting U.S. companies from
unlawful censorship coercion, and holding human rights abusers
accountable for their lawless behavior.

-   Recently, members of the Government of Brazil have taken
    unprecedented actions to tyrannically and arbitrarily coerce U.S.
    companies to censor political speech, deplatform users, turn over
    sensitive U.S. user data, or change their content moderation
    policies on pain of extraordinary fines, criminal prosecution, asset
    freezes, or complete exclusion from the Brazilian market. This
    undermines not only the viability of U.S. companies’ business
    operations in Brazil but also the policy of the United States in
    promoting free and fair elections and safeguarding fundamental human
    rights at home and abroad.
-   For example, since 2019, Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre
    de Moraes has abused his judicial authority to threaten, target, and
    intimidate thousands of his political opponents, shield corrupt
    allies, and suppress dissent, often in coordination with other
    Brazilian officials, including other justices on Brazil’s Supreme
    Federal Court, to the detriment of U.S. companies operating in
    Brazil.
    -   Justice de Moraes has unilaterally issued hundreds of orders to
        secretly censor his political critics. When U.S. companies have
        refused to comply with these orders, he imposed substantial
        fines, ordered the companies’ exclusion from Brazil’s social
        media market, threatened their executives with criminal
        prosecution, and, in one case, froze the assets of a U.S.
        company in Brazil in an effort to coerce compliance.

    <!-- -->

    -   In fact, in addition to jailing individuals without trial for
        social media posts, Justice de Moraes is currently overseeing
        the Government of Brazil’s criminal prosecution of Paulo
        Figueiredo, a U.S. resident, for speech he made on U.S. soil,
        and has supported criminal investigations into other U.S.
        persons after they exposed his gross violations of human rights
        and corruption.
-   President Trump is defending American companies from extortion,
    protecting American persons from political persecution, safeguarding
    American free speech from censorship, and saving the American
    economy from being subject to the arbitrary edicts of a tyrannical
    foreign judge.

**PUTTING AMERICA FIRST:** By imposing these tariffs to address the
Government of Brazil’s reckless actions, President Trump is protecting
the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States
from a foreign threat. In line with his election mandate, President
Trump has also taken other actions to achieve peace through strength and
ensure foreign policy reflects U.S. values, sovereignty, and security.

-   On Day One, President Trump signed an “America First Policy
    Directive” to the Secretary of State that declared that the United
    States’ foreign policy must always put the interests of America and
    its citizens first.
-   Consistent with this directive, on May 28, 2025, Secretary Rubio
    announced a visa restriction policy targeting foreign nationals
    responsible for the censorship of protected expression in the United
    States.
-   Pursuant to that policy, on July 18, President Trump directed
    Secretary Rubio to revoke visas belonging to Justice de Moraes, his
    allies on the Court, and their immediate family members for their
    role in enabling Justice de Moraes’ human rights violations against
    Brazilians and free speech violations against Americans.
-   Preserving and protecting the free speech rights of all Americans
    and defending American companies from coerced censorship will remain
    at the forefront of President Trump’s America First foreign policy
    strategy.
-   President Trump has successfully used tariffs in the past to advance
    America’s interests and address other urgent national security
    threats and is doing so again today.
