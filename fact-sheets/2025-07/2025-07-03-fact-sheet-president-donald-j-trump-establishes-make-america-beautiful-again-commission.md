  Commission'

**MAKING AMERICA BEAUTIFUL AGAIN:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order establishing the Make America Beautiful Again
(MABA) Commission to conserve America’s lands and waters, cut red tape,
and drive conservation and economic growth.

-   The MABA Commission will be chaired by Secretary of the Interior
    Doug Burgum and comprised of members of President Trump’s
    Administration.
-   Guided by our Nation’s rich history, the MABA Commission will work
    to expand access to recreation for outdoorsmen, hunters, anglers,
    hikers, bikers, climbers, skiers, runners, and all Americans seeking
    to spend time in nature.
-   The MABA Commission is tasked with expanding access to public lands
    and waters for recreation and incentivizing voluntary conservation
    efforts.
-   Using gold-standard science, the MABA Commission will promote active
    forest management and responsible stewardship of our public lands,
    while reducing bureaucratic delays that hinder effective
    environmental management and put our forests and rural communities
    at risk.

**EXPANDING ACCESS TO PUBLIC LANDS:** President Trump wants to preserve
America’s natural beauty and expand outdoor recreation for future
generations.

-   As the Roosevelt Arch at Yellowstone National Park states, America’s
    public lands are “for the benefit and enjoyment of the people.”
    Therefore, the MABA Commission will work to expand access to
    America’s natural wonders for the enjoyment of the American people.
-   The outdoor recreation economy creates $1.2 trillion in economic
    output and supports 5 million jobs.
-   The Biden Administration unnecessarily restricted outdoorsmen’s
    access to public lands and deprived them of the ability to
    responsibly hunt and fish in certain areas.
-   Years of mismanagement have unnecessarily reduced public access to
    and enjoyment of outdoor recreational areas

**CONSERVING AMERICAN TREASURES:** The MABA Commission will build on the
legacy of conservative conservationists like President Teddy Roosevelt
and protect our Nation’s natural treasures.

-   During President Trump’s first term in office, his Administration
    recovered more endangered or threatened species than any other
    administration in its first term.
-   President Trump signed the Great American Outdoors Act during his
    first term—the largest investment in America’s national parks and
    public lands in history and the most significant development in
    conservation policy since Teddy Roosevelt.
-   During President Trump’s first term, his Administration designated
    1.3 million new acres of wilderness, added 1,645 miles of new trails
    to the National Recreational Trails System, and expanded hunting and
    fishing opportunities across more than 2.3 million acres of land.
-   President Trump has worked to protect American industries while
    maintaining standards that allow Americans to have among the
    cleanest air and water in the world.
