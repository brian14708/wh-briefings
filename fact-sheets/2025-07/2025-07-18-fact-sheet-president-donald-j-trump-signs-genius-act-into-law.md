title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Signs GENIUS Act into Law'
---
 
**MAKING AMERICA THE LEADER IN DIGITAL ASSETS:** Today, President Donald
J. Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, a historic piece of legislation
that will pave the way for the United States to lead the global digital
currency revolution.

-   The GENIUS Act prioritizes consumer protection, strengthens the U.S.
    dollar’s reserve currency status, and bolsters our national
    security.
-   The GENIUS Act will make America the undisputed leader in digital
    assets, bringing massive investment and innovation to our country.

**PROTECTING CONSUMERS IN THE DIGITAL MARKET:** President Trump supports
the GENIUS Act because it protects consumers from nefarious actors in
financial markets.

-   This long-overdue legislation creates the first-ever Federal
    regulatory system for stablecoins, ensuring their stability and
    trust through strong reserve requirements.
-   The GENIUS Act requires 100% reserve backing with liquid assets like
    U.S. dollars or short-term Treasuries and requires issuers to make
    monthly, public disclosures of the composition of reserves.
-   Stablecoin issuers must comply with strict marketing rules to
    protect consumers from deceptive practices. Crucially, they are
    forbidden from making misleading claims that their stablecoins are
    backed by the U.S. government, federally insured, or legal tender.
-   The GENIUS Act aligns State and Federal stablecoin frameworks,
    ensuring fair and consistent regulation throughout the country.
-   In the event of insolvency of a stablecoin issuer, the GENIUS Act
    prioritizes stablecoin holders’ claims over all other creditors,
    ensuring a final backstop of consumer protection.

**ENSURING U.S. DOLLAR GLOBAL RESERVE CURRENCY STATUS:** By driving
demand for U.S. Treasuries, stablecoins will play a crucial role in
ensuring the continued global dominance of the U.S. dollar as the
world’s reserve currency.

-   The GENIUS Act will generate increased demand for U.S. debt and
    cement the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency by
    requiring stablecoin issuers to back their assets with Treasuries
    and U.S. dollars.
-   Additionally, the GENIUS Act will play a key role in attracting more
    digital asset activity to the country by providing clear rules and
    promoting responsible innovation in the stablecoin market.

**COMBATING ILLICIT ACTIVITY IN DIGITAL ASSETS:** Through regulation and
registration of stablecoin issuers, along with coordination with the
Treasury Department on sanctions enforcement, the GENIUS Act reinforces
our national security.

-   The GENIUS Act explicitly subjects stablecoin issuers to the Bank
    Secrecy Act, thereby clearly obligating them to establish effective
    anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance programs with risk
    assessments, sanctions list verification, and customer
    identification.
-   This legislation improves the Treasury Department’s ability to
    combat illicit stablecoin activities by enhancing its sanctions
    evasion and money laundering enforcement capabilities.
-   All stablecoin issuers must possess the technical capability to
    seize, freeze, or burn payment stablecoins when legally required and
    must comply with lawful orders to do so.

**DELIVERING ON PROMISE TO MAKE AMERICA THE CRYPTO CAPITAL OF THE
WORLD: **President Trump is fulfilling his campaign promise to position
America as the global leader in cryptocurrency.

-   President Trump promised to make the United States the “crypto
    capital of the world,” emphasizing the need to embrace digital
    assets to drive economic growth and technological leadership.
-   In his first week in office, President Trump signed an Executive
    Order to promote United States leadership in digital assets.
-   In March, President Trump signed an Executive Order to establish a
    Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile,
    positioning the United States as a leader among nations in
    government digital asset strategy.
-   President Trump has long been a proponent of the GENIUS Act, saying
    it “is going to make America the UNDISPUTED Leader in Digital Assets
    — Nobody will do it better, it is pure GENIUS! Digital Assets are
    the future, and our Nation is going to own it. We are talking about
    MASSIVE Investment, and Big Innovation. The House will hopefully
    move LIGHTNING FAST, and pass a ‘clean’ GENIUS Act. Get it to my
    desk, ASAP — NO DELAYS, NO ADD ONS. This is American Brilliance at
    its best, and we are going to show the World how to WIN with Digital
    Assets like never before!”
