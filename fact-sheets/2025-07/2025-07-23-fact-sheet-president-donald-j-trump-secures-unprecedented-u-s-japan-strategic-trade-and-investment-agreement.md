  \ Strategic Trade and Investment Agreement"

**A HISTORIC TRADE AND INVESTMENT AGREEMENT WITH JAPAN:** Yesterday,
President Donald J. Trump announced a landmark economic agreement with
Japan—one of America’s closest allies and most important trading
partners.

-   This historic deal reflects the strength of the U.S.–Japan
    relationship and Japan’s recognition of the United States as the
    most attractive and secure destination for strategic investment in
    the world.
-   The agreement reaffirms the shared commitment of both nations to
    economic prosperity, industrial leadership, and long-term security.
    It delivers a powerful signal that the U.S.–Japan alliance is not
    only a cornerstone of peace in the Indo-Pacific, but also a driver
    of global growth and innovation.
-   With over $550 billion in a new Japanese/USA investment vehicle and
    enhanced access for American exports, this agreement marks a new
    chapter in bilateral cooperation—one that will unleash the full
    potential of the U.S. economy, strengthen vital supply chains, and
    support American workers, communities, and businesses for decades to
    come.

**RESTORING AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL POWER:** Japan will invest $550
billion directed by the United States to rebuild and expand core
American industries.

-   This is the single largest foreign investment commitment ever
    secured by any country and will generate hundreds of thousands of
    U.S. jobs, expand domestic manufacturing, and secure American
    prosperity for generations.
-   At President Trump’s direction, these funds will be targeted toward
    the revitalization of America’s strategic industrial base,
    including:
    -   **Energy infrastructure and production**, including LNG,
        advanced fuels, and grid modernization;

    <!-- -->

    -   **Semiconductor manufacturing and research**, rebuilding U.S.
        capacity from design to fabrication;

    <!-- -->

    -   **Critical minerals mining, processing, and refining**, ensuring
        access to essential inputs;

    <!-- -->

    -   **Pharmaceutical and medical production**, ending U.S.
        dependence on foreign-made medicines and supplies;

    <!-- -->

    -   **Commercial and defense shipbuilding**, including new yards and
        modernization of existing facilities.
-   The United States will retain 90% of the profits from this
    investment—ensuring that American workers, taxpayers, and
    communities reap the overwhelming share of the benefit.
-   This capital surge, combined with the trillions already secured
    under President Trump’s leadership, will be a key component of a
    once-in-a-century industrial revival.

**ENSURING BALANCED TRADE THROUGH A PREDICTABLE TARIFF FRAMEWORK:** As
part of this agreement, imports from Japan will be subject to a baseline
15% tariff rate.

-   In addition to raising billions in revenue, this new tariff
    framework, combined with expanded U.S. exports and investment-driven
    production, will help narrow the trade deficit with Japan and
    restore greater balance to the overall U.S. trade position.
-   This approach reflects the United States’ broader effort to
    establish a consistent, transparent, and enforceable trade
    environment—one in which American workers and producers are no
    longer disadvantaged by outdated or one-sided trade rules.
-   By aligning with this framework, Japan affirms the strength and
    mutual respect of the U.S.–Japan economic relationship and
    recognizes the importance of durable trade grounded in fairness.

**SECURING INCREASED MARKET ACCESS FOR AMERICAN PRODUCERS:** For
decades, U.S. companies have faced barriers when seeking access to
Japan’s market. This agreement delivers breakthrough openings across key
sectors:

-   **Agriculture and Food:**
    -   Japan will immediately increase imports of U.S. rice by 75%,
        with a major expansion of import quotas;

    <!-- -->

    -   Japan will purchase $8 billion in U.S. goods, including corn,
        soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol, and sustainable aviation fuel.
-   **Energy:**
    -   Major expansion of U.S. energy exports to Japan;

    <!-- -->

    -   The US and Japan are exploring a new offtake agreement for
        Alaskan liquefied natural gas (LNG).
-   **Manufacturing and Aerospace:**
    -   Japan has committed to purchase U.S.-made commercial aircraft,
        including an agreement to buy 100 Boeing aircraft;

    <!-- -->

    -   Additional billions of dollars annually of purchases of U.S.
        defense equipment, enhancing interoperability and alliance
        security in the Indo-Pacific.
-   **Automobiles and Industrial Goods:**
    -   Longstanding restrictions on U.S. cars and trucks will be
        lifted, granting U.S. automakers access to the Japanese consumer
        market; U.S. Automotive standards will be approved in Japan for
        the first time ever.

    <!-- -->

    -   Broader openings for a range of industrial and consumer goods,
        leveling the playing field for American producers.

**A GENERATIONAL SHIFT IN U.S.-JAPAN ECONOMIC RELATIONS:** This
agreement is not merely a trade deal—it is a strategic realignment of
the U.S.-Japan economic relationship delivering for the American people.

-   For the first time, the terms of engagement place American industry,
    innovation, and labor at the center.
-   By securing historic investment and breaking open long-closed
    markets, President Trump has once again delivered a deal that no one
    else could deliver—a deal that will help to rebuild the American
    economy, strengthen our industrial foundation, and safeguard our
    national strength for decades to come.
-   President Trump is proving that when the United States leads from
    strength, the world follows—and America wins.

**SECURING LONG-TERM ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP:** This agreement reflects the
strong and enduring relationship between the United States and Japan,
and it advances the mutual interests of both nations.

-   By aligning on economic and national security, energy reliability,
    and reciprocal trade, the agreement establishes a foundation for
    shared prosperity, industrial resilience, and technological
    leadership.
-   President Trump has once again delivered a transformative outcome
    for the American people—ensuring that our workers, producers, and
    innovators are rewarded, respected, and empowered in the global
    economy.
