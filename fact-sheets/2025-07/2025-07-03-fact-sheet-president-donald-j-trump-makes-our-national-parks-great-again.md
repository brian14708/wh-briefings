title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Makes Our National Parks Great Again'
---
 
**PUTTING AMERICANS FIRST:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an
Executive Order investing in our national treasures by increasing fees
for foreign tourists visiting our national parks to improve services,
access, and affordability for Americans.

-   The Order directs the Secretary of the Interior to increase fees
    only for foreign visitors, while making national parks more
    affordable and enjoyable for American families.  
-   The Order increases national park access to American families by
    directing the National Park Service to ensure that U.S. residents
    receive priority access in any permitting or reservation systems.

**MAKING OUR NATIONAL PARKS BEAUTIFUL AGAIN:** The increased fee revenue
from foreign tourists will raise hundreds of millions for conservation
projects that improve our national parks.

-   Charging higher entrance fees to foreign tourists is a common policy
    at national parks throughout the world that supports both
    conservation and affordable access for residents.
-   Increasing entry fees at national parks for foreign visitors will
    fuel investment in our national parks, reduce the maintenance
    backlog, construct critical infrastructure improvements, and support
    conservation projects that improve our majestic national parks.
-   Increasing fees for foreign visitors will also ensure fairness.
    American citizens fund national parks and public lands with their
    tax dollars, yet they are currently charged the same rate as foreign
    visitors who do not pay taxes, meaning that American citizens pay
    more to see their own national treasures than foreign visitors do.
    President Trump is ending this unfair situation and putting
    Americans first.
-   When President Trump signed into law the Great American Outdoors Act
    in 2020, the National Park Service’s maintenance backlog was $14.9
    billion. Under the Biden Administration’s mismanagement, the
    maintenance backlog grew to over $22.9 billion. This Order will
    improve our national parks and reduce the maintenance backlog.

**HONORING OUR CONSERVATION LEGACY:** Since the days of Republican
President Teddy Roosevelt, America has led the world in conservation
policy. This Order builds on America’s conservative, conservationist
history and reinvests in our natural treasures while putting Americans
first.

-   During President Trump’s first term, he signed the Great American
    Outdoors Act—the single largest investment in America’s national
    parks and public lands in history and the most significant
    conservation achievement since Teddy Roosevelt’s presidency.
-   This Order builds on President Trump’s legacy as a conservation
    President and fulfills his promise to put Americans first.
