title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Takes Action to Address the Threat to
  National Security from Imports of Copper'
---
 
**STRENGTHENING AMERICA’S COPPER INDUSTRY:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed a Proclamation to address the effects of copper imports on
America’s national security, including by imposing tariffs on several
categories of copper imports.

-   The Proclamation imposes universal 50% tariffs on imports of
    semi-finished copper products (such as copper pipes, wires, rods,
    sheets, and tubes) and copper-intensive derivative products (such as
    pipe fittings, cables, connectors, and electrical components),
    effective August 1.
    -   The copper 232 tariffs apply to the copper content of a product;
        non-copper content of a product remains subject to reciprocal
        tariffs or other applicable duties. These tariffs do not stack.

    <!-- -->

    -   The copper 232 tariffs do not stack with auto 232 tariffs. If a
        product is subject to auto 232 tariffs, then the auto 232
        tariffs apply, not the copper 232 tariffs. 

    <!-- -->

    -   Copper input materials (such as copper ores, concentrates,
        mattes, cathodes, and anodes) and copper scrap are not subject
        to 232 or reciprocal tariffs.
-   The Proclamation directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish a
    product “inclusion” process to add copper derivative products to
    these tariffs.
-   The President is also authorizing the Secretary of Commerce to take
    steps under the Defense Production Act to support the domestic
    copper industry, including:
    -   Requiring 25% of high-quality copper scrap produced in the
        United States to be sold in the United States. This will improve
        access to this important feedstock for domestic fabricators and
        secondary refiners.
        -   Commerce also recommended an export licensing requirement
            for high-quality copper scrap to ensure adequate domestic
            supply.

    <!-- -->

    -   Requiring 25% of copper input materials (such as copper ores,
        concentrates, mattes, cathodes, and anodes) produced in the
        United States to be sold in the United States – starting at 25%
        in 2027, increasing to 30% in 2028 and 40% in 2029. This will
        boost U.S. refining capacity by ensuring low-cost inputs while
        domestic refiners grow their operations.
-   By taking these actions, President Trump is leveling the playing
    field for U.S. copper businesses to support a strong domestic copper
    industry.

**ADDRESSING THE EFFECTS OF COPPER IMPORTS:** The Proclamation follows
the Secretary of Commerce’s completion of a Section 232 investigation
under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended.

-   President Trump directed the initiation of the Section 232
    investigation through Executive Order 14220 of February 25, 2025,
    “Addressing the Threat to National Security from Imports of Copper.”
    The investigation found that:
    -   Copper is essential to the manufacturing foundation on which
        U.S. national and economic security depend. Copper is a
        necessary input in a range of defense systems, including
        aircraft, ground vehicles, ships, submarines, missiles, and
        ammunition. It is the Department of Defense’s second-most used
        material, and it plays a central role in the broader U.S.
        industrial base.

    <!-- -->

    -   Foreign competitors’ predatory practices and excessive
        environmental regulations have undercut the American copper
        industry and domestic investment in smelting, refining, and
        fabrication facilities.

    <!-- -->

    -   The U.S. now has a massive trade deficit in, and an
        unsustainable dependence on, many foreign copper products.

**REVITALIZING DOMESTIC INDUSTRY AND REDUCING TRADE IMBALANCES:** This
Proclamation builds on previous actions taken by the Trump
Administration to ensure U.S. trade and industrial policies serve the
national interest.

-   On Day One, President Trump established his America First Trade
    Policy to make America’s economy great again.
-   President Trump signed Proclamations to close existing loopholes and
    exemptions and elevate tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50%.
-   President Trump implemented a 10% additional tariff on imports from
    China in response to China’s role in the border crisis. 
-   President Trump imposed reciprocal tariffs to take back America’s
    economic sovereignty and address nonreciprocal trade relationships
    that threaten our economic and national security.
-   President Trump has issued several Executive Orders and Presidential
    Memoranda to boost mining, manufacturing, and investment in domestic
    industry, including by reducing regulations and eliminating
    bureaucracy.
-   President Trump signed a Memorandum to safeguard American
    innovation, including the consideration of tariffs to combat digital
    service taxes, fines, practices, and policies that foreign
    governments levy on American companies.
-   President Trump has initiated several other Section 232
    investigations in addition to the one on which he is taking action
    today.
