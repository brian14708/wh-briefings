title: 'Fact Sheet: The United States and European Union Reach Massive Trade Deal'
---
 
**MAKING GLOBAL HISTORY:** Yesterday, President Donald J. Trump
announced a trade deal with the European Union (EU), fundamentally
rebalancing the economic relationship between the world’s two largest
economies.

-   The deal marks a generational modernization of the transatlantic
    alliance and will provide Americans with unprecedented levels of
    market access to the European Union.
-   The deal bolsters America’s economy and manufacturing capabilities.
    The EU will purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and make new
    investments of $600 billion in the United States, all by 2028.
-   Through decisive leadership and an unyielding commitment to American
    workers, President Trump has delivered yet another agreement that
    positions the United States as the world’s preeminent destination
    for investment, innovation, and advanced manufacturing.

**REACHING A HISTORIC TRADE DEAL:** President Trump’s agreement with the
European Union achieves historic structural reforms and strategic
commitments that will benefit American industry, workers, and national
security for generations:

-   The United States and European Union reached a Cooperation Agreement
    on Reciprocal, Fair and Balanced Trade.
-   This colossal deal will enable U.S. farmers, ranchers, fishermen,
    and manufacturers to increase U.S. exports, expand business
    opportunities, and help reduce the goods trade deficit with the
    European Union.  The EU will remove significant tariffs, including
    the elimination of all EU tariffs on U.S. industrial goods exported
    to the EU, creating enormous opportunities for American-made and
    American-grown goods to compete and win in Europe. This new market
    access will drive growth across the American economy—fueling
    exports, expanding production, and allowing American businesses of
    all sizes to reach millions of new customers across the Atlantic.
-   As part of President Trump’s strategy to establish balanced trade,
    the European Union will pay the United States a tariff rate of 15%,
    including on autos and auto parts, pharmaceuticals, and
    semiconductors. However, the sectoral tariffs on steel, aluminum,
    and copper will remain unchanged—the EU will continue to pay 50% and
    the parties will discuss securing supply chains for these products.
    This new tariff regime will generate tens of billions of dollars in
    revenue annually and help to close the longstanding trade imbalance
    between the United States and Europe by encouraging local sourcing,
    reshoring production, and ensuring that foreign producers contribute
    their fair share to the American economy.
-   Additional key terms of the U.S.-European Union Agreement will
    include:
    -   **Massive EU Investment in the United States:** The EU will
        invest $600 billion in the United States over the course of
        President Trump’s term. This new investment is in addition to
        the over $100 billion EU companies already invest in the United
        States every year.

    <!-- -->

    -   **Unleashing American Energy:** The EU will double down on
        America as the Energy Superpower by purchasing $750 billion of
        U.S. energy exports through 2028. This will strengthen the
        United States’ energy dominance, reduce European reliance on
        adversarial sources, and narrow our trade deficit with the EU.

    <!-- -->

    -   **Tariff Barriers:**  The European Union will work with the
        United States to eliminate tariffs in various sectors and will
        provide meaningful quotas for other products, which when
        combined will create commercially meaningful market access
        opportunities for a significant amount of U.S. goods exports to
        the European Union, supporting high-quality American jobs. 

    <!-- -->

    -   **Non-Tariff Barriers for U.S. Industrial Exports:** The
        European Union will work to address a range of U.S. concerns
        related to various EU requirements that are burdensome to U.S.
        exporters, particularly small and medium-sized businesses,
        including through efforts to eliminate the red tape that U.S.
        exporters face when doing business in the European Union.

    <!-- -->

    -   **Non-Tariff Barriers for U.S. Agriculture Exports:** The United
        States and the European Union intend to work together to address
        non-tariff barriers affecting trade in food and agricultural
        products, including streamlining requirements for sanitary
        certificates for U.S. pork and dairy products.

    <!-- -->

    -   **No Free Riders:** The United States and the European Union
        will establish strong rules of origin to ensure that the
        benefits of this agreement flow directly to the United States
        and the European Union, not to third countries. 

    <!-- -->

    -   **Barriers for Digital Trade:** The United States and the
        European Union intend to address unjustified digital trade
        barriers. In that respect, the European Union confirms that it
        will not adopt or maintain network usage fees. Furthermore, the
        United States and the European Union will maintain zero customs
        duties on electronic transmissions.

    <!-- -->

    -   **Economic Security:** The United States and the European Union
        agree to strengthen economic security alignment to enhance
        supply chain resilience and innovation. The two sides will take
        complementary actions to address non-market policies of third
        parties, as well as cooperating on inbound and outbound
        investment reviews, export controls, and duty evasion.

    <!-- -->

    -   **Commercial Deals:** The United States and European Union
        recognize a series of major commercial agreements across key
        sectors—including energy and semiconductors—that will further
        expand U.S. exports to the European market.

    <!-- -->

    -   **Military Equipment:** The European Union agreed to purchase
        significant amounts of U.S. military equipment.
-   President Trump’s America First economic agenda is restoring our
    industrial might, securing energy dominance, and making the United
    States the premier destination for advanced manufacturing and
    industrial investment.
-   In just six short months, President Trump has reaffirmed the United
    States as the world’s most attractive destination for investment and
    the unrivaled leader in innovation, research, and advanced
    manufacturing.
-   Other American Presidents have tried and failed to reach a
    significant trade deal with the European Union. With this latest
    deal, President Trump has once again proven that bold leadership,
    economic strength, and unwavering resolve deliver results no other
    leader could achieve.

**LIBERATING AMERICA FROM UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES:** Since Day One,
President Trump challenged the assumption that American workers and
businesses must tolerate unfair trade practices that have disadvantaged
them for decades and contributed to our historic trade deficit.

-   On April 2, President Trump declared a national emergency in
    response to the large and persistent U.S. goods trade deficit caused
    by a lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships,
    unfair tariff and non-tariff barriers, and U.S. trading partners’
    economic policies that suppress domestic wages and consumption.
-   President Trump continues to advance the economic and national
    security interests of the American people by removing tariff and
    non-tariff barriers and expanding market access for American
    exporters.
-   Today’s announcement opens up historic market access to the second
    largest economy in the world, reestablishing the strong positive
    long-term relationship between the United States and its key ally
    the European Union.
