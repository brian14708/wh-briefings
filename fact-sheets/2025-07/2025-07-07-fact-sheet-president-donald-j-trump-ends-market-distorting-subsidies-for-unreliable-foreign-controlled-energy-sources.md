title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Ends Market Distorting Subsidies for
  Unreliable, Foreign-Controlled Energy Sources'
---
 
**ENDING AMERICAN DEPENDENCE ON UNRELIABLE ENERGY SOURCES:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to eliminate
subsidies for unreliable “green” energy sources like wind and solar in
furtherance of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

-   The Order directs the Secretary of the Treasury to terminate the
    clean electricity production and investment tax credits for wind and
    solar facilities and implement the enhanced Foreign Entity of
    Concern restrictions each as identified in the One Big Beautiful
    Bill Act.
-   The Order directs the Secretary of the Interior to revise
    regulations and policies to eliminate preferential treatment for
    wind and solar facilities compared to reliable, dispatchable energy
    sources.

**SECURING AMERICAN ENERGY AND ENSURING AMERICAN PROSPERITY:** President
Trump is committed to unleashing American energy and preventing American
taxpayers from funding expensive and unreliable energy policies
from the Green New Scam.

-   Unreliable wind and solar energy sources displace affordable,
    dispatchable energy, compromise America’s electric grid, and
    denigrate the beauty of our Nation’s natural landscape. 
-   Reliance on so-called “green” subsidies threatens national security
    by making the United States dependent on supply chains controlled by
    foreign adversaries. 
-   Ending the massive cost of taxpayer handouts to unreliable energy
    sources is vital to energy dominance, national security, economic
    growth, and the fiscal health of the Nation. 

**UNLEASHING AMERICAN ENERGY:** President Trump believes in all forms of
reliable, dispatchable energy, harnessing nuclear, fossil fuels, and
emerging technologies to secure American energy independence and fuel
economic growth. 

-   On Day One, President Trump declared a National Energy Emergency to
    eliminate bureaucratic barriers, unleash innovation, and restore
    America’s position as the world’s leading energy producer. 
-   President Trump established the National Energy Dominance Council to
    develop a strategy to achieve energy dominance by cutting red tape,
    enhancing private sector investments, and advancing innovation. 
-   Unleashing American energy will create jobs and economic prosperity,
    improve the United States’ trade balance, help our country compete
    with hostile foreign powers, strengthen relations with allies and
    partners, and support international peace and security.
