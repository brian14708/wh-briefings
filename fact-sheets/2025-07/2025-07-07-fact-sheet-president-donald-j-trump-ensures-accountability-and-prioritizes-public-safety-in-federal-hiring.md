title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Ensures Accountability and Prioritizes
  Public Safety in Federal Hiring'

**ESTABLISHING POLICIES THAT DRIVE ACCOUNTABLE HIRING:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum that requires
many federal hires to be approved by an agency’s presidentially
appointed leadership, to end incompetence and “equity” over results.

-   This prohibits filling vacant federal civilian positions or creating
    new ones without approval from agency leadership, with certain
    exceptions.
    -   Exemptions from the policy for immigration enforcement, national
        security, and public safety positions shall remain, which apply
        to roles like Department of Veterans Affairs medical personnel,
        food safety inspectors, firefighters, air traffic controllers,
        and National Weather Service employees.
-   This Memorandum provides that the policy applies through October 15,
    2025.
    -   The Memorandum allows hiring that is directly approved by senior
        agency leadership appointed by the President.

    -   This ensures democratic accountability, rather than hiring being
        driven by the bureaucracy, and that hiring decisions are based
        on agency priorities.
-   It also clarifies that any hiring of employees be consistent with
    the Merit Hiring Plan issued by the Administration on May 29, 2025.

**PROMOTING FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY AND GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY:** President
Trump is strengthening accountable hiring practices to ensure taxpayer
dollars are used efficiently.

-   In the last two years of the Biden Administration, government was
    directly responsible for the creation of more than 1 in every 4
    jobs.
-   President Trump is committed to reversing this trend by prioritizing
    private-sector job growth and maintaining oversight of hiring by
    presidentially appointed leadership.
    -   This ensures the Federal workforce remains focused on essential
        functions and fully aligned with administration priorities. 

**REFORMING THE FEDERAL BUREAUCRACY:** The American people elected
President Trump to drain the swamp and end ineffective government
programs that empower government without achieving measurable results.

-   The government wastes billions of dollars each year on duplicative
    programs and frivolous expenditures that fail to align with American
    values or address the needs of the American people.
-   The Trump Administration is committed to streamlining the Federal
    Government, eliminating unnecessary programs, and reducing
    bureaucratic inefficiency.
-   President Trump launched a 10-to-1 deregulation initiative, ensuring
    every new rule is justified by clear benefits.
-   President Trump authorized buyout programs to encourage federal
    employees to leave voluntarily.
-   Through these actions, President Trump is keeping his promise to
    restore efficiency and accountability in the Federal Government.
