title: 'Fact Sheet: The United States and Indonesia Reach Historic Trade Deal'
---
 
**DELIVERING ON RECIPROCAL TRADE:** President Donald J. Trump announced
a landmark trade deal with Indonesia that will provide Americans with
market access in Indonesia once considered impossible and unlock major
breakthroughs for America’s manufacturing, agriculture, and digital
sectors.

-   Under this deal, Indonesia will pay the United States a reciprocal
    tariff rate of 19%.
-   The key terms of the U.S.-Indonesia Agreement on Reciprocal Trade
    will include:
    -   **Eliminating Tariff Barriers:** Indonesia will eliminate tariff
        barriers, on a preferential basis, on over 99% of U.S. products
        exported to Indonesia across all sectors, including for all
        agricultural products, health products, seafood, information and
        communications technology, automotive products, and chemicals,
        which will create commercially meaningful market access
        opportunities for the full range of U.S. exports, supporting
        high-quality American jobs.
    -   **Breaking Down Non-Tariff Barriers for U.S. Industrial
        Exports:** Indonesia will address a range of non-tariff
        barriers, including by: (1) exempting U.S. companies and
        originating goods from local content requirements; (2) accepting
        vehicles built to U.S. federal motor vehicle safety and
        emissions standards; (3) accepting FDA certificates and prior
        marketing authorizations for medical devices and
        pharmaceuticals; (4) exempting U.S. exports of cosmetics,
        medical devices, and other manufactured goods from burdensome
        certification and labeling requirements; (5) removing import
        restrictions or licensing requirements on U.S. remanufactured
        goods and their parts; (6) eliminating pre-shipment inspection
        or verification requirements on imports of U.S. goods; (7)
        adopting and implementing good regulatory practices; (8) taking
        steps to resolve many long-standing intellectual property issues
        identified in USTR’s Special 301 Report; and (9) addressing U.S.
        concerns with conformity assessment procedures.
    -   **Breaking Down Non-Tariff Barriers for U.S. Agriculture
        Exports:** Indonesia will address and prevent barriers to U.S.
        agricultural products in the Indonesian market, including
        by: (1) exempting U.S. food and agricultural products from all
        of Indonesia’s import licensing regimes including its commodity
        balance policy; (2) ensuring transparency and fairness with
        respect to geographical indications (GIs) including meats and
        cheeses; (3) providing permanent Fresh Food of Plant Origin
        (FFPO) designation for all applicable U.S. plant products;
        and (4) recognizing U.S. regulatory oversight, including listing
        of all U.S. meat, poultry, and dairy facilities and accepting
        certificates issued by U.S. regulatory authorities.
    -   **Strengthening Rules of Origin:** The United States and
        Indonesia will negotiate facilitative rules of origin that
        ensure that the benefits from the agreement accrue to the United
        States and Indonesia, not third-countries.
    -   **Removing Barriers for Digital Trade:** The United States and
        Indonesia will finalize commitments on digital trade, services,
        and investment. Indonesia has committed to eliminate existing
        HTS tariff lines on “intangible products” and suspend related
        requirements on import declarations; support a permanent
        moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions at the
        World Trade Organization (WTO) immediately and without
        conditions; and take effective actions to implement the Joint
        Initiative on Services Domestic Regulation, including submitting
        its revised Specific Commitments for certification by the WTO.
        Indonesia will provide certainty regarding the ability to move
        personal data out of its territory to the United States through
        recognition of the United States as a country or jurisdiction
        that provides adequate data protection under Indonesia’s law.
        American companies have sought these reforms for years.
    -   **Aligning on Economic Security:** Indonesia has committed to
        join the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity and take
        effective actions to address global excess capacity in the steel
        sector and its impacts. The United States and Indonesia are
        committed to strengthening cooperation to increase supply chain
        resilience. This includes addressing duty evasion and
        cooperating on export controls and investment security.
        Indonesia will remove restrictions on exports to the United
        States for all industrial commodities, including critical
        minerals.
    -   **Improving Labor Standards:** Indonesia has committed to adopt
        and implement a forced labor import ban and remove provisions
        that restrict workers and unions from exercising freedom of
        association and collective bargaining rights.
    -   **Notching Commercial Deals:** The United States and Indonesia
        take note of commercial deals in the areas of agriculture,
        aerospace, and energy, which will further increase U.S. exports
        to Indonesia.
-   President Trump has delivered a forward-looking and tough trade deal
    that will benefit American workers, exporters, farmers, and digital
    innovators—this deal is what winning looks and will feel like for
    all Americans.

**A DEFINED PATH FORWARD:** In the coming weeks, the United States and
Indonesia will memorialize the Agreement on Reciprocal Trade in order to
lock in benefits for American businesses and workers.

-   The United States currently runs its fifteenth largest goods trade
    deficit with Indonesia.
    -   The U.S. total goods trade deficit with Indonesia was $17.9
        billion in 2024.

    -   Before this deal, Indonesia’s simple average applied tariff was
        8% while the U.S. average applied tariff was 3.3%. 

**LIBERATING AMERICA FROM UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES:** Since Day One,
President Trump challenged the assumption that American workers and
businesses must tolerate unfair trade practices that have disadvantaged
them for decades and contributed to our historic trade deficit.

-   On April 2, President Trump declared a national emergency in
    response to the large and persistent U.S. goods trade deficit caused
    by a lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships,
    unfair tariff and non-tariff barriers, and U.S. trading partners’
    economic policies that suppress domestic wages and consumption.
-   President Trump continues to advance the economic and national
    security interests of the American people by removing tariff and
    non-tariff barriers and expanding market access for American
    exporters.
-   Today’s announcement shows that America can defend its domestic
    production and strengthen its defense industrial base while
    obtaining expansive market access with our trading partners.
