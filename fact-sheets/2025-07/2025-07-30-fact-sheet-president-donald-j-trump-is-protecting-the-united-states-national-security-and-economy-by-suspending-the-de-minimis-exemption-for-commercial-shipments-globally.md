  \ National Security and Economy by Suspending the De Minimis Exemption for Commercial\
  \ Shipments Globally"

**TAKING DECISIVE ACTION GLOBALLY TO PROTECT AMERICANS:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order suspending duty-free
*de minimis* treatment for low-value shipments, closing the catastrophic
loophole used to, among other things, evade tariffs and funnel deadly
synthetic opioids as well as other unsafe or below-market products that
harm American workers and businesses into the United States.

-   President Trump is taking action to deal with the national
    emergencies that he has recently declared with respect to unusual
    and extraordinary threats to the national security, foreign policy,
    and economy of the United States.
-   Effective August 29, imported goods sent through means other than
    the international postal network that are valued at or under $800
    and that would otherwise qualify for the *de minimis* exemption will
    be subject to all applicable duties.
-   For goods shipped through the international postal system, packages
    will instead be assessed duties according to one of the following
    methodologies:
    -   Ad valorem duty: A duty equal to the effective tariff rate
        imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act
        (IEEPA) that is applicable to the country of origin of the
        product. This duty shall be assessed on the value of each
        package.

    <!-- -->

    -   Specific duty: A duty ranging from $80 per item to $200 per
        item, depending on the effective IEEPA tariff rate applicable to
        the country of origin of the product. The specific duty
        methodology will be available for six months, after which all
        applicable shipments must comply with the ad valorem duty
        methodology.  
-   Longstanding exemptions under 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(A) and (B) remain
    in place – meaning American travelers can still bring back up to
    $200 in personal items and individuals can continue to receive bona
    fide gifts valued at $100 or less duty-free.

**COMBATTING ESCALATING DECEPTIVE SHIPPING PRACTICES, ILLEGAL MATERIAL,
AND DUTY CIRCUMVENTION:** President Trump is putting an end to the
proliferation of shippers worldwide that, among other things,
deceptively exploit the *de minimis* privilege in an effort to evade
duties, inspection, and U.S. law.

-   Packages entering the United States using the duty-free *de minimis*
    exemption are typically subject to less scrutiny than traditional
    imports; however, the packages can pose health, safety, national and
    economic security risks. 
-   Between 2015 and 2024, the volume of *de minimis* shipments entering
    the U.S. increased from 134 million shipments to over 1.36 billion
    shipments. On average, CBP processes over 4 million *de minimis*
    shipments into the U.S. each day.
-   The *de minimis* exemption has been abused, with shippers sending
    illicit fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, precursors, and
    paraphernalia into the United States in reliance on the lower
    security measures applied to *de minimis* shipments, killing
    Americans.
-   Enforcement data consistently shows that *de minimis* shipments
    account for the majority of all cargo enforcement actions. In FY24,
    90% of all cargo seizures originated as *de minimis* shipments,
    including:
    -   98% of narcotics seizures (by number of cases).97% of
        intellectual property rights seizures, totaling 31 million
        counterfeit items. 

    <!-- -->

    -   77% of health and safety/prohibited items seizures totaling more
        than 20 million dangerous or illicit items (e.g., weapons parts
        and Glock switches).
-   The volume of *de minimis* shipments, even from countries that
    historically have not been the primary source of *de minimis* abuse,
    has skyrocketed this year, with 309 million so far for FY25 (through
    June 30), compared to 115 million for all of FY24, resulting in
    significant lost revenue for the United States.
-   CBP is increasingly interdicting *de minimis* shipments where the
    certificate of origin is misrepresented in an attempt to circumvent
    duties.

**BUILDING ON A RECORD OF FIGHTING HARMFUL TRADE LOOPHOLES: 
 **President Trump is delivering on his promise to “put an end” to the
“big scam” of *de minimis* shipments killing Americans and hurting U.S.
businesses.

-   In February, President Trump declared national emergencies on the
    United States’ northern and southern borders, including the public
    health crisis caused by fentanyl and other illicit drugs.
-   In April, President Trump declared a national emergency relating to
    the conditions underlying the United States’ exploding trade deficit
    and the implications of that deficit for the United States’ economy
    and national security.
-   Effective May 2, President Trump suspended *de minimis* treatment
    for low-value packages from China and Hong Kong, which account for
    the majority of *de minimis* shipments to the United States.
-   The President signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which
    permanently repeals the statutory basis for the *de minimis*
    exemption worldwide effective July 1, 2027.
-   President Trump is acting more quickly to suspend the *de minimis*
    exemption than the OBBBA requires, to deal with national emergencies
    and save American lives and businesses NOW.
