**RESTORING HEALTH AND FITNESS FOR AMERICA’S YOUTH:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order revitalizing the President’s
Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition, and reestablishing the
Presidential Fitness Test.

-   The Order reestablishes the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness,
    and Nutrition to develop bold and innovative fitness goals for young
    Americans with the aim of fostering a new generation of healthy,
    active citizens.
-   The Order directs the Council to create school-based programs that
    reward excellence in physical education and develop criteria for a
    Presidential Fitness Award.
-   The Order reestablishes the Presidential Fitness Test, which shall
    be administered by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
-   This Order ensures American youth will have opportunities at the
    global, national, State, and local levels that emphasize the
    importance of an active lifestyle, good nutrition, American sports,
    and military readiness.
-   The Order instructs the Council to partner with professional
    athletes, sports organizations, and influential figures.

**MAINTAINING A STRONG AND VITAL AMERICA:** President Trump is
addressing the widespread epidemic of declining health and physical
fitness with a time-tested approach celebrating the exceptionalism of
America’s sports and fitness traditions.

-   Rates of obesity, chronic disease, inactivity, and poor nutrition
    are at crisis levels, particularly among our children.
-   These trends weaken our economy, military readiness, academic
    performance, and national morale.
-   President Eisenhower recognized this issue when he created the
    President’s Council on Youth Fitness in response to reports on the
    poor state of youth fitness in America.
-   President Trump is creating a national culture of strength,
    vitality, and excellence for the next generation by promoting the
    physical, mental, and civic benefits of exercise and good nutrition.

**MAKING AMERICA ACTIVE AGAIN**: President Trump is taking action to end
the nationwide health crisis and restore urgency in improving the health
of all Americans.

-   In 2018, President Trump originally revitalized the Council,
    renaming it the “President’s Council on Sports, Fitness, and
    Nutrition.”
-   In 2019, The Trump Administration launched the National Youth Sports
    Strategy to unify U.S. youth sports culture around a shared vision
    that one day all youth will have the opportunity, motivation, and
    access to play sports.
-   In May 2025, President Trump proclaimed May 2025 as National
    Physical Fitness and Sports Month.
-   Over the next three years, America will host the Ryder Cup, the
    President’s Cup, the FIFA World Cup, and the Olympic Games –- the
    world’s premiere sporting competitions. 
-   In 2026, we will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our great
    Nation, honor the 70th anniversary of the original President’s
    Council on Youth Fitness, and showcase America’s continued global
    dominance in sports.
