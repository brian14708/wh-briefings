title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Announces Actions to Get Americans the
  Best Prices in the World for Prescription Drugs'

**REDUCING DRUG PRICES FOR AMERICANS AND TAXPAYERS:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump sent letters to leading pharmaceutical manufacturers
outlining the steps they must take to bring down the prices of
prescription drugs in the United States to match the lowest price
offered in other developed nations (known as the most-favored-nation, or
MFN, price). The steps include:

-   Calling on manufacturers to provide MFN prices to every single
    Medicaid patient.
-   Requiring manufacturers to stipulate that they will not offer other
    developed nations better prices for new drugs than prices offered in
    the United States.
-   Providing manufacturers with an avenue to cut out middlemen and sell
    medicines directly to patients, provided they do so at a price no
    higher than the best price available in developed nations.
-   Using trade policy to support manufacturers in raising prices
    internationally provided that increased revenues abroad are
    reinvested directly into lowering prices for American patients and
    taxpayers.

The letters inform manufacturers that if they “refuse to step up,” the
federal government “will deploy every tool in our arsenal to protect
American families from continued abusive drug pricing practices.”

Letters were sent to AbbVie, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim,
Bristol Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, EMD Serono, Genentech, Gilead, GSK,
Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, Regeneron, and
Sanofi.

**ENDING GLOBAL FREELOADING ON AMERICAN PHARMACEUTICAL INNOVATION: **
President Trump is taking decisive action to rebalance a system that
allows pharmaceutical manufacturers to offer low prices to other wealthy
nations while charging Americans significantly higher prices. 

-   According to recent data, the prices Americans pay for brand-name
    drugs are more than three times the price other Organization for
    Economic Cooperation and Development nations pay, even after
    accounting for discounts manufacturers provide in the U.S.
-   The United States has less than five percent of the world’s
    population, yet roughly 75% of global pharmaceutical profits come
    from American taxpayers.
-   Drug manufacturers benefit from generous research subsidies and
    enormous healthcare spending by the U.S. Government. Instead of
    passing that benefit through to American consumers, drug
    manufacturers then discount their products abroad to gain access to
    foreign markets and subsidize those discounts through high prices
    charged in America. Americans are subsidizing drug-manufacturer
    profits and foreign health systems, both in development and once the
    drugs are sold.

**ONCE AGAIN DELIVERING ON PROMISES TO PUT AMERICAN PATIENTS FIRST:**
Today’s letters are an important step in President Trump’s work to get
Americans the best deal in the world on prescription drugs.

-   On May 12, 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order titled:
    “Delivering Most-Favored-Nation Prescription Drug Pricing to
    American Patients” directing the Administration to take numerous
    actions to bring American drug prices in line with those paid by
    similar nations.
-   Following the Order, the Administration engaged pharmaceutical
    manufacturers in discussions to achieve MFN pricing in the United
    States. Today’s letters indicate that industry proposals have fallen
    short, and from this point forward, President Trump will only accept
    from drug manufacturers a commitment that provides American families
    immediate relief from vastly inflated drug prices and an end to the
    freeriding by European and other developed nations on American
    innovations.
-   President Trump has been relentless in his effort to address the
    unfair and outrageous prices Americans pay for prescription drugs:
    -   President Trump: “In case after case, our citizens pay massively
        higher prices than other nations pay for the same exact pill,
        from the same factory, effectively subsidizing socialism aboard
        \[abroad\] with skyrocketing prices at home. So we would spend
        tremendous amounts of money in order to provide inexpensive
        drugs to another country. And when I say the price is different,
        you can see some examples where the price is beyond anything —
        four times, five times different.”
