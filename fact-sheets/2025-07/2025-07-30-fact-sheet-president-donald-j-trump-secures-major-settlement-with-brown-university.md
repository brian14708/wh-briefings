**SECURING HISTORIC SETTLEMENT WITH BROWN UNIVERSITY:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump secured a historic settlement with Brown University to
restore fairness, merit, and safety in higher education.

-   The agreement ensures Brown will not engage in unlawful racial
    discrimination in admissions or university programming. Brown will
    provide access to all relevant data and information to rigorously
    assess compliance with its commitment to merit-based admissions. 
-   Brown will pay $50 million over ten years to state workforce
    development organizations that comply with anti-discrimination laws,
    supporting regional economic growth and career opportunities.
-   Brown will adopt the definitions of “male” and “female” from
    President Trump’s Executive Order 14168, “Defending Women from
    Gender Ideology Extremism” for women’s sports, programing,
    facilities, and housing.
-   Brown will not perform gender reassignment surgeries on minors or
    prescribe them puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones.
-   Brown will take steps to improve the campus climate for Jewish
    students and combat anti-Semitism.
-   The agreement reinstates all HHS grants, restores Brown’s
    eligibility for future grants and awards, and closes pending
    investigations into the university.
-   The agreement establishes a three-year monitoring period to ensure
    compliance with the agreement and federal laws.

**ADDRESSING DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES AT BROWN:** The Trump
Administration took action to address concerns about violations of
federal civil rights laws, protecting students and upholding fairness in
higher education.

-   The settlement comes after public outcry over incidents and civil
    rights investigations into Brown’s alleged discrimination on the
    basis of race and national origin.
-   Brown’s failure to address anti-Semitism and ensure fair treatment
    for all students raised urgent concerns about student safety and
    equal opportunities.
-   Brown’s diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs promoted
    unlawful race-based outcomes, violating anti-discrimination laws.
-   By securing this settlement, the Trump Administration is ensuring
    that Brown upholds merit-based standards, complies with federal law,
    and fosters an environment of academic excellence and safety for all
    students.

**ADVANCING REFORMS IN HIGHER EDUCATION:** President Trump is holding
elite universities accountable, ensuring they prioritize fairness,
merit, and American values.  

-   The Administration has challenged elite universities like Harvard,
    Columbia, and Brown for discriminating against students and staff,
    failing to protect students from violent anti-Semitism, and
    otherwise failing to be a responsible steward of taxpayer dollars.
-   President Trump signed a Proclamation to safeguard national security
    by suspending the entry of foreign nationals seeking to study or
    participate in exchange programs at Harvard University. 
-   The Administration successfully negotiated a resolution with the
    University of Pennsylvania to keep men out of women’s sports and
    restore the trophies and records of women.
-   President Trump secured a more than $200 million settlement with
    Columbia University to resolve claims related to discriminatory
    practices, marking a significant win for accountability in academia.
