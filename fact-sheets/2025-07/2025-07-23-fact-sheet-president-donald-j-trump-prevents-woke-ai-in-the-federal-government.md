title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Prevents Woke AI in the Federal Government'
---
 
**PREVENTING WOKE AI IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to ensure that artificial
intelligence (AI) models procured by the Federal government prioritize
truthfulness and ideological neutrality.

-   President Trump is protecting Americans from biased AI outputs
    driven by ideologies like diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) at
    the cost of accuracy.
-   The Order directs agency heads to procure only large language models
    (LLMs) that adhere to “Unbiased AI Principles” defined in the Order:
    truth-seeking and ideological neutrality.
    -   Truth-seeking means that LLMS shall be truthful and prioritize
        historical accuracy, scientific inquiry, and objectivity, and
        acknowledge uncertainty where reliable information is incomplete
        or contradictory.

    <!-- -->

    -   Ideological neutrality means that LLMs shall be neutral,
        nonpartisan tools that do not manipulate responses in favor of
        ideological dogmas like DEI, and that developers will not
        intentionally encode partisan or ideological judgments into an
        LLM’s outputs unless those judgments are prompted by or readily
        accessible to the end user.
-   The Order instructs the Director of the Office of Management and
    Budget, in consultation with other Federal leaders, to issue
    guidance for agencies to implement these principles in AI
    procurement.
-   The Order mandates that Federal contracts for LLMs include terms
    ensuring compliance with the Unbiased AI Principles, including terms
    holding vendors accountable for certain costs if contracts are
    terminated due to noncompliance.

**SAFEGUARDING TRUST IN FEDERAL AI USE:** President Trump is advancing
trustworthy AI in the Federal government to protect the integrity of
information and services provided to the American people.

-   AI is a critical technology that will shape how Americans learn,
    access information, and navigate their daily lives.
-   Ideological biases, such as those driven by DEI, can distort AI
    outputs, undermine historical and scientific accuracy, and erode
    public trust in AI systems.
    -   For example, one major AI model changed the race or sex of
        historical figures—including the Pope, the founding Fathers, and
        Vikings—when prompted for images because it was trained to
        prioritize DEI requirements.

    <!-- -->

    -   In another case, an AI model asserted that a user should not
        “misgender” another person even if necessary to stop a nuclear
        apocalypse.
-   By requiring truth-seeking and ideologically neutral AI models, the
    Federal government ensures reliable, objective information for
    Americans and prevents the spread of biased or misleading outputs.

**SERVING AMERICA, NOT IDEOLOGICAL AGENDAS:** President Trump is
terminating DEI across the Federal government and advancing American
leadership in AI to ensure technology and policies serve the public, not
ideological agendas.

-   President Trump is harnessing AI to strengthen national security,
    economic prosperity, and technological leadership.
    -   In January 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order to
        reverse harmful Biden Administration AI policies and enhance
        America’s global AI dominance.

    <!-- -->

    -   In April 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order to
        advance AI education for America’s youth.

    <!-- -->

    -   Today, President Trump also signed Executive Orders on
        facilitating the rapid and efficient buildout of data
        infrastructure and promoting the export of American AI
        technologies.
-   President Trump is restoring fairness and merit by dismantling
    radical DEI programs
    -   In January, President Trump signed executive actions to end
        radical and wasteful DEI programs and preferencing, terminate
        radical DEI preferencing in Federal contracting and spending,
        eliminate DEI and restore excellence and safety within the
        Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and abolish DEI
        bureaucracy within the Departments of Defense and Homeland
        Security.

    <!-- -->

    -   In March, President Trump signed a Memorandum removing DEI from
        the Foreign Service.

    <!-- -->

    -   In April, President Trump signed an Executive Order to ensure
        school discipline policies are based on objective behavior, not
        DEI.

    <!-- -->

    -   President Trump: “We will terminate every diversity, equity, and
        inclusion program across the entire Federal government.”
