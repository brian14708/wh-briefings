title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Grants Regulatory Relief from Burdensome
  EPA Restrictions to Promote American Security'
---
 
**PROVIDING REGULATORY RELIEF:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed
four proclamations, each granting two years of regulatory relief from
stringent Biden-era regulations that impacted various sectors vital to
national security.

-   The proclamations cover coal plants, taconite iron ore processing
    facilities, and certain chemical manufacturers that produce
    chemicals related to semiconductors, medical device sterilization,
    advanced manufacturing, and national defense systems.
-   These proclamations allow certain of these facilities to comply with
    the EPA standards that were in place before the Biden Administration
    rulemakings for two years.
-   The exemptions ensure that these facilities within these critical
    industries can continue to operate uninterrupted to support national
    security without incurring substantial costs to comply with, in some
    cases, unattainable compliance requirements.

**REDUCING BURDENSOME RESTRICTIONS:** President Trump recognizes that
overly restrictive environmental regulations undermine America’s energy
reliability, economic vitality, and national security.

-   Biden-era emissions standards impose costly and, in some cases,
    unattainable compliance requirements on these industries essential
    to national interests.
-   The technologies necessary to comply with these Biden-era standards
    are further not commercially viable in many instances.
-   These sectors are critical to maintaining national security and
    economic stability. Shutdowns could compromise our grid and lead to
    electricity shortages and reliance on foreign energy, increase our
    reliance on foreign supply chains for semiconductors, reduce our
    ability to provide sterile medical equipment for public health and
    military readiness, and reduce the supply on steel that we need to
    support critical infrastructure.

**BALANCING ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS WITH AMERICAN PROSPERITY:**
President Trump has consistently prioritized a pragmatic approach,
ensuring environmental policies support, rather than undermine,
America’s economic strength and national security.

-   President Trump has sought to protect American industries while
    maintaining standards that allow Americans to have among the
    cleanest air and water in the world.
-   He directed the EPA to repeal the Obama-era Clean Power Plan during
    his first term, replacing it with the Affordable Clean Energy rule
    in 2019 that set achievable standards to preserve jobs while
    addressing emissions.
-   He paused the expansion of windmills, recognizing their detrimental
    environmental impact, particularly on wildlife, often outweighs
    their benefits.
-   He has championed an energy dominance strategy, boosting domestic
    oil and gas production to reduce reliance on foreign energy while
    maintaining practical environmental oversight.
-   His approach encourages industry to develop cost-effective solutions
    like improved emissions technologies rather than imposing unfeasible
    mandates that risk economic disruption.
