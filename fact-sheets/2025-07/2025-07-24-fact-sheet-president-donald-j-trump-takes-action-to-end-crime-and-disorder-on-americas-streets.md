**ENDING VAGRANCY AND RESTORING ORDER:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed an Executive Order to restore order to American cities and
remove vagrant individuals from our streets, redirecting federal
resources toward programs that tackle substance abuse and returning to
the acute necessity of civil commitment.

-   The Order directs the Attorney General to reverse judicial
    precedents and end consent decrees that limit State and local
    governments’ ability to commit individuals on the streets who are a
    risk to themselves or others.  
-   The Order requires the Attorney General to work with the Secretary
    of Health and Human Services, Secretary of Housing and Urban
    Development, and the Secretary of Transportation to prioritize
    grants for states and municipalities that enforce prohibitions on
    open illicit drug use, urban camping and loitering, and urban
    squatting, and track the location of sex offenders.
-   The Order redirects funding to ensure that individuals camping on
    streets and causing public disorder and that are suffering from
    serious mental illness or addiction are moved into treatment
    centers, assisted outpatient treatment, or other facilities.
-   The Order ensures discretionary grants for substance use disorder
    prevention, treatment, and recovery do not fund drug injection sites
    or illicit drug use.
-   The Order stops sex offenders who receive homelessness assistance
    from being housed with children, and allows programs to exclusively
    house women and children.

**ENSURING AMERICANS FEEL SAFE IN THEIR OWN CITIES AND TOWNS:**
President Trump is taking a new approach focused on protecting public
safety because surrendering our cities and citizens to disorder and fear
is neither compassionate to the homeless nor to other citizens.** **

-   The number of individuals living on the streets in the United States
    on a single night during the last year of the Biden
    administration—274,224 —was the highest ever recorded.
-   The overwhelming majority of these individuals are addicted to
    drugs, have a mental health disorder, or both.
-   Federal and state governments have spent tens of billions of dollars
    on failed programs that address homelessness but not its root
    causes, leaving other citizens vulnerable to public safety threats.
-   Shifting these individuals into long-term institutional settings for
    humane treatment is the most proven way to restore public order. 

**MAKING AMERICA SAFE AGAIN**: President Trump is committed to ending
homelessness across America. 

-   In 2023, President Trump said: “We will use every tool, lever, and
    authority to get the homeless off our streets. We want to take care
    of them, but they have to be off our streets.”
-   In March 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order to beautify
    Washington D.C., directing the National Park Service to clear all
    homeless encampments and graffiti on Federal lands.
-   In May 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order establishing
    the National Center for Warrior Independence, a place where homeless
    veterans can go to receive the care, benefits, and services to which
    they are entitled.
-   As part of First Lady Melania Trump’s BE BEST Initiative, the
    Department of Housing and Urban Development announced a $1.8 million
    dollar investment to prevent homelessness among young Americans
    aging out of the foster care system.
