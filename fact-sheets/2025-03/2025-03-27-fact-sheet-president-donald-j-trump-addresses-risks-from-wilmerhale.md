title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Addresses Risks from WilmerHale'
---
 
**SUSPENDING SECURITY CLEARANCES TO PROTECT THE NATIONAL INTEREST:**
Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to suspend
security clearances held by individuals at Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale
and Dorr LLP (WilmerHale) pending a review of whether such clearances
are consistent with the national interest.

-   Security clearances held by WilmerHale employees will be immediately
    suspended, pending a review of whether their access to sensitive
    information is consistent with the national interest.
    -   The Federal Government will halt all material and services,
        including sensitive compartmented information facility (SCIF)
        access provided to WilmerHale and restrict its employees’ access
        to government buildings.

    -   Federal Agencies will also refrain from hiring WilmerHale
        employees unless specifically authorized.
-   To ensure taxpayer dollars no longer go to contractors whose
    earnings subsidize activities not aligned with American interests,
    the Federal Government will terminate contracts that involve
    WilmerHale.
-   The practices of WilmerHale will be reviewed under Title VII to
    ensure compliance with civil rights laws against racial bias.

**ADDRESSING ROGUE LAW FIRMS:** President Trump believes that lawyers
and law firms that engage in conduct detrimental to critical American
interests should not be subsidized by American taxpayers or have access
to our Nation’s secrets.

-   WilmerHale has abandoned the legal profession’s highest ideals and
    abused its pro bono practice to engage in activities that undermine
    justice and the interests of the United States.
-   WilmerHale pursues partisan goals, supports efforts to discriminate
    on the basis of race, and backs the obstruction of efforts to
    prevent illegal aliens from committing horrific crimes and
    trafficking deadly drugs within our borders.
-   WilmerHale has furthered the degradation of the quality of American
    elections by supporting efforts designed to enable noncitizens to
    vote.
-   WilmerHale has been accused of discriminating against its own
    employees on the basis of race and other categories prohibited by
    civil rights laws, including through the use of race-based
    “targets.”
-   WilmerHale rewarded Robert Mueller and two of his colleagues by
    welcoming them to the firm after they wielded the power of the
    Federal government to lead a partisan “investigation” against the
    President and others.   Mueller’s investigation epitomizes the
    weaponization of government.

**A RETURN TO ACCOUNTABILITY:** President Trump is delivering on his
promise to end the weaponization of government and protect the nation
from partisan and bad faith actors who exploit their influence. 

-   In addition to WilmerHale, President Trump has also taken action to
    hold other major law firms accountable.
-   This Executive Order aligns with President Trump’s priority on
    refocusing government operations to serve the citizens of the United
    States.
-   It builds on President Trump’s previous actions, such as signing an
    Executive Order on his first day in office to end the weaponization
    of the Federal government and ensure accountability for past
    misconduct.
-   It follows his revocation of security clearances held by
    intelligence officials who falsely claimed Hunter Biden’s laptop was
    Russian disinformation during the 2020 election.
