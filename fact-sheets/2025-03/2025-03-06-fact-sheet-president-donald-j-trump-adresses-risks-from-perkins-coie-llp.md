title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Adresses Risks from Perkins Coie LLP'
---
 
**STOPPING ABUSES THAT UNDERMINE THE NATION:** Today, President Donald
J. Trump signed an Executive Order to suspend security clearances held
by individuals at Perkins Coie LLP, pending a review of whether their
access to sensitive information is consistent with the national
interest.

-   Security clearances held by Perkins Coie LLP employees will be
    immediately suspended, pending a review of whether their access to
    sensitive information is consistent with the national interest.
    -   The Federal Government will halt all material and services,
        including sensitive compartmented information facility (SCIF)
        access provided to Perkins Coie LLP and restrict its employees’
        access to government buildings.

    -   Federal Agencies will also refrain from hiring Perkins Coie LLP
        employees unless specifically authorized.
-   To ensure taxpayer dollars no longer go to contractors whose
    earnings subsidize partisan lawsuits against the United States, the
    Federal Government will prohibit funding contractors that use
    Perkins Coie LLP.
    -   All Federal Government contracts with Perkins Coie LLP will
        undergo rigorous scrutiny, with agency heads directed to
        terminate engagements to the maximum extent permitted by law.
-   The practices of Perkins Coie LLP will be reviewed under Title VII
    to ensure compliance with civil rights laws against racial bias.

**ENSURING GOVERNMENT SERVES THE AMERICAN PEOPLE:** President Trump’s
Administration will not tolerate Perkins Coie LLP’s unethical and
discriminatory actions that threaten our elections, military strength,
and national security.

-   In 2016, Perkins Coie LLP hired Fusion GPS to manufacture a false
    “dossier” designed to steal an election while representing failed
    presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
-   Perkins Coie LLP pushed debunked claims of secret Trump-Russia
    communications via Alfa Bank, with attorney Michael Sussmann
    indicted for lying to the FBI about this scheme.
-   Perkins Coie LLP has worked with activist donors, including George
    Soros, to judicially overturn enacted election laws, such as those
    requiring voter identification.
    -   A court was forced to sanction Perkins Coie attorneys for
        unethical lack of candor before the court.
-   Perkins Coie LLP has been accused of racially discriminating against
    its own attorneys, staff, and applicants.
    -   Perkins Coie has publicly announced racial percentage quotas for
        hiring and promotions, violating civil rights laws, and excluded
        applicants from fellowships based on race until lawsuits forced
        change.
-   Perkins Coie LLP hosted an FBI workspace, raising concerns about
    partisan misuse of sensitive data during investigations targeting
    President Trump.
-   Perkins Coie LLP has filed lawsuits against the Trump
    Administration, including one designed to reduce military readiness.

**A RETURN TO ACCOUNTABILITY:** President Trump is delivering on his
promise to end the weaponization of government and protect the nation
from partisan actors who exploit their influence.  

-   President Trump is refocusing government operations to their core
    mission—serving the citizens of the United States.  
-   President Trump signed an Executive Order to end the weaponization
    of the Federal Government on his first day in office after promising
    to “end forever the weaponization of government and the abuse of law
    enforcement against political opponents.”
-   President Trump revoked security clearances held by dozens of
    intelligence officials who falsely claimed in a 2020 letter, during
    the height of the U.S. presidential election season, that Hunter
    Biden’s laptop was tantamount to Russian disinformation.
