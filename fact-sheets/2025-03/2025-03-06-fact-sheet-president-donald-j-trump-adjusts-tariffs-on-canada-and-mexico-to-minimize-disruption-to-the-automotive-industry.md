title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Adjusts Tariffs on Canada and Mexico
  to Minimize Disruption to the Automotive Industry'
---
 
**USING LEVERAGE TO PROTECT AMERICANS:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump announced adjustments to tariffs imposed on imports from Canada
and Mexico in recognition of the structure of the automotive supply
chain that strives to bring production into America.

-   Duties imposed to address the flow of illicit drugs across our
    borders are now:
    -   25% tariffs on goods that do not satisfy U.S.-Mexico-Canada
        Agreement (USMCA) rules of origin.

    <!-- -->

    -   A lower 10% tariff on those energy products imported from Canada
        that fall outside the USMCA preference.

    <!-- -->

    -   A lower 10% tariff on any potash imported from Canada and Mexico
        that falls outside the USMCA preference.

    <!-- -->

    -   No tariffs on those goods from Canada and Mexico that claim and
        qualify for USMCA preference.
-   While the situations at our Northern and Southern borders continue
    to require appropriate action from the Governments of Canada and
    Mexico, our American automotive industry, which provides American
    jobs, should not suffer significant disruption just because of the
    structure of its supply chain.  
      

**ENSURING BORDER SECURITY AND ECONOMIC SECURITY**: President Trump will
not allow our national security to be compromised by our closest trading
partners, Canada and Mexico, but recognizes the unique impact that these
tariffs could have on American automotive manufacturers.

-   President Trump will never stop standing up for the safety of the
    American people and is using tariffs as a tool to take decisive
    actions that put Americans’ safety and our national security first. 
-   On Tuesday, March 4, tariffs were issued on Canada and Mexico under
    the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to curb the
    flow of illegal border crossings and drugs into our country.
-   In order to minimize disruption to the U.S. automotive industry and
    workers, it is appropriate to adjust the tariffs on articles of
    Canada and Mexico so that they do not bear a disproportionate brunt
    of Canada and Mexico’s failure to respond to the crises at our
    borders.
-   America’s manufacturers, including our automakers, have strengthened
    our economy and expanded our workforce.
-   Today’s actions promote a level playing field for American
    manufacturers, bringing supply chains closer to home, especially for
    our auto industry, which has been hit hard by offshoring.

**DEALMAKER-IN-CHIEF:** President Trump continues to leverage America’s
economic power to secure our border and stop the flow of fentanyl into
our country, while protecting American industry.

-   In November, President Trump promised that tariffs on Mexico and
    Canada would remain in effect until drugs and illegal aliens stop
    invading our country.
-   Following the President imposing tariffs on both countries, Mexico
    and Canada announced measures to combat illegal immigration and
    fentanyl trafficking.
-   President Trump secured the extradition of 29 Mexican drug cartel
    bosses to face charges for their crimes in the United States,
    including one accused of killing a DEA agent.
-   In President Trump’s first month in office, illegal border crossings
    plummeted to the lowest level ever recorded, down 96% from the
    all-time high under the Biden-Harris Administration.

As President Trump stated in the America First Trade Policy Presidential
Memorandum, trade policy is an integral component of our economic and
national security
