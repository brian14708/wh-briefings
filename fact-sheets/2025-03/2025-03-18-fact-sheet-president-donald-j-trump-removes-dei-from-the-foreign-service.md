title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Removes DEI From the Foreign Service'
---
 
**RESTORING THE VALUES OF INDIVIDUAL DIGNITY, HARD WORK, AND
EXCELLENCE:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed a memorandum
removing radical “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion” (DEI) from the
Foreign Service.

-   The memorandum directs the Secretary of State to remove the
    “Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility” Core Precept from
    Foreign Service tenure and promotion criteria.
-   It further directs that the U.S. government will not base Foreign
    Service recruitment, hiring, promotion, or retention decisions on an
    individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, nor
    embed discriminatory equity ideology within any element of the
    Foreign Service.
-   Relevant agencies shall identify and take appropriate action
    regarding any Foreign Service Officer who knowingly and willfully
    engaged in illegal discrimination.

**PUTTING MERIT FIRST:** President Trump believes that hiring in all
parts of government should be based solely on merit.

-   Under the previous administration, divisive and discriminatory
    policies were systematically embedded into every part of the State
    Department.
-   Biden’s State Department conditioned eligibility for promotions on
    an employee’s ability to pass a DEI loyalty test.
    -   In 2023, Biden’s Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer for the
        State Department, Gina Abercrombie-Winstanley, said: “We made
        the change that if you wanted to be considered for promotion at
        the Department of State, you must be able to document what you
        are doing to support diversity, equity and inclusion and
        accessibility. This is how you are judged for promotion.”
-   Biden’s State Department published a “Five-Year Diversity, Equity,
    Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) Strategic Plan” that included a
    department-wide “DEIA Climate Survey” and implemented a
    comprehensive recruitment plan to aggressively target so-called
    “underrepresented groups.”
-   Foreign policy positions should be filled by the most qualified
    individuals, not by discriminatory quotas or ideological
    requirements.

**SERVING AMERICA, NOT IDEOLOGICAL AGENDAS:** President Trump is
restoring fairness and accountability in federal hiring, and terminating
DEI across the federal government.

-   In his first week in office, President Trump signed an Executive
    Order restoring merit-based hiring and promotions across the federal
    government.
-   President Trump also signed an Executive Order ending radical and
    wasteful DEI programs and preferencing.
-   President Trump: “We will terminate every diversity, equity, and
    inclusion program across the entire federal government.”
