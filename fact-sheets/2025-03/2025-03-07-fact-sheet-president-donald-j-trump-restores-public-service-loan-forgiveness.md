title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Restores Public Service Loan Forgiveness'
---
 
**ALIGNING PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS WITH ACTUAL PUBLIC SERVICE:**
Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to end
taxpayer-funded student loan forgiveness for anti-American activists. 

-   The Order directs the Secretary of Education to revise the Public
    Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program to exclude from eligibility
    organizations that engage in activities that have a substantial
    illegal purpose.
-   It stops taxpayer funds from subsidizing through loan forgiveness
    activities that advance illegal immigration, terrorism, child abuse,
    discrimination, and public disruptions.
-   It refocuses PSLF on its original intent of encouraging Americans to
    enter essential public service roles, such as nursing, rather than
    activist groups.
-   It protects national security and American values by ending federal
    support for organizations that harm American values and the public
    interest.

**CORRECTING THE ABUSE OF THIS FORGIVENESS PROGRAM BY THE PRIOR
ADMINISTRATION:** President Trump believes that organizations whose
activities have a substantial illegal purpose shall not be eligible for
public service loan forgiveness.

-   The PSLF program was created in 2007 to encourage Americans to enter
    critical public service jobs by forgiving the student loans of those
    who take such jobs after 10 years of service and loan payments.
-   The current eligibility rules allow people working for
    non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that advance illegal
    immigration, terrorism, discrimination, and violent protests to
    obtain taxpayer-funded loan forgiveness.
    -   The Biden Administration was accused of using the student loan
        forgiveness program to pay pro-Palestinian and pro-Hamas
        activists and criminals with taxpayer dollars.
-   Further, the prior administration’s waiver process misused taxpayer
    funds to forgive loans years early.
    -   Biden made immediate forgiveness available for people who didn’t
        pay the full amount, didn’t pay on time, or didn’t even enroll
        in the right repayment plan.
-   Prior to Biden taking office, PSLF had forgiven debt for just 7,000
    borrowers, but Biden ballooned this program to erase student loans
    for over 1 million borrowers.
-   This abuse has increased the cost of tuition, burdened students with
    debt, and encouraged them to join organizations that undermine
    national security and the societal good.
-   This Executive Order corrects this abuse by ensuring only legitimate
    public servants benefit, not those engaged in illegal or harmful
    activities.

**STOPPING TAXPAYER DOLLARS FROM FUNDING RADICAL AGENDAS:** President
Trump is ensuring American values guide the use of taxpayer funds.

-   By signing this Executive Order, President Trump continues to
    fulfill his promise to halt taxpayer funding of radical agendas.

This action builds on others he has taken in his second term to align
taxpayer dollars with American values, including by terminating radical
“diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI) preferences in federal
contracting, reinstating the Mexico City Policy to stop federal funding
of abortion overseas, and ending radical indoctrination in K-12
schooling.
