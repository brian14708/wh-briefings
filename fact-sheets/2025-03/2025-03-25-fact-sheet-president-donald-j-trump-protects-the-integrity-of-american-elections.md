**RESTORING TRUST IN AMERICAN ELECTIONS:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed an Executive Order to protect the integrity of American
elections.

-   This Order strengthens voter citizenship verification and bans
    foreign nationals from interfering in U.S. elections.
    -   The Election Assistance Commission will require documentary,
        government-issued proof of U.S. citizenship on its voter
        registration forms.

    <!-- -->

    -   Agencies like the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Social
        Security Administration and Department of State must provide
        states with access to Federal databases to verify eligibility
        and citizenship of individuals registering to vote.

    <!-- -->

    -   The Attorney General will prioritize prosecuting non-citizen
        voting and related crimes, including through use of DHS records
        and coordination with state attorneys general.
-   Federal election-related funds will be conditioned on states
    complying with the integrity measures set forth by Federal law,
    including the requirement that states use the national mail voter
    registration form that will now require proof of citizenship.
-   The Order improves the integrity of elections by directing the
    updating of the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines 2.0 and security
    standards for voting equipment and prioritizing federal grant funds
    accordingly.
    -   This includes requiring a voter-verifiable paper ballot record
        and not using ballots in which the counted vote is contained
        within a barcode or QR code.
-   It directs the Attorney General to enter into information-sharing
    agreements with state election officials to identify cases of
    election fraud or other election law violations.
    -   Non-compliant states may face prioritized Federal enforcement of
        election integrity laws and loss of funding given their
        unwillingness to police fraud.
-   The Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security shall
    prevent non-citizens from any involvement in administering
    elections.
-   The Attorney General will fully enforce the voter-list maintenance
    requirements of the National Voter Registration Act and the Help
    America Vote Act.
-   Given clear Federal law setting a single Election Day deadline, the
    Attorney General shall take appropriate action against states that
    count ballots received after Election Day in Federal elections.
    Federal election funding will be conditioned on compliance.
-   The Attorney General will prioritize enforcement of laws prohibiting
    foreign nationals from contributing to or donating in U.S.
    elections.
-   All agencies must report on compliance with undoing Biden Executive
    Order 14019, which turned Federal agencies into Democratic voter
    turnout centers.

**SAFEGUARDING THE VOTE:** President Trump recognizes that free, fair,
and honest elections—unmarred by fraud, errors, or suspicion—are
essential to our Constitutional Republic.

-   The United States lags behind other nations in enforcing basic and
    necessary election protections.
    -   India and Brazil tie voter identification to a biometric
        database, while the United States largely relies on
        self-attestation for citizenship.

    <!-- -->

    -   Germany and Canada require paper ballots when tabulating votes,
        while the United States has a patchwork of methods that often
        lack basic chain-of-custody protections.

    <!-- -->

    -   Denmark and Sweden sensibly limit mail-in voting to those unable
        to vote in person—and late arrivals do not count—while American
        elections now feature mass voting by mail, even after Election
        Day.
-   Without proper enforcement of Federal laws, illegal voting,
    discrimination, fraud, and other forms of malfeasance and error
    dilute the votes of lawful American citizens.
-   Federal law establishes a uniform Election Day across the nation for
    Federal elections, but numerous states fail to comply with those
    laws by counting ballots received after Election Day.
-   The Biden Administration blocked states from removing aliens from
    voter rolls, while foreign nationals and non-governmental
    organizations (NGOs) exploited loopholes to pour millions into
    influencing U.S. elections.

**MAKING ELECTIONS SECURE AGAIN:** Voters deserve elections they can
trust, and that confidence is being restored thanks to President Trump. 

-   President Trump is following through on his promise to secure our
    elections.
    -   President Trump: “We’re going to fix our elections so that our
        elections are going to be honorable and honest and people leave
        and they know their vote is counted. We are going to have free
        and fair elections. And ideally, we go to paper ballots,
        same-day voting, proof of citizenship, very big, and voter ID,
        very simple.”

    <!-- -->

    -   President Trump: “We will secure our elections, and they will be
        secure once and for all.”
-   Unlike the Biden Administration, which prioritized political agendas
    over fair elections, President Trump is putting the American people
    back in charge.
