title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Addresses Risks from Paul Weiss'
---
 
**SUSPENDING SECURITY CLEARANCES TO PROTECT THE NATIONAL INTEREST:**
Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to suspend
security clearances held by individuals at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton
& Garrison LLP (Paul Weiss) pending a review of whether such clearances
are consistent with the national interest.

-   Security clearances held by Paul Weiss employees and Mark Pomerantz
    will be immediately suspended, pending a review of whether their
    access to sensitive information is consistent with the national
    interest.
    -   The Federal Government will halt all material and services,
        including sensitive compartmented information facility (SCIF)
        access provided to Paul Weiss and restrict its employees’ access
        to government buildings.

    <!-- -->

    -   Federal Agencies will also refrain from hiring Paul Weiss
        employees unless specifically authorized.
-   To ensure taxpayer dollars no longer go to contractors whose
    earnings subsidize activities not aligned with American interests,
    the Federal Government will terminate contracts that involve Paul
    Weiss.
-   The practices of Paul Weiss will be reviewed under Title VII to
    ensure compliance with civil rights laws against racial bias.

**SAFEGUARDING TAXPAYER FUNDS:** The Trump Administration will no longer
support taxpayer funds from sponsoring activities that make our
communities less safe, increase burdens on local businesses, limit
constitutional freedoms, and degrade the quality of American elections.

-   Paul Weiss hired unethical attorney Mark Pomerantz, who had
    previously left the firm to join the Manhattan District Attorney’s
    office solely to manufacture a prosecution against President Trump.
    -   According to his coworkers, Pomerantz had unethically led
        witnesses in ways designed to implicate President Trump.

    <!-- -->

    -   After being unable to convince Manhattan District Attorney Alvin
        Bragg that a fraud case was feasible, Pomerantz engaged in a
        media campaign to gin up support for this unwarranted
        prosecution.
-   Paul Weiss has been accused of discriminating against its own
    employees on the basis of race and other categories prohibited by
    civil rights laws.

**ENDING THE WEAPONIZATION OF GOVERNMENT:** President Trump is
delivering on his promise to end the weaponization of government and
protect the nation from partisan actors who exploit their influence.  

-   President Trump is refocusing government operations to their core
    mission—serving the citizens of the United States.  
-   President Trump signed an Executive Order to end the weaponization
    of the Federal Government on his first day in office after promising
    to “end forever the weaponization of government and the abuse of law
    enforcement against political opponents.”
-   President Trump revoked security clearances held by dozens of
    intelligence officials who falsely claimed in a 2020 letter, during
    the height of the U.S. presidential election season, that Hunter
    Biden’s laptop was tantamount to Russian disinformation.
