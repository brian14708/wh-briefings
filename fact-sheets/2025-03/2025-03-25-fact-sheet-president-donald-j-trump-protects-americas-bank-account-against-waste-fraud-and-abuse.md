**PROMOTING FINANCIAL INTEGRITY AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order promoting financial
integrity, transparency, and efficiency by improving the Department of
the Treasury’s ability to screen for improper payments and fraud, track
transactions, and manage the Government’s disbursements.

-   The Order directs the Department of the Treasury to update guidance
    and enhance systems across the Federal Government to ensure that all
    payments made on behalf of agencies undergo pre-certification
    verification to prevent fraud and improper payments.
    -   In order for Treasury to disburse funds, agency heads must
        comply with Treasury disbursement requirements, which include
        ensuring that sufficient funds are available before obligations
        are incurred, verifying payee information, standardizing
        information reporting formats, confirming funds are being
        disbursed from appropriate sources, and implementing other
        verification and certification measures.
-   Agencies must share relevant data with Treasury to enhance
    Treasury’s ability to detect and prevent fraud, subject to
    applicable law.
-   Agencies will consolidate core financial systems, including for
    non-CFO Act agencies, consolidating transactional financial
    management services under standardized solutions to improve
    financial reporting and traceability.
-   Non-Treasury Disbursing Offices (NTDOs) will be reduced as
    appropriate, with Treasury developing a plan to centralize and
    manage payments previously handled by NTDOs.

**MANAGING TAXPAYER FUNDS RESPONSIBLY:** President Trump recognizes that
financial fraud threatens the integrity of Federal programs and
undermines trust in government.  

-   The Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimates the Federal
    Government loses up to $521 billion annually to fraud due to
    inadequate data and outdated systems.
-   The Treasury is responsible for safeguarding the General Fund
    (sometimes referred to as “America’s Bank Account”) but currently
    lacks sufficient controls to track transactions flowing through it.
    -   Fragmented disbursing authority, with NTDOs handing 22% of
        Federal payments, creates duplicative reporting and diminishes
        Treasury’s ability to provide centralized oversight.
-   The Federal Government’s longstanding challenges when it comes to
    accessing accurate data across agencies has prevented it from more
    fully safeguarding taxpayer dollars against fraud and improper
    payments.
-   Transitioning to centralized systems and ensuring basic
    pre-certification and verification measures before funds are
    disbursed will enhance security and improve efficiency in managing
    Federal funds.

**SAFEGUARDING AGAINST WASTE, FRAUD, AND ABUSE:** Since Day One,
President Trump has been steadfast in his commitment to get rid of
waste, fraud, and abuse across the Federal Government.

President Trump implemented a cost efficiency initiative to ensure
government contracts and grants are held to rigorous standards.

President Trump established the “Department of Government Efficiency” to
examine how to streamline the operations of the Federal Government,
eliminate unnecessary programs, and reduce bureaucratic inefficiency.

President Trump launched a 10-to-1 deregulation initiative, ensuring
every new Federal rule is justified by clear benefits.

President Trump reduced unnecessarily large scopes of governmental
entities and terminated numerous harmful Biden executive actions.
