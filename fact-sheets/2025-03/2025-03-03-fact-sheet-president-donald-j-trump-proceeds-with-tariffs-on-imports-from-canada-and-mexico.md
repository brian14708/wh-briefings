title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Proceeds with Tariffs on Imports from
  Canada and Mexico'
---
 
**SAFEGUARDING THE NATION:** President Donald J. Trump is proceeding
with implementing tariffs on Canada and Mexico under the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to combat the extraordinary threat
to U.S. national security, including our public health posed by
unchecked drug trafficking.

-   While President Trump gave both Canada and Mexico ample opportunity
    to curb the dangerous cartel activity and influx of lethal drugs
    flowing into our country, they have failed to adequately address the
    situation.
-   The flow of contraband drugs like fentanyl into the United States,
    through illicit distribution networks, has created a national
    emergency, including a public health crisis.
-   Mexican drug trafficking organizations, the world’s leading fentanyl
    traffickers, operate unhindered due to an intolerable relationship
    with the government of Mexico.
    -   The government of Mexico has afforded safe havens for the
        cartels to engage in the manufacturing and transportation of
        dangerous narcotics, which collectively have led to the overdose
        deaths of hundreds of thousands of American victims.
    -   Mexican drug cartels are known for extreme brutality,
        corruption, and control over entire regions of Mexico.
    -   The Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels manufacture fentanyl in
        clandestine labs they oversee in Mexico, in both powder form and
        pressed into fake pills, and traffic it into the United States
        through the many entry points they control. 97% of seizures
        occur at the U.S.-Mexico border.
    -   Cartel violence, including armed drones and roadside IEDs, are
        coming in closer and closer proximity to the U.S.-Mexico border
        as cartels are more actively targeting one another as well as
        Mexican military and law enforcement personnel.
    -   This alliance with the Mexican government endangers the national
        security of the United States, and we must eradicate the
        influence of these dangerous cartels.
-   There is also a growing presence of Mexican cartels operating
    fentanyl and nitazene synthesis labs in Canada. 
    -   A recent study recognized Canada’s heightened domestic
        production of fentanyl, and its growing footprint within
        international narcotics distribution.
    -   Canada-based drug trafficking organizations maintain robust
        “super labs,” mostly in rural and dense areas in western Canada,
        some of which can produce 44 to 66 pounds of fentanyl weekly.
    -   Last year’s northern border fentanyl seizures, though smaller
        than Mexico’s, could kill 9.5 million Americans due to the
        drug’s potency—proof of Canada’s growing role in this crisis.
    -   Fentanyl seizures at the northern border in the first four
        months of this fiscal year are quickly closing in on what was
        seized the entirety of  fiscal year 2022.
-   Both nations’ failure to arrest traffickers, seize drugs, or
    coordinate with U.S. law enforcement constitutes an unusual and
    extraordinary threat to America’s security—demanding IEEPA action to
    force accountability and protect American lives.

**PRESIDENT TRUMP IS KEEPING HIS PROMISE TO STOP THE FLOOD OF ILLEGAL
ALIENS AND DRUGS:** When voters overwhelmingly elected Donald J. Trump
as President, they gave him a mandate to seal the border. That is
exactly what he is doing.

-   The Biden Administration’s policies fueled the worst border crisis
    in U.S. history.
    -   More than 10 million illegal aliens attempted to enter the
        United States under Biden’s leadership.
    -   This problem is not confined to the southern border—encounters
        at the northern border with Canada are rising as well.
    -   The sustained influx of illegal aliens has profound consequences
        on every aspect of our national life—overwhelming our schools,
        lowering our wages, reducing our housing supply and raising
        rents, overcrowding our hospitals, draining our welfare system,
        and causing crime.  
    -   Gang members, smugglers, human traffickers, and illegal drugs
        and narcotics of all kinds are pouring across our borders and
        into our communities. 
        -   Last fiscal year, Customs and Border Protection (CBP)
            apprehended more than 21,000 pounds of fentanyl at our
            borders, enough fentanyl to kill more than 4 billion people.
        -   Since 2023, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has
            seized more than 25,697 kilograms of fentanyl pills and more
            than 7,272 kilograms of fentanyl powder at the southern
            border, and more than 659 kilograms of fentanyl pills and
            more than 650 kilograms of fentanyl powder at the northern
            border.
        -   From 2021 to present, fentanyl has been the leading cause of
            drug overdose deaths in the U.S., followed by
            methamphetamine, cocaine, and heroin in that order.
        -   According to the CDC, 68 percent of all drug poisoning
            deaths in 2022 and 2023—216,294 total—were caused by
            synthetic opioids, primarily fentanyl.
        -   It is estimated that federal officials are only able to
            seize a fraction of the fentanyl smuggled across the
            southern border.  
        -   More Americans are dying from fentanyl overdoses each year
            than the number of American lives lost in the entirety of
            the Vietnam War.

**BUILDING ON PAST SUCCESS:** President Trump continues to demonstrate
his commitment to ensuring U.S. trade policy serves the national
interest.

-   As President Trump said in the Presidential Memorandum on American
    First Trade Policy, trade policy is a critical component in national
    security.
-   President Trump promised in November to “sign all necessary
    documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products
    coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders. This
    Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular
    Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!”
-   During his first term as President of the United States, President
    Trump established the President’s Commission on Combating Drug
    Addiction and the Opioid Crisis and declared the Opioid Crisis a
    public health emergency.
-   President Trump also has a long record of putting America first on
    trade. In his first term, President Trump successfully used threats
    of tariffs on Mexico to help secure our border.
-   When our national security was threatened by a global oversupply of
    steel and aluminum, President Trump took swift action to protect
    America’s national security by implementing tariffs on imports of
    these goods.
