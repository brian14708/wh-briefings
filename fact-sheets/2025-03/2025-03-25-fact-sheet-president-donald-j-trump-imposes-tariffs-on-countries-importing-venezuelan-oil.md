title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Imposes Tariffs on Countries Importing
  Venezuelan Oil'
---
 
**PROTECTING UNITED STATES NATIONAL SECURITY:** Yesterday, President
Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order imposing tariffs on countries
that import Venezuelan oil.

-   President Trump is levying a 25% tariff on all goods from any
    country that imports Venezuelan oil, whether directly from Venezuela
    or indirectly through third parties.
-   The tariffs will lapse one year after a country ceases importing
    Venezuelan oil—or sooner if officials deem it appropriate.
-   If tariffs are imposed on China, they will also apply to Hong Kong
    and Macau to prevent transshipment and evasion.
-   These tariffs aim to sever the financial lifelines of Nicolás
    Maduro’s corrupt regime and curb its destabilizing influence across
    the Western Hemisphere.
-   This action targets transnational criminal threats, such as the Tren
    de Aragua gang, and addresses the humanitarian crises fueled by
    Venezuela’s actions.

**ADDRESSING AN EMERGENCY SITUATION:** The Maduro regime poses an
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign
policy of the United States.

-   The Maduro regime systemically undermines democratic institutions by
    suppressing free and fair elections and consolidating power
    illegitimately.
-   Venezuela’s endemic corruption and mismanagement under Maduro have
    crushed its people and triggered a regional humanitarian and public
    health crisis.
-   Millions of Venezuelans have fled Maduro’s oppressive rule, imposing
    significant burdens on neighboring countries and destabilizing the
    Western Hemisphere.
-   The Maduro regime has aided and facilitated the infiltration of the
    Tren de Aragua gang—a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization—into
    the United States by failing to secure its borders, allowing the
    gang to flourish within Venezuela, and refusing to take action
    against its members.
    -   These dangerous criminals exploited the previous
        administration’s open-border policies, establishing a foothold
        in U.S. communities and preying on American citizens through
        violent acts, including kidnapping, assault, and murder.

**USING OUR LEVERAGE TO SAFEGUARD OUR INTERESTS:** President Trump is
using America’s economic might to safeguard our interests and punish
those who support Maduro’s regime.

-   Tariffs are a powerful, proven source of leverage for protecting the
    national interest.
-   President Trump is sending a clear message that access to our
    economy is a privilege, not a right, and countries importing
    Venezuelan oil will face consequences.
-   As President Trump said in the Presidential Memorandum on American
    First Trade Policy, trade policy is a critical component in national
    security.
-   President Trump has successfully used tariffs in the past to advance
    America’s interests and address urgent national security threats and
    is doing so again today.
