title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Addresses the Threat to National Security
  from Imports of Timber, Lumber, and their Derivative Products'
---
 
**SECURING AMERICA’S LUMBER SUPPLY:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order launching an investigation into how imports of
timber, lumber, and their derivative products threaten America’s
national security and economic stability.

-   The Order directs the Secretary of Commerce to initiate a Section
    232 investigation under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.
-   This investigation will assess the national security risks arising
    from the United States’ increasing dependence on imported timber,
    lumber, and derivative products like paper, furniture, and
    cabinetry, and the potential need for trade remedies to safeguard
    domestic industry.
-   The investigation will culminate in a report identifying
    vulnerabilities in the lumber supply chain and providing
    recommendations to enhance the resilience of America’s domestic wood
    products industry.

**ADDRESSING THE THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY:** President Trump
recognizes that an overreliance on foreign timber, lumber, and their
derivative products could jeopardize the United States’ defense
capabilities, construction industry, and economic strength.

-   Timber and lumber are essential materials for national security,
    economic stability, and industrial resilience.
    -   Lumber plays a vital role in civilian construction and military
        infrastructure.

    -   The U.S. military spends over ten billion dollars annually on
        construction and is testing innovative wood products such as
        cross-laminated timber.
-   The United States has been a net importer of lumber since 2016,
    despite having the practical production capacity to supply 95% of
    the United States’ 2024 softwood consumption.
-   Foreign supply chains and major exporters increasingly fill U.S.
    demand, creating vulnerabilities to disruptions.
-   America’s reliance on imported lumber is exacerbated by foreign
    government subsidies and predatory trade practices, which undermine
    the competitiveness of the U.S. wood products industry.

**STRENGTHENING AMERICAN INDUSTRY:** This Executive Order builds on
previous actions taken by the Trump Administration to ensure U.S. trade
policy serves the nation’s long-term interests.

-   On Day One, President Trump initiated his America First Trade Policy
    to make America’s economy great again.
-   President Trump signed proclamations to close existing loopholes and
    exemptions in order to restore a true 25% tariff on steel and
    elevate the tariff to 25% on aluminum.
-   President Trump implemented a 10% additional tariff on imports from
    China in response to China’s role in importing illegal drugs to the
    United States.  
-   President Trump unveiled the “Fair and Reciprocal Plan” on trade to
    restore fairness in U.S. trade relationships and counter
    non-reciprocal trade agreements.   
-   President Trump signed a memorandum to safeguard American
    innovation, including the consideration of tariffs to combat digital
    service taxes (DSTs), fines, practices, and policies that foreign
    governments levy on American companies.
-   President Trump launched a Section 232 investigation into how copper
    imports threaten America’s national security and economic stability.
