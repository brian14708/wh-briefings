title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Empowers Parents, States, and Communities
  to Improve Education Outcomes'
---
 
**RETURNING EDUCATION TO PARENTS AND COMMUNITIES**: Today, President
Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order returning power over education
to families instead of bureaucracies.

-   The Executive Order directs the Secretary of Education to take all
    necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of
    Education and return education authority to the States, while
    continuing to ensure the effective and uninterrupted delivery of
    services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.
-   The Order also directs that programs or activities receiving any
    remaining Department of Education funds will not advance DEI or
    gender ideology.

**DISMANTLING BUREAUCRACY AND EMPOWERING FAMILIES**: Federal government
control of education has failed students, parents, and teachers.

-   Since its relatively recent inception in 1979, the Department of
    Education, which does not directly educate students, has spent over
    $3 trillion without improving student achievement as measured by
    standardized National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)
    scores.
    -   Federal taxpayers spent around $200 billion in additional
        education funding during COVID-19, which, given the substantial
        learning loss that resulted, typifies the ineffectiveness of the
        current federally driven model.
-   Mathematics and reading scores are down in public schools, despite
    per-pupil spending having increased by more than 245% since the
    1970s, indicating that more spending does not mean better education.
    -   13-year-olds’ mathematics scores are the lowest they have been
        in decades.

    <!-- -->

    -   13-year-olds’ reading scores are the lowest since testing began
        over 30 years ago.

    <!-- -->

    -   Low-performing students are falling further behind.

    <!-- -->

    -   In 2023, 13 Baltimore, Maryland, high schools had zero students
        who tested proficient in mathematics.
-   The Department of Education burdens schools with regulations and
    paperwork.
    -   Its “Dear Colleague” letters have forced schools to redirect
        resources toward complying with ideological initiatives, which
        diverts staff time and attention away from schools’ primary role
        of teaching.

    <!-- -->

    -   Biden’s Department of Education added rules that imposed nearly
        $3.9 billion in costs and 4,239,530 paperwork hours.
-   Taxpayers will no longer be burdened with tens of billions of
    dollars wasted on progressive social experiments and obsolete
    programs.
    -   Under the Biden Administration, the Department of Education
        wasted more than $1 billion in grants focused on entrenching
        radical ideologies in education.

    <!-- -->

    -   Biden’s Department of Education rewrote Title IX rules to expand
        the definition of “sex” discrimination to include “gender
        identity.”

    <!-- -->

    -   The Trump Administration recently canceled $226 million in
        grants under the Comprehensive Centers Program that forced
        radical agendas onto states and systems, including race-based
        discrimination and gender identity ideology.

**FULFILLING PROMISES TO PARENTS AND STUDENTS**: President Trump has
outlined a bold vision for America’s schools and returning education
back to the states.

-   During his campaign, President Trump said “I will close the
    Department of Education and move education back to the states where
    it belongs.” 
-   While speaking on parental rights in education, President Trump
    spoke of a dramatic rethinking of schools: “I want every parent in
    America to be empowered to send their child to public, private,
    charter, or faith-based school of their choice. The time for
    universal school choice has come. As we return education to the
    states, I will use every power I have to give parents this right.”
-   Since returning to office, President Trump has already signed an
    Executive Order to expand educational freedom and opportunity for
    families, recognizing our government-assigned education system has
    failed millions of parents, students, and teachers.
