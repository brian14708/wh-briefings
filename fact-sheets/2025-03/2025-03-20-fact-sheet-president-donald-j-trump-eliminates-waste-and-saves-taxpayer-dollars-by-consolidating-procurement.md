title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Eliminates Waste and Saves Taxpayer
  Dollars by Consolidating Procurement'
---
 
**CONSOLIDATING PROCUREMENT: ** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed
an Executive Order consolidating federal procurement for common goods
and services in the General Services Administration (GSA)—the agency
designed to conduct procurement—which will eliminate waste,
inefficiencies, and duplication and enable agencies to focus on their
core mission of delivering excellent services to the American people.

-   Since January 20th, 2025, GSA has coordinated the termination or
    economization of over 6,000 contracts across the federal
    government.  This Executive Order expands upon those efforts by
    directing:
    -   Agency Heads to submit proposals to GSA for consolidating
        domestic procurement functions for common goods and services
        within GSA, the agency with expertise in such procurement.

    <!-- -->

    -   GSA and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to develop a
        comprehensive plan for consolidating common goods and services
        procurement across the government to eliminate waste and
        duplication, while delivering the best possible services to the
        American people. 

    <!-- -->

    -   Agencies to designate GSA as the executive agent for the
        administration of government-wide acquisition contracts.

**RESTORING COMMON SENSE TO ACQUISITION:** President Trump believes that
a streamlined, centralized approach to procurement is essential to
ensuring taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and efficiently.

-   The government spends about $490 billion per year on federal
    contracts for common goods and services, making it the largest buyer
    of goods and services in the world.
-   For too long, agencies have independently purchased office
    productivity software, leading to numerous challenges and
    inefficiencies, including pricing inconsistencies.
    -   For example, the cost of a comprehensive suite of Microsoft
        Office 365 services could vary between agencies by more than
        $200 per license.

    <!-- -->

    -   Consolidating the acquisition of this software in GSA could
        result in more than $100M in savings per year. 
-   Agencies buy a wide range of common goods like band saw blades and
    televisions, which could be centralized in GSA and result in major
    savings for the American taxpayer.
    -   For a 32-7/8″ band saw blade, GSA’s average purchase price is
        22% lower than that available through other government
        procurement vehicles and on the commercial market.

    <!-- -->

    -   For a 50-inch flat screen TV, GSA’s average purchase price is
        20% lower than that available through other government
        procurement vehicles, and almost 30% lower than commercial
        market pricing.
-   The federal government routinely handles sensitive information and
    buys identity protection services to prevent and respond to data
    breaches—however, these are purchased in a decentralized manner,
    leading to inconsistent pricing and underutilization of volume-based
    discounts.
    -   GSA has an established purchasing solution that channels
        government-wide demand and saved $150 million in FY 24 alone.
-   Every government agency needs to purchase computers for their
    employees to effectively serve the American people, totaling well
    over $1 billion annually.
    -   Over the last 10 years, almost $6 billion has gone through GSA,
        which realizes an average savings rate of 38%.

    <!-- -->

    -   While NASA, NIH, Army, and GSA have set up a program to
        establish minimum computer standards and leverage the volume of
        government purchasing to achieve savings, not every agency has
        taken advantage of the program to reduce their costs.
-   Centralizing and standardizing procurement will make purchasing as
    simple and efficient as possible.   
-   Using the aforementioned savings examples as a proxy, a 10%
    reduction in spending through this consolidation initiative could
    result in approximately $50 billion in savings to the taxpayers per
    year.

**ELIMINATING WASTE:** Since Day One, President Trump has been laser
focused on eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal
government.

-   This Executive Order builds on his administration’s broader
    commitment to fiscal responsibility, cutting unnecessary
    bureaucratic bloat and redirecting resources to priorities that
    directly benefit the American people.
-   President Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has
    already identified more than $100 billion in estimated savings from
    a “combination of asset sales, contract/lease cancellations and
    renegotiations, fraud and improper payment deletion, grant
    cancellations, interest savings, programmatic changes, regulatory
    savings, and workforce reductions.”
