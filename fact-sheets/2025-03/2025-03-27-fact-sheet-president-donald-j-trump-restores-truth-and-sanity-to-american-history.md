title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Restores Truth and Sanity to American
  History'
---
 
**RESTORING TRUTH IN AMERICAN HISTORY:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed an Executive Order restoring truth and sanity to American
history by revitalizing key cultural institutions and reversing the
spread of divisive ideology.

-   President Trump aims to ensure that the Smithsonian is an
    institution that sparks children’s imagination, celebrates American
    history and ingenuity, serves as a symbol to the world of American
    greatness, and makes America proud.
    -   The Order directs the Vice President, who is a member of the
        Smithsonian Board of Regents, to work to eliminate improper,
        divisive, or anti-American ideology from the Smithsonian and its
        museums, education and research centers, and the National Zoo.

    <!-- -->

    -   The Order directs the Administration to work with Congress to
        ensure that future Smithsonian appropriations: (1) prohibit
        funding for exhibits or programs that degrade shared American
        values, divide Americans by race, or promote ideologies
        inconsistent with Federal law; and (2) celebrate women’s
        achievements in the American Women’s History Museum and do not
        recognize men as women.

    <!-- -->

    -   The Vice President will work with congressional leaders to
        appoint members to the Smithsonian Board of Regents who are
        committed to advancing the celebration of America’s
        extraordinary heritage and progress.
-   The Order also directs the Secretary of the Interior restore Federal
    parks, monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties
    that have been improperly removed or changed in the last five years
    to perpetuate a false revision of history or improperly minimize or
    disparage certain historical figures or events.
-   In preparation for the 250<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the signing
    of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 2026, the Order
    directs the Secretary of the Interior to complete restorations and
    improvements to Independence Hall by that date.

**COMBATING CORROSIVE IDEOLOGY:** In the last decade, Americans have
witnessed a concerted effort to rewrite American history and force our
nation to adopt a factually baseless ideology aimed at diminishing
American achievement. President Trump is fighting back by reestablishing
truth in the historical narrative and restoring Federal sites dedicated
to American heritage.

-   The prior administration pushed a divisive ideology that reconstrued
    America’s promotion of liberty as fundamentally flawed, infecting
    revered institutions like the Smithsonian and national parks with
    false narratives.
-   At Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, the Biden
    Administration sponsored training by an organization that advocates
    for dismantling “Western foundations” and that taught Park Rangers
    that their racial identity should dictate how they present history
    to visitors.
-   The Smithsonian Institution—once revered throughout the world as a
    symbol of American excellence—has recently promoted divisive
    ideology that American and Western values are harmful.
    -   The American Art Museum currently features an exhibit that
        purports to address how “sculpture has been a powerful tool in
        promoting scientific racism” and claims that the United States
        has “used race to establish and maintain systems of power,
        privilege, and disenfranchisement.”

    <!-- -->

    -   The National Museum of African American History and Culture has
        proclaimed that “hard work,” “individualism,” and “the nuclear
        family” are aspects of “White culture.”

    <!-- -->

    -   The American Women’s History Museum plans to celebrate male
        athletes participating in women’s sports.

**CELEBRATING AMERICAN GREATNESS:** President Trump is committed to
honoring America’s extraordinary heritage and building a sense of
national pride.

-   President Trump signed an Executive Order on his first day in office
    to establish a task force to prepare for America’s 250<sup>th</sup>
    birthday.
    -   This Order also protects America’s monuments from vandalism and
        calls for construction of the National Garden of American
        Heroes.
-   President Trump signed a memorandum ensuring Federal buildings
    reflect the timeless grandeur of traditional, classical
    architecture.
-   By signing this Executive Order, President Trump is ensuring that
    American history is celebrated accurately, fairly, and with
    pride—honoring the remarkable progress, liberty, and ingenuity that
    define our great nation.
