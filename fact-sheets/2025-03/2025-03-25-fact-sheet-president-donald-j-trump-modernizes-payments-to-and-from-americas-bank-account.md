**PHASING OUT PAPER CHECKS:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an
Executive Order to modernize how the government handles money, switching
from old-fashioned paper-based payments to fast, secure electronic
payments.

-   The Order mandates that, effective September 30, 2025, the Federal
    government will cease issuing paper checks for all disbursements,
    including intragovernmental payments, benefits, vendor payments, and
    tax refunds.
-   All executive departments and agencies must transition to modern,
    electronic funds transfer (EFT) methods like direct deposit,
    debit/credit card payments, digital wallets, and real-time
    transfers.
-   Payments made to the Federal government, such as fees, fines, loans,
    and taxes, must also be processed electronically where permissible
    under existing law.
-   Treasury will phase out physical lockbox services and expedite
    electronic collection of Federal receipts.
-   A comprehensive public awareness campaign will be launched to inform
    Federal payment recipients of the shift to electronic options and
    offer guidance on setting up digital payments.
-   Exceptions will be made for people without banking or electronic
    payment access, certain emergency payments, certain law enforcement
    activities, and other special cases qualifying for an exception
    under the Order or other existing law.
-   This Executive Order does not establish a Central Bank Digital
    Currency (CBDC).

**DEFENDING AGAINST FINANCIAL FRAUD AND IMPROPER PAYMENTS:** President
Trump is cracking down on waste, fraud, and abuse in government by
modernizing outdated paper-based payment systems that impose unnecessary
costs, delays, and security risks.

-   Paper-based payments, such as checks and money orders, impose
    unnecessary costs, delays, and risks of fraud, lost payments, theft,
    and inefficiencies.
-   Mail theft complaints have increased substantially since 2020.
-   Historically, Treasury checks are 16 times more likely to be
    reported lost or stolen, returned undeliverable, or altered than an
    electronic funds transfer.
-   Maintaining the physical infrastructure and specialized technology
    for digitizing paper records cost the American taxpayer over $657
    million in fiscal year 2024 alone.
-   Check fraud is becoming more common, with banks issuing about
    680,000 reports of check fraud in 2022 – nearly double the number
    from 2021.
-   Digital payments are more efficient, less costly, and less
    vulnerable to fraud.

**MODERNIZING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT:** President Trump is making
government work better for the American people.

President Trump has long championed the need for replacing outdated
technology, saying “government needs to catch up with the technology
revolution.”
