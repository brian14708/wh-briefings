  in the Entertainment Industry'

**SUPPORTING AMERICA’S LIVE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to protect fans from
exploitative ticket scalping and bring commonsense reforms to America’s
live entertainment ticketing industry.

-   The Order directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to:
    -   Work with the Attorney General to ensure that competition laws
        are appropriately enforced in the concert and entertainment
        industry.

    <!-- -->

    -   Rigorously enforce the Better Online Ticket Sales (BOTS) Act and
        promote its enforcement by state consumer protection
        authorities.

    <!-- -->

    -   Ensure price transparency at all stages of the ticket-purchase
        process, including the secondary ticketing market.

    <!-- -->

    -   Evaluate and, if appropriate, take enforcement action to prevent
        unfair, deceptive, and anti-competitive conduct in the secondary
        ticketing market.
-   The Order directs the Secretary of the Treasury and Attorney General
    to ensure that ticket scalpers are operating in full compliance with
    the Internal Revenue Code and other applicable law.
-   Treasury, the Department of Justice, and the FTC will also deliver a
    report within 180 days summarizing actions taken to address the
    issue of unfair practices in the live concert and entertainment
    industry and recommend additional regulations or legislation needed
    to protect consumers in this industry.

**ADDRESSING UNFAIR PRACTICES IN THE TICKET MARKETPLACE:** President
Trump is committed to making arts and entertainment that enrich
Americans’ lives as accessible as possible.

-   America’s live concert and entertainment industry has a total
    nationwide economic impact of $132.6 billion and supports 913,000
    jobs. But it has become blighted by unscrupulous middle-men who
    impose egregious fees on fans with no benefit to artists.
-   Ticket scalpers use bots and other unfair means to acquire large
    quantities of face-value tickets, then re-sell them at an enormous
    markup on the secondary market, price-gouging consumers and
    depriving fans of the opportunity to see their favorite artists
    without incurring extraordinary expenses.
    -   By some reports, fans have paid as much as 70 times the face
        value of a ticket price to obtain a ticket.

    <!-- -->

    -   When this occurs, the artists do not receive any additional
        profit—it goes solely to the scalper and the ticketing agency.
-   While the BOTS Act—meant to stop scalpers from using bots to
    purchase tickets—has been on the books for over 8 years, the FTC has
    only once taken action to enforce this law.

**PROTECTING AMERICAN CONSUMERS:** President Trump believes that
Americans shouldn’t be subjected to exploitative pricing and unfair
fees.

-   This Executive Order tackles an issue President Trump highlighted on
    the campaign trail, where he vowed to work on combating high ticket
    prices and described the current climate, where fans are priced out,
    as “very unfortunate.”
-   It builds on other actions President Trump has already taken since
    returning to office to protect American consumers.
    -   He terminated New York City’s congestion pricing scheme that
        hurt everyday Americans such as workers and small business
        owners. 

    <!-- -->

    -   He signed an Executive Order to empower patients with clear,
        accurate, and actionable healthcare pricing information.  

    <!-- -->

    -   He formally directed the whole administration to focus on price
        relief for American families to defeat the cost-of-living
        crisis.
