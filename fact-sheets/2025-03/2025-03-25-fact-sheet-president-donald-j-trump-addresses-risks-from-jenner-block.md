title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Addresses Risks from Jenner & Block'
---
 
**SUSPENDING SECURITY CLEARANCES TO PROTECT THE NATIONAL INTEREST:**
Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to suspend
security clearances held by individuals at Jenner & Block LLP (Jenner)
pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the
national interest.

-   Security clearances held by Jenner employees will be immediately
    suspended, pending a review of whether their access to sensitive
    information is consistent with the national interest.
    -   The Federal Government will halt all material and services,
        including sensitive compartmented information facility (SCIF)
        access provided to Jenner and restrict its employees’ access to
        government buildings.

    -   Federal Agencies will also refrain from hiring Jenner employees
        unless specifically authorized.
-   To ensure taxpayer dollars no longer go to contractors whose
    earnings subsidize activities not aligned with American interests,
    the Federal Government will terminate contracts that involve Jenner.
-   The practices of Jenner will be reviewed under Title VII to ensure
    compliance with civil rights laws against racial bias.

**ADDRESSING ROGUE LAW FIRMS:** President Trump believes that lawyers
and law firms that engage in conduct detrimental to critical American
interests should not be subsidized by American taxpayers or have access
to our Nation’s secrets.

-   Jenner pursues partisan goals, supports attacks against women and
    children based on the denial of the biological reality of sex, and
    backs the obstruction of efforts to prevent illegal aliens from
    committing horrific crimes and trafficking deadly drugs within our
    borders.
-   Jenner has been accused of discriminating against its own employees
    on the basis of race and other categories prohibited by civil rights
    laws, including through the use of race-based “targets.”
-   Jenner was also “thrilled” to re-hire Andrew Weissmann, a prosecutor
    known for his unethical behavior, including his role in engaging in
    partisan prosecution as part of Robert Mueller’s entirely
    unjustified investigation.
    -   Weissmann’s career has been rooted in weaponized government and
        abuse of power, including devastating tens of thousands of
        American families who worked for the now defunct Arthur Andersen
        LLP, only to have his unlawfully aggressive prosecution
        overturned by the Supreme Court. 

    <!-- -->

    -   The numerous reports of Weissman’s dishonesty, including pursuit
        of nonexistent crimes, bribery to foreign nationals, and overt
        demand that the federal government pursue a political agenda
        against President Trump, is a concerning indictment of Jenner’s
        values and priorities. 

**A RETURN TO ACCOUNTABILITY:** President Trump is delivering on his
promise to end the weaponization of government and protect the nation
from partisan and bad faith actors who exploit their influence. 

-   This Executive Order aligns with President Trump’s priority on
    refocusing government operations to serve the citizens of the United
    States.
-   It builds on President Trump’s previous actions, such as signing an
    Executive Order on his first day in office to end the weaponization
    of the Federal government and ensure accountability for past
    misconduct.
-   It follows his revocation of security clearances held by
    intelligence officials who falsely claimed Hunter Biden’s laptop was
    Russian disinformation during the 2020 election.
-   In addition to Jenner, President Trump has also taken action to hold
    other major law firms accountable.
