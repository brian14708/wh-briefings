title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Rescinds Additional Harmful Biden Executive
  Actions'
---
 
**RESTORING COMMON SENSE AND GOOD GOVERNANCE:** Today, President Donald
J. Trump signed an Executive Order rescinding a second round of harmful
executive actions issued by the prior administration, continuing his
efforts to reverse damaging policies and restore effective government.

-   This Executive Order rescinds 19 executive actions signed by
    President Biden.
    -   This is in addition to the nearly 80 executive actions President
        Trump rescinded on Day One.

    <!-- -->

    -   In just two months, President Trump has rescinded more executive
        actions than the total number of executive orders President
        Biden signed in his entire first year.
-   These rescissions are necessary to end radical ideology, eliminate
    wasteful regulations, and prioritize the interests of American
    citizens.
-   President Trump is committed to continuing the review and repeal of
    harmful Biden administration policies to usher in a new golden age
    for America.

**REVERSING BIDEN’S FAILED POLICIES:** President Trump’s latest action
targets some of Biden’s most damaging executive orders and policies,
including:

-   Rescinding Biden’s executive action that elevated radical gender
    ideology in U.S. diplomacy and foreign aid.
-   Eliminating Biden’s use of the Defense Production Act to push his
    Green New Scam, including mandates for electric heat pumps and solar
    panels.
-   Repealing Biden’s executive order forcing radical labor policies and
    apprenticeship mandates onto American businesses and government
    agencies.
-   Removing Biden’s directive to prioritize union-driven policies that
    imposed unnecessary regulations on industries.
-   Revoking Biden executive order that funneled Federal resources into
    radical biotech and biomanufacturing initiatives under the guise of
    environmental policy.

**PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DELIVERING ON HIS PROMISES:** With today’s
Executive Order, President Trump continues delivering on his promise to
reverse the disastrous policies of the previous administration and put
America back on a path to prosperity, security, and strength.

President Trump: “I can undo almost everything Biden did, he through
executive order. And on day one, much of that will be undone.”
