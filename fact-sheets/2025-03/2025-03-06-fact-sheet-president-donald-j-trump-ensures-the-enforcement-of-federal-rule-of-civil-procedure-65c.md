title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Ensures the Enforcement of Federal Rule
  of Civil Procedure 65(c)'

**ENSURING ACCOUNTABILITY IN FEDERAL COURTS:** Today, President Donald
J. Trump signed a memorandum directing federal agencies to enforce a
rule mandating financial guarantees from parties requesting injunctions.
This ensures coverage of potential costs or losses if the court later
deems an injunction wrongly issued.

-   The memorandum instructs agency heads, in consultation with the
    Attorney General, to request under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
    65(c) that federal courts require plaintiffs post security equal to
    the federal government’s potential costs and damages from a wrongly
    issued preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order.
    -   Security refers to a financial guarantee compensating the
        government for losses if an injunction is later found
        unjustified.
-   This applies to all lawsuits seeking preliminary injunctions or
    temporary restraining orders where the government can demonstrate
    monetary harm from the requested relief.
-   Agencies must justify security amounts based on reasoned assessments
    of harm, ensuring courts deny or dissolve injunctions if plaintiffs
    fail to pay up, absent good cause.

**STOPPING JUDICIAL OVERREACH AND FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS:** By issuing this
memorandum, President Trump is ensuring the democratic process remains
intact by curbing activist judges and holding litigants accountable.

-   Unelected district judges have issued sweeping injunctions beyond
    their authority, inserting themselves into executive policymaking
    and stalling policies voters supported.
-   Activist groups file meritless suits for fundraising and political
    gain, facing no consequences when they lose, while taxpayers bear
    the costs and delays.
-   The Justice Department is forced to divert resources from public
    safety to fight these frivolous cases, weakening effective
    governance.
-   Enforcing Rule 65(c) deters such litigation by holding plaintiffs
    accountable for costs and damages if their injunctions are baseless,
    protecting taxpayer funds and judicial integrity.

**STRENGTHENING AMERICA’S JUDICIAL SYSTEM:** President Trump is
committed to protecting our democracy, challenging judicial overreach,
and ensuring the rule of law is upheld.

-   Injunctions can cost taxpayers millions or even billions of dollars,
    especially when they mandate continued funding.
-   President Trump appointed high-performing “superstar” judges
    according to a respected study.  Trump’s judges occupied 9 of the
    top 11 spots for productivity, and 9 of the top 10 spots for
    influence.
-   President Trump’s judges are also rated the least partisan.
-   Multiple Supreme Court justices have recently warned that “single
    district-court judges” acting outside their judicial power are
    “abusing” the power entrusted to them.
