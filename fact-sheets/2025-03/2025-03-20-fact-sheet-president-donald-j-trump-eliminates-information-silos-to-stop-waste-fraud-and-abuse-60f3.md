  Waste, Fraud, and Abuse'

**STOPPING WASTE, FRAUD, AND ABUSE THROUGH DATA TRANSPARENCY:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order stopping waste,
fraud, and abuse by eliminating information silos.

-   Agency Heads are directed to grant full and prompt access of
    unclassified Agency records, data, and systems to Federal officials
    in order to identify and eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse.
    -   This includes authorizing and facilitating both the intra- and
        inter-Agency sharing and consolidation of unclassified Agency
        records.
-   Agency Heads must ensure immediate, unfettered access to
    comprehensive data from all state programs that receive federal
    funding, including third-party databases, to enhance oversight.
-   The Secretary of Labor will gain access to unemployment data and
    payment records to strengthen fraud detection efforts.
-   This Executive Order enhances accountability and streamlines
    government operations by ensuring Federal Agencies share critical
    data, consistent with applicable privacy protections.

**ELIMINATING BUREAUCRATIC INEFFICIENCY:** Decades of restricted data
access within and between agencies have led to duplicated efforts,
undetected overpayments, and unchecked fraud, costing taxpayers
billions**.**

-   The Biden Administration’s lack of transparency allowed waste to
    flourish, with billions lost annually to improper payments and
    fraudulent claims.
-   In fiscal year 2023, the Biden Administration reported an estimated
    $236 billion in improper payments as the result of overpayments,
    inaccurate recordkeeping, and fraud.
    -   74% of these errors were overpayments, including payments to
        deceased individuals.
-   The Biden Administration lost more than $925 billion total over four
    years to improper payments.
-   Over the last 20 years, the Federal Government has made an estimated
    $2.7 trillion in such improper payments. 
-   This Executive Order dismantles unnecessary barriers, promotes
    inter-agency collaboration, and ensure the Federal Government
    operates responsibly and efficiently to safeguard public funds.

**SHRINKING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT:** Since returning to office,
President Trump has moved swiftly to fulfill his promise of a leaner,
more effective government.

-   On Day One, President Trump established the “Department of
    Government Efficiency” (DOGE) to examine how to streamline the
    Federal Government, eliminate unnecessary programs, and reduce
    bureaucratic inefficiency.
-   President Trump directed a hiring freeze across federal agencies and
    limited new hires to one for every four departures.
-   President Trump eliminated unnecessary agencies and government
    programs.
-   President Trump launched a 10-to-1 deregulation initiative, ensuring
    every new rule is justified by clear benefits.
-   President Trump promised to “cut waste, fraud, and abuse everywhere
    that we can find it, and there’s plenty of it.”
