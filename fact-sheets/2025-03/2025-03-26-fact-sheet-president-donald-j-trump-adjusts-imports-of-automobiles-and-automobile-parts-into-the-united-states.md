title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Adjusts Imports of Automobiles and Automobile
  Parts into the United States'
---
 
**COUNTERING TRADE PRACTICES THAT THREATEN TO IMPAIR U.S. NATIONAL
SECURITY:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed a proclamation
invoking Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to impose a 25%
tariff on imports of automobiles and certain automobile parts,
addressing a critical threat to U.S. national security.

-   President Trump is taking action to protect America’s automobile
    industry, which is vital to national security and has been
    undermined by excessive imports threatening America’s domestic
    industrial base and supply chains.
-   The 25% tariff will be applied to imported passenger vehicles
    (sedans, SUVs, crossovers, minivans, cargo vans) and light trucks,
    as well as key automobile parts (engines, transmissions, powertrain
    parts, and electrical components), with processes to expand tariffs
    on additional parts if necessary.
-   Importers of automobiles under the United States-Mexico-Canada
    Agreement will be given the opportunity to certify their U.S.
    content and systems will be implemented such that the 25% tariff
    will only apply to the value of their non-U.S. content.
    -   USMCA-compliant automobile parts will remain tariff-free until
        the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with U.S. Customs and
        Border Protection (CBP), establishes a process to apply tariffs
        to their non-U.S. content.
-   The President is exercising his authority under Section 232 of the
    Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to adjust imports to protect our
    national security.
    -   This statute provides the President with authority to adjust
        imports being brought into the United States in quantities or
        under circumstances that threaten to impair national security.

**MAINTAINING A RESILIENT DOMESTIC INDUSTRIAL BASE: **President Trump is
taking action to end unfair trade practices that jeopardize U.S.
national security.

-   The COVID-19 pandemic exposed critical vulnerabilities and choke
    points in global supply chains, undermining our ability to maintain
    a resilient domestic industrial base.
-   Legislation, pre-existing trade agreements like the USMCA, revisions
    to the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, and subsequent negotiations
    have not sufficiently mitigated the threat to national security
    posed by imports of automobiles and certain automobile parts.
-   These new tariffs aim to ensure the U.S. can sustain its domestic
    industrial base and meet national security needs. 

**STRENGTHENING AMERICA’S MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY: **President Trump’s
decision to implement tariffs on imports of automobiles and automobile
parts will protect and strengthen the U.S. automotive sector.

-   Foreign automobile industries, bolstered by unfair subsidies and
    aggressive industrial policies, have expanded, while U.S. production
    has stagnated.
-   In 1985, American-owned facilities in the United States manufactured
    11.0 million automobiles, representing 97% of overall domestic
    (American- and foreign-owned) production of automobiles.
-   In 2024, Americans bought approximately 16 million cars, SUVs, and
    light trucks, and 50% of these vehicles were imports (8 million).
    -   Of the other 8 million vehicles assembled in America
        and not imported, the average domestic content is conservatively
        estimated at only 50% and is likely closer to 40%.
    -   Therefore, of the 16 million cars bought by Americans, only 25%
        of the vehicle content can be categorized as Made in America.
-   The United States trade deficit in automobile parts reached $93.5
    billion in 2024.
-   Currently, the U.S. automobile and automobile parts industry
    (American-owned and foreign-owned firms) employs approximately one
    million U.S. workers.
-   Employment in automotive parts manufacturing totaled approximately
    553,300 jobs in 2024, a decline of 286,000 jobs or 34% since 2000.
-   In 2023, Research and Development (R&D) by American-owned automobile
    manufacturers amounted to only 16% of global R&D spending. R&D by
    American-owned firms lagged behind the EU, which controlled 53% of
    global R&D.

**TARIFFS WORK: **Studies have repeatedly shown that tariffs can be an
effective tool for reducing or eliminating threats to impair U.S.
national security and achieving economic and strategic objectives.

-   A 2024 study on the effects of President Trump’s tariffs in his
    first term found that they “strengthened the U.S. economy” and “led
    to significant reshoring” in industries like manufacturing and steel
    production.
-   A 2023 report by the U.S. International Trade Commission that
    analyzed the effects of Section 232 and 301 tariffs on more than
    $300 billion of U.S. imports found that the tariffs reduced imports
    from China and effectively stimulated more U.S. production of the
    tariffed goods, with very minor effects on prices.
-   According to the Economic Policy Institute, the tariffs implemented
    by President Trump during his first term “clearly show\[ed\] no
    correlation with inflation” and only had a temporary effect on
    overall price levels.
-   An analysis from the Atlantic Council found that “tariffs would
    create new incentives for US consumers to buy US-made products.”
-   Former Biden Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen affirmed last year that
    tariffs do not raise prices: “I don’t believe that American
    consumers will see any meaningful increase in the prices that they
    face.”
-   A 2024 economic analysis found that a global tariff of 10% would
    grow the economy by $728 billion, create 2.8 million jobs, and
    increase real household incomes by 5.7%.
