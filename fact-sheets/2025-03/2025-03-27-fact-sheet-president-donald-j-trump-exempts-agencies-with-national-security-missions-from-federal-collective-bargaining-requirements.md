title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Exempts Agencies with National Security
  Missions from Federal Collective Bargaining Requirements'
---
 
**PROTECTING OUR NATIONAL SECURITY:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order using authority granted by the Civil Service
Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) to end collective bargaining with Federal
unions in the following agencies with national security missions:

-   ***National Defense*.** Department of Defense, Department of
    Veterans Affairs (VA), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and
    Coast Guard.
    -   VA serves as the backstop healthcare provider for wounded troops
        in wartime.
    -   NSF-funded research supports military and cybersecurity
        breakthroughs. 
-   ***Border Security*.** Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
    leadership components, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services,
    U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Department of
    Justice’s (DOJ) Executive Office of Immigration Review, and the
    Office of Refugee Resettlement within the Department of Health and
    Human Services (HHS).
-   ***Foreign Relations*.** Department of State, U.S. Agency for
    International Development, Department of Commerce’s International
    Trade Administration, and U.S. International Trade Commission.
    -   President Trump has demonstrated how trade policy is a national
        security tool.
-   ***Energy Security*.** Department of Energy, Nuclear Regulatory
    Commission, Environmental Protection Agency, and Department of
    Interior units that govern domestic energy production.
    -   The same Congress that passed the CSRA declared that energy
        insecurity threatens national security.
-   ***Pandemic Preparedness, Prevention, and Response*.** Within HHS,
    the Secretary’s Office, Office of General Counsel, Centers for
    Disease Control and Prevention, Administration for Strategic
    Preparedness and Response, Food and Drug Administration, and
    National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. In the
    Department of Agriculture, the Office of General Counsel, Food
    Safety and Inspection Service, and Animal and Plant Health
    Inspection Service.
    -   COVID-19 and the recent bird flu have demonstrated how foreign
        pandemics affect national security.
    -   VA is also a backstop healthcare provider during national
        emergencies, and served this role during COVID-19.
-   ***Cybersecurity*.** The Office of the Chief Information Officer in
    each cabinet-level department, as well as DHS’s Cybersecurity and
    Infrastructure Security Agency, the Federal Communications
    Commission (FCC), and the General Services Administration (GSA).
    -   The FCC protects the reliability and security of America’s
        telecommunications networks.
    -   GSA provides cybersecurity related services to agencies and
        ensures they do not use compromised telecommunications products.
-   ***Economic Defense.*** Department of Treasury.
    -   The Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) defines national
        security to include protecting America’s economic and productive
        strength. The Treasury Department collects the taxes that fund
        the government and ensures the stable operations of the
        financial system.
-   ***Public Safety.*** Most components of the Department of Justice as
    well as the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
-   ***Law Enforcement Unaffected***. Police and firefighters will
    continue to collectively bargain.

**ENSURING THAT AGENCIES OPERATE EFFECTIVELY:** The CSRA enables hostile
Federal unions to obstruct agency management. This is dangerous in
agencies with national security responsibilities:

-   Agencies cannot modify policies in collective bargaining agreements
    (CBAs) until they expire.
    -   The outgoing Biden Administration renegotiated many agencies’
        CBAs to last through President Trump’s second term.
-   Agencies cannot make most contractually permissible changes until
    after finishing “midterm” union bargaining.
    -   For example, the FLRA ruled that ICE could not modify
        cybersecurity policies without giving its union an opportunity
        to negotiate, and then completing midterm bargaining.
-   Unions used these powers to block the implementation of the VA
    Accountability Act; the Biden Administration had to offer
    reinstatement and backpay to over 4,000 unionized employees that the
    VA had removed for poor performance or misconduct.

**SAFEGUARDING AMERICAN INTERESTS:** President Trump is taking action to
ensure that agencies vital to national security can execute their
missions without delay and protect the American people. The President
needs a responsive and accountable civil service to protect our national
security.

-   Certain Federal unions have declared war on President Trump’s
    agenda.
    -   The largest Federal union describes itself as “fighting back”
        against Trump. It is widely filing grievances to block Trump
        policies.

    <!-- -->

    -   For example, VA’s unions have filed 70 national and local
        grievances over President Trump’s policies since the
        inauguration—an average of over one a day.
-   Protecting America’s national security is a core constitutional
    duty, and President Trump refuses to let union obstruction interfere
    with his efforts to protect Americans and our national interests.
-   President Trump supports constructive partnerships with unions who
    work with him; he will not tolerate mass obstruction that
    jeopardizes his ability to manage agencies with vital national
    security missions.
