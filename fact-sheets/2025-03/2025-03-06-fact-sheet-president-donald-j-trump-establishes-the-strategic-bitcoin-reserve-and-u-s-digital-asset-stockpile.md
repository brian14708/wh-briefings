title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Establishes the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve
  and U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile'

**CREATING A STRATEGIC BITCOIN RESERVE AND DIGITAL ASSET STOCKPILE:**
Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to establish
a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile,
positioning the United States as a leader among nations in government
digital asset strategy.

-   The Order creates a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve that will treat
    bitcoin as a reserve asset.
    -   The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will be capitalized with bitcoin
        owned by the Department of Treasury that was forfeited as part
        of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings.  Other
        agencies will evaluate their legal authority to transfer any
        bitcoin owned by those agencies to the Strategic Bitcoin
        Reserve.

    <!-- -->

    -   The United States will not sell bitcoin deposited into this
        Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which will be maintained as a store
        of reserve assets.

    <!-- -->

    -   The Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce are authorized to
        develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional
        bitcoin, provided that those strategies impose no incremental
        costs on American taxpayers.
-   It also established a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, consisting of
    digital assets other than bitcoin owned by the Department of
    Treasury that was forfeited in criminal or civil asset forfeiture
    proceedings.
    -   The government will not acquire additional assets for the U.S.
        Digital Asset Stockpile beyond those obtained through forfeiture
        proceedings.

    <!-- -->

    -   The Secretary of the Treasury may determine strategies for
        responsible stewardship, including potential sales from the U.S.
        Digital Asset Stockpile.
-   Agencies must provide a full accounting of their digital asset
    holdings to the Secretary of the Treasury and the President’s
    Working Group on Digital Asset Markets.
-   This Order ensures a strategic approach to managing digital assets
    under U.S. control.

**ADDRESSING A CRYPTO MANAGEMENT GAP:**

-   Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, is referred to as “digital
    gold” because of its scarcity and security, having never been
    hacked.
    -   With a fixed supply of 21 million coins, there is a strategic
        advantage to being among the first nations to create a Strategic
        Bitcoin Reserve.

    <!-- -->

    -   The United States currently holds a significant amount of
        bitcoin but has not maximized its strategic position as a unique
        store of value in the global financial system.

    <!-- -->

    -   Premature sales of bitcoin have already cost U.S. taxpayers over
        $17 billion.
-   The Executive Order begins to resolve the current disjointed
    handling of cryptocurrencies seized through forfeiture by, and
    scattered across, various Federal agencies.
-   Currently, no clear policy exists for managing these assets, leading
    to a lack of accountability and inadequate exploration of options to
    centralize, secure, or maximize their value.
-   Taking affirmative steps to centralize ownership, control, and
    management of these assets within the Federal government will ensure
    proper oversight, accurate tracking, and a cohesive approach to
    managing the government’s cryptocurrency holdings.
-   This move harnesses the power of digital assets for national
    prosperity, rather than letting them languish in limbo.

**DELIVERING ON PLEDGE TO MAKE AMERICA THE CRYPTO CAPITAL OF THE
WORLD:** President Trump is fulfilling his promise to position America
as the global leader in cryptocurrency.

-   President Trump promised to make the United States the “crypto
    capital of the world,” emphasizing the need to embrace digital
    assets to drive economic growth and technological leadership.
-   In his first week in office, President Trump signed an Executive
    Order to promote United States leadership in digital assets such as
    cryptocurrency.
-   President Trump has consistently advocated for a forward-thinking
    approach to crypto, stating: “I am very positive and open minded to
    cryptocurrency companies, and all things related to this new and
    burgeoning industry. Our country must be the leader in the field.”
-   President Trump promised to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a
    Digital Assets Stockpile.
-   President Trump appointed a “crypto czar” and is hosting the
    first-ever crypto summit at the White House, just a few of the many
    ways this Administration is demonstrating its strong commitment to
    this digital asset.
