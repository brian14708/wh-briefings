title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Prevents Abuses of the Legal System
  and the Federal Courts'
---
 
**ADDRESSING ATTORNEY MISCONDUCT:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed a memorandum to hold attorneys and law firms accountable for
unethical conduct when litigating against the Federal government or
pursuing baseless partisan attacks. The memorandum instructs the
Attorney General to:

-   Prioritize seeking sanctions against attorneys and law firms that
    engage in frivolous, unreasonable, or vexatious litigation against
    the United States.
-   Prioritize enforcement of regulations governing attorney conduct and
    discipline. This directive also applies to the Secretary of Homeland
    Security.
-   Refer attorneys and law firms for disciplinary action when their
    conduct in Federal court or before any component of the Federal
    government appears to violate professional conduct rules.
-   Recommend additional consequences, including reassessing security
    clearances or terminating federal contracts, for attorneys and law
    firms that engage in conduct deserving of sanctions or other
    disciplinary action.
-   Review attorney and law firm conduct over the last eight years in
    litigation against the Federal government and recommend further
    actions if misconduct is identified.

**PREVENTING ABUSES OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND FEDERAL COURTS:** President
Trump believes that lawyers and law firms must be held accountable when
they engage in illegal or unethical conduct, especially when their
misconduct threatens our national security, homeland security, public
safety, or election integrity.

-   Examples of egregious unethical conduct, such as Marc Elias’ direct
    involvement in creating a false “dossier” to interfere with the 2016
    presidential election, are too common in the legal profession.
-   The immigration system is likewise replete with examples of
    unscrupulous behavior by attorneys and law firms that undermine
    immigration enforcement.
    -   The immigration bar, and powerful Big Law pro bono practices,
        frequently coach clients to conceal their past or lie about
        their circumstances when seeking asylum.

    -   Fact-checking these fraudulent claims imposes an enormous burden
        on the Federal government, and in turn undermines the integrity
        of our immigration laws.
-   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 prohibits attorneys from engaging
    in certain unethical conduct, such as filing frivolous claims,
    presenting arguments not grounded in law, or making factual
    assertions without evidentiary support. Federal regulations
    establish similar attorney conduct standards, particularly in
    connection with immigration proceedings.
-   Frivolous lawsuits, bad-faith legal arguments, and blatant
    misrepresentations of fact burden the courts and waste taxpayer
    resources.
-   Lawyers and law firms that engage in unethical conduct often face
    little to no accountability—this memorandum delivers overdue
    enforcement.

**A RETURN TO ACCOUNTABILITY:** President Trump is delivering on his
promise to end the weaponization of government and protect the nation
from partisan and bad faith actors who exploit their influence. 

-   This memorandum aligns with President Trump’s priority on refocusing
    government operations to serve the citizens of the United States.
-   It builds on President Trump’s previous actions, such as signing an
    Executive Order on his first day in office to end the weaponization
    of the Federal government and ensure accountability for past
    misconduct.
-   It follows his revocation of security clearances held by
    intelligence officials who falsely claimed Hunter Biden’s laptop was
    Russian disinformation during the 2020 election.
-   President Trump has also taken action to hold major law firms
    accountable, including Covington & Burling, Paul Weiss, and Perkins
    Coie.
