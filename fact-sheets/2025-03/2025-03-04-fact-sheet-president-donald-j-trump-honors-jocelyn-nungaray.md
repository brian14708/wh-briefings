title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Honors Jocelyn Nungaray'
---
 
**HONORING A GREAT AMERICAN:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed
an Executive Order renaming the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge the
“Jocelyn Nungaray National Refuge” to forever commemorate the life of
twelve-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray, who was tragically killed on June 17,
2024.

-   Jocelyn Nungaray was brutally murdered in Houston, Texas, and two
    Venezuelan illegal aliens—both reputedly Tren de Aragua gang
    members—have been charged with this heinous crime.
    -   These two men, caught near the border in early 2024, were
        released into the United States due to the Biden
        Administration’s immigration policies. Only weeks later, they
        are alleged to have ended Jocelyn’s life in a senseless act of
        violence.
-   The Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge will bear her name as a lasting
    tribute to her love of animals and passion for finding them homes. 

**THE TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES OF BIDEN’S BORDER CRISIS:** The prior
administration’s approach to immigration left the nation vulnerable to
criminal activity and chaos.

-   While Biden was president, the southern border was overrun by
    cartels, criminal gangs, suspected terrorists, human traffickers,
    smugglers, and illicit narcotics.
-   The Biden Administration’s lenient border policies allowed thousands
    of illegal aliens to enter the United States daily.
-   The Biden Administration admitted that 40% of its catch-and-release
    migrants totally disappeared.
-   Innocent American lives have been taken due to this migrant
    invasion, with victims like Laken Riley, Jocelyn Nungaray, and
    Rachel Morin tragically losing their lives because of crimes
    committed by illegal aliens.
-   At one point in 2024, illegal aliens made up 75% of arrests in
    Midtown Manhattan for crimes like assault, robbery, and domestic
    violence.

**SEALING THE BORDER:** On Day One, President Trump secured the border
and launched a comprehensive strategy to restore safety and sovereignty
to the United States.

-   Apprehensions at the southern border are now at a record low, down
    94% from a year ago.
-   Would-be illegal border crossers have reportedly “given up” and are
    returning to their own countries as ICE arrests of illegal
    immigrants have surged 627%.
-   Mexican cartel operatives say they are “genuinely” fearful “for the
    first time in years” amid the Trump Administration’s crackdown.
-   Since returning to office, President Trump has:
    -   Declared a national emergency at the southern border.
    -   Deployed additional personnel to the border, including members
        of the Armed Forces and the National Guard.
    -   Restarted border wall construction.
    -   Designated international cartels and other criminal
        organizations—such as MS-13 and Tren de Aragua—as Foreign
        Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global
        Terrorists.
    -   Suspended the entry of aliens into the U.S.
    -   Called for enhanced vetting and screening of aliens.
    -   Required the identification of countries that warrant a partial
        or full suspension on the admission of nationals.
    -   Restarted the detention and removal of aliens who are in
        violation of Federal law.
    -   Directed the Administration to resume the Migrant Protection
        Protocols—also known as “Remain in Mexico”—as soon as
        practicable.
    -   Ended the use of the CBP One app.
    -   Terminated all categorical parole programs, such as the
        “Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans,”
        that are contrary to President Trump’s immigration agenda.
    -   Ended automatic citizenship for children of illegal aliens.
    -   Paused the operation of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program
        (USRAP).
    -   Ended catch-and-release policies.
    -   Revoked the Biden Administration’s disastrous executive actions
        that essentially opened our southern border.
    -   Detained the most dangerous illegal criminal aliens in
        Guantanamo Bay. 
    -   Ended the taxpayer subsidization of illegal immigration.
