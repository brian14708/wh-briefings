  Bureaucracy'

**ELIMINATING WASTE AND REDUCING GOVERNMENT OVERREACH:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order continuing the
reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy.

-   This Executive Order eliminates non-statutory functions and reduces
    statutory functions of unnecessary governmental entities to what is
    required by law.
    -   Affected entities include the Federal Mediation and Conciliation
        Service, United States Agency for Global Media, Woodrow Wilson
        International Center for Scholars, Institute of Museum and
        Library Services, United States Interagency Council on
        Homelessness, Community Development Financial Institutions Fund,
        Minority Business Development Agency, and Arctic Research
        Commission.
-   This action builds on an Executive Order President Trump previously
    signed to reduce unnecessary governmental entities and Federal
    advisory committees.

**REDUCING GOVERNMENT OVERREACH: **With this Executive Order, President
Trump is further decreasing the size of the Federal Government to

-   The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has already
    identified billions in waste, fraud, and abuse.
-   Cutting these governmental entities will save taxpayer dollars,
    reduce unnecessary government spending, and streamline government
    priorities.
-   By reducing the Federal footprint, President Trump is returning
    power to local communities and state governments.

**REFORMING THE FEDERAL BUREAUCRACY: **The American people elected
President Trump to drain the swamp and end ineffective government
programs that empower government without achieving measurable results.

-   The government wastes billions of dollars each year on duplicative
    programs and frivolous expenditures that fail to align with American
    values or address the needs of the American people.
-   President Trump eliminated the Federal Executive Institute, a
    government program purportedly designed to provide bureaucratic
    leadership training.  
-   President Trump established the “Department of Government
    Efficiency” to examine how to streamline the Federal Government,
    eliminate unnecessary programs, and reduce bureaucratic
    inefficiency.
-   President Trump launched a 10-to-1 deregulation initiative, ensuring
    every new rule is justified by clear benefits.

Through these actions, President Trump is keeping his promise to restore
