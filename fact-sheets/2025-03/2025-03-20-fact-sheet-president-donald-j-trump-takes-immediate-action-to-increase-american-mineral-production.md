title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Takes Immediate Action to Increase American
  Mineral Production'
---
 
**INCREASING AMERICAN MINERAL PRODUCTION:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed an Executive Order to boost American mineral production,
streamline permitting, and enhance national security.  

-   Agencies shall compile a list of all mineral production projects
    that have submitted a plan of operations, permit application, or any
    other approval request to that agency in order to expedite the
    review and advancement of those projects in coordination with the
    National Energy Dominance Council (NEDC).
    -   Additional mineral production projects will be considered for
        FAST-41 status to streamline permitting.
-   New recommendations will be provided to Congress regarding treatment
    of waste rock, tailings, and mine waste disposal under the Mining
    Act of 1872.
-   The Secretary of the Interior will prioritize mineral production
    activities over other types of activities on Federal lands that hold
    critical mineral deposits.
    -   The Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Energy, Secretary of
        Agriculture, and Secretary of the Interior shall identify
        additional sites that might be suitable for mineral production
        activities that can be permitted as soon as possible.
-   The Defense Production Act (DPA) will be used to expand domestic
    mineral production capacity.
-   Financing, loans, and investment support will be provided for new
    mineral production projects, including a dedicated critical minerals
    fund established through the United States International Development
    Finance Corporation in collaboration with the Department of Defense.
-   The Trump Administration will coordinate with private industry to
    ensure a stable and resilient domestic supply chain for critical
    materials, including critical minerals.
-   “Minerals” covered by the order include critical minerals, uranium,
    copper, potash, gold, and any other element, compound, or material
    as determined by the Chair of the NEDC, such as coal.

**SECURING AMERICA’S MINERAL FUTURE:** President Trump is boosting
domestic mineral production to reduce U.S. reliance on foreign minerals,
enhance national security, and create jobs.

-   Demand for critical minerals has been dubbed the “gold rush of the
    21<sup>st</sup> century” due to their importance in emerging
    technologies.
-   The United States currently imports a significant portion of its
    minerals from foreign countries, creating economic and security
    risks, despite possessing a vast supply of critical minerals.
    -   The United States is 100% import-reliant on at least 15 critical
        minerals, and imports of nonfuel mineral commodities make up
        more than half of U.S. consumption.

    -   U.S. capacity utilization for the metal mining industry has
        declined for years.
-   China, Iran, and Russia control large deposits of several minerals
    critical to the U.S., posing a national security risk.
    -   70% of U.S. imports of rare earths come from China.
-   A strong domestic mineral production industry would ensure U.S.
    companies can compete globally without overly relying on foreign
    supply chains.
-   Critical minerals are essential for U.S. military readiness, as they
    are key components in fighter jets, satellites, submarines, smart
    bombs, and missile guidance systems.

**PRIORITIZING U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY:** President Trump is committed to
ending American dependence on hostile foreign powers for critical
minerals.

-   Immediately upon returning to office, President Trump signed an
    Executive Order to make the U.S. “the leading producer and processor
    of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals.”
-   President Trump also signed an Executive Order advancing the Ambler
    Access Project, a 211-mile industrial road through Northwest Alaska
    that enables commercial mining for copper, zinc and other materials.
-   This builds on actions President Trump took in his first term:
    -   In 2017, President Trump implemented a Federal strategy to
        ensure secure and reliable supplies of critical minerals.

    <!-- -->

    -   In 2019, President Trump signed five Presidential Determinations
        finding that domestic production of rare earth elements and
        materials is essential to the national defense.

    <!-- -->

    -   In 2020, President Trump declared a National Emergency to expand
        the domestic mining industry, support mining jobs, alleviate
        unnecessary permitting delays, and reduce our Nation’s
        dependence on China for critical minerals.
