  of the United States'

**DESIGNATING ENGLISH AS THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order designating English as the
official language of the United States.

-   The Order rescinds a Clinton-era mandate that required agencies and
    recipients of federal funding to provide extensive language
    assistance to non-English speakers.  
-   This designation specifically allows agencies to keep current
    policies and provide documents and services in other languages, but
    encourages new Americans to adopt a national language that opens
    doors to greater opportunities.
-   Agencies will have flexibility to decide how and when to offer
    services in languages other than English to best serve the American
    people and fulfill their agency mission.

**UNIFYING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE:** It is long past time English is
recognized as the official language of the United States.

-   Since our nation’s founding, English has been the language of our
    nation, with historic documents like the Declaration of Independence
    and the Constitution written in English.
-   A national language strengthens the fabric of our society,
    empowering citizens old and new.
-   While over 350 languages are spoken in the United States, English
    remains the most widely used across the country.
-   Roughly 180 countries have an official language – the United States
    is one of the few nations in the world to have no official language
    designated.
-   More than 30 states and five U.S. territories have already embraced
    English as the official language.
-   Establishing English as the official language promotes unity,
    establishes efficiency in government operations, and creates a
    pathway for civic engagement.
-   This Order celebrates multilingual Americans who have learned
    English and passed it down, while empowering immigrants to achieve
    the American Dream through a common language.

**PROMISES KEPT:** President Trump has long championed the idea that
English should be the official language of the United States.

-   With this Executive Order, President Trump affirms that a common
    language fosters national cohesion, helps newcomers engage in
    communities and traditions, and enriches our shared culture.
