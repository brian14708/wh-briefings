title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Achieves Efficiency Through State and
  Local Preparedness'
---
 
**ENHANCING EFFICIENCY THROUGH STATE AND LOCAL PREPAREDNESS:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to empower states,
localities, and citizens to more effectively prepare for incidents like
cyber attacks and weather events.

-   The Order enables state and local governments to better understand,
    plan for, and address the needs of their citizens by reducing the
    complexity of federal preparedness and response policies.
-   It also launches a National Resilience Strategy that articulates the
    priorities, means, and ways to advance the resilience of the nation.
-   The Order calls for a review of all infrastructure, continuity, and
    preparedness policies to modernize and simplify federal approaches,
    aligning them with the National Resilience Strategy. This includes:
    -   Shifting national critical infrastructure policy from an
        “all-hazards” approach to a risk-informed approach, prioritizing
        resilience and action over mere information sharing.

    -   Overhauling national continuity policy to modernize its
        framework, streamline operations, and right-size the federal
        footprint for sustained readiness.

    -   Evaluating national preparedness policies to reformulate the
        process and metrics for federal responsibility.
-   The Order creates a National Risk Register to identify, describe,
    and measure risks to our national infrastructure, related systems,
    and their users in order to guide smarter spending and planning.
-   The Order streamlines federal functions so states and communities
    can work with Washington more easily and effectively.

**SAVING LIVES THROUGH EARLY PREPAREDNESS:** President Trump knows that
Americans need fast, effective help when crises hit—not delays or
excuses.

-   This Order injects common sense into both infrastructure
    prioritization and strategic investments through risk-informed
    decisions. This will make our infrastructure, communities, and
    economy more resilient to global and dynamic threats and hazards.
-   Local leaders and citizens know their needs best—not bureaucrats in
    Washington, D.C.
-   The Order streamlines operations and updates relevant government
    policies to reduce complexity, increase efficiency, and better
    protect and serve Americans. It enables state and local governments
    to better understand, plan for, and address the needs of their
    citizens.

**EMPOWERING STATES AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES:** This Executive Order
delivers on President Trump’s commitment to shift power from Washington
to the American people.

-   In his first week back in office, President Trump established a task
    force to assess FEMA’s ability to effectively address disasters
    occurring within the United States.
-   President Trump also signed an Executive Order to ensure California
    gets adequate resources to fight wildfires and assist California and
    North Carolina in rebuilding quicker, putting local needs first.
