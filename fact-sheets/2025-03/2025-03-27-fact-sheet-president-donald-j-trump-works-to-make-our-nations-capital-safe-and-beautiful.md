**MAKING WASHINGTON THE GREATEST CAPITAL CITY IN THE WORLD:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to make Washington,
D.C. what it should be—the pride of every American to whom it belongs.  

-   The Executive Order establishes a task force, officially known as
    the D.C. Safe and Beautiful Task Force, that will be comprised of
    members of key government agencies.
-   The task force is directed to:
    -   Surge law enforcement officers in public areas and strictly
        enforce quality-of-life laws in public areas like drug use,
        unpermitted demonstrations, vandalism, and public intoxication.

    <!-- -->

    -   Maximize immigration enforcement to apprehend and deport
        dangerous illegal aliens, including monitoring D.C.’s
        cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

    <!-- -->

    -   Help D.C.’s forensic crime laboratory get accreditation.

    <!-- -->

    -   Provide assistance to the D.C. Police Department in recruiting
        and retaining officers and boosting capabilities.

    <!-- -->

    -   Keep dangerous criminals off the streets by strengthening
        pre-trial detention policies.

    <!-- -->

    -   Expedite concealed carry licenses for law-abiding citizens.

    <!-- -->

    -   Crack down on fare evasion and other crimes on the D.C. Metro
        system.
-   The Executive Order will also create a program to beautify
    Washington, D.C.:
    -   This includes restoring and beautifying Federal buildings,
        monuments, statues, memorials, parks, and roadways, removing
        graffiti from commonly visited areas, and ensuring the
        cleanliness of public spaces and parks.

    <!-- -->

    -   The National Park Service will rapidly clear all homeless
        encampments and graffiti on federal lands.

**AMERICANS DESERVE A BETTER CAPITAL THAN TODAY’S WASHINGTON:** Our
nation’s capital, the only city that belongs to all of us, must be a
symbol of pride for the American people and a safe location for public
servants to do the people’s work. Today, because of failed policies,
it’s not.

-   Crime is near historic highs, yet D.C. police force numbers recently
    reached a half-century low.
    -   The left is touting modest decreases in D.C. crime in 2024, but
        they still represent a massive increase from earlier rates. In
        2023, violent crime rose by 39 percent. Property crime rose by
        24 percent.

    <!-- -->

    -   This mirrors the spin they tried to put on “decreases” in the
        rate of inflation in recent years. Inflation is still up—and so
        is crime. And Americans are smart enough to notice.

    <!-- -->

    -   For example, 2023 saw the highest number of homicides in the
        District since 1997.

    <!-- -->

    -   The D.C. Metro Police Department needs at least 4,000 officers,
        yet has fewer than 3,500.
-   D.C.’s failed policies opened the door to disorder—and criminals
    noticed. Washington, DC:
    -   Abandoned traditional pre-trial detention and effectively
        replaced it with ‘catch-and-release.’

    <!-- -->

    -   Decriminalized marijuana.

    <!-- -->

    -   Lets rioters run loose even if they vandalize property and
        assault police.
-   In 2022, the Biden U.S. Attorney for D.C. declined to prosecute 67%
    of arrested people who would have been tried in D.C. Superior
    Court. 
-   The vacuum in law enforcement has created an environment that
    facilitates crime and blight, encourages homeless and vagrancy
    encampments, and jeopardizes public safety.
-   The D.C. crime lab remains partially unaccredited, creating a
    bottleneck for investigations. Federal authorities will assist with
    capacity so forensic work can resume and accreditation can be
    regained.

**PRESIDENT TRUMP KEEPS HIS PROMISES:** President Trump is following
through on his promise to restore Washington, D.C. to glory by making
the nation’s capital safe and beautiful once again.

-   On President Trump’s first return to Washington since leaving office
    in 2021, he lamented “the filth and the decay” that marred the
    nation’s capital in his absence.
-   President Trump later promised that his Administration would “take
    over the horribly run capital of our nation, Washington, D.C., and
    clean it up, renovate it, and rebuild our capital city so that it is
    no longer a nightmare of murder and crime, but rather it will become
    the most beautiful capital anywhere in the world.”
