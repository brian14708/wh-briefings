title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Rapidly Expands Timber Production'
---
 
**FREEING OUR FORESTS:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an
Executive Order to immediately increase domestic timber production and
streamline federal policies to enhance forest management, reduce
wildfire risks, and decrease reliance on imported timber.

-   The Order calls for new or updated agency guidance to facilitate
    increased timber production, sound forest management, reduced
    delivery times, and decreased timber supply uncertainty.
-   It cuts red tape in order to streamline timber production and
    identifies measures to boost timber sales from public lands.
-   It pushes for quicker approvals under the Endangered Species Act so
    that forestry projects are not delayed by slow reviews.

**BOOSTING DOMESTIC TIMBER PRODUCTION:** President Trump is committed to
creating jobs, lowering constructions costs, and making the United
States more self-reliant by tapping into its abundant timber resources.

-   Timber production is essential for the construction, energy,
    manufacturing, and shipping industries.  
-   The United States has an abundance of timber resources that can more
    than meet domestic timber production needs, but burdensome Federal
    policies have prevented full utilization of these resources while
    the unfair trade practices of exporters into our country are
    depressing demand.
-   Increased timber production will help reduce foreign dependency,
    lower costs, and enhance economic security.
    -   Currently, the United States imports billions of dollars’ worth
        of lumber annually, which could be produced domestically.
-   Strong national security requires a reliable domestic wood industry
    for military and civilian needs.
-   The wood industry is a crucial part of the U.S. manufacturing and
    defense industrial base, supporting 500 facilities and over 750,000
    direct and indirect jobs.
-   As the recent California wildfires have shown, forest management and
    wildfire risk reduction are essential to protecting American lives
    and communities.

**IMPROVING FOREST MANAGEMENT:** President Trump has long been an
advocate for improving forest management to protect communities and
natural resources.

-   In his first term, President Trump signed legislation to improve the
    funding process for the Forest Service and the Department of the
    Interior’s wildfire suppression operations.
    -   Before this fix, the funding structure forced firefighting
        agencies to take funds from prevention programs to cover the
        rising costs of responding to wildfires.
-   President Trump took strong action to prevent and combat the spread
    of wildfires, focusing on strategies to reduce fire risks and
    improve forest conditions.
-   As part of his broader America First agenda, President Trump is
    focused on reducing foreign dependency on foreign goods across
    various sectors, including steel, aluminum, and copper.
