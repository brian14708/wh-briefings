  Accelerator'

**ACCELERATING INVESTMENT INTO AMERICA’S ECONOMY:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order establishing the United States
Investment Accelerator.

-   The Order establishes an office within the Department of Commerce
    named the United States Investment Accelerator, meant to facilitate
    and accelerate investments above $1 billion in the United States.
-   The Investment Accelerator will encourage companies to make large
    investments in the United States by: (1) reducing regulatory
    burdens; (2) speeding up permitting; (3) coordinating responses to
    investor issues across multiple Federal agencies; (4) increasing
    access to national resources; (5) facilitating collaboration with
    national laboratories; and (6) working with all 50 state governments
    and their economic development organizations, in each case according
    to applicable law.
-   The Investment Accelerator will be responsible for administering the
    CHIPS Program Office, where it will deliver the benefit of the
    bargain for taxpayers, negotiating much better CHIPS Act deals than
    the previous Administration.

**UNLEASHING ECONOMIC PROSPERITY:** President Trump believes it is in
America’s interest that the Federal Government dramatically expand its
assistance to companies seeking to invest and build in the United
States.

-   The United States is the most powerful economy in the world, but
    slow, complex, and burdensome regulations make domestic and foreign
    investment harder than necessary.
-   An Investment Accelerator is needed to cut through red tape and
    ensure that businesses can quickly deploy capital and create jobs
    without navigating a maze of bureaucratic hurdles.
-   By streamlining processes, the Accelerator will attract both foreign
    and domestic investment, reinforcing America’s position as the
    premier destination for large-scale investment.

**SECURING AMERICA’S ECONOMIC FUTURE:** President Trump is driving
massive private investment and strengthening the United States economy
through bold ideas that streamline government processes and put America
first.

-   Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, the United States has
    already secured more than $3 trillion in private investments during
    his second term.
-   Last month, President Trump signed a memorandum aimed at promoting
    foreign investment while protecting America’s national security
    interests.
-   With the Investment Accelerator in place, President Trump is
    supercharging the flow of capital into the United States, boosting
    prosperity across the nation.
