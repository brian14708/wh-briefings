title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Grants Regulatory Relief from Burdensome
  EPA Restrictions to Promote American Copper Security'
---
 
**PROVIDING REGULATORY RELIEF:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed
a Proclamation granting two years of regulatory relief from a stringent
Biden-Era EPA rule on primary copper smelting, an industry vital to
national security and economic resilience.

-   The Proclamation allows the stationary source named in the
    Proclamation to comply with the EPA standards that were in place
    before the Biden Administration rulemakings for two years.
-   This exemption ensures that the stationary source, a copper smelting
    facility, can continue to operate uninterrupted to support national
    security without incurring substantial costs to comply with
    unattainable compliance requirements.

**REDUCING BURDENSOME RESTRICTIONS:** President Trump recognizes that
overly restrictive environmental regulations undermine America’s mineral
and metal supply chains, economic vitality, and national security.

-   Copper smelting is essential to America’s energy, defense, and
    manufacturing sectors.
-   The Biden-era emissions standard imposes costly and unattainable
    compliance requirements on copper smelting, as the technologies
    necessary to comply do not yet exist in commercially viable or
    cost-effective forms.
-   Only two primary copper smelters remain in operation in the United
    States, and imposing this Biden-era standard on an already strained
    domestic industry risks accelerating further closures, weakening the
    Nation’s industrial base, undermining mineral independence, and
    increasing reliance on foreign-controlled processing capacity.
-   Without this relief, the United States faces grid instability, loss
    of domestic semiconductor inputs, and greater dependence on
    adversarial nations.

**BALANCING ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS WITH AMERICAN PROSPERITY:**
President Trump has consistently prioritized a pragmatic approach,
ensuring environmental policies support, rather than undermine,
America’s economic strength and national security.

-   President Trump has sought to protect American industries while
    maintaining standards that allow Americans to have among the
    cleanest air and water in the world.
-   He directed the EPA to repeal the Obama-era Clean Power Plan during
    his first term, replacing it with the Affordable Clean Energy rule
    in 2019 that set achievable standards to preserve jobs while
    addressing emissions.
-   He paused the expansion of windmills, recognizing their detrimental
    environmental impact, particularly on wildlife, often outweighs
    their benefits.
-   He has championed an energy dominance strategy, boosting domestic
    oil and gas production to reduce reliance on foreign energy while
    maintaining practical environmental oversight.
-   He granted two years of similar regulatory relief from stringent
    Biden-era regulations that impacted other sectors vital to national
    security, including coal plants, taconite iron ore processing
    facilities, and certain chemical manufacturers that produce
    chemicals related to semiconductors, medical device sterilization,
    advanced manufacturing, and national defense systems.
-   Using Section 232 authorities, he imposed a universal 50% tariff on
    copper imports to counter national security threats from foreign
    overproduction and bolster domestic copper production.
-   His approach encourages industry to develop cost-effective solutions
    like improved emissions technologies rather than imposing unfeasible
    mandates that risk economic disruption.
