title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Announces Second Deal to Bring Most-Favored-Nation
  Pricing to American Patients'
---
 
**ADVANCING MOST-FAVORED-NATION PRICING:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump announced the second agreement with a major pharmaceutical
company, AstraZeneca, to bring American drug prices in line with the
lowest paid by other developed nations (known as the
most-favored-nation, or MFN, price).

-   The agreement will provide every State Medicaid program in the
    country access to MFN drug prices on AstraZeneca products, resulting
    in hundreds of millions of dollars in savings and continuing
    President Trump’s historic efforts to strengthen the program for the
    most vulnerable.
-   The agreement ensures foreign nations can no longer use price
    controls to freeride on American innovation by guaranteeing MFN
    prices on all new innovative medicines AstraZeneca brings to market.
-   The agreement requires AstraZeneca to repatriate increased foreign
    revenue on existing products that AstraZeneca realizes as a result
    of the President’s strong America First U.S. trade policies for the
    benefit of American patients.
-   The agreement requires AstraZeneca to offer medicines at a deep
    discount off the list price when selling directly to American
    patients.

**DELIVERING REDUCED COSTS:** Today’s actions will result in tangible
cost savings to American patients and the healthcare system as a whole.

-   9 million American patients are treated by AstraZeneca medicines and
    will benefit from the President’s successful negotiation to lower
    prices.
-   The 25 million Americans who suffer from asthma, and the 16 million
    Americans who suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
    (COPD), one of the top ten leading causes of death in the United
    States, could benefit from these price reductions.  
    -   BEVESPI AEROSPHERE, an inhaler used to treat chronic obstructive
        pulmonary disease (COPD), will be made available to patients
        purchasing directly at a discount equal to 654% of the deal
        price.

    -   BREZTRI AEROSPHERE, an inhaler used to treat COPD, will be made
        available to patients purchasing directly at a discount equal to
        98% of the deal price.

    -   AIRSUPRA, an inhaler used to treat asthma symptoms and attacks,
        will be made available to patients purchasing directly at a
        discount equal to 96% of the deal price.

**INVESTING IN AMERICA TO SECURE PHARMACEUTICAL SUPPLY CHAINS:**
AstraZeneca is also announcing that it will invest $50 billion in U.S.
manufacturing and research and development by 2030.

-   The company is building a new facility in Charlottesville, Virginia,
    which will produce advanced pharmaceutical ingredients to support
    their chronic disease and oncology pipelines.
-   The Virginia facility will create 3,600 highly skilled jobs.

**ENDING GLOBAL FREELOADING ON AMERICAN PHARMACEUTICAL
INNOVATION:  **President Trump is taking decisive action to rebalance a
system that allows pharmaceutical manufacturers to offer low prices to
other wealthy nations while charging Americans significantly higher
prices. 

-   According to recent data, the prices Americans pay for brand-name
    drugs are more than three times the price other Organization for
    Economic Cooperation and Development nations pay, even after
    accounting for discounts manufacturers provide in the U.S.
-   The United States has less than five percent of the world’s
    population, yet roughly 75% of global pharmaceutical profits come
    from American taxpayers.
-   Drug manufacturers benefit from generous research subsidies and
    enormous healthcare spending by the U.S. Government. Instead of
    passing that benefit through to American consumers, drug
    manufacturers then discount their products abroad to gain access to
    foreign markets and subsidize those discounts through high prices
    charged in America. Americans are subsidizing drug-manufacturer
    profits and foreign health systems, both in development and once the
    drugs are sold.

**DELIVERING ON PROMISES TO PUT AMERICAN PATIENTS FIRST:** President
Trump is delivering on promises for American patients that the political
establishment did not believe were possible.

-   On May 12, 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order titled:
    “Delivering Most-Favored-Nation Prescription Drug Pricing to
    American Patients” directing the Administration to take numerous
    actions to bring American drug prices in line with those paid by
    similar nations.
-   On July 31, 2025, President Trump sent letters to leading
    pharmaceutical manufacturers outlining the steps they must take to
    bring down the prices of prescription drugs in the United States to
    match the lowest price offered in other developed nations.
-   On September 30, 2025, President Trump announced an agreement with
    Pfizer to bring MFN prices to American patients.
-   President Trump has been relentless in his effort to address the
    unfair and outrageous prices Americans pay for prescription drugs:
    -   President Trump: “In case after case, our citizens pay massively
        higher prices than other nations pay for the same exact pill,
        from the same factory, effectively subsidizing socialism aboard
        \[abroad\] with skyrocketing prices at home. So we would spend
        tremendous amounts of money in order to provide inexpensive
        drugs to another country. And when I say the price is different,
        you can see some examples where the price is beyond anything —
        four times, five times different.”
