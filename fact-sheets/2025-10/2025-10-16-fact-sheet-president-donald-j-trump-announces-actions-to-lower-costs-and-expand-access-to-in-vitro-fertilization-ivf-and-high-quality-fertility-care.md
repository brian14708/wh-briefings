  Expand Access to In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) and High-Quality Fertility Care'

**BRINGING MOST-FAVORED-NATION DRUG PRICING TO WOMEN:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump announced the third agreement with a leading
pharmaceutical manufacturer to bring American drug prices in line with
the lowest prices paid by other developed nations (known as the
most-favored-nation, or MFN, price). This agreement is with one of the
world’s leading manufacturers of fertility medications, EMD Serono, and
will result in massive cost savings on fertility treatments.

-   GONAL-F, a commonly used fertility medication, will be made
    available to women purchasing directly from *TrumpRx.gov* at a
    discount equal to 796% of the deal price.
-   Low- and middle-income women (those with incomes below 550% of the
    Federal poverty level) will receive an additional discount totaling
    2,320% of the deal price when purchasing from *TrumpRx.gov*.
-   The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimates women can
    save up to $2,200 per cycle of fertility drugs as a result of this
    deal on drugs that often cost over $5,000. Fertility drugs represent
    almost 20% of the total cost of a fertility treatment cycle.  
-   The agreement also provides that EMD Serono will offer other
    medicines at a deep discount when selling directly to American
    patients, guarantee MFN prices on all new innovative medicines that
    come to market, repatriate increased foreign revenue on existing
    products, and provide every State Medicaid program in the country
    access to MFN drug prices on EMD Serono products.
-   EMD Serono is also announcing that, for the first time in its
    history, it will be investing in manufacturing in the United States,
    manufacturing IVF drugs in the United States for the first time on
    the timelines agreed to in the deal.

**CUTTING THROUGH RED TAPE TO DELIVER SAVINGS ON MEDICINES:** President
Trump also announced the FDA will be including a lower cost fertility
drug in the initial round of recipients for the Commissioner’s National
Priority Review Voucher program.

-   The drug is a lower-cost alternative to expensive medications
    already on the U.S. market. It has been approved in Europe but not
    yet in the United States.
-   The priority review voucher program cuts down the review time of
    applications from 10-12 months to just 1-2 months.
-   If approved following the expedited review timeline, American
    patients stand to benefit even more from lower prices due to
    increased competition in the fertility drug space.

**TAKING NOVEL ACTION TO UNLEASH INNOVATION AND EXPAND COVERAGE:**
Additionally, President Trump announced the creation of a New Benefit
Option for fertility benefits. Under this option, employers will have a
new legal pathway to offer fertility benefits directly to employees,
like they do for dental, vision, and life insurance, representing a
massive opportunity to expand access to IVF coverage.

-   The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and the
    Treasury announced today that employers can now offer standalone
    benefit packages to employees interested in coverage for treatment
    of infertility, including IVF.
-   The Departments also announced their intent to undertake rulemaking
    to continue to further expand the ability of employers to offer
    fertility benefits to their employees.
-   These benefit packages can address the continuum of
    fertility-related services, from those that address the root causes
    of infertility to IVF.
-   This new benefit option has the potential to help more families have
    healthy babies. Fertility benefit companies poised to offer such
    benefit packages report nearly 25% higher live birth rates among
    women using these benefits than those seeking care without such
    benefits.
-   This solution addresses the sparse coverage of fertility for
    hard-working American families and increases options for small- and
    medium-size employers to offer fertility benefits. Despite most
    people in their reproductive age receiving health coverage through
    their job, most employer coverage does not include fertility
    medications, IVF, or non-IVF treatments.
    -   42% of employers offer coverage of fertility services.
    -   32% offer coverage of fertility medications.
    -   32% offer coverage of IVF; and even less (19%) offer coverage of
        non-IVF treatments. Notably, 70% of large employers offer IVF
        coverage.

**DELIVERING ON PROMISES FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES: **President Trump
promised to increase access to IVF and lower the associated costs so
American families can have more babies, building on his record of
supporting family formation and stability.  

-   As many as one in eight couples trying to have a baby are unable to
    conceive, and many face significant financial hurdles to accessing
    IVF. The cost can range from $12,000 to $25,000 per cycle and
    multiple cycles may be needed to get pregnant.
    -   The solutions to lower costs and expand access to IVF and
        high-quality fertility care will result in more healthy
        pregnancies and healthy babies at a time when U.S. fertility is
        at a historic low.

-   President Trump’s Working Families Tax Cuts established Trump
    Accounts, providing newborns with a $1,000 investment to help secure
    the financial future for every American child from birth.
    -   The Working Families Tax Cuts also expanded and made permanent
        the increases in the Child Tax Credit that the President
        championed in his first term, supporting over 40 million
        families.
-   President Trump has long advocated for more babies and expanding
    American families: “Because we want more babies, to put it very
    nicely. And for this same reason, we will also allow new parents to
    deduct major newborn expenses from their taxes, so that parents that
    have a beautiful baby will be able, so we’re pro family. But the IVF
    treatments are expensive. It’s very hard for many people to do it
    and to get it, but I’ve been in favor of IVF, right from the
    beginning.”
