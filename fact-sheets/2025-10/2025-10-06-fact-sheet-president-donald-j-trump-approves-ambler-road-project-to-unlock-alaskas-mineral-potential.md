  \ Alaska\u2019s Mineral Potential"

**UNLEASHING ALASKA’S EXTRAORDINARY RESOURCE POTENTIAL:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump approved the appeal of the Alaska Industrial
Development and Export Authority (AIDEA), directing his Administration
to promptly issue authorizations necessary for the establishment of the
Ambler Road Project. This project will provide road transportation
access to the Ambler Mining District.

-   The Amber Road Project is a proposed 211-mile industrial road from
    the Dalton Highway to Alaska’s remote Ambler Mining District
    (District) that would enable access to large deposits of copper,
    cobalt, gallium, germanium, and more.
-   The permits for the road have been held for years due to protracted
    litigation, and the President has finally allowed this project to go
    forward to support the Administration’s energy dominance agenda.
-   The decision finds that the road is in the public interest given our
    need for access to domestic critical minerals, and there is no
    economically feasible and prudent alternative route.
-   The decision directs the Bureau of Land Management, National Park
    Service, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to reissue necessary
    permits to construct the road.
-   In addition, the U.S. government is announcing a partnership with
    Trilogy Metals, investing $35.6 million to support mining
    exploration in Alaska’s Ambler Mining District. This investment
    makes the U.S. government a 10% shareholder in Trilogy Metals and
    includes warrants to purchase an additional 7.5% of the company.

**UNLOCKING ACCESS TO AMERICA’S CRITICAL MINERALS:** President Trump’s
decision overturns the Biden Administration’s 2024 rejection of the
Ambler Road, which ignored Alaska’s economic needs and national security
imperatives.

-   The Ambler Road Project is vitally important to America’s national
    defense and economic prosperity.
-   An access road is crucial to unlocking critical minerals located in
    this currently-inaccessible area of Alaska, which has been
    characterized as one of the largest undeveloped copper-zinc mineral
    belts in the world and contains extensive deposits of copper,
    silver, gold, lead, cobalt, and other strategic metals.
-   The road will provide essential surface transportation access for
    the more than 1,700 active mining claims in the District, supporting
    expanded mineral exploration, mine development, and operations.
-   Construction of the road will directly support 2,730 jobs, driving
    income, spending, and economic growth in rural Alaska.
    -   Alaska is projected to receive more than $1.1 billion in
        revenues from mining license tax revenues, corporate income
        taxes, production royalties, and claim rents associated with
        this project.
-   The project takes extensive mitigation measures, including caribou
    protection policies and fish passage culverts, to minimize
    environmental impacts.

**ENSURING AMERICAN PROSPERITY:** President Trump continues to
prioritize economic growth and national security, delivering where
Democrats have failed to harness America’s resources.

-   Immediately upon returning to office, President Trump signed an
    Executive Order to unleash Alaska’s extraordinary resource
    potential, including advancing the Ambler Access Road Project.
-   The Trump Administration has streamlined permitting, cutting project
    approval times to boost domestic industry and infrastructure.
-   In March, President Trump signed an Executive Order to boost
    American critical mineral production.
-   In April, President Trump launched a Section 232 investigation into
    the national security risks posed by U.S. reliance on imported
    processed critical minerals and their derivative products.
-   In June, President Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum to foster
    interagency coordination when funding energy and critical mineral
    projects to better prioritize the use of taxpayer funds and end
    wasteful duplicative processes.
-   President Trump has consistently championed policies that balance
    economic development with environmental stewardship, ensuring
    projects like the Ambler Road benefit all Alaskans and the Nation.
