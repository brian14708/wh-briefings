title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Authorizes Construction of Arctic Security
  Cutters'
---
 
**GROWING OUR ARCTIC FLEET:** President Donald J. Trump has signed a
Presidential Memorandum to authorize the construction of up to four
Arctic Security Cutters (ASCs) abroad to address urgent national
security needs in the Arctic region.

-   The Memorandum invokes the President’s authority under 14 U.S.C.
    1151(b) and 10 U.S.C. 8679(b) to permit foreign construction as a
    national security necessity.
-   It directs the U.S. Coast Guard to submit a plan for phasing ASC
    construction in a manner that promotes the on-shoring of expertise
    to build follow-on ASCs domestically.
-   In line with this decision, the President has also signed a
    Memorandum of Understanding with Finland to construct these four
    ASCs in shipyards located in Finland, followed by the leveraging of
    Finnish expertise to construct up to seven new ASCs in shipyards
    located in the United States.
-   The United States and Finland will engage in close collaboration to
    enhance the ASC fleet of the United States on an accelerated
    schedule, to revitalize the shipbuilding industry of both countries.

**BOLSTERING ARCTIC DEFENSE:** This Memorandum addresses growing
strategic competition, aggressive military posturing, and economic
encroachment by foreign adversaries, all of which threaten U.S.
interests in the Arctic.

-   The U.S. Coast Guard’s fleet of ASCs and Arctic-capable vessels is
    insufficient to meet current operations demands and presents a
    national security risk.
-   Currently, the Coast Guard’s operational polar fleet includes just
    two operational ASCs: One was commissioned in 1976; the other was
    previously a commercial vessel and commissioned into the Coast Guard
    just last month.  The Coast Guard assesses that at least 9 ASCs are
    needed in order to serve our national security needs year-round in
    the Arctic.
-   Adversaries’ aggressive military and economic actions in the Arctic
    jeopardize U.S. sovereignty, shipping lanes, and energy resources.
-   Foreign construction of ASCs is a temporary measure to bridge a
    critical capability gap while spurring future domestic shipbuilding
    investment that will ensure the Coast Guard has the full supply of
    cutters it requires.
-   The deals with Finnish shipyards will create great jobs for
    Americans, bring cutting-edge shipbuilding intellectual property to
    the United States, and result in billions of dollars of new
    investments in America.
-   These ships, most of which will eventually be made in America, will
    be among the most modern icebreaking vessels in the world.

**ADVANCING OUR NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS:** President Trump is
ensuring the United States has the robust defense capabilities needed to
protect American interests against global threats, particularly in the
Arctic.

-   In his first term, President Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum
    to speed up the U.S. icebreaker program.
-   In August, the U.S. Coast Guard added an ASC to its fleet for the
    first time in 25 years—the first in a series of ASCs expected to
    join the Coast Guard in the near future.
-   President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill includes nearly $9 billion
    to build a series of heavy, medium, and light ASCs.
-   President Trump: “We need icebreakers in the U.S. And if we can get
    some inexpensively, I’d like to do that.”
-   President Trump is restoring America’s status as a great Arctic
    power after previous administrations allowed our ships and arctic
    capacity to rust and decay.
