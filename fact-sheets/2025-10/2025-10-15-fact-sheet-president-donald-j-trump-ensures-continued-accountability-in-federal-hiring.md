title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Ensures Continued Accountability in
  Federal Hiring'

**CEMENTING POLICIES THAT DRIVE ACCOUNTABLE HIRING:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order requiring Federal hiring to
follow specific policies and procedures established by agency leadership
to improve the efficient delivery of government services.

-   The Order directs each agency to establish a Strategic Hiring
    Committee, consisting of senior agency leadership, to approve all
    hiring decisions.  Such Committees will ensure hiring focuses on
    agency needs, the national interest, and Administration priorities.
-   The Order also requires each agency to create and adhere to an
    Annual Staffing Plan, to ensure that new career appointments are in
    the most mission-critical areas, aligned with Administration
    priorities, and implement the recruitment initiatives of the
    Administration’s previously issued Merit Hiring Plan.
    -   The Office of Personnel Management and the Office of Management
        and Budget will monitor agencies’ implementation of their
        staffing plans on a quarterly basis.
-   Appropriate exemptions continue to exist for immigration
    enforcement, national security, and public safety positions, as well
    as political positions and certain other hires at the agency head’s
    discretion.
-   The Order ensures no adverse impacts on Social Security, Medicare,
    or veterans’ benefits, and allows the Director of the Office of
    Personnel Management to grant appropriate exceptions as needed.

**PROMOTING FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY AND EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT:** President
Trump is strengthening hiring practices to ensure taxpayer dollars are
used efficiently, improve services provided to Americans, and focus
those services on Administration priorities.

-   During the last two years of the Biden Administration, government
    was directly responsible for the creation of more than 1 in every 4
    new jobs in America, at the expense of American taxpayers. In
    contrast, President Trump will not use the Federal government to
    hide a lagging economy and will support private-sector growth
    instead.
-   In just 8 months, the Trump Administration has dramatically reduced
    the size of the Federal workforce and exceeded the targeted ratio of
    4 departures for each new hire, while still prioritizing hiring in
    key national security, immigration enforcement, and public safety
    roles.
-   For nearly 25 years, human capital management has been identified as
    a high-risk area by the Government Accountability Office. Yet, prior
    to this Administration, hiring decisions were spread across a vast
    supervisory layer—over 300,000 supervisory positions in the
    government—leading to diffuse accountability, unfocused hiring, and
    bloat.
-   This Order ensures that Presidential appointees maintain oversight
    of Federal hiring so that the Federal workforce remains focused on
    improving essential functions and is fully aligned with
    Administration priorities. 

**REFORMING THE FEDERAL BUREAUCRACY:** The American people elected
President Trump to drain the swamp and end ineffective government
programs that waste taxpayer dollars and empower government without
achieving measurable results.

-   The government wastes billions of dollars each year on duplicative
    programs and frivolous expenditures that fail to align with American
    values or address the needs of the American people.
-   The Trump Administration is committed to streamlining the Federal
    Government, eliminating unnecessary programs, and reducing
    bureaucratic inefficiency.
-   President Trump launched a 10-to-1 deregulation initiative, ensuring
    every new rule is justified by clear benefits.
-   President Trump authorized buyout programs to encourage federal
    employees to leave voluntarily. Adoption was large across both
    retirement-eligible and mid-career employees, with agencies able to
    exclude mission-critical positions from participating. In total,
    Federal employment attrition was over 300,000 people this year, more
    than double the historical average. But, unsurprisingly, the Federal
    government has remained more than capable of delivering on its core
    functions for the American people.
-   Through these actions, President Trump is keeping his promise to
    restore efficiency and accountability in the Federal Government.
