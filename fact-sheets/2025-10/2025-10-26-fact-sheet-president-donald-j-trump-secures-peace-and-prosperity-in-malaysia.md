title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Secures Peace and Prosperity in Malaysia'
---
 
**DELIVERING PEACE AND PROSPERITY IN ONE HISTORIC DAY:** Today in Kuala
Lumpur, President Donald J. Trump brokered the Kuala Lumpur Peace
Accords between Thailand and Cambodia, secured reciprocal trade deals
with Malaysia and Cambodia, issued Joint Trade Statements with Thailand
and Vietnam, elevated relations with Malaysia, and deepened
U.S.-Cambodia cooperation on defense and transnational crime. President
Trump also participated in the 13th annual U.S.-ASEAN Summit meeting.

**ACHIEVING HISTORIC PEACE BETWEEN THAILAND AND CAMBODIA:** President
Trump and Malaysia’s Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim hosted the Prime
Ministers of Thailand and Cambodia to sign the ‘Kuala Lumpur Peace
Accords’—a historic peace declaration ending border tensions between
Thailand and Cambodia.

-   Through decisive U.S. diplomacy, Thailand and Cambodia reached a
    pivotal agreement to establish border observer teams, a critical
    step in solidifying long-term peace and fostering mutual trust
    between the two countries.
-   At the request of President Trump and pursuant to the commitments in
    the Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords, Thailand will release 18 Cambodian
    soldiers that have been detained since July.
-   This is a landmark achievement for international diplomacy that only
    President Trump could accomplish.

**SECURING EVEN MORE TRADE DEALS:** President Trump signed Agreements on
Reciprocal Trade with Malaysia and Cambodia, and the United States
announced frameworks for trade negotiations with Thailand and Vietnam.

-   The United States and Malaysia agreed to a historic trade deal that
    will open up Malaysia’s market for U.S. exports*.*
    -   Malaysia will eliminate or reduce tariffs on nearly all U.S.
        exports, and allow non-discriminatory or preferential market
        access for U.S. agricultural and industrial goods.

    <!-- -->

    -   Malaysia will address a range of non-tariff barriers to ensure
        that U.S. exporters can access its market.  For example,
        Malaysia will end its discriminatory practices for U.S. motor
        vehicles, meaning that U.S. vehicles can compete on a level
        playing field in Malaysia’s market.  Malaysia will also
        recognize U.S. regulatory oversight, ensuring that U.S.
        agricultural products can be exported to Malaysia without
        burdensome and duplicative regulatory requirements.
-   The United States and Cambodia agreed to a trade deal that will
    provide U.S. exporters with unprecedented access to Cambodia’s
    market*.*
    -   Cambodia has agreed to eliminate all tariffs on U.S. goods,
        including food and agricultural products and industrial goods,
        meaning that U.S. exports to Cambodia will not face a duty.

    <!-- -->

    -   Cambodia has committed to treat U.S. exports fairly, including
        recognizing U.S. regulatory oversight to ensure that U.S. goods
        do not need to undergo burdensome additional testing
        requirements.

    <!-- -->

    -   U.S. exports to Cambodia will no longer face competitive
        disadvantages vis-à-vis other trading partners.
-   The United States and Thailand agreed to a framework for an
    agreement on reciprocal trade, which will address tariff and
    non-tariff barriers for agricultural products and industrial goods.
    -   Under that framework, Thailand would eliminate tariff barriers
        on approximately 99% of goods, covering a full range of U.S.
        industrial and food and agricultural products. 
-   The United States and Vietnam agreed to a framework for an agreement
    on reciprocal, fair, and balanced trade, which will address tariff
    and on-tariff barriers for U.S. agricultural products and industrial
    goods.
    -   Under that framework, Vietnam would provide preferential market
        access for substantially all U.S. industrial and agricultural
        exports to Vietnam.

**ENHANCING THE U.S.-MALAYSIA RELATIONSHIP:** President Trump and Prime
Minister Anwar announced transformative deals that will deliver billions
into the U.S. economy.

-   These groundbreaking deals include:
    -   Up to $3.4 billion annually in U.S. LNG purchases through
        multi-year agreements with Petronas in Malaysia.
    -   $42.6 million annually in U.S. coal sales to TNB Fuel in
        Malaysia and purchases of U.S. telecommunication products and
        services valued at $119 million.
    -   Purchase of 30 Boeing aircraft plus a purchase option for 30
        additional aircraft.
    -   Purchases of U.S. semiconductors, aerospace components, and data
        center equipment with an estimated value of $150 billion.
-   The United States and Malaysia signed a Memorandum of Understanding
    (MOU) on critical minerals which will lead to an expansion of trade
    and investments in critical minerals, including in exploration,
    extraction, refinement, manufacturing, recovery, and recycling. 
    This will create new opportunities for U.S. and Malaysian companies,
    open up alternative markets for critical minerals, and help
    diversify global critical mineral supply chains.
-   The President and Prime Minister announced elevation of bilateral
    relations to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, marking a
    historic advancement in bilateral ties.
-   The U.S. and Malaysian governments signed an MOU to deepen
    cooperation on maritime security and maritime domain awareness.
-   Maintaining a long tradition of U.S. leadership in space, the
    Philippines and Malaysia committed to principles of safe and
    transparent space exploration by signing the Artemis Accords,
    bringing the total number of signatory countries to 59.

**UNLOCKING NEW OPPORTUNITIES WITH CAMBODIA:** President Trump and
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet met for the first leader-level
engagement between the United States and Cambodia since Hun Manet became
Prime Minister.

-   Based on Cambodia’s diligent pursuit of peace and security, the
    United States will remove the arms embargo on Cambodia, and both
    sides agreed to restart the bilateral ANGKOR SENTINEL defense
    exercise, last held in 2017. Additionally, the United States will
    increase seats for Cambodian officers at U.S. military colleges such
    as West Point, Air Force Academy, and others. 
-   The United States and Cambodia agreed to expand cooperation on
    combating transnational crime organizations, including narcotics
    trafficators and online scam centers – criminal enterprises that
    steal over $10 billion annually from vulnerable Americans.

**STRENGTHENING OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THAILAND:** President Trump
secured commitments from Thailand that will expand our defense
relationship and further secure our supply chains.

-   Thailand and the United States will enhance cooperation and
    information sharing between U.S. and Thai law enforcement to advance
    joint investigations of cyber and financial crimes associated with
    scam centers.
-   President Trump and Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul signed a MOU
    that will secure and diversify critical minerals supplies, promote
    partnerships between U.S. and Thai companies, and increase global
    supply chain resilience. Importantly, these efforts will mitigate
    the negative impact of anti-competitive behavior and unfair trade
    practices such as dumping, heavy subsidies, and low standards
    through price floors and similar measures.
