title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Addresses the Threat to National Security
  from Imports of Medium and Heavy-Duty Vehicles, Parts, and Buses'
---
 
**SUPPORTING AMERICA’S TRUCKING INDUSTRY:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed a Proclamation invoking Section 232 of the Trade Expansion
Act of 1962 (Act) to impose tariffs on imports of medium- and heavy-duty
vehicles and parts, and buses, to bolster American industry and protect
national security.

-   The Proclamation imposes a 25% tariff on imports of medium- and
    heavy-duty trucks and truck parts.
    -   Medium- and heavy-duty trucks include Class 3 to Class 8
        vehicles, like large pick-up trucks, moving trucks, cargo
        trucks, dump trucks, and tractors for eighteen-wheelers.
    -   For medium- and heavy-duty trucks that do not qualify for
        preferential tariff treatment under the United
        States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the tariff will apply to
        the full value of the vehicle. For medium- and heavy-duty trucks
        that qualify for preferential tariff treatment under the USMCA,
        the tariff will only apply to the value of the non-U.S. content
        in the vehicle.
    -   <span style="letter-spacing: 0.2px">The tariff on medium- and
        heavy-duty truck parts will apply to key parts, including
        engines, transmissions, tires, and chassis.</span>
    -   USMCA-compliant medium- and heavy-duty truck parts will not be
        subject to tariffs imposed in the Proclamation until the
        Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with U.S. Customs and
        Border Protection, establishes a process to apply tariffs to the
        non-U.S. content of the parts.
-   The Proclamation imposes a 10% tariff on imports of buses, including
    school buses, transit buses, and motor coaches.  
-   The Proclamation incentivizes domestic medium- and heavy-duty truck
    production by offering an offset to a portion of tariffs for medium-
    and heavy-duty truck parts equal to 3.75% of the aggregate value of
    all trucks assembled in the United States from 2025 through 2030.
    This percentage reflects the duty that would be owed when a 25%
    tariff is applied to 15% of the value of a U.S.-assembled medium-
    and heavy-duty truck.
    -   This offset can be used to adjust any Section 232 medium- and
        heavy-duty truck part tariffs owed by a medium- and heavy-duty
        truck manufacturer.

    <!-- -->

    -   An equivalent offset program will also be established for
        medium- and heavy-duty truck engine manufacturers based on the
        value of medium- and heavy-duty truck engines assembled in the
        United States.
-   Recognizing that medium- and heavy-duty truck and automobile
    industries share many common suppliers and structural similarities
    across their supply chains, this Proclamation adjusts the Section
    232 automobile tariff program to harmonize that tariff program with
    the program established for the medium- and heavy-duty truck
    industry.
    -   The Proclamation extends the import adjustment offset program
        for automobile manufacturers through 2030. Automobile producers
        will be able to offset a portion of tariffs on automobile parts
        equal to 3.75% of the Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price of
        automobiles they assemble in the United States.  This percentage
        reflects the duty that would be owed when a 25% tariff is
        applied to 15% of the value of a U.S.-assembled automobile.
-   Products subject to tariffs under this proclamation will not be
    subject to additional or existing sectoral tariffs on steel,
    aluminum, copper, automobiles and automobile parts, and lumber; they
    also will not be subject to reciprocal tariffs or the tariffs
    imposed on Canada, Mexico, Brazil, or India.

**STRENGTHENING U.S. TRUCK MANUFACTURING FOR THE LONG HAUL:** President
Trump is fortifying America’s ability to manufacture medium- and
heavy-duty trucks and essential parts, which is vital for America’s
military readiness, emergency response capabilities, and critical
infrastructure for economic activity.

-   The Proclamation follows the Secretary of Commerce’s completion of a
    Section 232 investigation under the Act, which found that imports of
    medium- and heavy-duty trucks, truck parts, and buses threaten to
    impair the national security of the United States. 
-   Trucks and buses of all kinds are indispensable to military
    readiness, military troop movements, disaster response, and the
    continuity of American critical infrastructure and economic
    stability, moving over 70% of the Nation’s freight, including
    essential goods like food, fuel, and medical supplies.
-   Domestic truck and bus manufacturing drives technological innovation
    across the U.S. economy, with benefits that spillover to the entire
    U.S. industrial base.
-   Since the 1990s, foreign industrial practices and other policies
    have stimulated foreign vehicle manufacturing at the expense of
    American manufacturing and innovation.
    -   Offshoring has resulted in imports of medium- and heavy-duty
        trucks increasingly penetrating the U.S. market, with imports
        now accounting for approximately 43% of the trucks sold in
        America.

    <!-- -->

    -   America also increasingly relies on foreign suppliers for
        several important categories of medium- and heavy-duty truck
        parts, including engines, batteries, transmission shafts,
        castings, and forgings. With significantly fewer U.S. producers
        of truck parts, the domestic supply chain is weaker, resulting
        in national security vulnerabilities.
-   In a time of crisis, America would need adequate, reliable domestic
    manufacturing capacity for medium- and heavy-duty trucks, medium-
    and heavy-duty truck parts, and buses. Only factories here, on
    American soil, subject to American law, can provide that kind of
    reliable capacity.
-   President Trump’s tariffs will protect and expand U.S. medium- and
    heavy-duty truck, medium- and heavy-duty truck part, and bus
    manufacturing, securing supply chains essential for national and
    economic security.

**BUILDING ON A RECORD OF SECURING CRITICAL INDUSTRIES AND SUPPLY
CHAINS: **This Proclamation builds on previous actions taken by the
Trump Administration to ensure U.S. trade and industrial policies serve
the national interest.

-   On Day One, President Trump established his America First Trade
    Policy to make America’s economy great again.
-   President Trump has repeatedly used Section 232 tariffs to protect
    against threats to our national security and to strengthen
    manufacturing critical for our national and economic security,
    including on steel, aluminum, copper, and autos.
    -   The Department of Commerce is currently conducting additional
        investigations, including investigations on semiconductors,
        commercial aircraft, wind turbines, robotics, unmanned aircraft
        systems, and personal protective equipment.
-   President Trump imposed reciprocal tariffs to take back America’s
    economic sovereignty, address nonreciprocal trade relationships that
    threaten our economic and national security, and to remedy the
    consequences of nonreciprocal trade.
-   President Trump has issued several Executive Orders, Proclamations,
    and Presidential Memoranda to boost mining, manufacturing, and
    investment in domestic industry, including by reducing regulations
    and eliminating bureaucracy.
