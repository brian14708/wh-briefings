---
 
**ACHIEVING CRITICAL MINERAL AND ENERGY DOMINANCE:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a
landmark Critical Minerals Framework to unleash the potential of our
abundant natural resources—a model for supply-chain cooperation
globally.  

-   The U.S. and Australian governments intend to invest more than $3
    billion together in critical mineral projects in the next six
    months, with recoverable resources in the projects estimated to be
    worth $53 billion.
    -   The Export-Import Bank of the United States is issuing seven
        Letters of Interest for more than $2.2 billion in financing,
        unlocking up to $5 billion of total investment, to advance
        critical minerals and supply-chain security projects between our
        two countries.
-   The U.S. Department of War will invest in the construction of a 100
    metric ton-per-year advanced gallium refinery in Western Australia,
    further advancing self-reliance in critical minerals processing.

**DEEPENING DEFENSE COOPERATION:** Australia committed to enhanced
burden sharing and is making new defense investments that will bolster
the U.S.-Australia alliance.

-   Australia agreed to purchase $1.2 billion in Anduril unmanned
    underwater vehicles and take delivery of the first tranche of Apache
    helicopters in a separate $2.6 billion deal.   
-   Since February, Australia has contributed $1 billion to the U.S.
    Government to expand and modernize the U.S. submarine industrial
    base, with another $1 billion by the end of the year.  Together, we
    are strengthening the Australia – United Kingdom – United States
    (AUKUS) trilateral security partnership to meet the challenges of
    tomorrow.
-   Australia is investing significantly in its integrated air and
    missile defense capabilities, including $2 billion in U.S.
    companies, for its Joint Air Battle Management System.
-   The U.S.-Australia alliance is securing munitions supply-chain
    resilience under Australia’s Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance
    (GWEO) enterprise, and building on streamlined export cooperation,
    which will directly support more than 200 manufacturing suppliers in
    Texas, Florida, Arkansas, and Alabama.

**PROMOTING ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AND TECHNOLOGY COOPERATION:** The United
States and Australia are forging a historic partnership to drive
innovation, economic growth, and technological leadership through
strategic investments and collaborative initiatives.

-   Australia’s superannuation funds will increase investments in the
    United States to $1.44 trillion by 2035—an increase of almost $1
    trillion from current levels.  
    -   This unprecedented investment will create tens of thousands of
        new, high-paying jobs for Americans.

    Australia and is committed to opening new markets for U.S. ranchers.
-   NASA and the Australian Space Agency signed a framework agreement to
    strengthen civil space and aeronautics cooperation.  NASA’s Artemis
    program, which will return astronauts to the Moon, will be joined by
    a technology development lunar rover from Australia.
-   The United States and Australia agreed to develop and launch a
    bilateral Technology Prosperity Deal to establish joint initiatives
    to cooperate and invest in AI, quantum, and other critical
    technologies.
