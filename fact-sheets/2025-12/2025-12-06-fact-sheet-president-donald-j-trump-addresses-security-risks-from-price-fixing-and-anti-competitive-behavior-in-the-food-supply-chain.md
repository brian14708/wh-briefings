title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Addresses Security Risks from Price
  Fixing and Anti-Competitive Behavior in the Food Supply Chain'
---
 
**PROTECTING AMERICA’S FOOD SUPPLY AND FAMILY BUDGETS:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to stop price
fixing, anti-competitive behavior, and foreign influence that drives up
grocery prices and threatens the security of America’s food supply.

-   The Order directs the Attorney General and the Chairman of the
    Federal Trade Commission to each establish a Food Supply Chain
    Security Task Force within their respective agencies to aggressively
    investigate price fixing and anti-competitive practices across the
    food sector.
-   Both Task Forces are empowered to bring enforcement actions and
    propose new rules to stop anti-competitive behavior and restore
    competition.
-   The Attorney General is directed to pursue criminal proceedings,
    including grand jury investigations, if evidence of criminal
    collusion is uncovered.
-   The Task Forces will jointly consult with relevant members of
    Congress in six months and then one year from the date of the order
    to provide progress updates subject to applicable law and recommend
    appropriate Congressional action, if any.

**STOPPING PRICE FIXING AND FOREIGN CONTROL:** President Trump
understands that an affordable and secure food supply is vital to
America’s national and economic security, but that anti-competitive
behavior threatens its stability and affordability.

-   In recent years, major players in America’s food supply chain have
    paid tens of millions to settle price fixing lawsuits.
-   Sectors including meat processing, seed, fertilizer, and farm
    equipment may be vulnerable to anti-competitive manipulation that
    result in higher prices for farmers and consumers.
-   Foreign-controlled companies are increasingly involved in key
    segments, potentially creating national security risks and driving
    up the cost of food for American families—issues the Task Forces are
    specifically directed to investigate.
-   Without aggressive enforcement, price fixing and anti-competitive
    behavior will continue to inflate grocery bills and weaken America’s
    food independence.

**DELIVERING LOWER COSTS FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES:** President Trump is
fighting every day to reverse Biden’s inflation crisis and bring down
sky-high grocery prices – and he will not rest until every American
feels the relief at the checkout line.

-   On Day One, President Trump declared a National Energy Emergency to
    eliminate bureaucratic barriers, unleash innovation, and restore
    America’s position as the world’s leading energy producer. 
-   In July, President Trump signed the largest tax cuts in American
    history, leaving families with thousands more in their pockets each
    year.
-   Last month, President Trump directed the Department of Justice to
    launch an investigation into the nation’s largest meat packing
    companies for potential collusion, price fixing, and price
    manipulation.
-   By halting proposed Biden-era regulations, President Trump has
    already saved Americans over $180 billion, or $2,100 per family of
    four.
-   Under Biden, workers lost over $2,900 in purchasing power — meaning
    inflation rose faster than wages. Under President Trump, even after
    accounting for higher prices, real wages have grown by $700 and are
    on track to increase by $1,200 after his first full year.
-   While lower prices can’t happen overnight, we’re making big progress
    and will keep working to make sure everyone benefits.
