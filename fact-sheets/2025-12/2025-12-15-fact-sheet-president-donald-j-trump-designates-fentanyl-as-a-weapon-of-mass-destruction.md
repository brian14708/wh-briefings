title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Designates Fentanyl as a Weapon of Mass
  Destruction'
---
 
**DEFENDING AMERICA FROM A CHEMICAL WEAPON:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed an Executive Order designating illicit fentanyl and its
core precursor chemical as weapons of mass destruction (WMD).

-   The Order directs the Attorney General to immediately pursue
    criminal charges, sentencing enhancements, and sentencing variances
    in fentanyl trafficking cases.
-   The Order directs the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the
    Treasury to pursue appropriate actions against relevant assets and
    financial institutions for those involved in or supporting the
    manufacture, distribution, and sale of illicit fentanyl and its core
    precursor chemicals.
-   The Order directs the Secretary of War and Attorney General to
    determine whether the Department of War should provide enhanced
    national security resources to the Department of Justice as
    necessary during an emergency situation involving a weapon of mass
    destruction.
-   The Order directs the Secretary of War, in consultation with the
    Secretary of Homeland Security, to update their chemical incident
    response-related directives to include the fentanyl threat.
-   The Order directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to identify
    fentanyl smuggling networks using WMD and nonproliferation related
    threat intelligence.

**STOPPING FENTANYL FROM POISONING OUR PEOPLE:** President Trump is
unleashing every available tool against the cartels and foreign networks
that have turned fentanyl into the leading cause of death for Americans
aged 18-45.

-   Illicit fentanyl is closer to a chemical weapon than a narcotic,
    claiming the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans.
-   Just two milligrams of fentanyl—equivalent to 10-15 grains of table
    salt—is considered a lethal dose.
-   Cartels and Foreign Terrorist Organizations use fentanyl profits to
    fund assassinations, terrorism, and insurgencies while waging armed
    conflict over trafficking routes and other facets of their
    operations.
-   The potential for fentanyl to be weaponized for concentrated,
    large-scale terror attacks by organized adversaries is a serious
    threat to the United States.
-   By designating illicit fentanyl as a WMD, President Trump is
    ensuring the full weight of the Federal government is focused,
    coordinated, and mobilized to confront fentanyl as the deadly
    chemical weapon it is.

**MAKING AMERICA SAFE AGAIN:** President Trump will not rest until the
cartels are dismantled, illicit fentanyl is eradicated from America’s
streets, and every family is safe from this chemical weapon.

-   Immediately upon returning to office, President Trump declared a
    National Emergency at the southern border that allowed the United
    States to gain operational control of the border, combat the
    cartels, and secure our Nation.
-   President Trump designated eight cartels as Foreign Terrorist
    Organizations (FTOs) and Specially Designated Global Terrorists
    (SDGTs), including Tren de Aragua and MS-13, to combat their
    violence and drug trafficking.
-   President Trump imposed tariffs to deal with Mexico’s, Canada’s, and
    China’s failure to address the flow of poisonous fentanyl and other
    drugs into our country.
-   President Trump authorized military strikes to stop lethal drugs,
    destroy narco-boats, and disrupt the narcoterrorists who are
    poisoning the American people.
-   President Trump signed the HALT Fentanyl Act into law—permanently
    classifying fentanyl-related substances as a Schedule I drug under
    the Controlled Substances Act. He is now taking the fight to the
    next level by designating illicit fentanyl as a WMD to stop the
    cartels and protect American families.
