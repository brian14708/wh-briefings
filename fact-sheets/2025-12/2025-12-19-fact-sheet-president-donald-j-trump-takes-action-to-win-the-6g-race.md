    be cleared for full-power commercial 6G use.
    -   Federal incumbents have 12 months to submit relocation plans
        that protect national security missions while freeing this prime
        spectrum for American industry.
-   The Memorandum directs immediate study of two other critical
    spectrum bands—2.69-2.9 GHz and 4.4-4.94 GHz—as part of an effort to
