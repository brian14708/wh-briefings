title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Adjusts Imports of Timber, Lumber, and
  Their Derivative Products into the United States'
---
 
**SUPPORTING AMERICA’S LUMBER INDUSTRY:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed a Proclamation invoking Section 232 of the Trade Expansion
Act of 1962 (Act) to delay increases in tariffs for upholstered
furniture, kitchen cabinets, and vanities for another year.

-   The United States continues to engage in productive negotiations
    with trade partners to address trade reciprocity and national
    security concerns with respect to imports of wood products.
-   The United States will therefore delay the increase in tariff rates
    for upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets, and vanities that was
    set to take place on January 1, 2026, under the September 29, 2025
    Proclamation for an additional year.
-   The current 25% tariff on certain upholstered furniture, kitchen
    cabinets, and vanities, as imposed under the September 25, 2025
    Proclamation, will remain in effect.

**ADDRESSING THE THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY:** Earlier this year,
President Trump imposed tariffs on imports of timber, lumber, and their
derivative products (wood products) to bolster American industry and
protect national security.

-   This followed the Secretary of Commerce’s completion of a Section
    232 investigation under the Act, which found that the present
    quantities and circumstances of the imports of wood products
    threatened to impair national security.
-   President Trump recognizes that an overreliance on foreign timber,
    lumber, and their derivative products could jeopardize the United
    States’ defense capabilities, construction industry, and economic
    strength.
-   America’s reliance on imported lumber is exacerbated by foreign
    government subsidies and predatory trade practices that undermine
    the competitiveness of the U.S. wood products industry.
-   Given the ongoing productive negotiations regarding the imports of
    wood products, the President is delaying the tariff increase to
    allow for further negotiations to occur with other countries. 

**BUILDING ON A RECORD OF SECURING CRITICAL INDUSTRIES AND SUPPLY
CHAINS:** This Proclamation builds on previous actions taken by the
Trump Administration to ensure U.S. trade and industrial policies serve
the national interest.

-   On Day One, President Trump established his America First Trade
    Policy to make America’s economy great again.

<!-- -->

-   President Trump has repeatedly used Section 232 tariffs to protect
    against threats to our national security and to strengthen
    manufacturing critical for our national and economic security,
    including on steel, aluminum, copper, and autos.
    -   The Department of Commerce is currently conducting additional
        investigations, including on semiconductors, pharmaceuticals,
        commercial aircraft, wind turbines, robotics, unmanned aircraft
        systems, and personal protective equipment.
-   President Trump imposed reciprocal tariffs to take back America’s
    economic sovereignty, address nonreciprocal trade relationships that
    threaten our economic and national security, and to remedy the
    consequences of nonreciprocal trade.
-   President Trump has issued several Executive Orders, Proclamations,
    and Presidential Memoranda to boost mining, manufacturing, and
    investment in domestic industry, including by reducing regulations
    and eliminating bureaucracy.
