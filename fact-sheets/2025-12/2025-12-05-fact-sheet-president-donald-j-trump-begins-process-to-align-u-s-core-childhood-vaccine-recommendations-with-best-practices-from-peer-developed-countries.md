title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Begins Process to Align U.S. Core Childhood
  Vaccine Recommendations with Best Practices from Peer, Developed Countries'

**ALIGNING THE CHILDHOOD VACCINE SCHEDULE WITH INTERNATIONAL BEST
PRACTICES:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed a Presidential
Memorandum to begin the process to align U.S. core childhood vaccine
recommendations with best practices from peer, developed countries.

-   The Memorandum directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services
    (HHS Secretary) and the Acting Director of the Centers for Disease
    Control and Prevention (CDC Director) to review best practices from
    peer, developed countries for core childhood vaccination
    recommendations — vaccines recommended for all children — and the
    scientific evidence that informs those best practices.
-   If the HHS Secretary and the CDC Director determine that those best
    practices are superior to current domestic recommendations, they are
    directed to update the United States core childhood vaccine schedule
    to align with such scientific evidence and best practices from peer,
    developed countries while preserving access to vaccines currently
    available to Americans.

**ENSURING AMERICANS ARE RECEIVING THE BEST MEDICAL ADVICE IN THE
WORLD:** Among peer nations, the United States is a high outlier in the
number of vaccinations recommended for all children.

-   When President Trump returned to office in January 2025, the United
    States recommended vaccinating all children for 18 diseases,
    including COVID-19.
-   By comparison, Denmark recommends vaccinations for just 10 diseases
    with serious morbidity or mortality risks, Japan recommends
    vaccinations for 14 diseases, and Germany recommends vaccinations
    for 15 diseases. The timing and administration of the vaccines also
    varies by country.
-   The United States currently recommends yearly influenza vaccines
    starting at six months, while many peer countries do not recommend
    yearly influenza vaccination as a core vaccination for all children.
-   Practices like the hepatitis B vaccination at birth are standard in
    the United States, but uncommon in most developed countries, where
    it is typically only recommended for newborns of mothers who test
    positive for the infection.

**MAKING OUR CHILDREN HEALTHY AGAIN:** President Trump is committed to
building a healthier future for America, starting with our youngest
generation.

-   In February, President Trump signed an Executive Order establishing
    the President’s MAHA Commission, tasking the Commission with
    investigating and addressing the root causes of America’s escalating
    health crisis—with an initial focus on childhood chronic diseases.
-   The Trump Administration ended the blanket recommendation for all
    children to get the COVID-19 vaccine, updating its recommendation to
    be based on shared clinical decision-making between patients and
    clinicians.

In September, the MAHA Commission released *the Make Our Children
Healthy Again Strategy*, a sweeping plan with more than 120 initiatives
to reverse the failed policies that fueled America’s childhood chronic
disease epidemic. The strategy prioritized development of a vaccine
framework that ensures America has the best childhood vaccine schedule.

In May, the MAHA Commission released the *Make Our Children Healthy
Again Assessment,* summarizing what is known and what questions remain
regarding the childhood chronic disease crisis.
