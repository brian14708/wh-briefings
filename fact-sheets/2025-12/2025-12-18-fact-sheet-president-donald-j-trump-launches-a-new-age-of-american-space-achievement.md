**ENSURING AMERICAN SPACE SUPERIORITY:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed an Executive Order that sets a bold vision for an America
First space policy, ensuring the United States leads the world in space
exploration, security, and commerce.

-   The Order calls for Americans’ return to the Moon by 2028, and the
    establishment of initial elements of a permanent lunar outpost by
    2030.
-   The Order directs the deployment of nuclear reactors on the Moon and
    in orbit, including a lunar surface reactor ready for launch by
    2030.
-   The Order ensures our ability to detect, characterize, and counter
    the full range of security threats to U.S. space interests.
-   The Order spurs private sector innovation and investment by
    upgrading launch infrastructure and developing a commercial pathway
    to replace the International Space Station by 2030.
-   The Order directs the Assistant to the President for Science and
    Technology to coordinate National Space Policy efforts, and Federal
    departments and agencies to work together on the Order’s
    implementation, including streamlining procurement, implementing
    relevant space security strategies, and ensuring an appropriate
    workforce to accomplish these goals.

**SECURING AMERICA’S NATIONAL AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS:** At a time when
our adversaries are challenging American space leadership, President
Trump is securing and defending vital American interests in, from, and
to space.

-   Growing a vibrant commercial space economy through the power of
    American free enterprise will build prosperity and open new economic
    opportunities, such as high-paying aerospace manufacturing jobs here
    in America.
-   Enabling next-generation space capabilities will give Americans
    better positioning, navigation, and timing services for precision
    agriculture, more accurate weather forecasts for safe and
    predictable airline travel, and ubiquitous satellite-enabled
    communications for global broadband internet access.
-   Protecting critical space assets and activities is essential for
    military readiness and for defending America’s economic dominance. 
-   Expanding human reach and American presence in space honors our
    pioneering legacy, ensures America remains at the forefront of space
    discovery and achievement, and drives innovation with spillover
    applications as far-ranging as memory foam, scratch-resistant
    lenses, cordless power tools, and heart pumps.

**BUILDING AMERICAN STRENGTH AND DRIVING ACHIEVEMENT:** President Trump
has demonstrated consistent leadership as a driving force for American
strength and achievement in space.

    competition in the commercial space industry, ensuring the United
    States maintains its leading role in the commercial use of space.
-   President Trump promised that “We will lead humanity back to the
    moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an
    astronaut on Mars.”
-   President Trump spearheaded the establishment of the Space Force,

    Air Force more than 70 years ago.
    -   The Space Force is critical to preparing the Department of War
        for evolving warfighting conditions and expanding our
        capabilities.
-   During his first term, President Trump issued seven groundbreaking
    Space Policy Directives instructing NASA to return American
    astronauts to the Moon, reforming our Nation’s commercial space
    regulatory framework, establishing cybersecurity principles for
    space systems, and much more.
-   In January 2021, President Trump issued an Executive Order promoting
    small modular reactors for National defense and space exploration.

    encourage space resource recovery and utilization.
