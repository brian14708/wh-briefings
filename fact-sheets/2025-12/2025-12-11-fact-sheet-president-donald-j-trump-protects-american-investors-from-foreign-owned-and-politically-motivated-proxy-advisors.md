title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Protects American Investors from Foreign-Owned
  and Politically-Motivated Proxy Advisors'

**PROTECTING AMERICAN INVESTORS AND RETIREMENT SAVINGS:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to end the outsized
influence of proxy advisors that prioritize radical political agendas
over investor returns.

-   The Order directs the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange
    Commission (SEC) to review and, as appropriate, rescind or revise
    all rules and regulations related to proxy-advisors that implicate
    “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI) and “environmental, social,
    and governance” (ESG) priorities, as well as rules related to
    shareholder proxy proposals that are inconsistent with the policies
    in the Order.
    -   It requires the SEC to enforce anti-fraud provisions in
        securities laws against proxy advisors with respect to their
        voting recommendations, consider requiring proxy advisors to
        register as investment advisers, consider requiring proxy
        advisors to provide increased transparency on conflicts of
        interest, examine whether proxy advisors serve as a vehicle for
        investment advisers to coordinate their voting decisions, and
        assess whether registered investment advisers breach their
        fiduciary duties by hiring proxy advisors to advise on,
        non-pecuniary factors in investing, including on factors such as
        DEI and ESG, and subsequently follow their recommendations.
-   The Order directs the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission
    (FTC), in consultation with the Attorney General, to determine
    whether proxy advisors are engaged in unfair methods of competition
    or unfair or deceptive acts or practices and to review ongoing state
    antitrust investigations into proxy advisors for violations of
    Federal antitrust law.
-   The Order directs the Secretary of Labor to strengthen ERISA
    fiduciary rules and increase fiduciaries’ transparency regarding
    their use of proxy advisors, ensuring proxy advisors and plan
    managers act solely in the financial interest of American workers
    and retirees.

**RESTORING CONFIDENCE IN THE PROXY ADVISOR INDUSTRY:** President Trump
is stopping foreign-owned proxy giants from using Americans’ 401(k)s,
IRAs, and pensions to force leftist policies on U.S. companies.

-   Two foreign-owned proxy advisors—Institutional Shareholder Services
    and Glass Lewis—dominate more than 90% of the proxy advisor market
    and routinely recommend votes for racial equity audits, aggressive
    GHG emission cuts, and other actions that are similarly designed to
    advance radical politically-motivated agendas like DEI and ESG.
-   These firms’ clients often adopt the proxy advisor firms’
    recommendations without independent analysis, giving proxy advisors
    enormous power over shareholder proposals, board composition,
    executive compensation, and other corporate governance matters at
    America’s largest companies.
-   Their politically-motivated advice has prioritized ideological goals
    over maximizing returns for millions of hard working- and
    middle-class American investors.
-   Conflicts of interest, lack of transparency, and one-size-fits-all
    voting policies have eroded trust and hurt the value of retirement
    savings for everyday Americans. 

**BUILDING WEALTH FOR ALL AMERICANS:** President Trump is enhancing
financial opportunities and retirement security for all Americans,
ensuring they can build wealth and thrive.

-   On the campaign trail, President Trump vowed to “sign an Executive
    Order … to keep politics away from America’s retirement accounts
    forever. I will demand that funds invest your money to help you, not
    them, but to help you. Not to help the radical left communists,
    because that’s exactly what they are.”
-   Through tax cuts and deregulation, President Trump is delivering on
    his promise to Make America Wealthy Again, empowering workers to
    save and invest more for their retirement.
-   Under President Trump’s Working Families Tax Cuts Act, the vast
    majority of senior citizens will pay no tax on their Social Security
    benefits.
-   President Trump signed an Executive Order to allow 401(k) investors
    to access alternative assets for better returns and diversification.
