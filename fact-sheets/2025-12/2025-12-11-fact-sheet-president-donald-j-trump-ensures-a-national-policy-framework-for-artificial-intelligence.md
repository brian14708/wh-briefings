title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Ensures a National Policy Framework
  for Artificial Intelligence'
---
 
**PREVENTING A PATCHWORK OF AI REGULATIONS:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed an Executive Order to protect American AI innovation from
an inconsistent and costly compliance regime resulting from varying
State laws. 

-   The Order directs the Attorney General to establish an AI Litigation
    Task Force to challenge unconstitutional, preempted, or otherwise
    unlawful State AI laws that harm innovation.
-   The Order directs the Secretary of Commerce to publish an evaluation
    of State AI laws that conflict with national AI policy priorities
    and withhold non-deployment Broadband Equity Access and Deployment
    (BEAD) funding from any State with such AI laws. Other agencies are
    directed to consider whether to make an absence of similar laws, or
    a policy of enforcement discretion with respect to any existing such
    laws, a condition of applicable discretionary grant programs.
-   The Order instructs the Federal Trade Commission and Federal
    Communications Commission to take actions that will limit States’
    ability to force AI companies to deceive consumers, including
    determining whether laws that force companies to embed DEI into
    their models cause those companies to violate the Federal Trade
    Commission Act, and considering whether to adopt a Federal reporting
    and disclosure standard for AI models.
-   The Order calls for the development of a national AI legislative
    framework that would preempt State AI laws that stifle innovation.

**STRENGTHENING AMERICAN COMPETITVENESS:** President Trump is acting
decisively to ensure our great technological pioneers can compete on the
world stage, ensuring America’s national security and economic
prosperity in the age of AI.

-   State legislatures have introduced over 1,000 different AI bills,
    creating a patchwork of rules, disclosures, and reporting
    requirements.
-   States such as California and Colorado are considering requiring AI
    companies to censor outputs and insert left-wing ideology in their
    programming.
-   Reducing the compliance costs and development burdens associated
    with varying state laws will lower barriers to entry in AI and
    enhance innovation, and ensure that American companies are not
    subject to restrictions that their international competitors do not
    face.
-   The most restrictive States should not be allowed to dictate
    national AI policy at the expense of America’s domination of this
    new frontier.

**ENABLING COMMON SENSE AI POLICY:** The Trump Administration supports a
common sense approach to AI policy. This means removing unnecessary red
tape, updating out-of-date rules created before AI advancements, and
clarifying new rules for certain sectors or use-cases.

-   President Trump: “Investment in AI is helping to make the U.S.
    Economy the ‘HOTTEST’ in the World, but overregulation by the States
    is threatening to undermine this Major Growth ‘Engine.’ Some States
    are even trying to embed DEI ideology into AI models, producing
    ‘Woke AI’ (Remember Black George Washington?). We MUST have one
    Federal Standard instead of a patchwork of 50 State Regulatory
    Regimes. If we don’t, then China will easily catch us in the AI
    race.”
-   The Trump Administration is committed to protecting the dignity,
    privacy, and safety of children in the digital age. In May 2025,
    President Trump signed the Take It Down Act, legislation championed
    by the First Lady to protect young Americans from deepfake
    exploitation online.
-   The Order builds on President Trump’s record of promoting AI models
    that seek truth and accuracy. In July 2025, he signed an Executive
    Order preventing the federal government from using AI models that
    include ideological biases or social agendas.
-   Today’s Executive Order delivers on President Trump’s AI Action Plan
    released in July 2025, which called for examining and removing
    onerous regulations that hinder America’s ability to lead in this
    key technology.
