title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump is Increasing Medical Marijuana and
  Cannabidiol Research'
---
 
**RECOGNIZING AND IMPROVING KNOWLEDGE OF MEDICAL USES OF MARIJUANA AND
CANNABIDIOL FOR PATIENTS AND DOCTORS:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order that will improve medical marijuana and
cannabidiol research to better inform patients and doctors.

-   The Order directs the Attorney General to expedite completion of the
    process of rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III of the Controlled
    Substance Act (CSA).
-   The Order directs the White House Deputy Chief of Staff for
    Legislative, Political, and Public Affairs to work with the Congress
    to allow Americans to benefit from access to appropriate
    full-spectrum CBD products while still restricting the sale of
    products that pose serious health risks.
-   The Order directs HHS to develop research methods and models
    utilizing real-world evidence to improve access to hemp-derived
    cannabinoid products in accordance with Federal law and to inform
    standards of care.

**REMOVING BARRIERS TO RESEARCH:** Rescheduling marijuana corrects the
Federal government’s long delay in recognizing the medical use of
marijuana and will vastly improve research on safety and efficacy.  

-   Marijuana is currently controlled as a Schedule I substance, which
    is defined as having no currently accepted medical use, a high
    potential for abuse, and a lack of accepted safety for use under
    medical supervision. 
-   Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is consistent with the 2023
    recommendation from the Department of Health and Human Services
    (HHS) that recognized for the first time that marijuana has a
    currently accepted medical use.
-   40 U.S. states plus the District of Columbia have State or
    locally-sanctioned, regulated medical marijuana programs, and HHS
    found that 30,000 licensed health care practitioners are authorized
    to recommend the medical use of marijuana for more than six million
    registered patients for at least 15 medical conditions.
-   The FDA reviewed the landscape of medical use of marijuana and found
    credible scientific support for its use to treat anorexia related to
    a medical condition, nausea and vomiting, and pain.
    -   Chronic pain affects nearly one in four U.S. adults and more
        than one in three U.S. seniors, and six in 10 people who use
        medical marijuana report doing so to manage pain.

    -   One in 10 seniors used marijuana in the last year and evidence
        shows improvements in some seniors’ health-related quality of
        life and pain with medical marijuana use.
-   However, the lack of appropriate research on medical marijuana and
    consequent lack of FDA approval leaves American patients and doctors
    without adequate guidance on appropriate prescribing and
    utilization, especially as just over half of older Americans using
    marijuana have discussed the usage with their healthcare provider.
-   Schedule III status will allow research studies to incorporate
    real-world evidence and models that can assess the health outcomes
    of medical marijuana and legal CBD products while focusing on
    long-term health effects in vulnerable populations like adolescents
    and young adults.

**IMPROVING ACCESS TO CANNABIDIOL PRODUCTS:** President Trump is paving
the way for enhanced research and better information on hemp-derived
cannabinoid products, helping to inform patients and doctors about their
potential role in managing common health conditions.

-   Hemp-derived cannabinoid products, primarily containing CBD, are not
    controlled substances under the CSA but currently lack a clear FDA
    regulatory pathway, limiting product consistency and consumer
    protections.
-   Hemp-derived cannabinoid products have potential to improve patient
    symptoms for common ailments and are frequently used by Americans.
    -   One in five U.S. adults and nearly 15% of seniors reported using
        CBD in the past year.

    <!-- -->

    -   Clinical studies have shown that chronic pain patients have
        reported improvements with CBD use.
-   The challenging legal landscape for CBD products, including recent
    changes that affect full-spectrum CBD products, leaves American
    patients and doctors without adequate guidance or product
    safeguards.
-   Legislative solutions and innovative research methods and models are
    needed to improve access and inform standards of care. This
    Administration is committed to work expeditiously to provide clarity
    and access as appropriate.

**DELIVERING ON PROMISES TO HELP IMPROVE HEALTHCARE FOR ALL AMERICANS:**
President Trump is committed to ensuring our seniors, our veterans, and
all Americans have access to the best medical treatments and research
infrastructure in the world.

-   President Trump has announced five deals with major pharmaceutical
    manufacturers to bring prices in line with those paid in other
    developed nations, which will provide substantial price relief on
    numerous products taken by millions of Americans.
-   In February, President Trump signed an Executive Order to that will
    ensure patients have access to clear, accurate prices before they
    receive care.
-   In April, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Food
    and Drug Administration announced a series of measures to phase out
    all petroleum-based synthetic dyes from the nation’s food supply.
-   In May, President Trump signed an Executive Order  to increase
    options for care, benefits, and services for our veterans. This
    includes reduced wait times for Veterans Health Administration
    appointments through options such as expanded hours, weekend
    appointments, and virtual healthcare. 
-   Also in May, President Trump signed an Executive Order to impose the
    highest standards of scientific rigor on both the development and
    use of science by Federal agencies to restore public trust and
    ensure that policymaking follows, or adequately addresses,
    scientific findings, for demonstratable positive outcomes for the
    American public.
-   In July, President Trump signed into law the historic Working
    Families Tax Cuts Act that included, among other things, an
    unprecedented $50 billion investment into transforming healthcare in
    rural communities.
-   The historic law also expanded access to Health Savings Accounts
    that give millions of Americans more control over their healthcare
    dollars and increased access to Direct Primary Care.
-   The Trump Administration is accelerating the approval and
    availability of safe, effective medicines by reducing unnecessary
    clinical testing for biosimilars—expanding patient options and
    lowering costs for millions.
