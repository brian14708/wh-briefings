title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Announces the Reset of Corporate Average
  Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards'
---
 
**DELIVERING A WIN FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES AND AUTOMAKERS: **Today,
President Donald J. Trump is delivering major relief to American
families by resetting the Biden Administration’s costly and unlawful
Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.

-   President Trump is returning CAFE standards to levels that can
    actually be met with conventional gasoline and diesel vehicles. The
    Biden Administration standards imposed unrealistic fuel economy
    targets that effectively resulted in an electric vehicle (EV)
    mandate.
-   The Trump Administration’s reset of the CAFE standards ensures the
    program’s fidelity to the legal restrictions set forth by Congress.
-   The Biden standards broke the law by going far beyond the
    requirements that were mandated by Congress when it created the CAFE
    program.

**SAVING AMERICAN FAMILIES MONEY:** Today’s action represents an
enormous win in response to the cost-of-living increases imposed on the
economy by the Biden Administration.

-   The Biden Administration created extraordinarily stringent fuel
    economy standards for passenger cars and trucks, set at such
    aggressive levels that they were impossible to meet with available
    technologies for gas cars.
-   The Biden standards would have compelled widespread shifts to EVs
    that American consumers did not ask for, accompanied by significant
    cost-of-living increases. Since EVs are so expensive to build,
    automakers must sell them at a loss and make up the difference by
    significantly raising the sticker price of gas cars.
-   If President Trump had done nothing, the Biden standards would have
    raised the average cost of a new car by nearly $1,000, relative to
    the cost under the standards announced today.
-   President Trump’s actions will save American families $109 billion
    in total over the next five years.
-   By helping more Americans buy newer, safer vehicles, this reset is
    projected to save more than 1,500 lives and prevent nearly a
    quarter-million serious injuries through 2050.

**MARKING A CRITICAL BATTLE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST BIDEN’S HIDDEN
COST-OF-LIVING INCREASES**: The CAFE reset represents the latest action
by President Trump to prevent the Biden EV-related policies from raising
costs for Americans.

-   In June, President Trump signed a joint resolution to end the
    California EV mandates, which would have effectively been a 100% ban
    on new gas cars sold in the state by 2035 (with similar effects in
    17 states that adopted California’s standards).
-   In July, President Trump signed into law the Working Families Tax
    Cuts Act, which set the civil penalty for violating CAFE standards
    to $0, protecting the U.S. auto manufacturing industry from
    significant fines.
-   Under President Trump, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has
    also released its proposal to rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding,
    which ignores Congress’ clear intent under the Clean Air Act and has
    been used to justify over $1 trillion in costs for the American
    consumers and economy.
-   Today’s action helps ensure that even if far-left Democrats return
    to power, the CAFE standards are sensible, so U.S. automakers are
    not held to infeasible standards.
-   Combined with auto loan interest deductibility for new
    made-in-the-USA vehicles, President Trump continues to deliver real
    relief that makes owning a safe, reliable car more affordable for
    every American family.
