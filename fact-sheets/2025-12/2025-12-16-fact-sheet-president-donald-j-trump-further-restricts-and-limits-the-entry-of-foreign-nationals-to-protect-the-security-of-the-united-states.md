title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Further Restricts and Limits the Entry
  of Foreign Nationals to Protect the Security of the United States'

**STRENGTHENING NATIONAL SECURITY THROUGH COMMON SENSE RESTRICTIONS
BASED ON DATA:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed a Proclamation
expanding and strengthening entry restrictions on nationals from
countries with demonstrated, persistent, and severe deficiencies in
screening, vetting, and information-sharing to protect the Nation from
national security and public safety threats.

-   The Proclamation continues the full restrictions and entry
    limitations of nationals from the original 12 high-risk countries
    established under Proclamation 10949: Afghanistan, Burma, Chad,
    Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran,
    Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen.
-   It adds full restrictions and entry limitations on 5 additional
    countries based on recent analysis: Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South
    Sudan, and Syria.
-   It also adds full restrictions and entry limitations on individuals
    holding Palestinian-Authority-issued travel documents. 
-   It imposes full restrictions and entry limitations on 2 countries
    that were previously subject to partial restrictions: Laos and
    Sierra Leone.
-   The Proclamation continues partial restrictions of nationals from 4
    of the 7 original high-risk countries: Burundi, Cuba, Togo, and
    Venezuela.
    -   Because Turkmenistan has engaged productively with the United
        States and demonstrated significant progress since the previous
        Proclamation, this new Proclamation lifts the ban on its
        nonimmigrant visas, while maintaining the suspension of entry
        for Turkmen nationals as immigrants.
-   It adds partial restrictions and entry limitations on 15 additional
    countries: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Cote d’Ivoire,
    Dominica, Gabon, The Gambia, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal,
    Tanzania, Tonga, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.
-   The Proclamation includes exceptions for lawful permanent residents,
    existing visa holders, certain visa categories like athletes and
    diplomats, and individuals whose entry serves U.S. national
    interests.
    -   The Proclamation narrows broad family-based immigrant visa
        carve-outs that carry demonstrated fraud risks, while preserving
        case-by-case waivers.

**SECURING OUR BORDERS AND INTERESTS:** The restrictions and limitations
imposed by the Proclamation are necessary to prevent the entry of
foreign nationals about whom the United States lacks sufficient
information to assess the risks they pose, garner cooperation from
foreign governments, enforce our immigration laws, and advance other
important foreign policy, national security, and counterterrorism
objectives.

-   It is the President’s duty to take action to ensure that those
    seeking to enter our country will not harm the American people.
-   After consulting with cabinet officials and in light of the original
    report pursuant to Executive Order 14161, Proclamation 10949, and
    country-specific information gathered since, President Trump has
    determined that the entry of nationals from additional countries
    must be restricted or limited to protect U.S. national security and
    public safety interests.
-   The restrictions are country-specific in order to encourage
    cooperation with the subject countries in recognition of each
    country’s unique circumstances.
-   Many of the restricted countries suffer from widespread corruption,
    fraudulent or unreliable civil documents and criminal records, and
    nonexistent birth-registration systems—systemically preventing
    accurate vetting.
-   Some nations refuse to share passport exemplars or law-enforcement
    data, while others permit Citizenship-by-Investment schemes that
    conceal identity and bypass vetting requirements and travel
    restrictions.
-   Some countries’ high visa-overstay rates and refusal to repatriate
    removable nationals demonstrate disregard for U.S. immigration laws
    and burden American enforcement resources.
-   Terrorist presence, criminal activity, and extremist activity in
    several listed countries result in a general lack of stability and
    government control—which causes deficient vetting capabilities and
    poses direct risks to American citizens and interests when nationals
    from these countries are admitted to the United States.

**MAKING AMERICA SAFE AGAIN:** President Trump is keeping his promise to
restore travel restrictions on dangerous countries and to secure our
borders.

-   In his first term, President Trump imposed travel restrictions that
    restricted entry from several countries with inadequate vetting
    processes or that posed significant security risks.
-   The Supreme Court upheld the travel restrictions put in place in the
    prior Administration, ruling that it “is squarely within the scope
    of Presidential authority” and noting that it is “expressly premised
    on legitimate purposes”—namely, “preventing entry of nationals who
    cannot be adequately vetted and inducing other nations to improve
    their practices.”
-   In June 2025, President Trump restored the travel restrictions from
    his first-term, incorporating an updated assessment of current
    global screening, vetting, and security risks.

**JUSTIFICATION FOR FULL SUSPENSION**

***Burkina Faso***

-   According to the Department of State, terrorist organizations
    continue to plan and conduct terrorist activities throughout Burkina
    Faso. According to the Fiscal Year 2024, Department of Homeland
    Security (DHS) Entry/Exit Overstay Report (“Overstay Report”),
    Burkina Faso had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 9.16 percent and a
    student (F), vocational (M), and exchange visitor (J) visa overstay
    rate of 22.95 percent. Additionally, Burkina Faso has historically
    refused to accept back its removable nationals.

***Laos***

-   According to the Overstay Report, Laos had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay
    rate of 28.34 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 11.41
    percent. According to the Fiscal Year 2023, Department of Homeland
    Security (DHS) Entry/Exit Overstay Report (“2023 Overstay Report”),
    Laos had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 34.77 percent and an F, M,
    and J visa overstay rate of 6.49 percent. Additionally, Laos has
    historically failed to accept back its removable nationals.

***Mali***

-   According to the Department of State, armed conflict between the
    Malian government and armed groups is common throughout the country.
    Terrorist organizations operate freely in certain areas of Mali. 

***Niger***

-   According to the Department of State, terrorists and their
    supporters are active in planning kidnappings in Niger, and they may
    attack anywhere in the country.  According to the Overstay Report,
    Niger had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 13.41 percent and an F, M,
    and J visa overstay rate of 16.46 percent.

***Sierra Leone***

-   According to the Overstay Report, Sierra Leone had a B-1/B-2
    overstay rate of 16.48 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate
    of 35.83 percent. According to the 2023 Overstay Report, Sierra
    Leone had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 15.43 percent and an F, M,
    and J visa overstay rate of 35.83 percent. Additionally, Sierra
    Leone has historically failed to accept back its removable
    nationals.

***South Sudan***

-   According to the Overstay Report, South Sudan had a B-1/B-2 visa
    overstay rate of 6.99 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate
    of 26.09 percent. Additionally, South Sudan has historically failed
    to accept back its removable nationals.

***Syria***

-   Syria is emerging from a protracted period of civil unrest and
    internal strife. While the country is working to address its
    security challenges in close coordination with the United States,
    Syria still lacks an adequate central authority for issuing
    passports or civil documents and does not have appropriate screening
    and vetting measures. According to the Overstay Report, Syria had a
    B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 7.09 percent and a F, M, and J visa
    overstay rate of 9.34 percent. 

***Palestinian Authority Documents***

-   Several U.S.-designated terrorist groups operate actively in the
    West Bank or Gaza Strip and have murdered American citizens. Also,
    the recent war in these areas likely resulted in compromised vetting
    and screening abilities. In light of these factors, and considering
    the weak or nonexistent control exercised over these areas by the
    PA, individuals attempting to travel on PA-issued or endorsed travel
    documents cannot currently be properly vetted and approved for entry
    into the United States.

**JUSTIFICATION FOR PARTIAL SUSPENSION (Immigrants and Nonimmigrants on
B-1, B-2, B-1/B-2, F, M, and J Visas)**

    the country, which creates substantial screening and vetting
    difficulties.

***Nigeria***

    State operate freely in certain parts of Nigeria, which creates
