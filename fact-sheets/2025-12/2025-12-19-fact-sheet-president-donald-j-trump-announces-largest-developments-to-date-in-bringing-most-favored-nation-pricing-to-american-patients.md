title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Announces Largest Developments to Date
  in Bringing Most-Favored-Nation Pricing to American Patients'
---
 
**LOWERING DRUG PRICES FOR AMERICAN PATIENTS:** Today, President Donald
J. Trump announced nine new agreements with major pharmaceutical
companies to lower prescription drug prices for Americans in line with
the lowest prices paid by other developed nations (known as the
most-favored-nation, or MFN, price).

-   The nine manufacturers include Amgen, Bristol Myers Squibb,
    Boehringer Ingelheim, Genentech, Gilead Sciences, GSK, Merck,
    Novartis, and Sanofi.
-   The agreements reduce prices on drugs that treat numerous costly and
    chronic conditions, including type two diabetes, rheumatoid
    arthritis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary
    disease (COPD), hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency virus
    (HIV), and certain cancers, among others.
-   The agreements will provide every State Medicaid program in the
    country access to MFN drug prices on products made by the nine
    companies, resulting in billions of dollars in savings and
    continuing President Trump’s historic efforts to strengthen the
    program for the most vulnerable.
-   The agreements ensure foreign nations can no longer use price
    controls to free ride on American innovation by guaranteeing MFN
    prices on all new innovative medicines the nine companies bring to
    market.
-   The agreements require the nine companies to repatriate increased
    foreign revenue on existing products that they realize as a result
    of the President’s strong America First U.S. trade policies for the
    benefit of American patients.
-   The agreements require the nine companies to offer medicines at a
    deep discount off the list price when selling directly to American
    patients through *TrumpRx*.

**DELIVERING LOWER COSTS:** Patients will be able to see massive price
reductions on numerous products when purchasing directly through
*TrumpRx* as a result of today’s actions. Select examples include:

-   Amgen will reduce the price of its cholesterol-lowering drug Repatha
    from $573 to $239 for patients purchasing directly through
    *TrumpRx*.
-   Bristol Myers Squibb will reduce the price of its HIV medication,
    Reyataz, from $1,449 to $217 for patients purchasing directly
    through *TrumpRx*.
-   Boehringer Ingelheim will reduce the price of its type two diabetes
    medication, Jentadeuto, from $525 to $55 for patients purchasing
    directly through *TrumpRx*.
-   Genentech will reduce the price of its flu medication, Xofluza, from
    $168 to $50 for patients purchasing directly through *TrumpRx.*
-   Gilead Sciences will reduce the price of its Hepatitis C medication,
    Epclusa, from $24,920 to $2,425 for patients purchasing directly
    through *TrumpRx*.
-   GSK will reduce the prices of its inhaler portfolio. Prices for the
    popular asthma inhaler Advair Diskus 500/50 will fall from $265 to
    $89 for patients purchasing directly through *TrumpRx*.
-   Merck will reduce the price of its diabetes medication, Januvia,
    from $330 to $100 for patients purchasing directly through
    *TrumpRx*.

    Mayzent, from $9,987 to $1,137 for patients purchasing directly
    through *TrumpRx*.
-   Sanofi will reduce the price of its prescription blood thinner,
    Plavix, from $756 to $16 for patients purchasing directly through
    *TrumpRx* and Sanofi will list its insulin products at *TrumpRx* at
    $35 per month’s supply.

**BOLSTERING NATIONAL HEALTH SECURITY BY INVESTING IN AMERICA:** The
pharmaceutical manufacturers involved in today’s announcement are
committing to invest at least $150  billion collectively in U.S.
manufacturing in the near term. Additionally, as part of the agreements,
several companies are donating active pharmaceutical ingredients for key
products to the Strategic Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Reserve
(SAPIR) to reduce reliance on foreign nations and ensure the United
States has an adequate supply of such products in the event of an
emergency.

-   GSK will contribute 98.8kg of albuterol, the active ingredient in a
    common rescue inhaler for people with asthma.
-   Bristol Myers Squibb will contribute tablets representing 6.5 tons
    of apixaban, the active ingredient in the drug Eliquis, a blood
    thinner taken by millions of American patients.
-   Merck will contribute 3.5 tons of ertapenem, an antibacterial
    medication used to treat complex infections.

**DELIVERING ON PROMISES TO PUT AMERICAN PATIENTS FIRST:** President
Trump is delivering on promises to ensure American patients no longer
pay high prices to subsidize low prices in the rest of the world,
something the political establishment did not believe was possible.

-   On May 12, 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order titled:
    “Delivering Most-Favored-Nation Prescription Drug Pricing to
    American Patients” directing the Administration to take numerous
    actions to bring American drug prices in line with those paid by
    similar nations.
-   On July 31, 2025, President Trump sent letters to leading
    pharmaceutical manufacturers outlining the steps they must take to
    bring down the prices of prescription drugs in the United States to
    match the lowest price offered in other developed nations.
-   Since September 30, 2025, President Trump has announced 14 deals
    with major pharmaceutical manufacturers to bring prices in line with
    those paid in other developed nations, which will provide
    substantial price relief on numerous products taken by millions of
    Americans.
-   On December 1, 2025, the Office of the United States Trade
    Representative, the Department of Commerce, and the Department of
    Health and Human Services announced an agreement with the United
    Kingdom (U.K.) that will increase the net price of new prescription
    drugs by 25% in the U.K., helping ensure they pay their fair share
    for innovative medicines.
