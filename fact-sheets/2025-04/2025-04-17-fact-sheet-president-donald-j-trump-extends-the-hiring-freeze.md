title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Extends the Hiring Freeze'
---
 
**EXTENDING THE HIRING FREEZE:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed
a Presidential Memorandum extending the hiring freeze for an additional
three months.

-   The freeze, originally implemented on January 20, 2025, prohibits
    filling vacant federal civilian positions or creating new ones, with
    minor exceptions.
    -   Exemptions from the freeze for necessary positions—including for
        immigration enforcement, national security, and public
        safety—shall remain.
-   This Memorandum extends the hiring freeze through July 15, 2025.
-   It also clarifies that once a merit hiring plan has been adopted,
    any hiring of employees exempt from the freeze shall be consistent
    with that plan.
-   Upon expiration of the hiring freeze and implementation of the
    hiring plan, agencies will be able to hire no more than one employee
    for every four employees that depart from federal service (with
    appropriate immigration, law enforcement, and public safety
    exceptions).

**PROMOTING FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY AND GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY:** The
extension of the hiring freeze is a critical step in shrinking the
federal government and ensuring taxpayer dollars are used efficiently.

-   In the last two years of the Biden Administration, government was
    directly responsible for the creation of more than 1 in every 4
    jobs.
-   President Trump is committed to reversing this trend by prioritizing
    private-sector job growth and reducing the federal workforce to
    focus on essential functions.

**REFORMING THE FEDERAL BUREAUCRACY:** The American people elected
President Trump to drain the swamp and end ineffective government
programs that empower government without achieving measurable results.

-   The government wastes billions of dollars each year on duplicative
    programs and frivolous expenditures that fail to align with American
    values or address the needs of the American people.
-   President Trump established the “Department of Government
    Efficiency” to examine how to streamline the Federal Government,
    eliminate unnecessary programs, and reduce bureaucratic
    inefficiency.
-   President Trump launched a 10-to-1 deregulation initiative, ensuring
    every new rule is justified by clear benefits.
-   President Trump authorized buyout programs to encourage federal
    employees to leave voluntarily.
-   Through these actions, President Trump is keeping his promise to
    restore efficiency and accountability in the Federal Government.
