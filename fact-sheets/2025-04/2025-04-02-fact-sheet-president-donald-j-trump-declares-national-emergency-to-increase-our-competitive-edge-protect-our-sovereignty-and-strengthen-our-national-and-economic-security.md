title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Declares National Emergency to Increase
  our Competitive Edge, Protect our Sovereignty, and Strengthen our National and Economic
  Security'
---
 
**PURSUING RECIPROCITY TO REBUILD THE ECONOMY AND RESTORE NATIONAL AND
ECONOMIC SECURITY:** Today, President Donald J. Trump declared that
foreign trade and economic practices have created a national emergency,
and his order imposes responsive tariffs to strengthen the international
economic position of the United States and protect American workers.

-   Large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits have led to
    the hollowing out of our manufacturing base; resulted in a lack of
    incentive to increase advanced domestic manufacturing capacity;
    undermined critical supply chains; and rendered our
    defense-industrial base dependent on foreign adversaries.
-   President Trump is invoking his authority under the International
    Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) to address the
    national emergency posed by the large and persistent trade deficit
    that is driven by the absence of reciprocity in our trade
    relationships and other harmful policies like currency manipulation
    and exorbitant value-added taxes (VAT) perpetuated by other
    countries.
-   Using his IEEPA authority, President Trump will impose a 10% tariff
    on all countries.
    -   This will take effect April 5, 2025 at 12:01 a.m. EDT.
-   President Trump will impose an individualized reciprocal higher
    tariff on the countries with which the United States has the largest
    trade deficits. All other countries will continue to be subject to
    the original 10% tariff baseline.
    -   This will take effect April 9, 2025 at 12:01 a.m. EDT.
-   These tariffs will remain in effect until such a time as President
    Trump determines that the threat posed by the trade deficit and
    underlying nonreciprocal treatment is satisfied, resolved, or
    mitigated.
-   Today’s IEEPA Order also contains modification authority, allowing
    President Trump to increase the tariff if trading partners retaliate
    or decrease the tariffs if trading partners take significant steps
    to remedy non-reciprocal trade arrangements and align with the
    United States on economic and national security matters.
-   Some goods will not be subject to the Reciprocal Tariff. These
    include: (1) articles subject to 50 USC 1702(b); (2) steel/aluminum
    articles and autos/auto parts already subject to Section 232
    tariffs; (3) copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and lumber
    articles; (4) all articles that may become subject to future Section
    232 tariffs; (5) bullion; and (6) energy and other certain minerals
    that are not available in the United States.
-   For Canada and Mexico, the existing fentanyl/migration IEEPA orders
    remain in effect, and are unaffected by this order. This means USMCA
    compliant goods will continue to see a 0% tariff, non-USMCA
    compliant goods will see a 25% tariff, and non-USMCA compliant
    energy and potash will see a 10% tariff. In the event the existing
    fentanyl/migration IEEPA orders are terminated, USMCA compliant
    goods would continue to receive preferential treatment, while
    non-USMCA compliant goods would be subject to a 12% reciprocal
    tariff.

   
**TAKING BACK OUR ECONOMIC SOVEREIGNTY:** President Trump refuses to let
the United States be taken advantage of and believes that tariffs are
necessary to ensure fair trade, protect American workers, and reduce the
trade deficit—this is an emergency.

-   He is the first President in modern history to stand strong for
    hardworking Americans by asking other countries to follow the golden
    rule on trade: Treat us like we treat you.
-   Pernicious economic policies and practices of our trading partners
    undermine our ability to produce essential goods for the public and
    the military, threatening national security.
-   U.S. companies, according to internal estimates, pay over $200
    billion per year in value-added taxes (VAT) to foreign governments—a
    “double-whammy” on U.S. companies who pay the tax at the European
    border, while European companies don’t pay tax to the United States
    on the income from their exports to the U.S.
-   The annual cost to the U.S. economy of counterfeit goods, pirated
    software, and theft of trade secrets is between $225 billion and
    $600 billion. Counterfeit products not only pose a significant risk
    to U.S. competitiveness, but also threaten the security, health, and
    safety of Americans, with the global trade in counterfeit
    pharmaceuticals estimated at $4.4 billion and linked to the
    distribution of deadly fentanyl-laced drugs.
    -   This imbalance has fueled a large and persistent trade deficit
        in both industrial and agricultural goods, led to offshoring of
        our manufacturing base, empowered non-market economies like
        China, and hurt America’s middle class and small towns. 
    -   President Biden squandered the agricultural trade surplus
        inherited from President Trump’s first term, turning it into a
        projected all-time high deficit of $49 billion.
-   The current global trading order allows those using unfair trade
    practices to get ahead, while those playing by the rules get left
    behind.
-   In 2024, our trade deficit in goods exceeded $1.2 trillion—an
    unsustainable crisis ignored by prior leadership.
-   “Made in America” is not just a tagline—it’s an economic and
    national security priority of this Administration. The President’s
    reciprocal trade agenda means better-paying American jobs making
    beautiful American-made cars, appliances, and other goods.
-   These tariffs seek to address the injustices of global trade,
    re-shore manufacturing, and drive economic growth for the American
    people.
-   Reciprocal trade is America First trade because it increases our
    competitive edge, protects our sovereignty, and strengthens our
    national and economic security.
-   These tariffs adjust for the unfairness of ongoing international
    trade practices, balance our chronic goods trade deficit, provide an
    incentive for re-shoring production to the United States, and
    provide our foreign trading partners with an opportunity to
    rebalance their trade relationships with the United States.

   
**REPRIORITIZING U.S. MANUFACTURING:** President Trump recognizes that
increasing domestic manufacturing is critical to U.S. national security.

-   In 2023, U.S. manufacturing output as a share of global
    manufacturing output was 17.4%, down from 28.4% in 2001.
-   The decline in manufacturing output has reduced U.S. manufacturing
    capacity.
    -   The need to maintain a resilient domestic manufacturing capacity
        is particularly acute in advanced sectors like autos,
        shipbuilding, pharmaceuticals, transport equipment, technology
        products, machine tools, and basic and fabricated metals, where
        loss of capacity could permanently weaken U.S. competitiveness.
-   U.S. stockpiles of military goods are too low to be compatible with
    U.S. national defense interests.
    -   If the U.S. wishes to maintain an effective security umbrella to
        defend its citizens and homeland, as well as allies and
        partners, it needs to have a large upstream manufacturing and
        goods-producing ecosystem.
    -   This includes developing new manufacturing technologies in
        critical sectors like bio-manufacturing, batteries, and
        microelectronics to support defense needs.
-   Increased reliance on foreign producers for goods has left the U.S.
    supply chain vulnerable to geopolitical disruption and supply
    shocks.
    -   This vulnerability was exposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and
        later with Houthi attacks on Middle East shipping.
-   From 1997 to 2024, the U.S. lost around 5 million manufacturing jobs
    and experienced one of the largest drops in manufacturing employment
    in history.

   
**ADDRESSING TRADE IMBALANCES:** President Trump is working to level the
playing field for American businesses and workers by confronting the
unfair tariff disparities and non-tariff barriers imposed by other
countries.

-   For generations, countries have taken advantage of the United
    States, tariffing us at higher rates. For example:
    -   The United States imposes a 2.5% tariff on passenger vehicle
        imports (with internal combustion engines), while the European
        Union (10%) and India (70%) impose much higher duties on the
        same product. 
    -   For networking switches and routers, the United States imposes a
        0% tariff, but India (10-20%) levies higher rates.
    -   Brazil (18%) and Indonesia (30%) impose a higher tariff on
        ethanol than does the United States (2.5%). 
    -   For rice in the husk, the U.S. imposes a tariff of 2.7%, while
        India (80%), Malaysia (40%), and Turkey (31%) impose higher
        rates. 
    -   Apples enter the United States duty-free, but not so in Turkey
        (60.3%) and India (50%).
-   The United States has one of the lowest simple average
    most-favored-nation (MFN) tariff rates in the world at 3.3%, while
    many of our key trading partners like Brazil (11.2%), China (7.5%),
    the European Union (5%), India (17%), and Vietnam (9.4%) have simple
    average MFN tariff rates that are significantly higher.
-   Similarly, non-tariff barriers—meant to limit the quantity of
    imports/exports and protect domestic industries—also deprive U.S.
    manufacturers of reciprocal access to markets around the world. For
    example:
    -   China’s non-market policies and practices have given China
        global dominance in key manufacturing industries, decimating
        U.S. industry. Between 2001 and 2018, these practices
        contributed to the loss of 3.7 million U.S. jobs due to the
        growth of the U.S.-China trade deficit, displacing workers and
        undermining American competitiveness while threatening U.S.
        economic and national security by increasing our reliance on
        foreign-controlled supply chains for critical industries as well
        as everyday goods.
    -   India imposes their own uniquely burdensome and/or duplicative
        testing and certification requirements in sectors such as
        chemicals, telecom products, and medical devices that make it
        difficult or costly for American companies to sell their
        products in India. If these barriers were removed, it is
        estimated that U.S. exports would increase by at least $5.3
        billion annually.
    -   Countries including China, Germany, Japan, and South Korea have
        pursued policies that suppress the domestic consumption power of
        their own citizens to artificially boost the competitiveness of
        their export products. Such policies include regressive tax
        systems, low or unenforced penalties for environmental
        degradation, and policies intended to suppress worker wages
        relative to productivity.
    -   Certain countries, like Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, and Vietnam,
        restrict or prohibit the importation of remanufactured goods,
        restricting market access for U.S. exporters while also stifling
        efforts to promote sustainability by discouraging trade in
        like-new and resource-efficient products. If these barriers were
        removed, it is estimated that U.S. exports would increase by at
        least $18 billion annually.
    -   The UK maintains non-science-based standards that severely
        restrict U.S. exports of safe, high-quality beef and poultry
        products.
    -   Indonesia maintains local content requirements across a broad
        range of sectors, complex import licensing regimes, and,
        starting this year, will require natural resource firms to
        onshore all export revenue for transactions worth $250,000 or
        more.
    -   Argentina has banned imports of U.S. live cattle since 2002 due
        to unsubstantiated concerns regarding bovine spongiform
        encephalopathy.  The United States has a $223 million trade
        deficit with Argentina in beef and beef products.
    -   For decades, South Africa has imposed animal health restrictions
        that are not scientifically justified on U.S. pork products,
        permitting a very limited list of U.S. pork exports to enter
        South Africa. South Africa also heavily restricts U.S. poultry
        exports through high tariffs, anti-dumping duties, and
        unjustified animal health restrictions. These barriers have
        contributed to a 78% decline in U.S. poultry exports to South
        Africa, from $89 million in 2019 to $19 million 2024.
    -   U.S. automakers face a variety of non-tariff barriers that
        impede access to the Japanese and Korean automotive markets,
        including non-acceptance of certain U.S. standards, duplicative
        testing and certification requirements, and transparency issues.
        Due to these non-reciprocal practices, the U.S. automotive
        industry loses out on an additional $13.5 billion in annual
        exports to Japan and access to a larger import market share in
        Korea—all while the U.S. trade deficit with Korea more than
        tripled from 2019 to 2024.
-   Monetary tariffs and non-monetary tariffs are two distinct types of
    trade barriers that governments use to regulate imports and
    exports. President Trump is countering both through reciprocal
    tariffs to protect American workers and industries from these unfair
    practices.

   
**THE GOLDEN RULE FOR OUR GOLDEN AGE:** Today’s action simply asks other
countries to treat us like we treat them. It’s the Golden Rule for Our
Golden Age.

-   Access to the American market is a privilege, not a right.
-   The United States will no longer put itself last on matters of
    international trade in exchange for empty promises.
-   Reciprocal tariffs are a big part of why Americans voted for
    President Trump—it was a cornerstone of his campaign from the start.
    -   Everyone knew he’d push for them once he got back in office;
        it’s exactly what he promised, and it’s a key reason he won the
        election.
-   These tariffs are central to President Trump’s plan to reverse the
    economic damage left by President Biden and put America on a path to
    a new golden age.
    -   This builds on his broader economic agenda of energy
        competitiveness, tax cuts, no tax on tips, no tax on Social
        Security benefits, and deregulation to boost American
        prosperity.

   
**TARIFFS WORK: **Studies have repeatedly shown that tariffs can be an
effective tool for reducing or eliminating threats that impair U.S.
national security and achieving economic and strategic objectives.

-   A 2024 study on the effects of President Trump’s tariffs in his
    first term found that they “strengthened the U.S. economy” and “led
    to significant reshoring” in industries like manufacturing and steel
    production.
-   A 2023 report by the U.S. International Trade Commission that
    analyzed the effects of Section 232 and 301 tariffs on more than
    $300 billion of U.S. imports found that the tariffs reduced imports
    from China and effectively stimulated more U.S. production of the
    tariffed goods, with very minor effects on prices.
-   According to the Economic Policy Institute, the tariffs implemented
    by President Trump during his first term “clearly show\[ed\] no
    correlation with inflation” and only had a temporary effect on
    overall price levels.
-   An analysis from the Atlantic Council found that “tariffs would
    create new incentives for US consumers to buy US-made products.”
-   Former Biden Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen affirmed last year that
    tariffs do not raise prices: “I don’t believe that American
    consumers will see any meaningful increase in the prices that they
    face.”
-   A 2024 economic analysis found that a global tariff of 10% would
    grow the economy by $728 billion, create 2.8 million jobs, and
    increase real household incomes by 5.7%.
