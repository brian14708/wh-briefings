title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Modernizes American Workforce Programs
  for the High-Paying Skilled Trade Jobs of the Future'
---
 
**OVERHAULING FEDERAL WORKFORCE TRAINING:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed an Executive Order to modernize American workforce programs
to prepare citizens for the high-paying skilled trade jobs of the
future.

-   The order directs the Secretaries of Labor, Education, and Commerce
    to review all federal workforce programs to modernize, integrate,
    and re-align programs to address critical workforce needs in
    emerging industries.
-   These Secretaries shall provide President Trump with a streamlined
    and integrated plan to re-orient federal workforce programs to
    prepare the American economy for the opportunities presented by
    reshoring and re-industrialization.
-   This Comprehensive Workforce Strategy will further America’s global
    economic leadership and domination of key sectors by, among other
    things, capitalizing on the AI revolution.

**PROVIDING RETURN ON WORKFORCE INVESTMENT:** After years of shuffling
Americans through an economically unproductive postsecondary system,
President Trump will refocus young Americans on career preparation.

-   Decades of failed political leadership have left America with a
    one-size-fits-all approach to workforce preparedness, which previous
    Administrations promoted as “college for all.”
-   The Federal Government invests over $700 billion a year in American
    higher education, but only about half of new college graduates find
    jobs that require college degrees.
-   Meanwhile, the Federal Government spends $4.1 billion on the
    Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act and $1.4 billion on Career
    and Technical Education through the Perkins Act. Neither of these
    programs are structured to promote apprenticeships or have
    incentives to meet workforce training needs.
-   The Trump Administration is putting American workers first,
    unleashing domestic advanced manufacturing to produce the best
    American-made products and implement world-leading,
    American-developed technologies.

**BACK TO THE FUTURE OF JOBS:** After decades of leadership by so-called
“Experts” making wrong predictions on what the future will hold,
President Trump will restore focus on sectors and programs that Made the
American Economy Great in the first place.

-   In 2024, there was a shortage of 447,00 construction workers and
    94,000 durable goods workers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics
    projects that the annual shortage of skilled tradesman over the next
    decade will be close to half a million—and grow as the years go by.
-   This understates the problem—and the opportunity. Even the best
    federal government statisticians cannot predict the future. As the
    potential of American AI increases, and as America reshores
    manufacturing and makes Made in America a mark of international
    envy, America will need more skilled tradesman than we’re prepared
    to train.
-   President Trump’s Executive Order will meet the needs of the future
    with a focus on registered apprenticeships. The Administration will
    submit a plan to support more than 1 million apprenticeships per
    year.
