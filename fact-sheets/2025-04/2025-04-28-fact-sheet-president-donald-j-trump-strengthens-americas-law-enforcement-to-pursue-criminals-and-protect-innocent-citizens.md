  \ to Pursue Criminals and Protect Innocent Citizens"

**EMPOWERING LAW ENFORCEMENT TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to empower state and local law
enforcement to relentlessly pursue criminals and protect American
communities. More specifically, the Order directs the Attorney General
to:

-   Create a mechanism to provide legal resources and indemnification
    for officers facing unjust legal expenses from official duties,
    including pro bono assistance. 
-   Maximize the use of Federal resources to improve training, increase
    officer pay and benefits, strengthen legal protections, seek tougher
    sentences for crimes against officers, enhance prison security and
    capacity, and improve crime-data uniformity.
-   Review Federal consent decrees, out-of-court agreements, and
    post-judgment orders involving State or local law enforcement
    agencies and modify or rescind any that impede the performance of
    law enforcement functions.
-   Increase the provision of surplus military assets to support local
    law enforcement and evaluate their use in crime prevention.
-   Use recently established Homeland Security Task Forces (HSTFs) to
    advance Federal and local coordination.

**KEEPING AMERICANS SAFE:** President Trump’s Executive Order empowers
law enforcement to do their jobs, relentlessly pursue criminals, and
protect innocent citizens.

-   Millions of Americans live in fear, worried that surging crime will
    destroy their lives, homes, or businesses.
-   Crime increases when local leaders demonize law enforcement and
    impose legal and political handcuffs that make aggressively
    enforcing the law impossible; reversing this dynamic is essential to
    restoring public safety.
-   Democrat-led soft-on-crime policies have fueled chaos.
    -   In many local jurisdictions, officers are forced to comply with
        DEI policies or are wrongly accused of misconduct, which diverts
        their attention from fighting crime.

    -   Some use “bail reform” to free dangerous felons without ensuring
        they face trial, leaving communities vulnerable to repeat
        offenders.

    <!-- -->

    -   Some ignore shoplifting, vagrancy, and urban encampments,
        allowing disorder to spread unchecked in cities.

    -   Certain jurisdictions excuse violent riots when it’s fashionable
        and demonize law enforcement officers who risk their lives to
        protect citizens.
-   President Trump is committed to reversing these failed policies,
    empowering law enforcement, and ensuring every American can live in
    safety and security.

**STOPPING CRIME AND UPHOLDING JUSTICE:** President Trump is fulfilling
his campaign promise to Make America Safe Again.

-   President Trump sealed the border and initiated the largest
    deportation operation in U.S. history to remove criminal illegal
    aliens and protect American communities.
-   President Trump created a task force to make Washington, D.C., safe
    and beautiful.
-   President Trump designated international cartels and other violent
    organizations as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially
    Designated Global Terrorists.
-   President Trump marshalled Federal resources to combat the explosion
    of anti-Semitism on our campuses and in our streets.
-   This Executive Order will restore law and order and ensure that
    every community is better protected from crime and lawlessness.
