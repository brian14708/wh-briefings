title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Lifts Burdensome EPA Restrictions on
  Coal Plants'
---
 
**SUPPORTING OUR NATION’S COAL INDUSTRY:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed a proclamation granting two-years of relief from a
stringent Biden-era environmental rule to certain coal-fired power
plants, safeguarding the Nation’s energy grid and security, and saving
coal plants from closure.

-   The proclamation allows certain coal plants to comply with a less
    stringent version of the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA)
    Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) rule for two years, instead
    of the more onerous version put in place by the Biden
    Administration.
-   The move ensures these plants are not prematurely forced offline due
    to unattainable compliance requirements under the new rule.

**ADDRESSING THE THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY AND ENERGY STABILITY:**
President Trump recognizes that environmental advocate overreach
jeopardizes America’s energy reliability, economic vitality, and
national security.

-   Coal is essential to our Nation’s grid, making up 16% of U.S.
    electricity generation.
-   Compliance with the Biden-era standards requires the application of
    emissions-control technologies that, for many coal plants, are not
    commercially viable.
-   The current compliance timeline of the Biden-era rule could force
    widespread coal plant shutdowns, risking thousands of jobs and the
    stability of our electrical grid.
-   These shutdowns could lead to electricity shortages, increased
    reliance on foreign energy, and heightened vulnerability during
    crises.
-   This relief is necessary to maintain operational coal plants,
    protect energy security, and allow time for viable technology
    solutions, avoiding broader risks to America’s economy and defense
    readiness.

**BALANCING ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS WITH AMERICAN PROSPERITY:**
President Trump has consistently prioritized a pragmatic approach,
ensuring environmental policies support rather than undermine America’s
economic strength and national security.

-   President Trump has sought to protect American industries while
    maintaining standards that allow Americans to have among the
    cleanest air and water in the world.
-   He directed the EPA to repeal the Obama-era Clean Power Plan during
    his first term, replacing it with the Affordable Clean Energy rule
    in 2019 that set achievable standards to preserve jobs while
    addressing emissions.
-   He paused the expansion of windmills, recognizing their detrimental
    environmental impact, particularly on wildlife, often outweighs
    their benefits.
-   He has championed an energy dominance strategy, boosting domestic
    oil and gas production to reduce reliance on foreign energy while
    maintaining practical environmental oversight.
-   His approach encourages industry to develop cost-effective solutions
    like improved emissions technologies rather than imposing unfeasible
    mandates that risk economic disruption.
