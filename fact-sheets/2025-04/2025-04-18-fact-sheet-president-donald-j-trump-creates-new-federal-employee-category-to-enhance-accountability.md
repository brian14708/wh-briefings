title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Creates New Federal Employee Category
  to Enhance Accountability'
---
 
**RESTORING ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE FEDERAL WORKFORCE:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump’s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) took action to
implement President Trump’s Executive Action titled “Restoring
Accountability to Policy-Influencing Positions Within the Federal
Workforce.”

-   OPM proposed a rule to amend the civil service regulations to
    include Schedule Policy/Career for career employees with important
    policy-determining, policy-making, policy-advocating, or
    confidential duties.
    -   These employees will serve as at-will employees, without access
        to cumbersome adverse action procedures or appeals, overturning
        Biden Administration regulations that protected poor performing
        employees.
    -   Line federal employees who implement those policies, like Border
        Patrol agents or wage and hour inspectors, will generally be
        excluded.
-   This rule empowers federal agencies to swiftly remove employees in
    policy-influencing roles for poor performance, misconduct,
    corruption, or subversion of Presidential directives, without
    lengthy procedural hurdles.
-   Schedule Policy/Career positions remain career positions, filled
    through existing nonpartisan, merit-based hiring processes.
    -   These employees will keep their competitive status and are not
        required to personally or politically support the President, but
        must faithfully implement the law and the administration’s
        policies.
-   OPM estimates 50,000 positions will ultimately be moved into
    Schedule Policy/Career, approximately 2% of the Federal workforce.
    -   The proposed rule does not directly move positions into Schedule
        Policy/Career. That will be done by a subsequent executive order
        after a final rule issues.

   
**FIXING A BROKEN SYSTEM:** The proposed rule tackles systemic issues in
federal workforce accountability, addressing unaccountable,
policy-determining federal employees who put their own interests ahead
of the American people’s.

-   Federal employees report their agencies do not hold employees
    accountable:
    -   The Merit Principles Survey shows less than a quarter of federal
        employees believe their agencies address poor performers
        effectively.
    -   When asked what typically happens to poor performers in their
        work unit, federal employees’ most common response is they
        “remain in the work unit and continue to underperform.”
-   This happens because the process for removing federal employees is
    lengthy and difficult:
    -   The Government Accountability Office reports it takes 6 months
        to a year to remove poor performers, even before appeals.
    -   Only two-fifths of federal managers are confident they could
        remove employees who committed serious misconduct.
    -   Just one-quarter believe they could remove an employee for poor
        performance in a critical element of their job.
-   Unaccountability allows corruption to fester in agencies:
    -   For example, a recent audit of the Federal Deposit Insurance
        Corporation (FDIC) found widespread misconduct by senior
        leaders, such as male supervisors pressuring female subordinates
        for sexual favors in exchange for career assistance.
    -   The FDIC almost never seriously disciplined employees for such
        corrupt behavior. Not a single complaint to the agency’s
        Anti-Harassment program resulted in a removal, or even a
        demotion.
    -   The auditors found the FDIC tolerated misconduct because the
        removal process was too difficult to use. 
-   Some bureaucrats also use the protections the system gives them to
    oppose presidential policies and impose their own preferences:
    -   Recent polling asked senior federal employees in Washington,
        D.C., what they would do if the President gave them a lawful
        order they considered bad policy. A plurality said they would
        ignore the order and do what they thought best.
    -   During the first Trump administration career attorneys in the
        Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division would not assist
        in litigation charging Yale University with racially
        discriminating against Asian and Caucasian  applicants.
    -   In the President’s first term, career employees in the
        Department of Education would not constructively assist in
        drafting major rules like the Title IX rules.
    -   An Equal Employment Opportunity Commission administrative judge
        (AJ) recently sent an agency-wide email stating that the
        agency’s Acting Chair (who was appointed by President Trump) was
        “not fit to be our chair much less hold a license to practice
        law” and that the AJ would not implement President Trump’s
        Executive Orders.
-   Unaccountable bureaucracy undermines democracy. For the government
    to be accountable to the American people, elected officials must be
    able to hold policy-determining and policy-making career employees
    accountable for their performance and conduct.

   
**DRAINING THE SWAMP:** President Trump is delivering on his promise to
dismantle the deep state and reclaim our government from Washington
corruption.

-   In his first term, President Trump signed an Executive Order to
    reclassify certain federal workers in policy-related roles as
    “Schedule F” employees, enabling swift accountability for those in
    influential positions.
-   When President Biden took office, he revoked this Executive Order,
    reinstating protections that shielded unaccountable bureaucrats.

President Trump vowed on the campaign trail to reinstate this Executive
Order, a promise he kept on his first day returning to office.
