title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Protects American Energy from State
  Overreach'
---
 
**PROTECTING AMERICAN ENERGY FROM STATE INTERFERENCE:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order aimed at securing America’s
energy dominance by removing unlawful and burdensome state-level
impediments to domestic energy production.

-   The Order directs the Attorney General to identify and take action
    against state laws and policies that burden the use of domestic
    energy resources and that are unconstitutional, preempted by federal
    law, or otherwise unenforceable.
-   The Attorney General will prioritize taking action against laws and
    policies purporting to address “climate change” policies, or
    involving “environmental, social, and governance” initiatives,
    “environmental justice,” carbon or “greenhouse gas” emissions, and
    funds to collect carbon penalties or carbon taxes.
-   The Attorney General will submit a report to the President detailing
    actions taken and additional recommendations to protect American
    energy pursuant to the Order in 60 days.

**STRENGTHENING NATIONAL AND ECONOMIC SECURITY THROUGH ENERGY:**
President Trump believes that an affordable and reliable domestic energy
supply is vital to America’s national security, economic prosperity, and
foreign policy.

-   When states purport to regulate energy beyond their constitutional
    or statutory authorities, American energy suffers.
-   States like New York and Vermont have imposed retroactive “climate
    change” extortion laws on energy producers for those producers’
    alleged past contributions to greenhouse gas emissions, while
    California enforces restrictive carbon caps that punish businesses.
-   These state policies raise energy prices, disrupt supply
    reliability, and degrade quality of life for families nationwide.
-   Affordable energy is essential for heating homes, fueling vehicles,
    and powering industries, all of which are jeopardized by
    ideologically-driven state laws.
-   By removing unconstitutional state impediments to American energy
    production, the United States can secure a prosperous future for all
    Americans.

**STOPPING STATE OVERREACH:** President Trump is committed to halting
efforts by individual states to impose their regulatory preferences on
the entire nation, defending federalism, and safeguarding Americans from
overreaching, ideologically driven state policies. 

-   He signed an Executive Order overriding disastrous California
    policies in order to fight and prevent massive wildfires in southern
    California.
-   He signed an Executive Order threatening to revoke federal funding
    from “sanctuary” states and cities that refuse to comply with
    federal immigration law.
-   His administration is working to block efforts by California to set
    its own vehicle emissions standards that would have forced
    automakers across the country to comply with the state’s extreme
    environmental rules.
