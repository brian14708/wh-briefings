title: "Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Pushes the Reset Button on America\u2019\
  s Energy Regulations"
---
 
**ZERO-BASED REGULATION TO UNLEASH AMERICAN ENERGY:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order requiring the automatic
rescission of outdated regulations to unleash American innovation and
energy production.

-   The Order requires ten agencies and subagencies to insert a one-year
    expiration date into existing energy regulations.
-   If not extended before the expiration date, these energy regulations
    will expire no later than September 30, 2026.
    -   Agencies will extend only those regulations that affirmatively
        serve American interests.  The rest will expire, resetting the
        regulatory landscape.
-   This Order will unleash American energy innovation, which has been
    frozen in the 1970s.  Regulations from the Carter Administration
    should not govern energy production today.
    -   President Trump is laser focused on energy abundance, not just
        efficiency.

**KEEPING AMERICAN ENERGY ON THE CUTTING EDGE:** President Trump is
committed to keeping American energy on the cutting edge:

-   The Order requires the same agencies to include a five-year
    expiration date in future energy regulations, unless those new
    regulations are themselves deregulatory.
-   If an agency does not affirmatively extend the expiration date of
    any energy regulation, that regulation will automatically expire
    after five years.
-   This Order will ensure American energy regulations are continually
    reviewed and updated to keep up with modern technology and needs.
-   The Order exempts permitting regimes, to ensure certainty for
    long-term development projects.

**REWIRING THE BUREAUCRACY**: President Trump knows that the bureaucracy
is built to regulate, not deregulate. The result is an ever-increasing
number of regulations that stifle innovation and limit American freedom.

-   Zero-based regulation uses the bureaucracy against itself. If
    bureaucrats move slowly, the default is deregulation and free
    markets—not the sclerotic status quo.
-   Zero-based regulation demolishes agency resistance against
    innovation. It forces agencies to reconsider every regulation, and
    justify it for the present day, making regulation more accountable
    to elections and the American people.
