title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Reinstates Commonsense School Discipline
  Policies'
---
 
**REINSTATING COMMONSENSE, NON-DISCRIMINATORY SCHOOL DISCIPLINE
POLICIES:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order
to restore safety and order in American classrooms by ensuring school
discipline policies are based on objective behavior, not DEI.

-   The Order requires new guidance to local and state educational
    agencies regarding school discipline, emphasizing compliance with
    Title VI protections against racial discrimination and preferencing.
-   It calls for appropriate action against educational agencies that
    fail to comply with Title VI by continuing to use racially
    preferential discipline practices. 
-   The Order requires a report to the President that includes an
    analysis of DEI-based school discipline and its consequences,
    measures to ensure that federal funds do not support racially
    preferential policies, including through nonprofit organizations,
    and proposing model discipline policies rooted in American values. 
     

**ENSURING SAFETY AND ORDER IN AMERICAN CLASSROOMS:** President Trump is
taking action to combat the increased levels of classroom disorder and
school violence that teachers and students are facing due to flawed
Obama-Biden policies.  

-   In 2014, the Obama Administration issued guidance pressuring schools
    (including with threatened loss of federal funding) to impose
    discipline in a manner designed to equalize disciplinary rates by
    race, rather than simply imposing discipline based on objective
    behavior alone.
-   As a result, students were disciplined differently depending on
    their race, and some students who should have been suspended or
    expelled for dangerous behavior remained in the classroom.
    -   A 2018 Federal Commission on School Safety report found that
        schools ignored or covered up student misconduct to avoid
        federal scrutiny over racial disparities in discipline data.
-   Following the 2018 report, President Trump rescinded the Obama-era
    guidance.
-   In 2023, the Biden Administration reinstated the Obama practice of
    weaponizing Title VI to promote a DEI approach to school discipline,
    which makes schools less safe.

**MAKING AMERICA’S EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS GREAT AGAIN:** President
Trump prioritizes the needs of students, parents, and teachers over the
demands of teachers’ unions, ensuring policies serve the interests of
American families first.

-   President Trump eliminated divisive DEI programs in classrooms to
    foster unity and focus on academic excellence.
-   President Trump signed an Executive Order to expand educational
    freedom and opportunity for families.
-   President Trump directed the Secretary of Education to take all
    necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of
    Education and return education authority to the States to better
    serve children.
-   President Trump prohibited federal funding for COVID-19 vaccine
    mandates in schools.
-   President Trump signed an Executive Order to keep men out of women’s
    sports and locker rooms.
