**STRENGTHENING THE U.S. FISHING INDUSTRY:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed an Executive Order to restore American seafood
competitiveness.

-   The Order strengthens the U.S. fishing industry by reducing
    regulatory burdens, combating unfair foreign trade practices, and
    enhancing domestic seafood production and exports.
-   It directs the Secretary of Commerce to immediately consider
    suspending, revising, or rescinding regulations that overly burden
    America’s commercial fishing, aquaculture, and fish processing
    industries.
-   It directs the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to:
    -   Incorporate better, cheaper, more reliable technologies and
        cooperative research programs into fishery assessments.

    <!-- -->

    -   Expand exempted fishing permit programs to promote fishing
        opportunities nationwide.

    <!-- -->

    -   Modernize data collection and analytical practices to improve
        the responsiveness of fisheries management to real-time ocean
        conditions.
-   The Order establishes an America First Seafood Strategy to boost
    U.S. seafood production, sales, and exports, ensuring long-term
    industry growth and global competitiveness.
-   The Order also mandates the development of a seafood trade strategy
    to address unfair competition, low environmental and labor
    standards, and illegally sourced seafood from abroad, while
    expanding access to foreign markets for American seafood products.
-   It tasks the administration with improving the Seafood Import
    Monitoring Program (SIMP) to better detect high-risk shipments from
    countries that violate international laws.
-   It orders a review of all existing marine national monuments to
    assess opening them to commercial fishing.

**ADDRESSING THREATS TO AMERICAN SEAFOOD COMPETITIVENESS:** President
Trump recognizes that overregulation and unfair trade practices have
eroded the U.S. fishing industry’s global leadership.

-   The U.S. controls over four million square miles of prime fishing
    grounds but imports nearly 90% of its seafood, resulting in a trade
    deficit exceeding $20 billion.
-   The seafood industry is one of the most heavily regulated sectors in
    the United States, with restrictive catch limits and outdated data
    hampering American fishermen’s productivity.
-   Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, forced labor in
    foreign seafood supply chains, and unfair trade practices abroad all
    undermine U.S. markets.

**SUPPORTING AMERICAN FISHERMEN:** This Executive Order builds on
President Trump’s commitment to revitalize the U.S. fishing industry.

-   In 2020, President Trump signed an Executive Order to promote
    seafood competitiveness and remove unnecessary regulatory burdens.
-   Upon returning to office, President Trump signed an Executive Order
    halting offshore wind projects to preserve a robust U.S. fishing
    industry for future generations.
-   President Trump implemented tariffs to protect America’s fishing
    industry—praised as being a lifeline for the shrimping industry.
