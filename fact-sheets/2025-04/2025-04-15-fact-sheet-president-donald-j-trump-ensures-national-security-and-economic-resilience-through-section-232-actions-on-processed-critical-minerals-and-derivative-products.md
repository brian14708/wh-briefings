title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Ensures National Security and Economic
  Resilience Through Section 232 Actions on Processed Critical Minerals and Derivative
  Products'
---
 
**BOLSTERING AMERICA’S CRITICAL MINERALS FUTURE:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order launching an investigation
into the national security risks posed by U.S. reliance on imported
processed critical minerals and their derivative products.

-   The Order directs the Secretary of Commerce to initiate a Section
    232 investigation under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to evaluate
    the impact of imports of these materials on America’s security and
    resilience.
-   This investigation will assess vulnerabilities in supply chains, the
    economic impact of foreign market distortions, and potential trade
    remedies to ensure a secure and sustainable domestic supply of these
    essential materials.
-   The investigation will culminate in a report detailing risks and
    providing recommendations to strengthen domestic production, reduce
    dependence on foreign suppliers, and enhance economic and national
    security.
-   If the Secretary of Commerce submits a report finding that imports
    of critical-mineral articles threaten to impair national security
    and the President decides to impose tariffs, any resulting tariff
    rate imposed under Section 232 would take the place of the current
    reciprocal tariff rate, pursuant to President Trump’s April 2 order.

**COUNTERING THREATS TO NATIONAL SECURITY AND ECONOMIC STABILITY:**
President Trump recognizes that an overreliance on foreign critical
minerals and their derivative products could jeopardize U.S. defense
capabilities, infrastructure development, and technological innovation.

-   Critical minerals, including rare earth elements, are essential for
    national security and economic resilience.
    -   Processed critical minerals and their derivative products are
        key building blocks of our defense industrial base and integral
        to applications such as jet engines, missile guidance systems,
        advanced computing, radar systems, advanced optics, and secure
        communications equipment.
-   The United States remains heavily dependent on foreign sources,
    particularly adversarial nations, for these essential materials,
    exposing the economy and defense sector to supply chain disruptions
    and economic coercion.
-   Foreign producers have engaged in price manipulation, overcapacity,
    and arbitrary export restrictions, using their supply chain
    dominance as a tool for geopolitical and economic leverage over the
    United States.
-   A few months ago, China banned exports to the United States of
    gallium, germanium, antimony, and other key high-tech materials with
    potential military applications.  
-   Just this week, China suspended exports of six heavy rare earth
    metals, as well as rare earth magnets, in order to choke off
    supplies of components central to automakers, aerospace
    manufacturers, semiconductor companies and military contractors
    around the world.

**STRENGTHENING AMERICAN INDUSTRY:** This Executive Order builds on
previous actions taken by the Trump Administration to ensure U.S. trade
policy serves the nation’s long-term interests.

-   On Day One, President Trump initiated his America First Trade Policy
    to make America’s economy great again.
-   On Liberation Day, President Trump imposed a 10% tariff on all
    countries and individualized reciprocal higher tariffs on nations
    with which the U.S. has the largest trade deficits in order to level
    the playing field and protect America’s national security.
    -   More than 75 countries have already reached out to discuss new
        trade deals.

    -   As a result, the individualized higher tariffs are currently
        paused amid these discussions, except for China, which
        retaliated.

    <!-- -->

    -   China now faces up to a 245% tariff on imports to the United
        States as a result of its retaliatory actions.  
-   President Trump signed proclamations to close existing loopholes and
    exemptions to restore a true 25% tariff on steel and elevate the
    tariff to 25% on aluminum.
-   President Trump unveiled the “Fair and Reciprocal Plan” on trade to
    restore fairness in U.S. trade relationships and counter
    non-reciprocal trade agreements.   
-   President Trump signed a memorandum to safeguard American
    innovation, including the consideration of tariffs to combat digital
    service taxes (DSTs), fines, practices, and policies that foreign
    governments levy on American companies.
-   President Trump signed similar Executive Orders launching
    investigations into how imports of copper and imports of timber,
    lumber, and their derivative products threaten America’s national
    security and economic stability.
