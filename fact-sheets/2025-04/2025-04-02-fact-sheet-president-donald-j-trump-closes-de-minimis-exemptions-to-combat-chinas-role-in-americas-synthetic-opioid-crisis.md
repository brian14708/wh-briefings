title: "Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Closes De Minimis Exemptions to Combat\
  \ China\u2019s Role in America\u2019s Synthetic Opioid Crisis"

**CLOSING LOOPHOLES IN THE TARIFF SYSTEM:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed an Executive Order eliminating duty-free *de minimis*
treatment for low-value imports from China, a critical step in
countering the ongoing health emergency posed by the illicit flow of
synthetic opioids into the U.S.

-   Following the Secretary of Commerce’s notification that adequate
    systems are in place to collect tariff revenue, President Trump is
    ending duty-free *de minimis* treatment for covered goods from the
    People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Hong Kong starting May 2, 2025
    at 12:01 a.m. EDT.
    -   Imported goods sent through means other than the international
        postal network that are valued at or under $800 and that would
        otherwise qualify for the *de minimis* exemption will be subject
        to all applicable duties, which shall be paid in accordance with
        applicable entry and payment procedures.
    -   All relevant postal items containing goods that are sent through
        the international postal network that are valued at or under
        $800 and that would otherwise qualify for the *de minimis*
        exemption are subject to a duty rate of either 30% of their
        value or $25 per item (increasing to $50 per item after June 1,
        2025). This is in lieu of any other duties, including those
        imposed by prior Orders.
-   Carriers transporting these postal items must report shipment
    details to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), maintain an
    international carrier bond to ensure duty payment, and remit duties
    to CBP on a set schedule.
-   CBP may require formal entry for any postal package instead of the
    specified duties.
-   The Secretary of Commerce will submit a report within 90 days
    assessing the Order’s impact and considering whether to extend these
    rules to packages from Macau.

   
**COMBATING CHINA’S ROLE IN THE OPIOID CRISIS:** President Trump is
targeting deceptive shipping practices by Chinese-based shippers, many
of whom hide illicit substances, including synthetic opioids, in
low-value packages to exploit the *de minimis* exemption.

-   On average, CBP processes over 4 million *de minimis* shipments into
    the U.S. each day.
-   The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which exerts ultimate control
    over the government and enterprises of the PRC, has subsidized and
    otherwise incentivized PRC chemical companies to export fentanyl and
    related precursor chemicals that are used to produce synthetic
    opioids sold illicitly in the United States.
-   Many PRC-based chemical companies hide illicit substances in the
    flow of legitimate commerce, including through false invoices,
    fraudulent postage, and deceptive packaging.
-   While the U.S. previously offered a generous *de minimis* exemption,
    China enforces strict import restrictions and tightly limits *de
    minimis* exemptions, showing no similar leniency toward U.S.
    shipments.
-   Last fiscal year, CBP apprehended more than 21,000 pounds of
    fentanyl at our borders, enough fentanyl to kill more than 4 billion
    people.
    -   It is estimated that federal officials are only able to seize a
        fraction of the fentanyl smuggled across the southern border. 
-   These drugs kill tens of thousands of Americans each year, including
    75,000 deaths per year attributed to fentanyl alone.
    -   More Americans are dying from fentanyl overdoses each year than
        the number of American lives lost in the entirety of the Vietnam
        War.

   
**KEEPING HIS PROMISE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE:** When voters
overwhelmingly elected Donald J. Trump as President, they gave him a
mandate to seal the border and stop the influx of deadly drugs. That is
exactly what he is doing.

-   On the campaign trail, President Trump promised “We will not rest
    until we have ended the drug addiction crisis.”
-   Upon returning to office, President Trump immediately took action to
    seal the border and crack down on drug trafficking.
-   President Trump implemented 20% tariffs on China to address the
    threat of the sustained influx of synthetic opioids, including
    fentanyl, flowing from China into the United States.
