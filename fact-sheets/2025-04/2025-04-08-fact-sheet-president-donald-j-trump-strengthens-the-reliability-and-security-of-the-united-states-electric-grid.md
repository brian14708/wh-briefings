  of the United States Electric Grid'

**ENHANCING GRID RELIABILITY AND SECURITY:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed an Executive Order to strengthen the reliability and
security of the United States electric grid. The Executive Order:

-   Directs the Secretary of Energy to streamline, systemize, and
    expedite processes for issuing emergency orders under the Federal
    Power Act during forecasted grid interruptions.
-   Requires the Secretary of Energy to develop a uniform methodology to
    analyze reserve margins across all regions of the bulk power system.
    -   The methodology will assess varied grid conditions and accredit
        generation resources based on historical performance.
-   Requires the Secretary of Energy to incorporate such methodology
    into a process that assesses reserve margins on a regular basis and
    identifies which generation resources in a region are critical to
    system reliability.
-   The Secretary of Energy will then utilize that process to prevent
    significant generation resources from leaving the grid or converting
    fuel sources if it would result in a net reduction in accredited
    generating capacity.

**POWERING AMERICA FOR GENERATIONS TO COME:** This Executive Order is
critical to meeting the Nation’s growing energy needs and protecting
national security.

-   Rapid technological advancements, an expansion of AI data centers,
    and increased domestic manufacturing are driving an unprecedented
    surge in electricity demand, placing a significant strain on our
    Nation’s electric grid.
-   The Nation’s electricity is expected to rise 16% in the next 5
    years—triple the growth forecasted just a year ago.
-   The Nation’s 2,700 data centers, mostly operated by tech giants like
    Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Apple, consumed over 4% of U.S.
    electricity in 2022 and are expected to reach 9% by 2030.
-   An estimated 80 million transformers, averaging over 40 years old,
    are vital to keeping the grid running nationwide.
-   Grid reliability is essential to maintaining our national and
    economic security.
-   The United States’ ability to remain at the forefront of
    technological innovation depends on a reliable supply of energy from
    all available sources.

**MAKING AMERICA ENERGY DOMINANT:** President Trump believes it is vital
for America to be energy dominant and energy secure.

-   On the campaign trail, President Trump warned, “you have a grid
    system in this country that’s obsolete and a disaster,” underscoring
    his urgency to act.
-   On Day One, President Trump declared a National Energy Emergency to
    ensure the integrity of our Nation’s electrical grid. 
-   He is revitalizing America’s big beautiful coal industry to support
    grid stability and American jobs.
-   President Trump is cutting red tape and rolling back regulations
    that hinder coal, oil, and natural gas production.
-   He is pushing to expand domestic energy production by investing in
    next-generation energy technologies and accelerating energy projects
    by streamlining the permitting process.
