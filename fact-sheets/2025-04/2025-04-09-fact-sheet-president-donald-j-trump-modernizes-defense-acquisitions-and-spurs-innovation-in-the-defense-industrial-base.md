title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Modernizes Defense Acquisitions and
  Spurs Innovation in the Defense Industrial Base'
---
 
**OVERHAULING THE ACQUISITION SYSTEM:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order modernizing defense acquisitions and spurring
innovation in the defense industrial base.

-   The Order directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a plan to
    reform our acquisition process by: (1) using existing authorities to
    expedite acquisitions, such as a first preference for commercial
    solutions; (2) cutting unnecessary tasks, reducing duplicative
    approvals, and centralizing decision making; and (3) managing risk
    while encouraging innovation.
-   The Secretary of Defense will review internal Department of Defense
    (DoD) regulations with the intent to eliminate any unnecessary
    supplemental regulations and promote expedited and streamlined
    acquisitions.
-   The Secretary of Defense will also submit a plan to reform,
    right-size, and train the acquisition workforce by focusing
    performance evaluations on how well the employee uses efficient
    procurement methods and takes calculated risks in order to innovate.
-   All Major Defense Acquisitions Programs (MDAPs) will be reviewed to
    determine consistency with this new policy based on speed,
    flexibility, and execution.
    -   Any program more than 15% behind schedule or 15% over cost will
        be scrutinized for cancellation.

**STRENGTHENING OUR MILITARY EDGE:** After years of mismanagement and
inertia, President Trump is reprioritizing our defense acquisition
system.

-   America’s defense acquisition workforce is a national strategic
    asset critical to maintaining military superiority, and its
    personnel must deliver on enhancing warfighting capabilities rather
    than being bogged down with bureaucratic procedures.
-   For decades, mountains of red tape have stifled innovation and
    slowed the defense industrial base’s ability to respond to emerging
    global threats and even basic requirements.
    -   The new Air Force One is now five years behind schedule, delayed
        until 2029 or later, despite the contract being awarded in 2018.

    -   Nine Navy ship programs (not just individual ships, but the
        entire procurement program) are between one and three years
        behind schedule.

    -   The first flight of the Air Force’s new ICBM, the Sentinel, is
        already two years behind schedule and 37% more expensive than
        originally promised.

    <!-- -->

    -   The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis is in
        port for a scheduled overhaul and refueling stint—work that
        normally takes four years to complete—yet the carrier now won’t
        be ready for at least another year, marking over five years out
        of service.
-   In June 2024, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) described
    the Pentagon as “alarmingly slow” in fielding weapons for every
    Service. Yet the previous administration did nothing effective to
    address the problem.
-   With adversaries like China and Russia rapidly advancing their own
    military technologies, it is essential to prioritize speed,
    flexibility, and innovation to deliver cutting-edge capabilities to
    our Armed Forces.

**REBUILDING OUR DEPLETED MILITARY:** By signing this Executive Order,
President Trump is demonstrating his serious commitment to ensuring our
military remains the world’s most powerful. 

-   President Trump campaigned on the promise to rebuild America’s
    depleted military, emphasizing the need to restore its strength and
    readiness after years of neglect.
-   President Trump: “\[A\]s I work to again rebuild America’s military
    strength and deterrence that Joe Biden so foolishly squandered, we
    need to take a long, hard look at defense procurement and our
    defense industrial base, because it’s been withered down to nothing.
    Given all the money we spend on the Pentagon, it’s unacceptable that
    we would ever run out of ammunition or be unable to quickly produce
    the weapons needed.”
