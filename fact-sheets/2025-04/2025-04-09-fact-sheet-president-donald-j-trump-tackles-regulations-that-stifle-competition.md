title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Tackles Regulations That Stifle Competition'
---
 
**RESTORING COMPETITION TO U.S. MARKETS:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed an Executive Order aimed at eliminating anti-competitive
regulations. Competition lowers prices, speeds innovation, and increases
options for consumers. The Executive Order continues the President’s
policy of ushering in a Golden Age of American economic prosperity.

-   Agency heads, in coordination with the Chairman of the Federal Trade
    Commission and the Attorney General, are directed to review all
    regulations subject to their authority and identify any that impose
    anti-competitive restraints.
    -   This includes regulations that facilitate the formation of
        monopolies, create or impose unnecessary barriers to entry, or
        needlessly burden agency procurement.
-   In the next 70 days, Agency Heads must provide the FTC Chairman and
    Attorney General a list of all anti-competitive regulations, as well
    as a proposal to rescind or modify them as necessary.
    -   Regulations requiring rescission or modification will be placed
        on the Unified Regulatory Agenda created pursuant to Executive
        Order 14129 of February 19, 2025.

**SOLICITING PUBLIC INPUT:** The American people, more than any Federal
official, know which regulations stifle entrepreneurship and economic
growth. You are invited to tell us which regulations impede competition
and should be changed or repealed:

-   The FTC Chairman is required to seek input from the public, asking
    for help identifying anti-competitive regulations.
-   The FTC Chairman will convey useful responses to the relevant agency
    for possible rescission or modification.

**POWERING ECONOMIC GROWTH THROUGH DEREGULATION**: This Executive Order
is another element of the President’s sweeping deregulatory agenda that
will ensure America remains the most competitive and dynamic economy in
the world.
