title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Demands Transparency Regarding Foreign
  Influence at American Universities'
---
 
**ENFORCING TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS IN HIGHER EDUCATION:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order bolstering
transparency requirements regarding foreign funds flowing to American
higher education and research institutions.

-   The Order mandates full and timely disclosure of foreign funding by
    higher education institutions.
-   It directs the Secretary of Education to:
    -   Reverse or rescind any actions by the prior administration that
        allow universities to obscure details regarding their foreign
        funding.

    <!-- -->

    -   Require universities to disclose the true source and purpose of
        foreign funds.

    <!-- -->

    -   Provide the American people with greater access to general
        information about foreign funding of higher education
        institutions, which the prior administration kept limited.

    <!-- -->

    -   Work with the Attorney General and relevant departments and
        agencies to hold non-compliant institutions accountable through
        audits, investigations, and enforcement actions.
-   To enhance accountability, the Order clarifies that certain Federal
    grant funds could be revoked for failure to comply with foreign
    funding disclosure requirements.

**SAFEGUARDING AMERICAN INTERESTS:** President Trump is committed to
protecting national security, academic integrity, and American
excellence by ensuring transparency in foreign funding.

-   For far too long, foreign funds have flowed to U.S. colleges and
    universities with inadequate transparency or oversight.
-   The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations described
    foreign government spending at America’s universities as
    “effectively a black hole.”
-   A recent report found that $60 billion in foreign gifts and
    contracts have been funneled into American colleges and universities
    over the past several decades.
-   Only about 300 of the approximately 6,000 U.S. institutions
    self-report foreign money each year.
-   Undisclosed foreign funding raises serious concerns about potential
    foreign influence, national security risks, and compromised academic
    integrity.

**RESTORING ACCOUNTABILITY:** President Trump is ending secrecy
surrounding foreign funding in higher education to protect students,
research, and the marketplace of ideas.  

-   In President Trump’s first term, his Department of Education
    uncovered $6.5 billion in previously unreported foreign funds to
    U.S. colleges and universities.
-   The Biden Administration weakened these efforts by reassigning
    investigative responsibilities to an ill-equipped unit, and by
    reducing oversight and public access to information.
-   This Executive Order reinstates robust enforcement, ensuring foreign
    funding is transparent and does not compromise American interests.
