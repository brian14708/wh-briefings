title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Unleashes American Commercial Fishing
  in the Pacific'
---
 
**UNLEASHING OPPORTUNITY IN THE PACIFIC:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed a proclamation to unleash American commercial fishing in
the Pacific Ocean—a key component of the America First Fishing Policy.

-   The proclamation opens the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National
    Monument (PRIMNM) to commercial fishing, boosting the economy of
    American Samoa.
-   It allows U.S.-flagged vessels to fish commercially within 50 to 200
    nautical miles of the PRIMNM’s boundaries.

**EMPOWERING AMERICAN COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN:** President Trump believes
that removing unnecessary restrictions on American fishermen will
strengthen the U.S. economy, support local communities, and restore
fairness to an industry disadvantaged by overregulation and foreign
competition.

-   The PRIMNM was first established by President Bush in 2009 and then
    expanded by President Obama, closing off over 400,000 square miles
    of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone in the Pacific.
-   The ban on commercial fishing within the PRIMNM did little to guard
    fish populations against overfishing, as tuna and other pelagic
    species are migratory in nature and do not permanently reside within
    the PRIMNM.
-   As a result of the prohibitions on commercial fishing, American
    fishing fleets have lost access to nearly half of the United States’
    Exclusive Economic Zone in the Pacific Islands.
    -   This has driven American fishermen to fish further offshore in
        international waters to compete against poorly regulated and
        highly subsidized foreign fleets, most notably from China.

    -   By supporting honest American fishermen, we combat the rampant
        illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing by foreign fleets.
-   This disadvantages United States commercial fishermen and is
    detrimental for United States territories like American Samoa, whose
    private sector economy is dependent on the fishing industry.
    -   American Samoa is home to the only Buy American-compliant tuna
        processing facility for U.S. military rations and school lunch
        programs.

    -   This cannery is the largest employer on the island, providing
        about 5,000 jobs.  In fact, the cannery accounts for 99.5% of
        American Samoa’s exports and 84% of the private employment in
        the territory.

**ADVANCING U.S. ECONOMIC INTERESTS:** President Trump’s actions to
revitalize commercial fishing are part of his broader strategy to
unleash the full potential of the American economy by prioritizing
deregulation and cutting red tape.

-   President Trump launched a 10-to-1 deregulation initiative, ensuring
    every new Federal rule is justified by clear benefits and
    accompanied by much larger deregulatory measures.
-   President Trump established the National Energy Dominance Council to
    cut red tape, enhance private sector investments, advance
    innovation, and streamline the permitting process across all forms
    of American energy.
-   President Trump established the “Department of Government
    Efficiency” to examine how to streamline the operations of the
    Federal Government, eliminate unnecessary programs and wasteful
    spending, and reduce bureaucratic inefficiency.
-   President Trump has already reduced unnecessarily large governmental
    entities and terminated numerous harmful Biden expansions of
    governmental authority.
