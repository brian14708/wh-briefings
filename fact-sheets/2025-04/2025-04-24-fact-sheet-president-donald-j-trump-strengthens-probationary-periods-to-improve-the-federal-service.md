  Improve the Federal Service'

**ENHANCING FEDERAL WORKFORCE ACCOUNTABILITY:** Today, President Donald
J. Trump signed an Executive Order strengthening probationary periods in
the federal service.

-   The Order establishes a new Civil Service Rule XI to govern
    probationary and trial periods for federal employees, superseding
    existing civil service regulations that limited agency discretion in
    evaluating such employees.
-   Instead of these employees becoming tenured civil servants by
    default, Rule XI requires agencies to affirmatively certify that
    finalizing their appointment after their probationary or trial
    period concludes advances the public interest.
    -   This fulfills a longstanding Merit Systems Protection Board
        recommendation.
-   The Order mandates that agencies utilize probationary and trial
    periods (typically one year) to assess employees’ fitness and
    alignment with agency needs and the public interest.
-   It creates an individualized review process, requiring a designee of
    agency leadership to meet with probationary employees at least 60
    days before their probationary period ends to discuss their
    performance and continued employment.
-   The Order allows the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Director
    to establish an appeals process for probationary terminations in
    some circumstances.
-   The Order requires agencies to identify current probationary
    employees and designate evaluators within 15 days, ensuring
    accountability from the outset.

**ENSURING A HIGH-QUALITY FEDERAL WORKFORCE:** President Trump believes
a meaningful probationary process is essential to maintaining a
merit-based federal workforce that serves the American people.

-   Probationary periods are a critical part of the hiring process to
    confirm an employee’s ability to perform their duties, yet agencies
    have underutilized this tool, resulting in the indefinite retention
    of underperforming staff.
-   The Government Accountability Office has documented that agencies
    often fail to screen out unsuitable employees during their
    probationary period, contrary to congressional intent in the Civil
    Service Reform Act of 1978.
-   Existing OPM regulations have hindered agencies by imposing
    unnecessary obstacles to terminating probationary employees and
    failing to require certification that continued employment benefits
    the public interest.
-   A high-quality, efficient federal workforce, dedicated to the public
    interest and no larger than necessary, is vital to serving
    taxpayers.
-   Strengthening probationary periods ensures federal employees are
    held to high standards.

**DRAINING THE SWAMP:** The federal workforce must work for the American
people, and thanks to President Trump, the federal bureaucracy is being
held accountable.

-   Taxpayers will no longer be burdened by an oversized, unaccountable
    federal bureaucracy that fails to prioritize the public interest.
-   Last month, President Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum
    clarifying federal authority to take “suitability” actions against
    federal employees, ensuring accountability for bad conduct and
    preventing security risks both before and after appointment to
    federal service.
-   President Trump also signed the DOGE Workforce Optimization
    Executive Order to make the federal workforce more efficient and
    effective, significantly reducing the size of government.
-   This Executive Order builds on the President’s longstanding power to
    create Civil Service Rules to govern probationary periods in the
    federal government.
