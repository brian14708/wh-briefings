title: "Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Makes America\u2019s Showers Great Again"
---
 
**UNDOING THE LEFT’S WAR ON WATER PRESSURE:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed an Executive Order to end the Obama-Biden war on water
pressure and make America’s showers great again.

-   The Order directs the Secretary of Energy to immediately rescind the
    overly complicated federal rule that redefined “showerhead” under
    Obama and Biden.
-   Twice in the last 12 years, those administrations put out massive
    regulations defining the word “showerhead.”  The Biden definition
    was a staggering 13,000 words. The Oxford English Dictionary, by
    contrast, defines “showerhead” in one short sentence. 
-   President Trump is restoring sanity to at least one small part of
    the federal regulations, returning to the straightforward meaning of
    “showerhead” from the 1992 energy law, which sets a simple
    2.5-gallons-per-minute standard for showers.
-   The Order frees Americans from excessive regulations that turned a
    basic household item into a bureaucratic nightmare. No longer will
    showerheads be weak and worthless.

**ROLLING BACK OVERREGULATION:** Overregulation chokes the American
economy, entrenches bureaucrats, and stifles personal freedom.         

-   Under Obama and Biden, the government issued lengthy rules—thousands
    of words long—redefining “showerhead” as a “nozzle” and making
    multi-nozzle showers illegal if they collectively discharged over
    2.5 gallons of water per minute.
    -   These changes served a radical green agenda that made life worse
        for everyday Americans.

    <!-- -->

    -   President Trump sought to undo this definition in his first term
        by publishing extensive analysis and a formal rule—however,
        Biden undid this progress and the shower wars continued. 

    <!-- -->

    -   The government should not waste taxpayer time and money writing
        another elaborate definition for a term that has a simple
        definition.

    <!-- -->

    -   No market failure justifies this intrusion: Americans pay for
        their own water and should be free to choose their showerheads
        without federal meddling.
-   It’s not just showers—the Biden Administration aggressively targeted
    everyday appliances like gas stoves, water heaters, washing
    machines, furnaces, dishwashers, and more, waging war on the
    reliable tools Americans depend on daily.
    -   These appliances worked perfectly fine before Biden’s meddling
        piled on convoluted regulations that made those appliances
        worse. 

    <!-- -->

    -   President Trump is slashing red tape and ending Biden’s dumb war
        on things that work.

**DELIVERING ON PROMISES:** By restoring shower freedom, President Trump
is following through on his commitment to dismantle unnecessary
regulations and put Americans first.

-   President Trump: “We’re going to get rid of those restrictions. You
    have many places where they have water, they have so much water they
    don’t know what to do with it. But people buy a house, they turn on
    the sink, and water barely comes out. They take a shower, water
    barely comes out. And it’s an unnecessary restriction.”
-   This Executive Order builds on actions President Trump has already
    taken to roll back overregulation and empower Americans, including:
    -   Cutting red tape across federal agencies to unleash economic
        growth.

    <!-- -->

    -   Repealing burdensome Biden-era executive actions that stifled
        freedom.

    <!-- -->

    -   Fighting against radical green agendas that prioritize ideology
        over people.
