  \ Clean Coal Industry"

**ACHIEVING AMERICAN ENERGY DOMINANCE:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed an Executive Order reinvigorating America’s beautiful clean
coal industry. The Executive Order:

-   Directs the Chair of the National Energy Dominance Council to
    designate coal as a “mineral” under Executive Order 14241, entitling
    coal to all of the benefits of that prior Order.
-   Directs relevant agencies to identify coal resources on Federal
    lands, lift barriers to coal mining, and prioritize coal leasing on
    those lands.
-   Directs the Secretary of the Interior to acknowledge the end of the
    Jewell Moratorium, which paused coal leasing on Federal lands.
-   Requires agencies to rescind any agency policies that seek to
    transition the Nation away from coal production or otherwise
    establish preferences against coal as a generation resource.
-   Directs CEQ to assist agencies in adopting coal-related categorical
    exclusions under NEPA.
-   Seeks to promote coal and coal technology exports, facilitate
    international offtake agreements for U.S. coal, and accelerate
    development of coal technologies.
-   Calls for the Secretary of Energy to determine whether coal used in
    the production of steel meets the definition of a “critical
    material” and “critical mineral” under the Energy Act of 2020, and
    if so, add it to the relevant lists.
-   Pushes for using coal to power new artificial intelligence (AI)
    data.

**INCREASING DOMESTIC ENERGY PRODUCTION:** President Trump believes that
coal is essential to our national and economic security.

-   The coal industry supports hundreds of thousands of jobs and adds
    tens of billions to the U.S. economy each year.
-   America’s coal resources are vast, with a current estimated value in
    the trillions of dollars.
-   Coal-fired electricity generation is cleaner than ever, yet the
    previous administration waged war on coal.
-   Coal will be critical to meeting the rise in electricity demand due
    to a resurgence of domestic manufacturing and the construction of AI
    data processing centers. 
-   Supporting our coal industry will increase our energy supply, lower
    electricity costs, stabilize our grid, create high-paying jobs,
    support burgeoning industries, and assist our allies.

**FUELING THE NATION:** By reinvigorating clean coal, President Trump is
following through on his promise to once again unleash American energy.

-   President Trump: “We will develop the liquid gold that is right
    under our feet, including American oil and natural gas and we will
    also embrace nuclear, clean coal, hydropower, which is fantastic,
    and every other form of affordable energy to get it done.”
-   This Executive Order builds on actions President Trump has already
    taken to bring Americans the lowest-cost energy and electricity on
    earth. This includes:
    -   Withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement.
