**REVITALIZING U.S. MARITIME POWER:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed a historic Executive Order to restore American maritime
dominance.

-   The Order directs the creation of a Maritime Action Plan (MAP) to
    revitalize U.S. maritime industries.
    -   The MAP will provide a strategy with specific actions to restore
        and create sustained resiliency for the American maritime
        industry.
-   Up until now, government procurement processes and over-regulation
    have hindered private industry’s ability to build vessels on time
    and on budget—this Order reverses that trend.
-   It instructs the Secretary of Defense to assess options, including
    the Defense Production Act Title III authorities, to invest in and
    expand the Maritime Industrial Base.
    -   Such an action will help better utilize and leverage existing
        authorities to spur public and private investment in the
        Maritime Industrial Base.
-   The Order directs the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to
    make recommendations regarding China’s anticompetitive actions
    within the shipbuilding industry.
-   It also directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to enforce
    collection of the Harbor Maintenance Fee and other charges on
    foreign cargo entering the United States to prevent circumvention
    via Canada or Mexico.
    -   This will put an end to a longstanding unfair practice, ensuring
        all cargoes entering the United States are assessed the proper
        applicable fees and generating additional revenue for investment
        into the maritime industry.
-   The U.S. government will work with our allies and partners to align
    trade policies to disrupt China’s non-market practices in the
    international supply chain and logistics sectors.
-   The Order establishes a Maritime Security Trust Fund to provide
    consistent funding for maritime programs in addition to a
    shipbuilding financial incentives program to boost private
    investment in U.S. shipbuilding.
-   It develops Maritime Prosperity Zones to incentivize investment in
    waterfront communities and is to be modeled on President Trump’s
    highly successful Opportunity Zone concept.
-   It expands Mariner training and education through an investment in
    the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy and a plan for expanding training
    opportunities.
-   To ensure national economic security, the U.S. government will
    increase the fleet of commercial vessels trading internationally
    under U.S. flag as well as domestically between our ports.
-   The MAP will develop a strategy to ensure security and leadership of
    arctic waterways to address the growing presence of foreign nations
    in the region and the need for the United States to reestablish
    itself in the area.
-   The Administration will review ways to improve competition within
    the private sector for government projects and reduce costs to
    ensure taxpayer funds are being utilized most efficiently.
-   The Order directs the Secretary of Defense to conduct a review and
    issue guidance on the funding, retention, support, and mobilization
    of a robust inactive reserve fleet, to ensure we have adequate
    assured access to sealift capacity whenever needed for military
    operations.

**RESURRECTING THE AMERICAN MARITIME INDUSTRY:** After being weakened by
decades of government neglect, President Trump is prioritizing the
revitalization of the U.S. maritime industry to strengthen the nation’s
economic and national security as part of the America First Agenda.

-   0.2% of the world’s ships are built by the United States, compared
    to 74% built by China.
-   0% of the containers used to move commodities around the world are
    built by the United States, compared to 96% built by China.
-   0% of the ship-to-shore cranes in the United States are built
    domestically, compared to 80% built by China.
-   Chinese state-owned software is being installed in port operations
    across the United States, with limited to no alternatives.

**MAKING SHIPBUILDING GREAT AGAIN:** President Trump cares deeply about
revitalizing shipbuilding and strengthening America’s maritime power.  

-   During the joint address to Congress, President Trump vowed to
    “resurrect the American shipbuilding industry, including commercial
    shipbuilding and military shipbuilding.”
    -   President Trump: “We used to make so many ships.  We don’t make
        them anymore very much, but we’re going to make them very fast,
        very soon.  It will have a huge impact.”
-   To demonstrate the seriousness with which President Trump views this
    issue, he also established a new Office of Maritime and Industrial
    Capacity at the National Security Council in the White House.
