---
 
**EMPOWERING AMERICA’S YOUTH:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed
an executive order to create new educational and workforce development
opportunities for America’s youth, fostering interest and expertise in
artificial intelligence (AI) technology from an early age to maintain
America’s global dominance in this technological revolution for future
generations.

-   AI is rapidly transforming the modern world, driving innovation,
    enhancing productivity, and reshaping how we live and work.
-   America’s youth need opportunities to cultivate the skills and
    understanding necessary to use and create the next generation of AI
    technology.
    -   Early training in AI will demystify this technology and prepare
        America’s students to be confident participants in the
        AI-assisted workforce, propelling our nation to new heights of
        scientific and economic achievement.
-   Preparing our students to be leaders in AI technology also requires
    investing in our educators, providing them with the tools and
    knowledge to both train students about AI and utilize the technology
    in the classroom.
-   Lifelong learners also need new resources to develop technical
    skills for a rapidly evolving work environment that increasingly
    incorporates digital technology.

**PROMOTING AI LITERACY AND PROFICIENCY**: President Trump promised to
ensure and advance America’s position as the global leader in AI
technology. By incorporating AI into education and providing AI training
for educators, we will help equip the next generation of American AI
innovators.

-   To do this, President Trump is establishing the White House Task
    Force on AI Education.
-   The task force will be chaired by the Director of the White House
    Office of Science and Technology Policy and include other key
    members of the administration, such as the Secretary of Education,
    the Secretary of Labor, and the Special Advisor for AI & Crypto.
-   The task force will plan and help agencies implement a Presidential
    AI Challenge, which will encourage and highlight student and
    educator achievements in AI, promote wide geographic adoption of
    technological advancement, and foster collaboration between
    government, academia, philanthropy, and industry to address national
    challenges with AI solutions.
-   The task force will also establish public-private partnerships to
    provide resources for K-12 AI education, both to enhance AI-related
    education but also to better utilize AI tools in education
    generally.
-   The order directs the Secretary of Education to prioritize the use
    of AI in discretionary grant programs for teacher training and
    directs the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) to
    prioritize research on the use of AI in education.

**PREPARING AMERICA’S WORKFORCE:** Protecting and preparing the American
workforce for the challenges of the future has always been at the
forefront of the President’s AI agenda.

-   Today’s executive order instructs the Secretary of Labor to leverage
    authorities and financial incentives to increase participation in
    AI-related apprenticeships.
-   It also instructs the Secretary of Labor to encourage States and
    grantees to use Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA)
    funding to develop AI skills and support work-based learning
    opportunities within occupations utilizing AI.
-   The Secretary of Labor, through the Assistant Secretary of Labor for
    Employment and Training, in collaboration with the Director of NSF,
    will work with State and local workforce organizations and training
    providers to identify and promote high-quality AI skills education
    coursework and certifications across the country.
-   The Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Education, and the NSF
    Director will work together to create opportunities for high school
    students to take AI courses and certification programs.
