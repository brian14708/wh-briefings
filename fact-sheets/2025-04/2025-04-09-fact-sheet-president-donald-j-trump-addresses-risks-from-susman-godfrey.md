title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Addresses Risks from Susman Godfrey'
---
 
**SUSPENDING SECURITY CLEARANCES TO PROTECT THE NATIONAL INTEREST:**
Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to suspend
security clearances held by individuals at Susman Godfrey LLP (Susman)
pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the
national interest.

-   Security clearances held by Susman employees will be immediately
    suspended, pending a review of whether their access to sensitive
    information is consistent with the national interest.
    -   The Federal Government will halt all material and services,
        including sensitive compartmented information facility (SCIF)
        access provided to Susman and restrict its employees’ access to
        government buildings.

    -   Federal Agencies will also refrain from hiring Susman employees
        unless specifically authorized.
-   To ensure taxpayer dollars no longer go to contractors whose
    earnings subsidize activities not aligned with American interests,
    the Federal Government will terminate contracts that involve Susman.
-   The practices of Susman will be reviewed under Title VII to ensure
    compliance with civil rights laws against racial bias.

**ADDRESSING ROGUE LAW FIRMS:** President Trump believes that lawyers
and law firms that engage in conduct detrimental to critical American
interests should not be subsidized by American taxpayers or have access
to our Nation’s secrets.

-   Susman spearheads efforts to weaponize the American legal system and
    degrade the quality of American elections.
-   Susman funds groups that engage in dangerous efforts to undermine
    the effectiveness of the U.S. military through the injection of
    political and radical ideology, and it supports efforts to
    discriminate on the basis of race.
-   Susman has been accused of engaging in unlawful discrimination,
    including on the basis of race.
    -   Susman administers a program where it offers financial awards
        and employment opportunities only to “students of color.”

**A RETURN TO ACCOUNTABILITY:** President Trump is delivering on his
promise to end the weaponization of government and protect the nation
from partisan and bad faith actors who exploit their influence. 

-   In addition to Susman, President Trump has also taken action to hold
    other major law firms accountable.
-   This Executive Order aligns with President Trump’s priority on
    refocusing government operations to serve the citizens of the United
    States.
-   It builds on President Trump’s previous actions, such as signing an
    Executive Order on his first day in office to end the weaponization
    of the Federal government and ensure accountability for past
    misconduct.
-   It follows his revocation of security clearances held by
    intelligence officials who falsely claimed Hunter Biden’s laptop was
    Russian disinformation during the 2020 election.
