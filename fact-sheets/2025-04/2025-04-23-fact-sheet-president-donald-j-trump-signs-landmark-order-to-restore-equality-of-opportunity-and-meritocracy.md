title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Signs Landmark Order to Restore Equality
  of Opportunity and Meritocracy'
---
 
**TREATING AMERICANS EQUALLY:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed
an Executive Order eliminating the use of disparate-impact liability in
various contexts to ensure equal treatment under the law.

-   Disparate-impact liability is a legal theory holding that
    differences in outcomes among races, sexes, or similar groups
    indicate unlawful discrimination, even without discriminatory intent
    or policies, but the theory violates the Constitution’s guarantee of
    equal treatment for all by requiring race-oriented policies and
    practices to rebalance outcomes along racial lines.
-   The Order revokes presidential actions that approved of
    disparate-impact liability and sets in motion broader reform.
-   It directs all agencies to deprioritize enforcement of statutes and
    regulations that include disparate-impact liability.
-   The Order instructs the Attorney General to repeal or amend all
    Title VI (racial nondiscrimination) regulations that contemplate
    disparate-impact liability.
-   It directs the administration to assess all pending investigations,
    lawsuits, and consent judgements that rely on a theory of
    disparate-impact liability, and take appropriate action.

**RESTORING EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY:** This Executive Order restores the
true promise of the Civil Rights Movement—a system that does not
differentiate between Americans based on race and where success is
determined by individual merit, free from discriminatory practices that
prioritize group outcomes over personal achievement.

-   Disparate-impact liability undermines civil-rights laws by mandating
    discrimination to achieve predetermined, race-oriented outcomes,
    contradicting the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection and
    treatment.
-   It hinders businesses from making merit-based hiring
    decisions—depriving job seekers of opportunities best suited to
    their skills and preventing employers from acting in the best
    interests of their customers and the public.
-   The Order ensures that opportunity is based on individual effort and
    achievement, not immutable characteristics, upholding the promise of
    the American Dream.

**ADVANCING A MERIT-BASED AMERICA:** President Trump is a champion of
individual merit and fairness.  

-   President Trump: “Our country is going to be based on merit again.”
-   In his first week in office, President Trump signed an Executive
    Order to restore merit-based opportunity in the federal workforce.
-   President Trump also signed an Executive Order to restore merit and
    mission focus to America’s armed forces.
