  Aliens'

**CRACKING DOWN ON SANCTUARY CITIES:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order to enforce federal law with respect to
sanctuary jurisdictions to protect their citizens from dangerous illegal
aliens.

-   The Order directs the Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland
    Security to publish a list of States and local jurisdictions
    obstructing federal immigration law enforcement and notify each
    sanctuary jurisdiction of its non-compliance, providing an
    opportunity to correct it.
-   Sanctuary jurisdictions that do not comply with federal law may lose
    federal funding.
-   The Order directs the Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland
    Security to pursue all necessary legal remedies and enforcement
    measures to bring non-compliant jurisdictions into compliance.
-   It instructs the Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security
    to develop mechanisms for proper eligibility verification in
    sanctuary jurisdictions to prevent illegal aliens from receiving
    federal public benefits.
-   The Order ensures illegal aliens are not being favored over American
    citizens by directing the Attorney General to address state or local
    laws that unlawfully prioritize aliens.
    -   This includes in-state tuition benefits for aliens or criminal
        sentencing factors that favor aliens.

**ENFORCING FEDERAL LAW:** President Trump believes it is imperative
that the federal government restore the enforcement of United States
immigration law to protect national sovereignty and security.

-   Millions of illegal aliens entered the United States under President
    Biden’s watch, including human smugglers, gang members, criminals,
    and terrorists.
-   Some state and local officials are choosing to violate, obstruct,
    and defy the enforcement of Federal immigration laws, a lawless
    insurrection against the Federal Government’s constitutional
    authority to protect the territorial sovereignty of the United
    States and conduct a unified national policy on immigration.
    -   The sanctuary state of Massachusetts released several illegal
        aliens accused of raping kids back into the community while
        refusing to hold them for ICE.

    -   Jose Ibarra was arrested and released twice before going on to
        murder Laken Riley.

    -   The sanctuary city of Philadelphia ignored an ICE detainer and
        released a previously deported illegal alien from Honduras, who
        then went on to rape a child.
-   Beyond creating enormous national security risks, these efforts
    often violate federal criminal laws, including those prohibiting
    obstruction of justice, harboring or hiring illegal aliens,
    conspiring against the United States, and impeding federal law
    enforcement.

**SECURING OUR HOMELAND:** President Trump is following through on his
promise to rid the United States of sanctuary cities.

-   President Trump: “No more Sanctuary Cities! They protect the
    Criminals, not the Victims. They are disgracing our Country, and are
    being mocked all over the World. Working on papers to withhold all
    Federal Funding for any City or State that allows these Death Traps
    to exist!!!”
