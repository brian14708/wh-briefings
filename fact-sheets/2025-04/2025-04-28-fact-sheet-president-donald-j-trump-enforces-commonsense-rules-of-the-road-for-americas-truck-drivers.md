**ENFORCING ENGLISH PROFICIENCY FOR SAFETY:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed an Executive Order to keep American families safe on the
road by ensuring anyone behind the wheel of a commercial vehicle is
properly qualified and proficient in English.

-   The Order directs the Secretary of Transportation to rescind
    guidance that watered down the law requiring English proficiency for
    commercial drivers.
-   It mandates revising out-of-service criteria to ensure drivers
    violating English proficiency rules are placed out-of-service,
    enhancing roadway safety.
-   It instructs the Secretary of Transportation to review state
    issuance of non-domiciled commercial driver’s licenses to identify
    any irregularities and ensure American drivers are validly licensed
    and qualified.
-   The Order directs the Secretary of Transportation to carry out
    additional administrative, regulatory, or enforcement actions to
    improve the working conditions of America’s truck drivers.

**SUPPORTING AMERICA’S TRUCK DRIVERS:** President Trump recognizes that
America’s truck drivers are essential to the strength of our economy,
the security of our Nation, and the livelihoods of the American people.

-   President Trump believes that English is a non-negotiable safety
    requirement for professional drivers, as they should be able to read
    and understand traffic signs; communicate with traffic safety
    officers, border patrol, agricultural checkpoints, and cargo
    weight-limit station personnel; and provide and receive feedback and
    directions in English.
-   Federal law mandates that commercial vehicle drivers read and speak
    English sufficiently, yet this requirement has not been enforced
    pursuant to Obama Administration guidance, compromising roadway
    safety as trucking fatalities have increased since this guidance was
    issued.
    -   Motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of death in the United
        States, killing over 120 people every day.
-   The Trump Administration is committed to enforcing this law to
    protect the safety of American truckers, drivers, passengers, and
    others by ensuring that anyone operating a commercial vehicle is
    properly qualified and proficient in English, the national language.

**UPHOLDING NATIONAL LANGUAGE STANDARDS:** President Trump has long
championed the idea that English should be the official language of the
United States.

-   President Trump previously signed an Executive Order designating
    English as the official language of the United States. 
-   With this Executive Order, President Trump is ensuring commercial
    drivers meet established English-proficiency standards to safely
    navigate roads, comply with regulations, and communicate effectively
    with authorities and employers.
