title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Addresses Risks Associated with Miles
  Taylor'
---
 
**RECLAIMING GOVERNMENT INTEGRITY:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed a Presidential Memorandum suspending any active security
clearance held by Miles Taylor and his associates.

-   The Order directs the head of every federal agency to immediately
    suspend any active security clearance held by Taylor.
-   The Order also suspends any active security clearance held by
    individuals at entities associated with Taylor, including the
    University of Pennsylvania, pending a review of whether such
    clearances are consistent with the national interest.
-   Furthermore, the Order calls for a review of Taylor’s activities as
    a government employee to identify any instances where his conduct
    appears to have been contrary to suitability standards for federal
    employees or involved the unauthorized dissemination of classified
    information.

**ERADICATING GOVERNMENT BETRAYAL:** President Trump is committed to
ending the weaponization of government and believes that those who
engage in such conduct should not have access to our nation’s secrets.

-   Taylor is a bad-faith actor who weaponized and abused his government
    position, prioritizing his own ambition, personal notoriety, and
    monetary gain over fidelity to his constitutional oath.
-   While serving as an administrative staff assistant at the Department
    of Homeland Security, Taylor stoked dissension by manufacturing
    sensationalist reports on the existence of a supposed “resistance”
    within the federal government that “vowed” to undermine and render
    effective a sitting President.
-   Taylor published a book under the pseudonym “Anonymous,” full of
    falsehoods and fabricated stories. 
-   Taylor disclosed sensitive information obtained through unauthorized
    methods and betrayed the confidence of those with whom he served.
-   Taylor relied upon various colleagues to facilitate his unethical
    laundering and release of sensitive government data to advance his
    false narratives.

**DRAINING THE SWAMP:** President Trump is delivering on his promise to
drain the swamp by rooting out inefficiency, corruption, and disloyalty.

-   President Trump already suspended the security clearances held by
    numerous other individuals who have engaged in conduct detrimental
    to American interests.
-   He is ensuring taxpayer funds do not go to anti-American activists
    and is declassifying records related to alleged government
    misconduct, providing transparency to the public.
-   The Trump Administration is aggressively investigating Biden-era
    programs that wasted billions of taxpayer dollars on inefficient and
    politically-driven projects, including canceling unnecessary
    government contracts and grants that do not serve the national
    interest.
-   President Trump is restoring trust in government by prioritizing
    loyalty to the Constitution and the American people over entrenched
    bureaucratic interests.
