title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Enforces Requirement of Cost-Effective
  Commercial Solutions in Federal Contracts'
---
 
**ENFORCING COST-EFFECTIVE PROCUREMENT:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed an Executive Order to enforce existing law requiring the
Federal Government to utilize the competitive marketplace and the
innovations of private enterprise to provide better, more-cost-effective
services to the taxpayer.

-   The Order directs the administration to prioritize the procurement
    of commercially available products and services, as required by the
    Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (FASA), rather than
    non-commercial, custom products or services.
-   It calls for agency contracting officers to review all pending
    contracts for non-commercial products or services within 60 days and
    submit proposed waivers justifying their necessity.
    -   The waivers must include market research and price analysis to
        demonstrate why commercial solutions cannot meet the
        government’s needs.
-   It directs agencies to submit reports to the Office of Management
    and Budget (OMB) within 120 days and annually thereafter detailing
    compliance with FASA and progress on implementing the Order’s
    policies.
-   The Order establishes that waivers for non-commercial procurements
    must be reviewed and approved or denied in writing.

**CURBING WASTEFUL EXPENDITURES:** President Trump is eliminating
unnecessary and imprudent expenditures of taxpayer dollars by requiring
government procurement of existing commercial products and services
where possible.

-   Previous administrations evaded statutory requirements and abused
    the federal contracting framework by procuring custom products and
    services where a suitable or superior commercial solution would
    fulfill the Government’s needs.
-   This overreliance on custom items increased government spending and
    caused costly delays to the detriment of American taxpayers.
-   Federal agencies are wasting taxpayer dollars on non-commercial
    solutions that fail to leverage the efficiency and competitiveness
    of the private-sector marketplace.
-   For example, with respect to IT procurement, a 2019 report found
    that the Federal government could have saved an estimated $345
    billion over the last 25 years if it had abided by FASA and
    purchased more commercial off-the-shelf IT solutions, rather than
    building systems from scratch.

**PROMOTING COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS AND STREAMLINING ACQUISITIONS:**
President Trump is ensuring government procurement delivers better value
to American taxpayers.

-   President Trump previously signed an Executive Order to modernize
    defense acquisitions, including a preference for commercial
    solutions.
-   President Trump also signed an Executive Order consolidating certain
    federal procurement in the General Services Administration in order
    to eliminate waste, inefficiencies, and duplication.
