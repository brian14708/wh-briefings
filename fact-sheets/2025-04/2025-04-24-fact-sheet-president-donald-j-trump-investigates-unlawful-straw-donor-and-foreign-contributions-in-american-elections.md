  \ and Foreign Contributions in American Elections"
---
 
**INVESTIGATING “STRAW” DONORS:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed a Presidential Memorandum to crack down on illegal “straw donor”
and foreign contributions in American elections, following reports and
congressional investigations regarding potentially unlawful activities
through ActBlue and other online fundraising platforms.

-   The Memorandum directs the Attorney General to investigate and take
    appropriate action concerning allegations regarding the use of
    online fundraising platforms to make “straw” or “dummy”
    contributions and to make foreign contributions to U.S. political
    candidates and committees, all of which break the law.
-   Specifically, the Memorandum notes that a congressional
    investigation revealed significant fraud schemes using ActBlue and,
    over a 30-day period during the 2024 election cycle, hundreds of
    ActBlue donations from foreign IP addresses using prepaid cards,
    despite it being illegal for foreign nationals to contribute to U.S.
    elections.
-   It instructs the Attorney General to report the results of the
    investigation to the President, through the Counsel to the
    President. 

**PROTECTING AMERICAN DEMOCRACY:** President Trump is taking action to
address malign actors and foreign nationals who seek to illegally
influence American elections, undermining the integrity of our electoral
process.

-   Recently uncovered evidence suggests that online fundraising
    platforms are being used to launder excessive and prohibited
    contributions to political candidates and committees.
-   Bad actors have sought to evade Federal source and amount
    limitations by breaking down large contributions into smaller ones,
    often attributing them to numerous individuals without their consent
    or knowledge.
-   These “straw donations” are frequently made through “dummy”
    accounts, using methods such as gift cards or prepaid credit cards
    to avoid detection.
-   ActBlue has become notorious for its lax standards that enable
    unverified and fraudulent donations. 
-   A recent House of Representatives investigation found that ActBlue
    detected at least 22 “significant fraud campaigns” in recent
    years—nearly half of which had a foreign nexus.
    -   Over a 30-day window during the 2024 election cycle, ActBlue
        detected 237 donations from foreign IP addresses using prepaid
        cards.

    -   The investigation revealed that ActBlue trained employees to
        “look for reasons to accept contributions,” even in the face of
        suspicious activity.
-   Until recently, ActBlue accepted political contributions without
    requiring a card verification value (CVV), making it easy to
    contribute without identity verification.
    -   Before addressing this issue in response to a congressional
        investigation, ActBlue tested whether this would hurt its
        fundraising.
-   Numerous state attorneys general have opened investigations into
    ActBlue over suspicious donations made through obscured identities
    and untraceable means.

**MAKING ELECTIONS SECURE AGAIN:**  Voters deserve elections they can
trust, and that confidence is being restored thanks to President Trump. 

-   President Trump is following through on his promise to secure our
    elections.
    -   President Trump: “We’re going to fix our elections so that our
        elections are going to be honorable and honest.”
    -   President Trump: “We will secure our elections, and they will be
        secure once and for all.”
-   President Trump recently signed an Executive Order to protect the
    integrity of American elections.
-   Unlike the Biden Administration, which prioritized political agendas
    over fair elections, President Trump is putting the American people
    back in charge.
