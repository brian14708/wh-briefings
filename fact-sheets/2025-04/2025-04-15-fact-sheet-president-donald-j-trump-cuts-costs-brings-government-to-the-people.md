title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Cuts Costs, Brings Government to the
  People'
---
 
**RESTORING FLEXIBILITY IN FEDERAL OFFICE SPACE MANAGEMENT:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order rescinding two
executive actions issued by Presidents Carter and Clinton that constrain
federal office locations, continuing to cut wasteful spending and
improve government service to the American people.

-   This Executive Order rescinds two long-standing presidential actions
    that unnecessarily restricted where federal agencies could site
    their facilities.
-   President Trump’s Order allows federal agencies to select office
    space and facilities based on cost-effectiveness, mission
    suitability, and the needs of the American people.
-   The Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) will
    update federal office space management regulations to conform with
    this Order.

**BRINGING GOVERNMENT TO THE PEOPLE:** By eliminating the needless and
counterproductive location restrictions, President Trump is making it
easier for federal agencies to bring their services to the American
people.

-   The GSA currently manages approximately 363 million rentable square
    feet in 8,397 buildings in more than 2,200 communities nationwide.
    -   Deferred maintenance liabilities now exceed $17 billion, and in
        many cases, these liabilities exceed the value of the properties
        owned by GSA.
-   The rescinded orders required federal agencies to prioritize central
    business districts and historic properties and districts when
    selecting locations for federal facilities. 
-   Those actions prevented agencies from prioritizing efficiency and
    cost-effectiveness in siting decisions.
-   Thanks to this Executive Order, agencies are empowered to site their
    facilities in the best available properties near the people they
    serve.

** RETURNING COMMON SENSE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT:** President Trump
is restoring common sense to Federal office space management.

-   The Trump Administration is working to right-size the federal real
    estate portfolio to reduce the burden on the American taxpayer. 
-   President Trump signed an Executive Order on Day One to require
    employees return to in-person work, addressing the chronic
    underutilization of federal office space.
