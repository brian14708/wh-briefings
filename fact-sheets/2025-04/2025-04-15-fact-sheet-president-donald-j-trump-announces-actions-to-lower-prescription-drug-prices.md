title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Announces Actions to Lower Prescription
  Drug Prices'
---
 
**LOWERING PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order to expand on the historic efforts of his first
term to lower prescription drug prices.

-   The Order directs the Department of Health and Human Services to
    take steps to significantly reduce drug prices for American
    patients.
-   It delivers lower drug prices for Medicare and the seniors who rely
    on it by:
    -   Improving the Medicare Drug Pricing Negotiation Program in order
        to eclipse the 22% in savings achieved in the program’s first
        year.
    -   Aligning Medicare payment for certain prescription drugs with
        the cost by which hospitals actually acquire them, which can be
        35% lower than what the government currently pays.
    -   Standardizing Medicare payments for prescription drugs, such as
        cancer treatments, regardless of where the patient receives
        care, which can lower prices by as much as 60%.
-   It provides massive discounts to low-income patients for life-saving
    medications.
    -   Insulin prices for low-income patients and the uninsured will be
        lowered to as low as $0.03, plus a small administrative fee.
    -   Injectable epinephrine for low-income patients and the uninsured
        will be as low as $15, plus a small administrative fee.
-   The Order helps states reduce drug prices by:
    -   Facilitating importation programs that could save states
        millions in prescription drug costs.
    -   Building off programs to help states get much better deals on
        expensive sickle-cell medications in Medicaid than the
        statutorily required 23.1% discount.

**BRINGING RADICAL TRANSPARENCY AND COMPETITION TO PRESCRIPTION DRUG
MARKETS:** President Trump is dedicated to creating a transparent,
competitive, and fair prescription drug market for American consumers.

-   President Trump has already taken numerous actions to end the
    practice of large corporations profiting by keeping health care
    prices and business practices hidden from Americans.

-   The Order increases the availability of generics and biosimilars,
    which can be as much as 80% cheaper than brand alternatives.
-   The Order builds off that critical work and reevaluates the role of
    middlemen by:
    -   Improving disclosure of fees that pharmaceutical benefit
        managers (PBMs) pay to brokers for steering employers to utilize
        their services.
    -   Directing the administration to develop reforms to promote a
        more competitive, transparent, efficient, and resilient
        prescription drug value chain.
-   By addressing the influence of middlemen and promoting open
    competition, President Trump’s actions aim to create a fairer
    prescription drug market that lowers costs and ensures
    accountability across the health care system.

**PUTTING AMERICAN PATIENTS FIRST ONCE AGAIN:** President Trump is
delivering on his promise to once again put American patients first by
building off of the historic efforts of his first term to lower
prescription drug prices.

-   In his first term, President Trump took numerous actions that
    delivered real results for patients:
    -   The Food and Drug Administration sped up development of
        lower-cost generic medicines and biosimilars as well as created
        a pathway for states to import lower cost drugs from Canada.
    -   Government-mandated discounts were passed through to patients
        instead of being retained by middlemen.
    -   Price transparency rules were developed to allow patients,
        doctors, and employers to see the actual cost of prescription
        drugs.
    -   Insulin copays were capped for Medicare beneficiaries.
-   Unsurprisingly, the Biden-Harris Administration let many of these
    priorities languish while failing to even achieve the savings
    projected from the new Medicare Prescription Drug Negotiation
    Program.
-   President Trump will not stand for inaction, and his Administration
    is working rapidly to lower the cost of prescription drugs for
    Americans.
