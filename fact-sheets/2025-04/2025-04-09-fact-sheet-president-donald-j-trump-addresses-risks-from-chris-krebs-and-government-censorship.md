title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Addresses Risks from Chris Krebs and
  Government Censorship'
---
 
**RESTORING TRUST IN GOVERNMENT:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed a Presidential Memorandum revoking any active security clearance
held by Chris Krebs and his associates.

-   The Order directs the head of every federal agency to immediately
    revoke any active security clearance held by Krebs.
-   The Order also suspends any active security clearance held by
    individuals at entities associated with Krebs, including
    SentinelOne, pending a review of whether such clearances are
    consistent with the national interest.
-   Furthermore, the Order calls for a review of Krebs’ activities as a
    government employee, including his leadership of the Cybersecurity
    and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).
    -   The review will include a comprehensive evaluation of all of
        CISA’s activities over the last 6 years and will identify any
        instances where Krebs’ or CISA’s conduct appears to be contrary
        to the administration’s commitment to free speech and ending
        federal censorship, including whether Krebs’ conduct was
        contrary to suitability standards for federal employees or
        involved the unauthorized dissemination of classified
        information.

**ENDING GOVERNMENT CENSORSHIP:** President Trump is committed to ending
government censorship of Americans and believes that those who engage in
such conduct should not have access to our nation’s secrets.

-   Krebs, the former head of CISA, is a significant bad-faith actor who
    weaponized and abused his government authority.
-   Krebs, through CISA:
    -   Suppressed conservative viewpoints under the guise of combatting
        purported misinformation, and recruited and coerced major social
        media platforms to further its partisan mission.

    <!-- -->

    -   Covertly worked to blind the American public to the controversy
        surrounding Hunter Biden’s laptop.

    <!-- -->

    -   Promoted the censorship of election information, including known
        risks associated with certain voting practices, and falsely and
        baselessly denied that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen,
        including by inappropriately and categorically dismissing
        widespread election malfeasance and serious vulnerabilities with
        voting machines.

    <!-- -->

    -   Skewed the bona fide debate about COVID-19 by attempting to
        discredit widely shared views that ran contrary to CISA’s
        favored perspective.

**ENSURING LOYALTY AND ACCOUNTABILITY:** President Trump has made clear
that loyalty to the United States must come before personal or partisan
agendas, taking decisive action against those who misuse their
undeserved influence to deceive the American public.

-   President Trump already revoked the security clearances held by
    intelligence officials who falsely claimed Hunter Biden’s laptop was
    Russian disinformation during the 2020 election.
-   On Day One, President Trump signed an Executive Order to restore
    freedom of speech, dismantling federal programs that censored
    dissenting voices under the guise of combating misinformation,
    ensuring government serves the people—not partisan narratives.
-   That same day, President Trump signed an Executive Order ending the
    weaponization of the federal government.
-   These decisive actions underscore President Trump’s pledge to ensure
    a transparent government that is loyal and accountable to the
    people.
