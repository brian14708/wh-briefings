  Procurement'

**SUPPORTING AND EMBRACING AMERICAN INNOVATION:** Under President  
Trump’s leadership, America is well-positioned to maintain its global
dominance in artificial  
intelligence (AI) innovation. Today, the White House Office of
Management and Budget, in  
coordination with the Assistant to the President for Science and
Technology, issued two revised policies to facilitate responsible AI
adoption to improve public services. These policies fundamentally shift
perspectives and direction from the prior Administration, focusing now
on utilizing emerging technologies to modernize the Federal Government.

-   The Executive Branch is shifting to a forward-leaning,
    pro-innovation and pro competition mindset rather than pursuing the
    risk-averse approach of the previous  
    administration.
-   The Federal Government will no longer impose unnecessary
    bureaucratic restrictions on the use of innovative American AI in
    the Executive Branch.
-   By embracing AI adoption, agencies will be more agile,
    cost-effective, and efficient.
-   This shift will deliver improvements to the lives of the American
    public while enhancing  
    America’s global dominance in AI innovation.

**PROMOTING RAPID AND RESPONSIBLE AI ADOPTION:** M-25-21 gives agencies
the  
tools necessary to embrace AI innovation, while maintaining strong
protections for Americans’ privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.

-   Agencies will empower AI leaders to remove barriers to AI
    innovation.
    -   Agency Chief AI Officer roles are redefined to serve as change
        agents and AI advocates, rather than overseeing layers of
        bureaucracy.
    -   Chief AI Officers are tasked with promoting agency-wide AI
        innovation and adoption for lower risk AI, mitigating risks for
        higher-impact AI, and advising on agency AI investments and
        spending.
-   Agencies will produce an AI adoption maturity assessment to better
    track progress and  
    needs.
-   Policies introduce a single “high-impact AI” category to track AI
    use cases that require  
    heightened due diligence because of potential impacts on the rights
    or safety of the  
    American people.
-   Accountability for AI will mirror the existing process for using
    government IT, instead of  
    creating new layers of approvals.
-   Use of American AI will be maximized when seeking new AI solutions.

**DRIVING EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT AI ACQUISITION:** M-25-22 provides
agencies  
with concise, effective guidance on how to acquire best-in-class AI
quickly, competitively, and responsibly.

-   Agencies must support a competitive American AI marketplace,
    maximizing the use of American AI systems and services in support of
    American AI leadership, human flourishing, economic competitiveness,
    and national security.
-   This policy recognizes the importance of competition, communicating
    clear and specific requirements that avoid vendor lock-in.
-   The new approach removes burdensome agency reporting requirements
    and optimizes the acquisition process, while continuing to protect
    privacy and ensure lawful use of  
    government data.
-   Agencies will use performance-based techniques to best harness the
    rapidly developing AI marketplace and create an online shared
    repository of resources and tools to assist with AI procurement.

**AI WORKING FOR AMERICANS:** Federal agencies are maximizing the
benefits of AI to  
promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national
security. Illustrative  
examples include the following:

-   The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) optimizes patient care
    through AI tools that help identify and standardize Veterans’ care.
    -   The VA uses AI to support the identification and analysis of
        pulmonary nodules  
        during lung cancer screening exams. The AI functionality
        improves detection of these nodules, assisting clinicians with
        life-saving diagnoses.
-   The Department of Justice (DOJ) improves public safety by leveraging
    AI to protect the  
    American public.
    -   The DOJ is using AI to better understand the global drug market
        and the impact of illicit drugs on communities and individuals,
        in order to further drug trafficking  
        investigations and protect the American public.
-   The National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA) expands
    humanity’s ability to  
    safely traverse Mars by using AI.
    -   NASA is using AI on the Mars2020 Rover to help it navigate with
        limited direction  
        from Earth, optimizing scientific discovery from the rover’s
        sensors and assuring it safely traverses the planet’s hazardous
        terrain.
