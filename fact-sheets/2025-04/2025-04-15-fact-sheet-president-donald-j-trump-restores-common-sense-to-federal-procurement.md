title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Restores Common Sense to Federal Procurement'
---
 
**MODERNIZING THE PROCUREMENT SYSTEM:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order restoring common sense to Federal procurement
by dramatically simplifying the process.

-   The Order directs his administration to simplify and streamline the
    Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which governs Federal
    procurement, to ensure it contains only provisions required by
    statute or essential to efficient, secure, and cost-effective
    procurement.
-   Agencies exercising procurement authority must ensure
    agency-specific regulations align with the streamlined FAR.
-   The Order mandates the issuance of interim guidance, as needed, to
    support reform until the final rules reforming the FAR are
    published.
-   A regulatory sunset provision will be considered that would result
    in non-statutory FAR provisions expiring after four years unless
    renewed.

**ELIMINATING BARRIERS TO DOING BUSINESS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT:**
President Trump wants to create the most agile, effective, and efficient
procurement system possible.

-   The Federal Government is the largest buyer of goods and services in
    the world, spending nearly $1 trillion annually, yet conducting
    business with the Federal Government is often prohibitively
    inefficient and costly given the regulatory complexity.
-   Since its inception over 40 years ago, the FAR has ballooned to more
    than 2,000 pages of regulations, creating an onerous bureaucracy
    that undermines timely delivery of high-value products and services.
-   Studies have consistently found that the FAR is a barrier to, rather
    than a prudent vehicle for, doing business with the Federal
    Government.
-   By reforming the FAR, President Trump is reducing bureaucratic
    hurdles, empowering all businesses to compete for government
    contracts, and ensuring taxpayer dollars deliver maximum value.

**RECLAIMING EFFICIENCY FOR THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER:** President Trump is
working to simplify the Federal Government and free the American people
from excessive regulations and bureaucracy.

-   President Trump launched a 10-to-1 deregulation initiative, ensuring
    every new Federal rule is justified by clear benefits and
    accompanied by much larger deregulatory measures.
-   At every step, President Trump is promoting the use of commercial
    options, letting the market drive innovation and deliver
    high-quality, cost-effective solutions to meet government needs.
-   President Trump established the “Department of Government
    Efficiency” to examine how to streamline the operations of the
    Federal Government, eliminate unnecessary programs and wasteful
    spending, and reduce bureaucratic inefficiency.
-   President Trump has already reduced unnecessarily large governmental
    entities and terminated numerous harmful Biden expansions of
    governmental authority.
