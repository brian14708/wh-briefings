title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Reforms Foreign Defense Sales to Improve
  Speed and Accountability'
---
 
**ENSURING A RAPID AND TRANSPARENT FOREIGN DEFENSE SALES SYSTEM:**
Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to improve
speed and accountability in the defense sales system. This Order:

-   Improves accountability and transparency throughout the foreign
    defense sales system to ensure predictable and reliable delivery of
    American products to foreign partners and allies in support of U.S.
    foreign policy objectives.
-   Reduces rules and regulations involved in developing and executing
    foreign defense sales to ensure they advance U.S. interests.
-   Promotes U.S. competitiveness abroad, revitalizes the defense
    industrial base at home, and delivers cost efficiencies for the
    United States and trusted our allies and partners.
-   Instructs the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State to develop
    a list of priority partners for conventional arms transfers and
    prioritize end-items for potential transfer to those partners.
-   Instructs the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State, along
    with the Secretary of Commerce, to submit a plan to the President
    within 90 days that improves defense sales transparency via
    accountability metrics; secures exportability as a requirement
    earlier in the acquisition cycle; and consolidates the sale
    approvals process.

**ENABLING EFFECTIVE DEFENSE COOPERATION:** President Trump is committed
to ensuring America maintains the world’s strongest and most
technologically advanced military, supported by a robust network of
capable partners and allies.

-   Developing a rapid and transparent foreign defense sales system that
    enables effective defense cooperation between the United States and
    our chosen partners is foundational to these objectives.
-   Streamlining the foreign defense sales process will inject
    credibility into U.S. defense cooperation efforts by reducing
    delays, improving efficiency, and enhancing the ability of allies to
    procure critical defense technologies in a timely manner, in turn
    facilitating more effective joint operations as well as greater
    burden-sharing.
-   In tandem, this mutually reinforcing approach will enhance United
    States warfighting capabilities by fostering stronger American
    supply chains, domestic production levels, and technological
    development.
-   The Trump Administration aims to strengthen allied burden-sharing,
    promote global stability, and enhance U.S. strategic influence in
    key regions.
    -   The Executive Order ensures that America and its allies remain
        well-equipped to counter emerging threats and promote peace and
        security around the world.

**PRIORITIZING U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY:** President Trump has
consistently prioritized America’s military greatness and the safety of
the American people by investing in military readiness, strengthening
national defense, and supporting the men and women who serve this great
nation.

-   President Trump wants to build up the U.S. military and ensure that
    our forces remain prepared to meet any challenge.
    -   Under his leadership, our military is restoring a warrior ethos.
