title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Reforms Accreditation to Strengthen
  Higher Education'

**HOLDING ACCREDITORS ACCOUNTABLE:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order to overhaul the higher education accreditation
system, ensuring colleges and universities deliver high-quality,
high-value education free from unlawful discrimination and ideological
overreach.

-   The Order directs the Secretary of Education to hold higher
    education “accreditors” accountable, including through denial,
    monitoring, suspension, or termination of accreditation recognition,
    for accreditors’ poor performance or violations of federal civil
    rights law.
-   It directs the Attorney General and Secretary of Education to
    investigate and take action to terminate unlawful discrimination by
    American higher education institutions, including law schools and
    medical schools.
-   The Order mandates the Secretary of Education realign accreditation
    with student-focused principles by:
    -   Resuming recognition of new accreditors to foster competition.

    -   Requiring institutions use program-level student outcome data to
        improve results, without reference to race, ethnicity, or sex.

    <!-- -->

    -   Requiring high-quality, high-value academic programs.

    <!-- -->

    -   Prioritizing intellectual diversity among faculty in order to
        advance academic freedom, intellectual inquiry, and student
        learning.

    -   Launching an experimental site to test innovative quality
        assurance pathways.

    <!-- -->

    -   Increasing the consistency, efficiency, and effectiveness of the
        accreditor recognition review process.

    -   Streamlining accreditor recognition and institutional
        transitions between accreditors.

**ENSURING AMERICAN STUDENTS RECEIVE A HIGH-QUALITY EDUCATION:**
President Trump is tackling the broken accreditation system that has
left students with soaring debt, low graduation rates, and degrees of
questionable value.

-   Accreditors—the gatekeepers that decide which colleges and
    universities can access over $100 billion in annual Federal student
    loans and Pell Grants—have routinely approved low-quality
    institutions, ultimately failing students, families, and American
    taxpayers.
-   Accreditors have failed to ensure quality, with a national six-year
    undergraduate graduation rate of just 64% in 2020.
-   Nearly 25% of bachelor’s degrees and over 40% of master’s degrees
    offer a negative return on investment, burdening students with debt
    and limited earning potential.
-   Accreditors have also abused their authority by imposing
    discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)-based
    standards, violating Federal law.
    -   The American Bar Association’s (ABA) accreditation standards for
        law schools require unlawful race-based preferences, which the
        Attorney General recently reminded the ABA are illegal.

    -   The Liaison Committee on Medical Education and Accreditation
        Council for Graduate Medical Education imposes similar
        discriminatory requirements, prioritizing ideology over quality
        medical training.
-   These practices have diverted focus from student success to
    ideological conformity, undermining academic integrity and student
    achievement.

**RESTORING TRUST IN HIGHER EDUCATION:** President Trump is protecting
American students, families, and taxpayers from exploitative and
unlawful practices in higher education. 

-   In his first term, President Trump took historic steps to promote
    school choice, expand apprenticeship programs, and increase
    transparency in college costs.
-   This Executive Order builds on that legacy by reforming the
    accreditation system to prioritize student outcomes, eliminate
    unlawful discrimination, promote academic freedom and intellectual
    inquiry, and restore accountability.
-   These reforms will rebuild public trust in higher education,
    empowering students and families to make informed choices.
