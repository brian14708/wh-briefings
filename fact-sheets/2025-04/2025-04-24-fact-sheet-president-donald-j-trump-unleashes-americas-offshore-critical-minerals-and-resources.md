**REVITALIZING AMERICAN DOMINANCE IN DEEP SEABED MINERALS:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed a historic Executive Order to restore
American dominance in offshore critical minerals and resources.

-   The Order rapidly develops domestic capabilities for exploration,
    characterization, collection, and processing of critical deep seabed
    minerals.
    -   It establishes the U.S. as a global leader in seabed mineral
        exploration and development both within and beyond national
        jurisdiction.

    <!-- -->

    -   It creates a robust domestic supply for critical minerals
        derived from seabed resources.

    <!-- -->

    -   It strengthens partnerships with allies and industry to counter
        China’s influence in the seabed mineral resource space.
-   The Order instructs the Secretary of Commerce to expedite the
    process for reviewing and issuing exploration and commercial
    recovery permits under the Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act.
-   The Order directs the Secretary of Commerce, along with the
    Secretary of Interior and Secretary of Energy, to provide a report
    identifying:
    -   Private sector interest and opportunities for seabed mineral
        exploration, mining, and monitoring in the U.S. Outer
        Continental Shelf.

    <!-- -->

    -   Private sector interest and opportunities for nodule and other
        seabed mineral resource processing capacity in the U.S. or on
        U.S. flagged vessels.
-   The Order directs the Secretaries of Commerce, State, and Interior
    to develop a plan to map priority areas of the seabed to accelerate
    data collection.
-   The Order directs the Secretary of Interior to establish a process
    for reviewing and approving permits and granting licenses within the
    U.S. Outer Continental Shelf under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands
    Act and identify which critical minerals may be derived from seabed
    resources for defense, infrastructure, and energy purposes in
    coordination with the Secretaries of Energy and Defense.
-    The Order directs the Secretaries of Commerce, State, Interior, and
    Energy to engage with partners and allies for seabed mineral
    exploration and provide a joint report for the feasibility of an
    international seabed benefit-sharing mechanism.
-   The Order directs the Secretaries of Defense and Energy to provide a
    report addressing feasibility of using National Defense Stockpile
    for nodule-derived minerals; review and revise domestic processing
    capability for seabed mineral resources and DPA authorities; and
    have the Strategic and Critical Minerals Board develop a strategy.
-   The Order directs the CEO of U.S. International Development Finance
    Corporation, President of Export-Import Bank of the U.S., and
    Director of U.S. Trade and Development Agency to provide a report
    identifying tools to support domestic and international seabed
    mineral resource exploration, extraction, processing, and
    environmental monitoring.

**POSITIONING AMERICA AS A GLOBAL LEADER IN CRITICAL MINERALS:**
President Trump’s visionary leadership is positioning the United States
at the forefront of critical mineral production and innovation.  

-   President Trump recently signed an Executive Order to increase
    American critical mineral production.
-   President Trump also signed an Executive Order to open a Section 232
    investigation to evaluate the impact of imports of these materials
    on America’s security and resilience.
-   President Trump advanced the Ambler Access Project, a 211-mile
    industrial road through the Brooks Range foothills that enables
    commercial mining for copper, zinc and other materials in a remote
    Arctic area in Northwest Alaska.
-   With this Executive Order, President Trump is accelerating seabed
    mineral exploration and development to unlock vast offshore
    resources for America’s economic and strategic advantage.
