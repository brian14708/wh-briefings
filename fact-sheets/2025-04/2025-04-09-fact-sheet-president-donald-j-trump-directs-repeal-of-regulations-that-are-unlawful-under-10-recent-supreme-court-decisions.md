title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Directs Repeal of Regulations That Are
  Unlawful Under 10 Recent Supreme Court Decisions'
---
 
**REPEALING UNLAWFUL REGULATIONS:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed a Presidential Memorandum requiring agencies to rescind
regulations that are unlawful under 10 recent landmark Supreme Court
decisions.

-   This memorandum implements President Trump’s Executive Order 14219,
    *Ensuring Lawful Governance and Implementing the President’s
    “Department Of Government Efficiency” Deregulatory Initiative*
    (February 19, 2025).
-   EO 14219 ordered agencies to review and identify their unlawful
    regulations.  Now, President Trump is directing agencies to
    prioritize that review under 10 recent watershed Supreme Court
    cases, and to repeal regulations that are unlawful under those
    cases.

**IMPLEMENTING THE LAW FROM RECENT SUPREME COURT DECISIONS:  **President
Trump’s memorandum directs departments and agencies to review rules for
legality under ten recent watershed Supreme Court decisions:

1.  *Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo*, 603 U.S. 369 (2024)
    overturned the *Chevron* doctrine.  Accordingly, agencies are to
    repeal any regulation that is not consonant with the “single, best
    meaning” of the statute authorizing it.   Agencies are also to
    repeal any regulation that was promulgated in reliance on the
    *Chevron* doctrine and that could be defended only by relying on
    *Chevron* deference.
2.  *West Virginia v. EPA*, 597 U.S. 697 (2022) was a landmark ruling
    applying the Major Questions Doctrine, i.e., the principle that an
    agency cannot claim to discover vast delegations of power on an
    important issue in a statutory text that doesn’t clearly provide
    such authority. (Agencies cannot “seek to hide ‘elephants in
    mouseholes.’”)  Accordingly, agencies must repeal any regulation
    promulgated in violation of the Major Questions Doctrine. 
3.  *SEC v. Jarkesy*, 603 U.S. 109 (2024) held that it violates the
    Seventh Amendment for agencies to adjudicate common-law claims in
    their in-house courts.  Agencies accordingly must repeal any
    regulation authorizing enforcement proceedings that enable the
    agency’s courts to impose judgments or penalties that can only be
    obtained via jury trial in Article III Courts.
4.  *Michigan v. EPA*, 576 U.S. 743 (2015) held that it violates the
    Administrative Procedure Act for an agency to promulgate regulations
    without properly considering the cost as well as the benefits. 
    Agencies accordingly must repeal any regulation where the costs
    imposed are not justified by the public benefits, or where such an
    analysis was never conducted to begin with.
5.  *Sackett v. EPA*, 598 U.S. 651 (2023) ended a twenty-year attempt by
    the EPA to enforce the Clean Water Act against landowners whose
    property was near a ditch that fed into a creek, which fed into a
    navigable, intrastate lake.  Agencies accordingly must repeal any
    regulation inconsistent with a properly bounded interpretation of
    “waters of the United States.”
6.  *Ohio v. EPA*, 603 U.S. 279 (2024) struck down an EPA plan under the
    Clean Air Act that the EPA had adopted after the scientific and
    policy premises undergirding it had been shown to be wrong. 
    Agencies accordingly must repeal any regulation that does not
    sufficiently account for the costs it imposes, or for which
    foundational assumptions have changed and are no longer defensible.
7.  *Cedar Point Nursery v. Hassid*, 594 U.S. 139 (2021) held that a law
    that forced landowners to admit union organizers onto their property
    violated the Takings Clause. Agencies accordingly must repeal any
    regulation inconsistent with a proper understanding of the Takings
    Clause, which protects far more than just real estate from being
    taken by the government without compensation.
8.  *Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of
    Harvard College*, 600 U.S. 181 (2023) held that “affirmative action”
    admission programs violate the Equal Protection Clause of the
    Fourteenth Amendment.  Agencies accordingly must repeal any
    regulation that imposes racially discriminatory rules or
    preferences.  As the Court said, “\[e\]liminating racial
    discrimination means eliminating all of it.” 
9.  *Carson v. Makin*, 596 U.S. 767 (2022) held that a law excluding
    religious schools from participating in Maine’s school-voucher
    program violated the Free Exercise Clause.  Agencies accordingly
    must review their regulations to ensure equal treatment of religious
    institutions vis-à-vis secular institutions for purposes of funding
    and access to public benefits.
10. *Roman Cath. Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo*, 592 U.S. 14 (2020)
    struck down New York’s Covid-era occupancy restrictions on churches
    and synagogues because they were uniquely harsher than those that
    applied to “essential” businesses—such as acupuncture facilities. 
    Each agency should review its regulations to ensure at least equal
    treatment of religious institutions vis-à-vis secular institutions
    for regulatory purposes. 

**AVOIDING CUMBERSOME AND UNNECESSARY PROCEDURES**:  President Trump’s
memorandum directs agencies to revoke these unlawful regulations
expeditiously, using the Administrative Procedure Act’s (“APA”) “good
cause” exception where appropriate.  Agencies must move quickly to
delete illegal regulations from imposing further burdens on the American
people.
