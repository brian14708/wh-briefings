title: 'Fact Sheet: President Trump Brings Permitting Technology Into the 21st Century
  for Government Efficiency'
---
 
**MODERNIZING PERMITTING TECHNOLOGY:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
issued a memorandum to ensure the Federal government is leveraging
modern technology to effectively and efficiently conduct environmental
reviews and evaluate permits.

-   The Presidential Memorandum directs Federal agencies to make maximum
    use of technology in the environmental review and permitting
    processes for infrastructure projects of all kinds.
-   The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), in consultation with the
    National Energy Dominance Council (NEDC) and relevant permitting
    agencies, will issue a Permitting Technology Action Plan to guide
    agencies as they use technology to digitize permit applications,
    expedite reviews, enhance interagency coordination on projects, and
    give sponsors more transparency and predictability on project
    permitting schedules.
-   CEQ will also establish and lead a Permitting Innovation Center to
    assist Federal agencies as they adopt new software and automate
    application and review processes, including to coordinate agencies
    in this effort.
-   This will also help agencies share information with state and tribal
    officials to make those permitting processes easier for project
    sponsors.

**ELIMINATING UNCERTAINTY:** President Trump recognizes the
environmental review and permitting process has been burdened by a lack
of transparency and outdated technology.

-   The current environmental review and permitting process in the
    United States is inefficient, unpredictable, and counterproductive
    to the growth of the American economy and other infrastructure
    projects that benefit the American people.
-   Projects often involve multiple Federal agencies with overlapping
    statutory requirements, and expanding the use of modern technology
    in the environmental review and permitting process will improve
    coordination and reduce duplicative efforts by both Federal agencies
    and project applicants.
-   The actual time to complete many infrastructure projects, when
    measured from project inception to in-service date, can be a decade
    or more.

**RESTORING AMERICAN PROSPERITY:**  Environmental review and permitting
reform is a top priority for the Trump Administration and this action
will accelerate the process, improve the transparency and predictability
of project timelines, and eliminate unnecessary delays holding back the
growth of the American economy. 

-   As part of his America First agenda, President Trump promised to
    *Make America Affordable and Energy Dominant Again* by streamlining
    environmental reviews and permitting decisions.
-   This memorandum builds on President Trump’s Day One Executive Order
    *Unleashing American Energy*, which includes provisions to expedite
    and simplify the environmental review and permitting process, and
    return our Nation to energy dominance.
    -   In response to the President’s Executive Order, the CEQ
        published an interim final rule to rescind its National
        Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations. Rescinding this
        regulation removes a burdensome layer of bureaucracy, creating a
        clear path for agencies to expeditiously reform their own NEPA
        procedures and allow America to build again.

    <!-- -->

    -   This action to return CEQ to a consulting body, combined with
        the implementation of modern permitting technology, will enable
        better interagency coordination, resulting in the greatest and
        fastest permitting reform ever to take place in the decades-long
        history of NEPA.
