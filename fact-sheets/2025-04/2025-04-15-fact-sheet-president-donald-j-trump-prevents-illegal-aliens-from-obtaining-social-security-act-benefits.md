title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Prevents Illegal Aliens from Obtaining
  Social Security Act Benefits'
---
 
**ENDING BENEFITS FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed a Presidential Memorandum aimed at stopping illegal aliens and
other ineligible people from obtaining Social Security Act benefits.

-   The Memorandum directs the administration to ensure ineligible
    aliens are not receiving funds from Social Security Act programs.
    -   This includes promulgating guidance and prioritizing enforcement
        actions against grantees or subgrantees that do not: verify
        eligibility, stop payments to deceased or ineligible payees, or
        otherwise prevent ineligible aliens from receiving funds.
-   It expands the Social Security Administration’s (SSA’s) fraud
    prosecutor program to at least 50 U.S. Attorney Offices and
    establishes a Medicare and Medicaid fraud-prosecution program in 15
    U.S. Attorney Offices.
-   The Memorandum requires the SSA Inspector General to investigate
    earnings reports for individuals aged 100 or older with mismatched
    SSA records, to combat identity theft.
-   It also directs the SSA to consider whether to reinstate the use of
    civil monetary penalties against individuals who engage in Social
    Security fraud, an effort that has been paused for several years.

**PROTECTING TAXPAYER DOLLARS:** President Trump believes that
taxpayer-funded benefits should be provided only to eligible persons and
must not encourage or reward illegal immigration to the United States.

-   Policing Social Security Act fraud is critical because the Act
    contains not only traditional Social Security provided to older
    Americans, but also unemployment insurance, disability insurance,
    Medicare, Medicaid, TANF, and other programs.
-   The surge in illegal immigration caused by the previous
    Administration is siphoning dollars and essential services from
    American citizens while state and local budgets grow increasingly
    strained.
    -   Biden oversaw a sharp increase in the number of immigrants given
        Social Security Numbers (SSNs), with more than 2 million illegal
        aliens assigned SSNs in fiscal year 2024 alone.
-   The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) calculated
    that American taxpayers spend at least $182 billion annually to
    cover the costs incurred by the presence of 20 million illegal
    aliens and their children, which includes $66.4 billion in Federal
    expenses plus an additional $115.6 billion in state and local
    expenses.
    -   FAIR estimated that nearly a million illegal aliens hold stolen
        identifications or fraudulent SSNs.
    -   Although some illegal aliens do pay taxes, those tax
        contributions come nowhere near covering the costs they impose
        on the populace; FAIR estimates illegal aliens are still a
        $150.7 billion net fiscal burden.
-   The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Biden
    Administration’s open borders agenda, which sought to provide
    Medicaid-funded emergency services to illegal aliens, has cost
    Federal and state taxpayers more than $16.2 billion. Joe Biden also
    tried to make illegal aliens eligible for Obamacare until he was
    stopped in a lawsuit.

**MAKING IT CLEAR THE BORDER IS CLOSED:** President Trump is removing
the monetary incentive for illegal aliens to come to the United States.

-   President Trump promised to take illegal immigrants off Social
    Security.
-   This Memorandum builds on an Executive Order President Trump signed
    in February to ensure taxpayer resources are not used to incentivize
    or support illegal immigration.
-   Already, his administration has stopped more than 1,000 immigrants
    with criminal records or ties to terrorist activity from receiving
    Social Security benefits.
-   The Trump Administration also launched the CBP Home app to give
    illegal aliens the option to self-deport.
