  Wealth Fund'

**DELIVERING A PLAN TO CREATE A UNITED STATES SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUND:**
Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order calling for
the creation of a Sovereign Wealth Fund.

-   The Executive Order directs the Secretary of the Treasury and the
    Secretary of Commerce to deliver a plan within 90 days for the
    creation of a sovereign wealth fund.
    -   The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Commerce will
        work closely with the Director of the Office of Management and
        Budget and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy to
        develop the plan.

    -   The Order directs the Secretary to include in the plan
        recommendations for funding mechanisms, investment strategies,
        fund structure, and a governance model.

**ENSURING LONG-TERM ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS AND FISCAL
SUSTAINABILITY:** The creation of a sovereign wealth fund for the United
States will help maximize the stewardship of our national wealth.

-   Sovereign wealth funds exist around the world as mechanisms to
    amplify the financial return to a nation’s assets and leverage those
    returns for strategic benefit and goals.
    -   The United States can leverage such returns to promote fiscal
        sustainability, lessen the burden of taxes on American families
        and small businesses, establish long-term economic security, and
        promote U.S. economic and strategic leadership internationally.
-   The United States already holds a vast sum of highly valued assets
    that can be invested through a sovereign wealth fund for greater
    long-term wealth generation.
    -   The Federal government directly holds $5.7 trillion in assets.
        Indirectly, including through natural resource reserves, the
        Federal government holds a far larger sum of asset value.

**PURSUING NATIONAL ENDEAVORS AND MAGNIFYING ECONOMIC GROWTH:**
President Trump has called for the creation of a sovereign wealth fund
“to invest in great national endeavors for the benefit of all of the
American people.”

-   President Trump’s economic policies—including the pursuit of fair
    and balanced trade, national energy dominance, and tax and
    regulatory relief to spur robust economic growth—will result in
    greater wealth and revenue streams that a sovereign wealth fund can
    maximize the potential of.
-   Sovereign wealth funds are maintained by a diverse array of
    countries leveraging equally varied classes of national assets.
    President Trump has called for a sovereign wealth fund to ensure the
    United States can lead the way in long-term wealth generation.
    -   The United Kingdom recently announced their own plans to pursue
        development of such a fund.

    <!-- -->

    -   In addition to countries around the world maintaining their own
        funds, 23 states within our own country maintain their own funds
        that control in total $332 billion in assets.
