title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Restores American Competitiveness and
  Security in FCPA Enforcement'
---
 
**ELIMINATING UNDUE BARRIERS TO U.S. SUCCESS:** Today, President Donald
J. Trump signed an Executive Order to restore American competitiveness
and security by ordering revised, reasonable enforcement guidelines for
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) of 1977.

-   The Order directs the Attorney General to pause FCPA actions until
    she issues revised FCPA enforcement guidance that promotes American
    competitiveness and efficient use of federal law enforcement
    resources.
    -   Past and existing FCPA actions will be reviewed.
    -   Future FCPA investigations and enforcement actions will be
        governed by this new guidance and must be approved by the
        Attorney General.

**AMERICAN SECURITY REQUIRES AMERICAN ECONOMIC STRENGTH:** American
national security depends on America and its companies gaining strategic
commercial advantages around the world, and President Trump is stopping
excessive, unpredictable FCPA enforcement that makes American companies
less competitive.

-   U.S. companies are harmed by FCPA overenforcement because they are
    prohibited from engaging in practices common among international
    competitors, creating an uneven playing field.
-   Strategic advantages in critical minerals, deep-water ports, and
    other key infrastructure or assets around the world are critical to
    American national security.
-   FCPA overenforcement infringes upon the President’s Article II
    authority to conduct foreign affairs, necessitating this review and
    new enforcement policies.
-   Over time, FCPA interpretation and enforcement by U.S. prosecutors
    has broadened, imposing a growing cost on our Nation’s economy.
    -   In 2024, the DOJ and SEC filed 26 FCPA-related enforcement
        actions, and at least 31 companies were under investigation by
        year end.

    <!-- -->

    -   Over the past decade, there has been an average of 36
        FCPA-related enforcement actions per year, draining resources
        from both American businesses and law enforcement.

**PUTTING AMERICA FIRST:** President Trump is committed to prioritizing
American economic and security interests and ensuring U.S. businesses
have the tools to succeed globally.

-   Since returning to office, President Trump has signed several
    executive actions aimed at enhancing American economic
    competitiveness, including an Executive Order to strengthen U.S.
    leadership in artificial intelligence (AI) and tariffs on Mexico,
    Canada, and China to protect the American people.   a 10-to-1
    deregulation initiative, ensuring every new rule is justified by
    clear benefits
-   President Trump renegotiated trade deals, including the United
    States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) to secure better terms for
    American workers and businesses.
-   President Trump has worked to cut burdensome regulations that hinder
    U.S. businesses, ensuring they can operate efficiently and
    competitively on the world stage.
-   President Trump: “We have to save our country. Every policy must be
    geared toward that which supports the American worker, the American
    family, and businesses, both large and small, and allows our country
    to compete with other nations on a very level playing field…”
