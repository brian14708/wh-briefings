title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Encourages Foreign Investment While
  Protecting National Security'
---
 
**MAKING AMERICA THE WORLD’S GREATEST DESTINATION FOR INVESTMENT****:**
Today, President Donald J. Trump signed a National Security Presidential
Memorandum (NSPM) aimed at promoting foreign investment while protecting
America’s national security interests, particularly from threats posed
by foreign adversaries like the People’s Republic of China.

-   The NSPM establishes that welcoming foreign investment is crucial
    for economic growth, job creation, and innovation, ensuring that the
    United States leverages its world-leading financial markets to
    support American jobs and innovators.
-   The United States will create a “fast-track” process to facilitate
    greater investment from specified allies and partners, with
    conditions that prevent investors from partnering with our foreign
    adversaries in corresponding areas. The United States will also
    expedite environmental reviews for any investment over $1 billion.
-   The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS)
    will be used to restrict Chinese investments in strategic U.S.
    sectors like technology, critical infrastructure, healthcare,
    agriculture, energy, raw materials, and others.
-   The United States will protect our farmland and real estate near
    sensitive facilities, strengthen CFIUS authority over “greenfield”
    investments, and restrict foreign adversary access to U.S. talent
    and operations in sensitive technologies.
-   Rather than use overly bureaucratic, complex, and open-ended
    “mitigation” agreements for U.S. investments from foreign
    adversaries, more administrative resources will be directed toward
    facilitating investments from key partner countries.
-   The United States will establish new rules to curb the exploitation
    of its capital, technology, and knowledge by foreign adversaries
    such as China to ensure that only those investments that serve
    American interests are allowed.
-   The Trump Administration will consider new or expanded restrictions
    on U.S. outbound investment to China in sensitive technologies,
    including semiconductors, artificial intelligence, quantum,
    biotechnology, aerospace, and more, to stop American funds from
    supporting China’s Military-Civil Fusion (MCF) strategy.
-   The United States will continue to encourage passive investments
    from all foreign persons – this will allow our cutting-edge
    businesses to continue to benefit from foreign capital while
    safeguarding our national security.
-   The Trump Administration will protect U.S. investors’ savings and
    boost American prosperity by auditing foreign companies on U.S.
    exchanges, reviewing their ownership structures and any alleged
    fraud, and ensuring foreign adversary companies are ineligible for
    pension plan contributions.

**ENSURING AMERICA’S PROSPERITY AND SECURITY:** President Trump is
committed to making the United States a premier destination for
investment while balancing national security interests.

-   The United States is the leading innovator of next-generation
    technologies, and this action makes it easier for our friends to
    support U.S. innovators and economic growth.
-   Certain foreign countries, including China, systematically direct
    investment in American companies to gain access to cutting-edge
    technology, intellectual property, and leverage in strategic
    industries, which must be countered.
    -   Foreign entities and individuals hold roughly 43 million acres
        of U.S. agricultural land, which is nearly 2% of all land in the
        U.S.

    <!-- -->

    -   China owns more than 350,000 acres of farmland across 27 states.
-   China is exploiting our capital and ingenuity to fund and modernize
    their military, intelligence, and security operations, posing direct
    threats to United States security with weapons of mass destruction,
    cyber warfare, and more.
-   Chinese hackers have repeatedly targeted U.S. entities, including
    recently breaching the Treasury Department’s CFIUS office, the
    entity responsible for reviewing foreign investments for national
    security risks.

**SAFEGUARDING AMERICAN INNOVATION:** President Trump is keeping his
promise to prevent foreign adversaries from taking advantage of the
United States.

-   President Trump: “We will also adopt new rules to stop U.S.
    companies from pouring investments into China, and to stop China
    from buying up America, allowing all of those investments that
    clearly serve American interests.”
    -   President Trump also promised to “stop Chinese-owned” firms from
        “stealing our intellectual property, our workers’ knowledge and
        then sending it back to Communist China. We’re not going to let
        that happen.”

    <!-- -->

    -   President Trump: “We have powers that haven’t really been used
        in terms of environmental. If you invest over $1 billion in the
        United States, we’re going to give expedited reviews.”
-   This NSPM builds on numerous actions President Trump took in his
    first term to protect American innovation, including:
    -   Initiating a Section 301 investigation into China’s practices
        related to forced technology transfer, unfair licensing, and
        intellectual property policies.

    <!-- -->

    -   Announcing a Department of Justice China Initiative to identify
        and prosecute trade secrets theft, hacking, and economic
        espionage – a program which the Biden Administration ended.

    <!-- -->

    -   Prioritizing research and development of America’s artificial
        intelligence capabilities.

    <!-- -->

    -   Taking action to prevent foreign malign actors from gaining
        access to United States information networks.
