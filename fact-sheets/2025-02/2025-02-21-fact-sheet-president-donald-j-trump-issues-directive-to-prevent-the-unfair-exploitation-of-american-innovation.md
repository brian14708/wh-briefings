title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Issues Directive to Prevent the Unfair
  Exploitation of American Innovation'
---
 
**SAFEGUARDING AMERICA’S SOVEREIGNTY OVER ITS ECONOMY:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed a memorandum to defend American
companies and innovators from overseas extortion.

-   This Administration will consider responsive actions like tariffs to
    combat the digital service taxes (DSTs), fines, practices, and
    policies that foreign governments levy on American companies.
    -   DSTs allow foreign governments to collect tax revenue from
        American companies simply because they operate in foreign
        markets, even though those companies are generally not otherwise
        subject to foreign jurisdiction.
-   President Trump will not allow foreign governments to appropriate
    America’s tax base for their own benefit.
-   This memorandum directs the United States Trade Representative
    (USTR) to renew the DST investigations under Section 301 that were
    initiated during President Trump’s first term, and investigate any
    additional countries that use a DST to discriminate against U.S.
    companies. 
-   The Administration will review whether any act, policy, or practice
    in the European Union or United Kingdom incentivizes U.S. companies
    to develop or use products and technology in ways that undermine
    free speech or foster censorship.
-   Foreign governments will invite responsive actions from the
    Administration if they take steps to coerce U.S. businesses to hand
    over their intellectual property.
-   Regulations that dictate how American companies interact with
    consumers in the European Union, like the Digital Markets Act and
    the Digital Services Act, will face scrutiny from the
    Administration.

**DEFENDING AMERICAN COMPANIES FROM EXTORTION**: President Trump’s
memorandum unveils a comprehensive approach to ensuring that U.S.
products and services are governed by the United States of America, not
foreign governments.

-   Rather than position their own companies and workers for success,
    foreign governments have been taxing the success of America’s
    companies and workers.
    -   America’s economy will not be a source of revenue for countries
        that have failed to cultivate economic success of their own.  
-   To the detriment of America’s economy, in recent years, a number of
    our trading partners began enacting DSTs to raise revenue for their
    own government spending.
    -   Foreign governments could collect billions in DSTs from U.S.
        companies annually.

-   This exploitation goes beyond DSTs to other forms of unfair fines,
    practices, and penalties that undermine the ability of American
    companies to operate as intended and force them to incur additional
    compliance costs, lowering U.S. global economic competitiveness.

<!-- -->

-   In terms of GDP, the United States digital economy has been larger
    than most countries’ entire economy in recent years, including
    Australia, Canada, and most members of the European Union.

<!-- -->

-   America’s digital economic dominance is driven by cutting-edge
    American tech companies, and the American innovation and workers
    behind them.

**RESTORING THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT OF AMERICA:** President Donald J.
Trump has a track record of protecting American manufacturers and
empowering American innovators and workers.

-   During his first administration, President Trump initiated Section
    301 cases against DSTs and negotiated platinum-standard rules for
    digital trade with Japan and separately through the USMCA.  

<!-- -->

-   President Trump demonstrated in his first term that punitive
    measures like tariffs strengthened the U.S. economy and brought back
    American industry.
-   Just last week, President Trump announced the “Fair and Reciprocal
    Plan” on trade to restore fairness in U.S. trade relationships and
    counter non-reciprocal trade agreements.    
-   On Day One, President Trump initiated his America First Trade Policy
    to make America’s economy great again.
