title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Imposes Tariffs on Imports from Canada,
  Mexico and China'
---
 
**ADDRESSING AN EMERGENCY SITUATION**: The extraordinary threat posed by
illegal aliens and drugs, including deadly fentanyl, constitutes a
national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act
(IEEPA).

-   Until the crisis is alleviated, President Donald J. Trump is
    implementing a 25% additional tariff on imports from Canada and
    Mexico and a 10% additional tariff on imports from China.  Energy
    resources from Canada will have a lower 10% tariff.
-   President Trump is taking bold action to hold Mexico, Canada, and
    China accountable to their promises of halting illegal immigration
    and stopping poisonous fentanyl and other drugs from flowing into
    our country.
-   The orders make clear that the flow of contraband drugs like
    fentanyl to the United States, through illicit distribution
    networks, has created a national emergency, including a public
    health crisis. Chinese officials have failed to take the actions
    necessary to stem the flow of precursor chemicals to known criminal
    cartels and shut down money laundering by transnational criminal
    organizations.
    -   In addition, the Mexican drug trafficking organizations have an
        intolerable alliance with the government of Mexico. The
        government of Mexico has afforded safe havens for the cartels to
        engage in the manufacturing and transportation of dangerous
        narcotics, which collectively have led to the overdose deaths of
        hundreds of thousands of American victims. This alliance
        endangers the national security of the United States, and we
        must eradicate the influence of these dangerous cartels.

    -   There is also a growing presence of Mexican cartels operating
        fentanyl and nitazene synthesis labs in Canada.  A recent study
        recognized Canada’s heightened domestic production of fentanyl,
        and its growing footprint within international narcotics
        distribution

**USING OUR LEVERAGE TO ENSURE AMERICANS’ SAFETY**: Previous
Administrations failed to fully leverage America’s economic position as
a tool to secure our borders against illegal migration and combat the
scourge of fentanyl, preferring to let problems fester.

-   Access to the American market is a privilege. The United States has
    one of the most open economies in the world, and the lowest average
    tariff rates in the world.
-   While trade accounts for 67% of Canada’s GDP, 73% of Mexico’s GDP,
    and 37% of China’s GDP, it accounts for only 24% of U.S. GDP.
    However, in 2023 the U.S. trade deficit in goods was the world’s
    largest at over $1 trillion.
-   Tariffs are a powerful, proven source of leverage for protecting the
    national interest.  President Trump is using the tools at hand and
    taking decisive action that puts Americans’ safety and our national
    security first.
-   Though previous Administrations have failed to leverage America’s
    combination of exceptional strength and its unique role in world
    trade to advance the security interests of the American people,
    President Trump has not.

**PRESIDENT TRUMP IS KEEPING HIS PROMISE TO STOP THE FLOOD OF ILLEGAL
ALIENS AND DRUGS:** When voters overwhelmingly elected Donald J. Trump
as President, they gave him a mandate to seal the border. That is
exactly what he is doing.

-   The Biden Administration’s policies have fueled the worst border
    crisis in U.S. history.

<!-- -->

-   More than 10 million illegal aliens attempted to enter the United
    States under Biden’s leadership, including a rising number of
    Chinese nationals and people on the terror watchlist.
-   This problem is not confined to the southern border – encounters at
    the northern border with Canada are rising as well.
-   The sustained influx of illegal aliens has profound consequences on
    every aspect of our national life – overwhelming our schools,
    lowering our wages, reducing our housing supply and raising rents,
    overcrowding our hospitals, draining our welfare system, and causing
    crime.  
-   Gang members, smugglers, human traffickers, and illegal drugs and
    narcotics of all kinds are pouring across our borders and into our
    communities.
    -   Last fiscal year, Customs and Border Protection (CBP)
        apprehended more than 21,000 pounds of fentanyl at our borders,
        enough fentanyl to kill more than 4 billion people.
    -   It is estimated that federal officials are only able to seize a
        fraction of the fentanyl smuggled across the southern border.  
-   These drugs kill tens of thousands of Americans each year, including
    75,000 deaths per year attributed to fentanyl alone.
    -   More Americans are dying from fentanyl overdoses each year than
        the number of American lives lost in the entirety of the Vietnam
        War.

**BUILDING ON PAST SUCCESS**: President Trump continues to demonstrate
his commitment to ensuring U.S. trade policy serves the national
interest.

-   As President Trump said in the Presidential Memorandum on American
    First Trade Policy, trade policy is a critical component in national
    security.
-   President Trump promised in November to “sign all necessary
    documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products
    coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders. This
    Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular
    Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!”
-   During his first term as President of the United States, President
    Trump established the President’s Commission on Combating Drug
    Addiction and the Opioid Crisis and declared the Opioid Crisis a
    public health emergency.
-   President Trump also has a long record of putting America first on
    trade. In his first term, President Trump successfully used threats
    of tariffs on Mexico to help secure our border.
-   When our national security was threatened by a global oversupply of
    steel and aluminum, President Trump took swift action to protect
    America’s national security by implementing tariffs on imports of
    these goods.
-   In response to China’s intellectual property theft, forced
    technology transfer, and other unreasonable behavior, President
    Trump acted with conviction to impose tariffs on imports from China,
    using that leverage to reach a historic bilateral economic
    agreement.
-   Just last week, President Trump leveraged tariffs to successfully
    resolve national security concerns with Colombia, swiftly reaching
    an outcome that prioritizes the safety and security of the American
    people and the sanctity of our national borders.
