title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Prohibits Federal Funding for COVID-19
  Vaccine Mandates in Schools'
---
 
**PROHIBITING COVID-19 VACCINE MANDATES IN SCHOOLS**: Today, President
Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to prohibit federal funding
for COVID-19 vaccine mandates in schools.

-   The Order bars federal funds from being used to support or subsidize
    an educational service agency, state education agency, local
    education agency, elementary school, secondary school, or
    institution of higher education that requires students to have
    received a COVID-19 vaccination to attend in-person education
    programs.
-   The Secretary of Education and the Secretary of Health and Human
    Services must issue guidelines for compliance and provide a plan to
    end coercive COVID-19 vaccine mandates, including a report on
    non-compliant entities and a process for preventing federal funds
    from supporting educational entities that impose COVID-19 vaccine
    mandates.

**PUTTING AN END TO GOVERNMENT OVERREACH**: President Trump is committed
to protecting personal freedoms and ensuring that Americans’ education
isn’t conditioned on unnecessary government mandates.

-   Some schools and universities have recently enforced or continue to
    enforce COVID-19 vaccine mandates, making access to education
    contingent upon students’ COVID-19 vaccination status.
-   These mandates pressure students into making COVID-19 vaccine
    decisions based on government coercion, rather than on their own
    informed choices.
-   Studies consistently show that children and young adults have an
    incredibly low risk of developing a severe illness from COVID-19.
-   With COVID-19 vaccine mandates threatening educational opportunities
    for students, parents are being forced into a difficult position:
    comply with a controversial mandate or risk their child’s
    educational future.

**PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT**: President Trump is dedicated to
ensuring that American students are not forced to choose between their
education and their medical freedom.

-   President Trump is fulfilling his campaign promise: “I will not
    allow schools to impose COVID vaccine mandates…”
-   In President Trump’s first week in office, he reinstated service
    members who were dismissed for refusing the COVID vaccine, with full
    back pay and benefits.
-   President Trump is as a staunch advocate for parental rights,
    ensuring families have the primary role in shaping their children’s
    educational journey, free from undue bureaucratic mandates.
