title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Establishes the National Energy Dominance
  Council'
---
 
**POSITIONING AMERICAN ENERGY FOR THE NEXT CENTURY**: Today, President
Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order establishing the National
Energy Dominance Council.

-   The National Energy Dominance Council will be established within the
    Executive Office of the President, chaired by the Secretary of the
    Interior Doug Burgum and vice-chaired by the Secretary of Energy
    Chris Wright, and comprised of members of President Trump’s cabinet
    and key government agencies.
-   The Council will advise President Trump on strategies to achieve
    energy dominance by improving the processes for permitting,
    production, generation, distribution, regulation, and transportation
    across all forms of American energy.
-   It will recommend a National Energy Dominance Strategy to the
    President aimed at cutting red tape, enhancing private sector
    investments, and advancing innovation.
-   The Council will facilitate cooperation between the federal
    government and domestic energy partners, ensuring policy
    consistency.
-   It will also consult with various public and private sector
    stakeholders to expand energy production and address cost barriers.

**LOWERING PRICES AND STRENGTHENING AMERICAN ECONOMIC SECURITY**:
Championing domestic energy production is vital both for mitigating
price shocks to American families and de-risking the energy supply chain
for our Nation as well as our allies.

-   American energy dominance is the most reliable way to ensure the
    stability and affordability of American energy prices.
    -   Gasoline prices, as well as overall household energy prices,
        increased 30% under President Biden.

    -   The Biden-Harris Administration dramatically slowed the growth
        rate of American energy production and development, including by
        instituting a federal oil leasing moratorium, increasing energy
        permitting times by multiples of what they had been under
        President Trump, and removing hundreds of million acres from
        being available for energy production.

    <!-- -->

    -   Over the last four years, it is estimated that our Nation
        produced over two billion fewer barrels of oil than anticipated
        by trend (had President Trump’s energy policies been kept
        intact), a vast quantity of lost supply that could have lessened
        the burden of energy prices on American families.
-   Developing American energy resources will enable our Nation to
    reduce its reliance on foreign entities, including strategic
    adversaries.
    -   While creating policies to restrict American production, the
        Biden Administration asked OPEC+ to increase production to meet
        American energy demand.

    <!-- -->

    -   As energy prices rose, the Biden Administration was reluctant to
        enforce American oil sanctions on rogue regimes, allowing Iran
        to export over one million barrels of oil per day through lax
        enforcement (up from a low of approximately 70,000 under the
        Trump administration) and temporarily lifting oil sanctions
        altogether on the Maduro regime in Venezuela.

    <!-- -->

    -   The United States is also highly dependent on China for a range
        of critical minerals, which has put our Nation’s supply chain at
        risk, as exemplified by China’s recent weaponization of its
        resources through bans on exporting germanium, gallium, and
        antimony to the United States.

    <!-- -->

    -   As our Nation makes rapid advancements in next generation
        technologies, such as artificial intelligence (along with the
        associated data centers), and energy demand rises, it will be
        all the more important to expand domestic energy supply.
-   American energy leadership is vital not only for our Nation’s
    economic and national security, but also for the security of our
    allies.
    -   America’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry has played a
        critical role in helping Europe reduce its dependence on Russian
        energy, with LNG exports to Europe rising 141% in 2022, and
        continuing to increase to fill the gap.

    <!-- -->

    -   President Trump warned Western Europe as early as 2017 to rely
        on American natural gas rather than Russian energy.

**RESTORING AMERICAN ENERGY DOMINANCE**: President Trump has a
demonstrated track record of empowering American energy production, and
will return our Nation to energy dominance.

-   During President Trump’s first term, our Nation became a net
    exporter of energy for the first time in nearly 70 years and
    transformed into the world’s leading oil producer.
-   President Trump expedited the LNG export license process (achieving
    licensing times one-sixth as long as those seen during the Biden
    Administration, which revoked these reforms), reduced the permitting
    time for drilling on federal lands (increasing permit applications
    by 300%), fixed the New Source Review (which punished companies for
    repairing and upgrading coal power plants), and opened up millions
    of acres for domestic energy development.
-   Under President Trump’s leadership, American families saved an
    average of $2,500 per year in utility and gas costs, while the
    economy at large saw the creation of new American energy jobs.
