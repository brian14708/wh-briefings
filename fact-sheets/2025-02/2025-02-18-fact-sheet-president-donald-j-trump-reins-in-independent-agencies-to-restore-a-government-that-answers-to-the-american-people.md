title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Reins in Independent Agencies to Restore
  a Government that Answers to the American People'

**RESTORING DEMOCRACY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN GOVERNMENT:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order ensuring that all
federal agencies are accountable to the American people, as required by
the Constitution. Under this Executive Order:

-   The Order notes that Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests all
    executive power in the President, meaning that *all* executive
    branch officials and employees are subject to his supervision.
-   Therefore, because all executive power is vested in the President,
    all agencies must: (1) submit draft regulations for White House
    review—with no carve-out for so-called independent agencies, except
    for the monetary policy functions of the Federal Reserve; and (2)
    consult with the White House on their priorities and strategic
    plans, and the White House will set their performance standards.
-   The Office of Management and Budget will adjust so-called
    independent agencies’ apportionments to ensure tax dollars are spent
    wisely.
-   The President and the Attorney General (subject to the President’s
    supervision and control) will interpret the law for the executive
    branch, instead of having separate agencies adopt conflicting
    interpretations.

**REINING IN INDEPENDENT AGENCIES:** So-called independent agencies like
the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Federal Communications Commission
(FCC), and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have exercised
enormous power over the American people without Presidential oversight.

-   These agencies issue rules and regulations that cost billions of
    dollars and implicate some of the most controversial policy matters,
    and they do so without the review of the democratically elected
    President.
-   They also spend American tax dollars and set priorities without
    consulting the President, while setting their own performance
    standards.
-   Now they will no longer impose rules on the American people without
    oversight or accountability.

**ENSURING A GOVERNMENT THAT ANSWERS TO THE PEOPLE:** This order
fulfills President Trump’s promise to restore constitutional governance
and accountability to the entire executive branch.

-   Executive power without responsibility has no place in our Republic.
    The United States was founded on the principle that the government
    should be accountable to the people. That is why the Founders
    created a single President who is alone vested with “the executive
    Power” and responsibility to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully
    executed.”
-   Voters and the President can now hold all Federal agencies—not just
    Cabinet departments—responsible for their decisions, as the
    Constitution demands.
