---
 
**ESTABLISHING A FAITH OFFICE:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed
an Executive Order to establish the White House Faith Office.

-   The White House Faith Office will empower faith-based entities,
    community organizations, and houses of worship to better serve
    families and communities.
-   The Office will be housed in the Domestic Policy Council and will
    consult with experts within the faith community and make
    recommendations to the President regarding changes to policies,
    programs, and practices to better align with the American values.
-   The Office will coordinate with agencies on religious liberty
    training and on identifying and promoting grant opportunities for
    non-profit faith-based entities, community organizations, and houses
    of worship.  
-   The Office will work in collaboration with the Attorney General to
    identify failures to enforce constitutional and Federal statutory
    protections for religious liberty.

**DEFENDING RELIGIOUS LIBERTY:** President Trump is committed to
protecting the liberty and freedom of our religious communities,
organizations, and students.

-   In his first week, President Trump pardoned Christians and pro-life
    activists who were persecuted by the weaponized Biden Administration
    for praying and peacefully living out their faith.
-   President Trump reinstated service members forced out of the
    military over the COVID-19 vaccine mandate, including those
    discharged over their religious objections to the vaccine.
-   Last week, President Trump signed executive actions to ensure
    Federal overreach and taxpayer dollars will no longer force
    individuals to violate their commitment to life.
-   Yesterday, President Trump signed an Executive Order establishing a
    task force to eradicate anti-Christian bias.

**PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT:** These actions build on President
Trump’s longstanding commitment to safeguarding the fundamental right to
religious freedom, as evidenced by his first term.

-   In 2017, President Trump stopped the Johnson Amendment from
    interfering with pastors’ rights to speak their minds.
-   In 2018, President Trump established the Faith and Opportunity
    Initiative which recognized and promoted the essential contributions
    of faith-based organizations.
-   In 2018, President Trump reversed the Obama-era policy that
    prevented the government from providing disaster relief to religious
    organizations.
-   In 2019, President Trump hosted a Global Call to Protect Religious
    Freedom event at the United Nations and called on the international
    community and business leaders to work to protect religious freedom
    around the world.
-   In 2020, President Trump issued new guidance to protect religious
    liberty and expression in public schools.
