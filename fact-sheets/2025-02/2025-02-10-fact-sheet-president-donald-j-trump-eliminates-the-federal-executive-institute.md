title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Eliminates the Federal Executive Institute'
---
 
**ELIMINATING INEFFICIENCY AND BUREAUCRACY:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed an Executive Order to eliminate the Federal Executive
Institute, a government program purportedly designed to provide
bureaucratic leadership training.

-   The Order directs the Office of Personnel Management to take all
    necessary steps to terminate the Federal Executive Institute and
    revokes the appropriate documents.

**ENSURING EVERY TAX DOLLAR WORKS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE:** President
Trump is committed to ensuring that government serves the American
people, rather than itself, which requires a complete shift in
government leadership toward reducing waste and promoting efficient
service to taxpayers.

-   The Federal Executive Institute was created by the Johnson
    Administration more than 50 years ago to provide leadership training
    to government bureaucrats.
-   Bureaucratic leadership over the past half-century has enlarged and
    entrenched Washington, D.C.’s managerial class, a bloated system far
    removed from the needs of American families. New leadership is
    needed.
-   The Federal Executive Institute includes a resort property in
    Charlottesville, VA, that was formerly a luxury hotel, which is used
    for bureaucracy training courses.

**DISMANTLING GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY:** Eliminating the Federal
Executive Institute is part of President Trump’s broader mission to
reform the federal bureaucracy, including by ending ineffective
government programs that drain resources and empower government without
achieving measurable results.

-   The government wastes billions of dollars each year on duplicative
    programs and frivolous expenditures that fail to align with American
    values or address the needs of the American people.
-   President Trump temporarily paused foreign aid to many
    non-governmental organizations, international organizations, and
    contractors to ensure every dollar of U.S. foreign assistance
    supports American values.
-   President Trump established the “Department of Government
    Efficiency” to examine how to streamline the Federal government,
    eliminate unnecessary programs, and reduce bureaucratic
    inefficiency.
-   President Trump launched a 10-to-1 deregulation initiative, ensuring
    every new rule is justified by clear benefits
