title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Addresses the Threat to National Security
  from Imports of Copper'
---
 
**SECURING AMERICA’S COPPER SUPPLY:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order launching an investigation into how copper
imports threaten America’s national security and economic stability.

-   The Order directs the Secretary of Commerce to initiate a Section
    232 investigation under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.
-   This investigation will assess the national security risks arising
    from the United States’ increasing dependence on imported copper, in
    all its forms, and the potential need for trade remedies to
    safeguard domestic industry.
-   The investigation will culminate in a report identifying
    vulnerabilities in the copper supply chain and providing
    recommendations to enhance the resilience of America’s domestic
    copper industry.

   
**ADDRESSING THE THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY:** President Trump
recognizes that an overreliance on foreign copper, in all its forms,
could jeopardize U.S. defense capabilities, infrastructure development,
and technological innovation.

-   Copper is an essential material for national security, economic
    strength, and industrial resilience.
    -   Copper plays a vital role in defense applications,
        infrastructure, and emerging technologies like clean energy,
        electric vehicles, and advanced electronics.
    -   Copper is the Defense Department’s second-most utilized
        material.
-   Despite possessing ample copper reserves, America’s smelting and
    refining capacity lags behind global competitors like China, which
    controls over 50% of global smelting.
    -   The United States isn’t even in the top five nations in copper
        smelting capacity.
-   America’s reliance on copper imports has surged from virtually 0% in
    1991 to 45% of consumption in 2024, heightening risks to supply
    chain security.
-   Foreign overcapacity in smelting and refining, coupled with
    potential export restrictions from other nations, threaten to
    disrupt copper availability for U.S. defense and industry needs.

   
**STRENGTHENING AMERICAN INDUSTRY:** This Executive Order builds on
previous actions taken by the Trump Administration to ensure U.S. trade
policy serves the nation’s long-term interests.

-   On Day One, President Trump initiated his America First Trade Policy
    to make America’s economy great again.
-   President Trump signed proclamations to close existing loopholes and
    exemptions to restore a true 25% tariff on steel and elevate the
    tariff to 25% on aluminum.
-   President Trump implemented a 10% additional tariff on imports from
    China in response to China’s role in the border crisis.  
-   President Trump unveiled the “Fair and Reciprocal Plan” on trade to
    restore fairness in U.S. trade relationships and counter
    non-reciprocal trade agreements.   

President Trump signed a memorandum to safeguard American innovation,
including the consideration of tariffs to combat digital service taxes
(DSTs), fines, practices, and policies that foreign governments levy on
American companies.
