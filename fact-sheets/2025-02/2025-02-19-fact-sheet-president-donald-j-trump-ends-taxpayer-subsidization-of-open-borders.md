  Borders'

**PRESERVING FEDERAL BENEFITS FOR AMERICAN CITIZENS:** Today, President
Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to ensure taxpayer resources
are not used to incentivize or support illegal immigration.

-   The Order directs Federal departments and agencies to identify all
    federally funded programs currently providing financial benefits to
    illegal aliens and take corrective action.
-   It ensures that Federal funds to states and localities will not be
    used to support “sanctuary” policies or assist illegal immigration.
-   It mandates improvements in eligibility verification to prevent
    benefits from going to individuals unlawfully present in the United
    States.
-   President Trump is committed to safeguarding Federal public benefits
    for American citizens who are truly in need, including individuals
    with disabilities and veterans.

**TAXPAYERS ARE FOOTING THE BILL FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION:** With this
Executive Order, President Trump is ensuring taxpayer resources are used
to protect the interests of American citizens, not illegal aliens.

-   The surge in illegal immigration, enabled by the previous
    Administration, is siphoning dollars and essential services from
    American citizens while state and local budgets grow increasingly
    strained.
-   Under current welfare laws, specifically the Personal Responsibility
    and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), illegal
    aliens are generally barred from welfare programs. But if they’re
    granted parole, they are classified as “qualified aliens” and become
    eligible for various welfare programs on a sliding scale, with full
    eligibility granted within five years.
-   According to the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), providing
    welfare to one million illegal aliens could cost American taxpayers
    an additional $3 billion annually.
-   The U.S. House Homeland Security Committee estimated that taxpayers
    could pay as much as $451 billion to care for illegal aliens and
    gotaways that have entered the United States unlawfully since
    January 2021.
-   The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) calculated
    that American taxpayers spend at least $182 billion annually to
    cover the costs incurred by the presence of 20 million illegal
    aliens and their children, which includes $66.5 billion in Federal
    expenses plus an additional $115.6 billion in state and local
    expenses.
-   The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the Biden
    Administration’s open borders agenda, which sought to provide
    Medicaid-funded emergency services to illegal aliens, has cost
    Federal and state taxpayers more than $16.2 billion.
-   The Biden Administration gave billions in taxpayer dollars to
    left-wing groups that facilitated mass illegal migration and
    provided legal services to challenge deportation orders.
-   In addition, since 2021, more than $1 billion has been allocated
    through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to illegal
    aliens.

**SECURING THE BORDER AND PUTTING AMERICANS FIRST:** President Trump has
delivered on his promise to secure the border and prioritize the needs
of American citizens, taking immediate action to put an end to the
previous Administration’s border crisis. Since taking office, President
Trump has:

-   Declared a national emergency at the southern border.
-   Deployed additional personnel to the border, including members of
    the Armed Forces and the National Guard.
-   Restarted border wall construction.
-   Designated international cartels and other criminal organizations –
    such as MS-13 and Tren de Aragua – as Foreign Terrorist
    Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists.
-   Suspended the entry of aliens into the U.S.
-   Called for enhanced vetting and screening of aliens.
-   Required the identification of countries that warrant a partial or
    full suspension on the admission of nationals.
-   Restarted the detention and removal of aliens who are in violation
    of Federal law.
-   Directed the Administration to resume the Migrant Protection
    Protocols – also known as “Remain in Mexico” – as soon as
    practicable.
-   Ended the use of the CBP One app.
-   Terminated all categorical parole programs, such as the “Processes
    for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans,” that are
    contrary to President Trump’s immigration agenda.
-   Ended automatic citizenship for children of illegal aliens.
-   Paused the operation of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP).
-   Ended catch-and-release policies.
-   Revoked Biden’s disastrous executive actions that essentially opened
    our southern border.
-   Detained the most dangerous illegal criminal aliens in Guantanamo
    Bay.
