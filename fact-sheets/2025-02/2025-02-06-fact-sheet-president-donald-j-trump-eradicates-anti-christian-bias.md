title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Eradicates Anti-Christian Bias'
---
 
**ERADICATING ANTI-CHRISTIAN BIAS:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order establishing a task force to end the
anti-Christian weaponization of government and unlawful conduct
targeting Christians.

-   The task force, officially known as the Task Force to Eradicate
    Anti-Christian Bias, will be comprised of members of President
    Trump’s cabinet and key government agencies.
-   The task force will review the activities of all departments and
    agencies to identify and eliminate anti-Christian policies,
    practices, or conduct.
-   The task force will gather input from various stakeholders to ensure
    broad perspectives are considered, including faith-based
    organizations, State, local, and Tribal governments, and Americans
    affected by anti-Christian conduct.
-   It will identify and address gaps in laws and enforcement that have
    contributed to anti-Christian conduct, including by remedying any
    failures to fully enforce the law against acts of anti-Christian
    hostility, vandalism, and violence.
-   The task force will recommend further presidential or legislative
    actions necessary to rectify past wrongs and protect Americans’
    religious liberties.
-   The task force will submit an annual report on its progress, with a
    final report upon its conclusion.

**PROTECTING AMERICANS’ RELIGIOUS FREEDOM:** The previous Administration
engaged in an egregious pattern of targeting peaceful Christians while
ignoring violent, anti-Christian offenses. President Trump will not
tolerate this abuse of government and is taking action to ensure that
any unlawful and improper anti-Christian conduct, policies or practices
are identified, terminated, and rectified.

-   The United States Constitution enshrines the fundamental right to
    religious liberty in the First Amendment.
-   The Biden Department of Justice brought felony charges and obtained
    multi-year prison sentences against nearly two dozen pro-life
    Christians for praying and peacefully demonstrating outside abortion
    facilities.
-   The Biden Department of Justice ignored hundreds of attacks on
    Catholic churches, charities, and pro-life centers.
-   In 2023, a Federal Bureau of Investigation memo asserted that
    traditional Catholics were domestic-terrorism threats and suggested
    infiltrating Catholic churches as “threat mitigation.” 
-   The Biden Department of Education sought to repeal religious-liberty
    protections for faith-based organizations on college campuses. 
-   The Biden Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sought to force
    Christians to affirm radical transgender ideology against their
    faith.
-   The Biden Department of Health and Human Services sought to drive
    Christians out of the foster-care system. 
-   In 2024, the Biden Administration declared Easter Sunday as
    “Transgender Day of Visibility.”

**STANDING UP FOR RELIGIOUS LIBERTY:** President Donald J. Trump is
committed to protecting Americans’ fundamental right to religious
freedom.

-   On his fourth day in office, President Trump pardoned the Christians
    and pro-life activists who were persecuted by the Biden
    Administration for praying and peacefully living out their faith.
-   Last week, President Trump signed an Executive Order to combat
    anti-Semitism on our campuses and in our streets.
-   President Trump: “I will create a new federal task force on fighting
    anti-Christian bias. That’ll be done immediately.”
-   This Executive Order also builds on the long list of accomplishments
    from the first Trump Administration:
    -   During his first year in office, President Trump signed an
        Executive Order upholding religious liberty and the right to
        engage in religious speech.
