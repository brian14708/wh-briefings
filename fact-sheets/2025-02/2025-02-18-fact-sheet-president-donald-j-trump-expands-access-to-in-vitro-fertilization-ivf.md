title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Expands Access to In Vitro Fertilization
  (IVF)'
---
 
**LOWERING COSTS AND REDUCING BARRIERS TO IVF:** Today, President Donald
J. Trump signed an Executive Order expanding access to in vitro
fertilization (IVF) for Americans.

-   The Order directs policy recommendations to protect IVF access and
    aggressively reduce out-of-pocket and health plan costs for such
    treatments.   
    -   The recommendations will focus on how to ensure reliable access
        to IVF.

    <!-- -->

    -   Priority will also be placed on addressing any current policies,
        including those that require legislation, that exacerbate the
        cost of IVF treatments.
-   The Order recognizes the importance of family formation and that our
    Nation’s public policy must make it easier for loving and longing
    mothers and fathers to have children. 

**SUPPORTING AMERICAN FAMILIES:** As many as one in seven couples trying
to have a baby are unable to conceive, and many face significant
financial hurdles to accessing IVF. 

-   Avenues to more affordable IVF treatments are needed.
    -   The cost can range from $12,000 to $25,000 per cycle and
        multiple cycles may be needed to get pregnant.  

    <!-- -->

    -   IVF is often not fully covered by health insurance.
        -   Only a quarter of employers report coverage of IVF for their
            employees.

        <!-- -->

        -   Just a handful of states require some sort of coverage for
            IVF in state-regulated insurance plans.

        <!-- -->

        -   The federal government covers IVF in a limited capacity for
            military personnel, veterans, and federal employees. 
-   Department of Health and Human Services data reports that more than
    85,000 infants were born as a result of IVF in 2021.
-   The general U.S. fertility rate is at another historic low.
    -   The rate dropped 3% in 2023 from 2022. From 2014-2020, the rate
        consistently decreased by 2% annually.

**DELIVERING ON PROMISES FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES:** President Trump
promised to advance IVF and help American families with the associated
costs so American families can have more babies, building on his record
of supporting family formation and stability.  

-   In his first Administration, President Trump doubled the child tax
    credit and expanded the eligibility of receiving the credit.
-   He also signed into law a provision that enables new parents to
    withdraw up to $5,000 from their retirement accounts without penalty
    when they give birth to or adopt a child.
-   President Trump has long advocated for more babies and expanding
    American families: “Because we want more babies, to put it very
    nicely. And for this same reason, we will also allow new parents to
    deduct major newborn expenses from their taxes, so that parents that
    have a beautiful baby will be able, so we’re pro family. But the IVF
    treatments are expensive. It’s very hard for many people to do it
    and to get it, but I’ve been in favor of IVF, right from the
    beginning.”
