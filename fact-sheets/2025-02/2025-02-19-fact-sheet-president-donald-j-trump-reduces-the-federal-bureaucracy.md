title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Reduces the Federal Bureaucracy'
---
 
**SHRINKING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order continuing the reduction of Federal
bureaucracy and waste.

-   The Order aims to further decrease the size of the Federal
    Government to enhance accountability, reduce waste, and promote
    innovation.
-   It eliminates or reduces to the minimum level of activity and
    expenditure required by law unnecessary governmental entities and
    Federal advisory committees.
-   Within 30 days, a list of additional unnecessary government entities
    and advisory committees must be submitted to the President for
    termination.

**REDUCING GOVERNMENT OVERREACH:** President Trump’s Executive Order is
consistent with his Administration’s policy to dramatically reduce the
size of the Federal Government, while increasing its accountability to
the American people.  

-   The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has already
    identified billions in waste, fraud, and abuse.
-   Cutting these governmental entities and Federal advisory committees
    will save taxpayer dollars, reduce unnecessary government spending,
    and streamline government priorities.
-   By reducing the Federal footprint, President Trump is returning
    power to local communities and state governments.

**REFORMING THE FEDERAL BUREAUCRACY:** The American people elected
President Trump to drain the swamp and end ineffective government
programs that empower government without achieving measurable results.

-   The government wastes billions of dollars each year on duplicative
    programs and frivolous expenditures that fail to align with American
    values or address the needs of the American people.
-   President Trump recently eliminated the Federal Executive Institute,
    a government program purportedly designed to provide bureaucratic
    leadership training.  
-   President Trump temporarily paused foreign aid to many
    non-governmental organizations, international organizations, and
    contractors to ensure every dollar of U.S. foreign assistance
    supports American values.
-   President Trump established the “Department of Government
    Efficiency” to examine how to streamline the Federal Government,
    eliminate unnecessary programs, and reduce bureaucratic
    inefficiency.
-   President Trump launched a 10-to-1 deregulation initiative, ensuring
    every new rule is justified by clear benefits.
-   Through these actions, President Trump is keeping his promise to
    restore efficiency and accountability in the Federal Government.
