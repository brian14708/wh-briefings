title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Ends the Procurement and Forced Use
  of Paper Straws'
---
 
**ENDING THE FORCED USE OF PAPER STRAWS:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed an Executive Order to end the procurement and forced use of
paper straws.

-   The Federal government is directed to stop purchasing paper straws
    and ensure they are no longer provided within Federal buildings.
-   The Order requires the development of a National Strategy to End the
    Use of Paper Straws within 45 days to alleviate the forced use of
    paper straws nationwide.

**BRINGING BACK COMMON SENSE:** The irrational campaign against plastic
straws has forced Americans to use nonfunctional paper straws. This ends
under President Trump.

-   Cities and states across America have banned paper straws, caving to
    pressure from woke activists who prioritize symbolism over science.
-   Paper straws use chemicals that may carry risks to human health –
    including “forever chemical” PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl
    substances) which are known to be highly water soluble and can bleed
    from the straw into a drink.
    -   A study found that while PFAS were found in paper straws, no
        measurable PFAS were found in plastic straws. 
-   Paper straws are more expensive than plastic straws, and often force
    users to use multiple straws.
-   Paper straws are not the eco-friendly alternative they claim to be –
    studies have shown that producing paper straws can have a larger
    carbon footprint and require more water than plastic straws.
-   Paper straws often come individually wrapped in plastic, undermining
    the environmental argument for their use.

**PROMOTING A CLEAN AND HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT:** President Trump has made
it a top priority to promote a clean and healthy environment for the
American people.

-   President Trump’s policies are promoting economic growth, while
    still maintaining standards that allow Americans to have among the
    cleanest air and water in the world.
-   This marks a sharp contrast from the previous Administration, which
    wasted American taxpayer dollars on virtue signaling instead of
    implementing effective solutions.
    -   For instance, the Biden Administration spent billions on
        electric vehicle charging stations, yet only eight were
        completed.
-   Meanwhile, President Trump’s commonsense approach to environmental
    conservation has demonstrated his true commitment to preserving
    America’s natural resources.
-   President Trump has championed improved forest management in order
    to prevent forest fires that are devastating communities and
    ecosystems across the country.
-   By pausing the expansion of windmills, President Trump recognized
    their detrimental environmental impact, particularly on wildlife,
    often outweighs their benefits.
-   President Trump signed the Save Our Seas Act to preserve and protect
    our beautiful waters and oceans from being littered with garbage.  
-   President Trump is committed to securing American energy
    independence, recognizing that America’s domestic supply of clean
    coal and natural gas not only strengthens national security but also
    provides some of the cleanest energy in the world.
