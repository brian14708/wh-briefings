title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Addresses Human Rights Violations in
  South Africa'
---
 
**ADDRESSING HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN SOUTH AFRICA:** On Friday,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to address serious
human rights violations occurring in South Africa.

-   As encapsulated in its recent land confiscation act to seize
    disfavored citizens’ property without compensation, the government
    of South Africa blatantly discriminates against ethnic minority
    descendants of settler groups.
-   As long as South Africa continues to support bad actors on the world
    stage and allows violent attacks on innocent disfavored minority
    farmers, the United States will stop aid and assistance to the
    country.
-   The United States will establish a plan to resettle disfavored
    minorities in South Africa discriminated against because of their
    race as refugees.

**STANDING UP AGAINST INJUSTICE AND OPPRESSION:** President Donald J.
Trump is committed to holding South Africa accountable for its actions.

-   South Africa has taken positions against the United States and its
    allies.
    -   Merely two months after the October 7<sup>th</sup> terrorist
        attacks on Israel, South Africa accused Israel, not Hamas, of
        genocide in the International Court of Justice.

    -   South Africa also strengthened ties with Iran, which supports
        terrorism globally.
-   While championing terrorism and autocratic regimes abroad, South
    Africa has committed similar human rights violations at home. The
    recent Expropriation Act enables the government of South Africa to
    seize ethnic minority descendants of settler groups’ agricultural
    property without compensation.         
    -   The Expropriation Act follows countless government policies
        designed to dismantle equal opportunity in employment,
        education, and business, and hateful rhetoric and government
        actions fueling disproportionate violence against racially
        disfavored landowners.

    -   Years ago, the South African government disbanded volunteer
        forces defending rural farmers, turning a blind eye to the
        ensuing farm attacks.

**REAFFIRMING OUR COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS:** A commitment to human
rights is central to President Trump’s America First agenda.

-   President Trump: “South Africa is confiscating land, and treating
    certain classes of people very badly \[…\] I will be cutting off all
    future funding to South Africa until a full investigation of this
    situation has been completed!”
-   President Trump believes in sending a clear message to the world’s
    bad actors—and to their victims—by condemning human rights abuses in
    no uncertain terms.
