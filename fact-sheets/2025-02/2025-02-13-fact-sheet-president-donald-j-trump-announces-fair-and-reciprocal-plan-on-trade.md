  \ Plan\u201D on Trade"

**THE “FAIR AND RECIPROCAL PLAN”:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed a Presidential Memorandum ordering the development of a
comprehensive plan for restoring fairness in U.S. trade relationships
and countering non-reciprocal trading arrangements.

-   The “Fair and Reciprocal Plan” will seek to correct longstanding
    imbalances in international trade and ensure fairness across the
    board.
-   Gone are the days of America being taken advantage of: this plan
    will put the American worker first, improve our competitiveness in
    every area of industry, reduce our trade deficit, and bolster our
    economic and national security. 

**AMERICA WILL NO LONGER TOLERATE UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES**: The United
States is one of the most open economies in the world, yet our trading
partners keep their markets closed to our exports. This lack of
reciprocity is unfair and contributes to our large and persistent annual
trade deficit.

-   There are endless examples where our trading partners do not give
    the United States reciprocal treatment.
    -   The U.S. tariff on ethanol is a mere 2.5%. Yet Brazil charges
        the U.S. ethanol exports a tariff of 18%. As a result, in 2024,
        the U.S. imported over $200 million in ethanol from Brazil while
        the U.S. exported only $52 million in ethanol to Brazil.
    -   The U.S. average applied Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariff on
        agricultural goods is 5%. But India’s average applied MFN tariff
        is 39%. India also charges a 100% tariff on U.S. motorcycles,
        while we only charge a 2.4% tariff on Indian motorcycles.
    -   The European Union can export all the shellfish it wants to
        America. But the EU bans shellfish exports from 48 of our
        states, despite committing in 2020 to expedite approvals for
        shellfish exports. As a result, in 2023, the U.S. imported $274
        million in shellfish from the EU but exported only $38 million.
    -   The EU also imposes a 10% tariff on imported cars. Yet the U.S.
        only imposes a 2.5% tariff.
    -   A 2019 report found that across 132 countries and more than
        600,000 product lines, United States exporters face higher
        tariffs more than two-thirds of the time.

-   This lack of reciprocity is one source of America’s large and
    persistent annual trade deficit in goods: closed markets abroad
    reduce U.S. exports and open markets at home result in significant
    imports, both of which undercut American competitiveness.
    -   The United States has run a trade deficit of goods every year
        since 1975. In 2024, our trade deficit in goods exceeded $1
        trillion.
    -   Thanks to the proliferation of non-reciprocal barriers in just
        the last few years, the U.S. now runs a trade deficit in
        agriculture, worth around $40 billion in 2024.
-   Though America has no such thing, and only America should be allowed
    to tax American firms, trading partners hand American companies a
    bill for something called a digital service tax.
    -   Canada and France use these taxes to each collect over $500
        million per year from American companies.
    -   Overall, these non-reciprocal taxes cost America’s firms over $2
        billion per year.
    -   Reciprocal tariffs will bring back fairness and prosperity to
        the distorted international trade system and stop Americans from
        being taken advantage of.

**THE ART OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEAL**: President Trump continues to
deliver on his mandate given to him by the American People to put
America First when it comes to trade.

-   As President Trump said in the Presidential Memorandum on American
    First Trade Policy on his first day in office, trade policy is a
    critical component of our economic security and national security.

-   In his first term, President Trump successfully ended the outdated
    and unfair NAFTA, replacing it with the historic USMCA to deliver
    one of the largest wins for American workers.
-   When our national security was threatened by a global oversupply of
    steel and aluminum, President Trump took swift action to protect
    America’s national security by implementing tariffs on imports of
    these goods.
-   In response to China’s intellectual property theft, forced
    technology transfer, and other unreasonable behavior, President
    Trump acted with conviction to impose tariffs on imports from China,
    using that leverage to reach a historic bilateral economic
    agreement.

Just last week, President Trump leveraged tariffs to force Canada and
Mexico to make long-overdue changes at our northern and southern
borders, ensuring the safety and security of American citizens.
