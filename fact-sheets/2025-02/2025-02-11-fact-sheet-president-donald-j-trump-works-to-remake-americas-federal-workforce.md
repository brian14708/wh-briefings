**REFORMING THE FEDERAL WORKFORCE TO BETTER SERVE AMERICANS:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order implementing the
President’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) workforce
optimization initiative.

-   The Executive Order will make the federal workforce more efficient
    and effective.
    -   Agency Heads will coordinate and consult with DOGE to shrink the
        size of the federal workforce and limit hiring to essential
        positions.

    <!-- -->

    -   The Office of Personnel Management will initiate a rulemaking to
        ensure federal employees are held to the highest standards of
        conduct.
-   The Order will significantly reduce the size of government.
    -   Upon expiration of the Day 1 hiring freeze and implementation of
        the hiring plan, agencies will be able to hire no more than one
        employee for every four employees that depart from federal
        service (with appropriate immigration, law enforcement, and
        public safety exceptions).

    <!-- -->

    -   Agencies will undertake plans for large-scale reductions in
        force and determine which agency components (or agencies
        themselves) may be eliminated or combined because their
        functions aren’t required by law.
-   The Order exempts personnel and functions critical to national
    security, public safety, law enforcement, and immigration
    enforcement.

**REDUCING THE UNNECESSARY FOOTPRINT OF GOVERNMENT:** President Donald
J. Trump is committed to reducing the size and scope of the federal
government.

-   There are too many federal employees.
    -   Excluding active-duty military and Postal Service employees, the
        federal workforce exceeds 2.4 million.

    <!-- -->

    -   No one knows exactly how many federal agencies exist, but the
        Federal Register lists over 400.
-   The federal workforce contributes significantly to federal spending
    and debt.
    -   In fiscal year 2022, the federal government spent nearly $300
        billion on compensation for civilian employees, excluding
        pensions.

    <!-- -->

    -   According to a recent congressional report, only 6% of federal
        workers report to work in-person on a full-time basis.

**BUILDING ON PAST SUCCESS:** President Trump has made reforming the
federal workforce a key priority for his second term.

-   President Trump has consistently worked to shrink the administrative
    state.
-   His first term spurred robust economic growth and innovation through
    regulatory reform. 
-   Workforce reform in his second term will build on these successes.
