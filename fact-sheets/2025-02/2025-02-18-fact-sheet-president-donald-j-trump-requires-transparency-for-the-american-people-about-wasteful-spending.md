title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Requires Transparency for the American
  People About Wasteful Spending'
---
 
**PROMOTING TRANSPRENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed a memorandum requiring radical transparency regarding
wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars by the federal government.

-   It requires all departments and agencies to disclose details about
    terminated programs, cancelled contracts, and discontinued grants to
    the fullest extent allowed by law.

**PUTTING AN END TO WASTEFUL SPENDING:** By signing this memorandum,
President Trump recognizes that the American people have a right to see
how the federal government has wasted their hard-earned wages.

-   The United States government has wasted taxpayer dollars on
    programs, contracts, and grants that do not serve the American
    public’s interests.
-   For too long, taxpayers have subsidized ideological projects
    overseas and domestic organizations engaged in actions that
    undermine the national interest.
-   The Biden Administration spent billions on electric vehicle charging
    stations, yet only a fraction were completed.
-   The Trump Administration recently canceled a Biden-era $50 million
    environmental justice grant to an organization that believes
    “climate justice travels through a Free Palestine.”
-   Numerous USAID grants have come under review, including $1.5 million
    to “advance diversity equity and inclusion in Serbia’s workplaces
    and business communities.”
-   The Biden Administration gave nearly $4.6 million to help foreign
    groups promote LGBT projects like drag shows and pride parades. 
-   The Trump Administration found $20 billion parked at a financial
    institution by the Biden Administration to fund partisan pet
    projects.
-   President Trump’s Department of Education canceled $881 million in
    unnecessary contracts that were not benefiting students, including a
    $4.6 million contract just to coordinate Zoom and in-person
    meetings.
-   President Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has
    already recovered $1.9 billion in taxpayer funds “misplaced” by the
    Biden Administration.
-   The Government Accountability Office released a report last year
    estimating that the federal government “could lose between $233
    billion and $521 billion annually to fraud.”

**KEEPING HIS PROMISE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE:** President Trump
campaigned on a promise to return power back to the American people by
“cleaning out the Deep State, firing rogue bureaucrats and career
politicians, and targeting government corruption.”

-   President Trump recently signed a memorandum to stop last-minute
    collective bargaining agreements issued by the Biden Administration
    designed to constrain the incoming Trump Administration from
    reforming government.
-   President Trump created the Department of Government Efficiency
    (DOGE) to bring accountability and transparency to federal spending,
    ensuring taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and effectively.
-   President Trump launched a 10-to-1 deregulation initiative, ensuring
    every new rule is justified by clear benefits for taxpayers.
-   The Trump Administration is aggressively investigating Biden-era
    programs that wasted billions of taxpayer dollars on inefficient and
    politically-driven projects, including canceling unnecessary
    government contracts and grants that do not serve the national
    interest.
