title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Announces Actions to Make Healthcare
  Prices Transparent'
---
 
**EMPOWERING PATIENTS THROUGH RADICAL PRICE TRANSPARENCY:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to empower patients
with clear, accurate, and actionable healthcare pricing information.

-   The order directs the Departments of the Treasury, Labor, and Health
    and Human Services to rapidly implement and enforce the Trump
    healthcare price transparency regulations, which were slow walked by
    the prior administration.
    -   The departments will ensure hospitals and insurers disclose
        actual prices, not estimates, and take action to make prices
        comparable across hospitals and insurers, including prescription
        drug prices.
    -   The departments will update their enforcement policies to ensure
        hospitals and insurers are in compliance with requirements to
        make prices transparent.

**LOWERING COSTS FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES:** When healthcare prices are
hidden, large corporate entities like hospitals and insurance companies
benefit at the expense of American patients. Price transparency will
lower healthcare prices and help patients and employers get the best
deal on healthcare.

-   Prices vary widely from hospital to hospital in the same region. One
    patient in Wisconsin saved $1,095 by shopping for two tests between
    two hospitals located within 30 minutes of one another.
-   One economic analysis found that President Trump’s original price
    transparency rules, if fully implemented, could deliver savings of
    $80 billion for consumers, employers, and insurers by 2025.
-   Employers can lower their healthcare costs by an average of 27% on
    500 common services by better shopping for care.
-   The Biden Administration was sued in 2023 for not enforcing the
    prescription drug transparency requirements. The Trump
    Administration will work to hold health plans accountable for making
    drug prices transparent.

**DELIVERING ON PROMISES TO PUT AMERICAN PATIENTS FIRST:** President
Trump is delivering on his promise to once again put American patients
first by holding the healthcare industrial complex accountable for
delivering transparent prices.

-   In his first Administration, President Trump took historic action by
    mandating that hospitals and insurers make prices public.
-   While the prior Administration failed to prioritize further
    implementation and enforcement of these requirements, President
    Trump is delivering on his promises to make the healthcare system
    more affordable and easier to navigate for patients.
-   American patients are fed up with the status quo – 95% deem
    healthcare price transparency an important priority, with six in ten
    saying it should be a top priority of the government.
-   President Trump has long pushed for radical price transparency to
    ensure the healthcare system puts American patients first:
    -   President Trump: “Our goal was to give patients the knowledge
        they need about the real price of healthcare services.  They’ll
        be able to check them, compare them, go to different locations,
        so they can shop for the highest-quality care at the lowest
        cost.  And this is about high-quality care.  You’re also looking
        at that.  You’re looking at comparisons between talents, which
        is very important.  And then, you’re also looking at cost.  And,
        in some cases, you get the best doctor for the lowest cost. 
        That’s a good thing.”
