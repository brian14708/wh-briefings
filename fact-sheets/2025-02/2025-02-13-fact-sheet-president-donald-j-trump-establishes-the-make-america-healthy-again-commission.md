title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Establishes the Make America Healthy
  Again Commission'
---
 
**MAKING AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order establishing the President’s Make America
Healthy Again Commission.

-   Chaired by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.
    Kennedy Jr., the Commission is tasked with investigating and
    addressing the root causes of America’s escalating health crisis,
    with an initial focus on childhood chronic diseases.
-   Within 100 days, the Commission will produce an assessment that
    summarizes what is known and what questions remain regarding the
    childhood chronic disease crisis, and include international
    comparisons.
-   Within 180 days, the Commission will produce a strategy, based on
    the findings of the assessment, to improve the health of America’s
    children.
-   The Commission has four main policy directives to reverse chronic
    disease:
    -   Empower Americans through transparency and open-source data and
        avoid conflicts of interest in all federally funded health
        research.

    <!-- -->

    -   Prioritize gold-standard research on why Americans are getting
        sick in all health-related research funded by the federal
        government.

    <!-- -->

    -   Work with farmers to ensure that U.S. food is the healthy,
        abundant and affordable.

    <!-- -->

    -   Ensure expanded treatment options and health coverage
        flexibility for beneficial lifestyle changes and disease
        prevention.
-   The Commission aims to restore trust in medical and scientific
    institutions and hold public hearings, meetings, roundtables, and
    similar events to receive expert input from leaders in public
    health.

**ADDRESSING THE RISE OF CHRONIC ILLNESSES:** President Trump
understands that America’s healthcare system is largely focused on
treating chronic illnesses rather than preventing them, leading to a
growing health crisis with serious economic and national security
consequences.

-   Based on all health indicators and global comparisons, Americans are
    becoming sicker, beset by illnesses that our medical system isn’t
    addressing effectively.
    -   In the United States, six in 10 adults have at least one chronic
        condition, and four in 10 have two or more.

    <!-- -->

    -   Prior to COVID, American life expectancy averaged 78.8 years,
        while comparable countries averaged 82.6 years, creating a gap
        that equates to 1.25 billion fewer life years for Americans.

    <!-- -->

    -   The United States has the highest age-standardized cancer
        incidence rate across 204 countries, nearly double the
        next-highest rate.
        -   From 1990 to 2021, the United States saw an 88% increase in
            cancer.

    <!-- -->

    -   Asthma is far more common in the United States than in other
        parts of the world, including most of Europe, Asia, and Africa.
-   The rise in chronic conditions is not limited to adults.
    -   Childhood is usually the healthiest period of life, yet as of
        2022, 30 million (40.7%) United States children had at least one
        health condition like allergies, asthma, or autoimmune diseases.

    <!-- -->

    -   Autism now affects one in 36 children, a staggering increase
        from rates of one to four out of 10,000 children identified with
        the condition during the 1980s.

    <!-- -->

    -   18% of teens suffer from fatty liver disease, nearly 30% are
        prediabetic, and more than 40% are overweight or obese – these
        conditions were virtually unheard of in prior generations.

    <!-- -->

    -   The incidence of childhood cancer, while still rare, increased
        0.8% per year since 1975—an over 40% increase over 45 years.

    <!-- -->

    -   Overmedication, particularly among children, is a growing
        concern. More than 3.4 million children are currently taking
        medication for ADD/ADHD and diagnoses continue to rise.
-   Chronic disease has widespread effects, including on our military
    and our economy.
    -   77% of young adults do not qualify for military service without
        a waiver, primary due to being overweight, drug use, or mental
        and physical health issues.

    <!-- -->

    -   90% of America’s $4.5 trillion healthcare expenditure is
        directed at managing chronic and mental health conditions.

    <!-- -->

    -   The United States spends almost twice per capita what other
        wealthy countries spend on healthcare.
-   Americans have lost trust in our health system, skeptical as to
    whether they are receiving honest answers about the causes of the
    country’s health crisis and how to improve it.
    -   Only a third of Americans trust the U.S. health system, a
        near-record low.

**TAKING ON THE HEALTH CRISIS:** President Trump is fulfilling his
promise to tackle the health crisis facing America.

-   President Trump pledged that upon returning to the White House he
    would establish a special Presidential Commission that’s “not bought
    and paid for by Big Pharma, and I will charge them with
    investigating what is causing the decades-long increase in chronic
    illnesses \[…\] And then, I will ask them to publish recommendations
    for how every American child can have a safe and healthy childhood.”
-   In his first term, President Trump lowered healthcare costs,
    provided more healthcare options, and ensured better care for the
    American people.
-   President Trump has consistently championed initiatives aimed at
    improving the health and well-being of Americans. Select actions
    from the prior Trump Administration include:
    -   Passed Right To Try to give terminally ill patients access to
        lifesaving cures.

    <!-- -->

    -   Signed an executive order to fight kidney disease with more
        transplants and better treatment.

    <!-- -->

    -   Accelerated medical breakthroughs in genetic treatments for
        Sickle Cell disease.

    <!-- -->

    -   Declared the opioid crisis a nationwide public health emergency
        and signed the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, the
        largest-ever legislative effort to address a drug crisis in our
        Nation’s history.

    <!-- -->

    -   Expanded access to telehealth, especially in rural and
        underserved communities.
