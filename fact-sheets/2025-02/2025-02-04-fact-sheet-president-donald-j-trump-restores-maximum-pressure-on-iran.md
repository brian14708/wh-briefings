title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Restores Maximum Pressure on Iran'
---
 
**RESTORING MAXIMUM PRESSURE ON IRAN:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed a National Security Presidential Memorandum (NSPM) restoring
maximum pressure on the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran,
denying Iran all paths to a nuclear weapon, and countering Iran’s malign
influence abroad.

-   The NSPM establishes that:
    -   Iran should be denied a nuclear weapon and intercontinental
        ballistic missiles;

    <!-- -->

    -   Iran’s terrorist network should be neutralized; and

    <!-- -->

    -   Iran’s aggressive development of missiles, as well as other
        asymmetric and conventional weapons capabilities, should be
        countered.
-   The NSPM directs the Secretary of the Treasury to impose maximum
    economic pressure on the Government of Iran, including by
    sanctioning or imposing enforcement mechanisms on those acting in
    violation of existing sanctions.
    -   The Treasury Secretary will also issue guidance for all relevant
        business sectors – including shipping, insurance, and port
        operators – about the risks to any person that knowingly
        violates U.S. sanctions with respect to Iran or an Iranian
        terror proxy.

    <!-- -->

    -   The Secretary of State will also modify or rescind existing
        sanctions waivers and cooperate with the Secretary of Treasury
        to implement a campaign aimed at driving Iran’s oil exports to
        zero.

    <!-- -->

    -   The United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations
        will work with key allies to complete the snapback of
        international sanctions and restrictions on Iran.

**PROTECTING THE HOMELAND FROM IRAN:** The previous Administration’s
tolerance of Iran’s threats to American citizens and companies ends now.

-   The Attorney General will pursue all available legal steps to
    investigate, disrupt, and prosecute financial and logistical
    networks, operatives, or front groups inside the United States that
    are sponsored by Iran or an Iranian terror proxy.
    -   The Attorney General will prosecute leaders and members of
        Iranian-funded terrorist groups that have captured, harmed, or
        killed American citizens and seek their arrest and extradition
        to the United States.

**TAKING IRAN’S NUCLEAR PROGRAM OFF THE TABLE:** President Trump will
not tolerate Iran possessing a nuclear weapons capability, nor will he
stand for their sustained sponsorship of terrorism, especially against
U.S. interests.

-   In 2020, President Trump declared that “as long as \[he is\]
    President of the United States, Iran will never be allowed to have a
    nuclear weapon.”
-   Today’s NSPM fulfills the President’s 2020 vow to contend with
    Iran’s pernicious influence across the globe:
    -   “For far too long — all the way back to 1979, to be exact —
        nations have tolerated Iran’s destructive and destabilizing
        behavior in the Middle East and beyond.  Those days are over. 
        Iran has been the leading sponsor of terrorism, and their
        pursuit of nuclear weapons threatens the civilized world.  We
        will never let that happen.”
