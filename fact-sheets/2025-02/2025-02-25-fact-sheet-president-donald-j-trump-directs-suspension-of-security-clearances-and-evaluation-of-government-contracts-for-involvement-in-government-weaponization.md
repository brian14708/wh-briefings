title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Directs Suspension of Security Clearances
  and Evaluation of Government Contracts for Involvement in Government Weaponization'
---
 
**ADDRESSING THE WEAPONIZATION OF GOVERNMENT:** Today, President Donald
J. Trump signed a memorandum to suspend security clearances for
Covington & Burling LLP employees involved in the weaponization of
government, pending a review of their roles and responsibility in the
weaponization of the judicial process. This action also initiates a
comprehensive review of all Federal contracts with the firm to ensure
alignment with the interests of the American people.  

-   Security clearances held by Peter Koski and potential other members
    of Covington & Burling LLP who assisted former Special Counsel Jack
    Smith will be suspended, pending a review of their roles and
    responsibility in the weaponization of the judicial process.
-   The Federal Government will review and terminate engagement of
    Covington & Burling LLP by the United States to the maximum extent
    permitted by law.
    -   All contracts with Covington & Burling LLP will undergo a
        detailed evaluation to ensure agency funding decisions align
        with American citizens’ interests and the priorities of this
        Administration, as detailed in executive directives.

**PRIORITIZING CITIZENS OVER PARTISAN GAMES:** President Trump remains
steadfast in his commitment to restoring trust in government by ensuring
that public resources and privileges are not exploited for political
gain.

-   Individuals who hold government-issued security clearances bear a
    responsibility to uphold impartiality and the national interest.
    These privileges should not be leveraged to interfere in U.S.
    elections or advance partisan objectives.
-   Covington & Burling LLP provided former Special Counsel Jack Smith
    with $140,000 in free legal services prior to his resignation from
    the Department of Justice.
    -   Jack Smith and his staff spent more than $50 million in taxpayer
        dollars to target President Trump—an egregious misuse of
        judicial authority for political ends and part of the prior
        administration’s unprecedented weaponization of prosecutorial
        power to upend the democratic process.

**A RETURN TO ACCOUNTABILITY:** President Trump is sending a clear
message that the Federal Government will no longer tolerate the abuse of
power by partisan actors who exploit their positions for political gain.

-   President Trump is refocusing government operations to its core
    mission – serving the citizens of the United States.  
-   President Trump revoked security clearances held by dozens of
    intelligence officials who falsely claimed in a 2020 letter, during
    the height of the U.S. presidential election season, that Hunter
    Biden’s laptop was tantamount to Russian disinformation.
-   President Trump signed an Executive Order to end the weaponization
    of the Federal Government on his first day in office after promising
    to “end forever the weaponization of government and the abuse of law
    enforcement against political opponents.”
