title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Withdraws from Anti-American UN Organizations'
---
 
**ENDING U.S. SUPPORT FOR RADICAL ANTI-AMERICAN UN ORGANIZATIONS**:
Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order withdrawing
the United States from the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and
prohibiting any future funding for the UN Relief and Works Agency for
the Near East (UNRWA).

-   The Executive Order also requires the Secretary of State to review
    and report to the President on which international organizations,
    conventions, or treaties promote radical or anti-American sentiment.
    -   The UN Educational, Science, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO),
        in particular, will undergo a review under an expedited timeline
        due to its history of anti-Israel bias.
-   The Executive Order will prohibit the United States from providing
    any additional funding to UNRWA, which has consistently shown itself
    to be anti-Semitic and anti-Israel, as evidenced by the number of
    its staff members who took part in the horrific October
    7<sup>th</sup> terrorist attacks against Israel.
    -   UNRWA facilities have repeatedly been used by Hamas and other
        terrorist groups to store weapons and build tunnels.

**STANDING UP FOR HUMAN RIGHTS**: The UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC)
has not fulfilled its purpose and continues to be used as a protective
body for countries committing horrific human rights violations.

-   Countries such as Iran, China, and Cuba use the UNHRC to shield
    themselves despite having egregious records of human rights
    violations and abuses.

-   The UNHRC has demonstrated consistent bias against Israel, focusing
    on it unfairly and disproportionately in council proceedings.
-   In 2018, the year President Trump withdrew from the UNHRC in his
    first administration, the organization passed more resolutions
    condemning Israel than Syria, Iran, and North Korea combined.

**BUILDING ON PAST SUCCESS**: During his first administration, President
Trump stopped funding the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and
withdrew the United States from the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and
the UN Educational, Science and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).

-   President Trump in 2017: “The United Nations must reform if it is to
    be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty,
    security, and prosperity.”
-   After the U.S. withdrew from UNESCO, the organization took steps to
    improve its relationship with Israel.
-   President Trump successfully stopped U.S. funding to UNRWA during
    his first administration. The Biden Administration initially resumed
    funding until being forced to confront UNRWA’s corruption after the
    October 7<sup>th</sup> attacks, and President Trump is once again
    taking action to stand up for human rights by withdrawing the United
    States from this corrupt organization for good.
