**EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed an Executive Order keeping men out of women’s sports.

-   The Executive Order upholds the promise of Title IX and ends the
    dangerous and unfair participation of men in women’s sports.
    -   The order requires DOJ to abide by the nationwide vacatur of the
        previous Administration’s illegal Title IX rewrite that would
        have dissolved single-sex spaces and opportunities.

    -   The order also requires immediate action, including enforcement
        actions, against schools and athletic associations comprised of
        schools that deny women single-sex sports and single-sex locker
        rooms.
-   The Executive Order calls for the convening of private sporting
    bodies in the White House to hear, in person, the stories of female
    athletes who suffer life-long injuries, who have been silenced and
    forced to shower with men, and whose hard work has been cast aside
    due to the biological advantage of males.
-   The Executive Order directs State attorneys general to identify best
    practices for ensuring equal opportunities for women in sports and
    to highlight impact stories of women harmed by male athletes
    competing in women’s sports.
-   The Secretary of State will demand changes within the International
    Olympic Committee to preserve single-sex sports, a necessity for
    safety and fairness.
-   The Department of Homeland Security will review visa policies to
    address males falsely asserting they are females when entering the
    United States to compete in women’s sports.

**THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S WAR ON WOMEN:** Instead of standing for the
rights of women, Biden caved to woke activists who wanted biological
males to be treated as women in workplace showers, competitive sports,
prisons, and rape shelters.

-   The Biden Administration ignored the integrity of women’s sports and
    sex-equality under the 1972 landmark sex-discrimination Title IX law
    in the name of “inclusivity.”
-   On his first day in office, Biden signed an Executive Order calling
    on schools across the country to allow students to compete in the
    sport of their “gender identity.”
-   On the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Title IX, Biden’s Department
    of Education “issued a new rule” which redefined the word “women.”
    -   This move “opened sex-segregated spaces like bathrooms, locker
        rooms, dorm rooms and single-sex admissions programs to anyone
        who identifies as a woman” and removed “commonsense” student
        protections in “campus sexual assault and harassment
        proceedings.”
    -   The Biden Administration argued that states may not pass laws
        protecting single-sex sports. Their rewrite of Title IX was
        found to be illegal and has been vacated nationwide.
-   The Biden Administration changed federal prison policy to let
    prisoners be incarcerated with the gender they identify
    as, including letting biological males be housed with female
    inmates.
    -   Nearly half of trans-identifying male prisoners have sex-offense
        convictions.
    -   Because of Biden’s radical policies, two female inmates at an
        all-female prison were impregnated by a biological male who
        claimed to identify as a female.
-   Biden oversaw a shortage of baby formula and feminine hygiene
    products, which left women unable to access and afford these
    essential items.

**WOMEN’S OPPORTUNITIES AND PRIVACY ARE BEING DESTROYED:** Policies,
like those of the NCAA, are based on the faulty premise that it is
possible to medically close the male-female athletic gap. It’s not.

-   Men, on average, have greater muscle mass, strength, and
    cardiovascular capacity due to testosterone levels, which provides
    them with physical advantages in many sports.
    -   Even if male athletes “transition” through hormone therapy, they
        retain physical advantages.
    -   Stories of athletes such as Peyton McNabb, who has been
        permanently disabled by a male spiking a volleyball in her face
        during a women’s match, highlight the danger in allowing male
        participation.
-   Women’s sports were created to give female athletes a level playing
    field – allowing biological men to compete undermines the fairness
    and opportunities for women to succeed in their own leagues.
-   Transgender men are pushing out the achievements of women who have
    worked their whole careers to set records in their respective
    fields.
    -   Female athletes have lost nearly 900 medals to men competing
        against them in women’s sporting categories.
    -   In addition to awards and trophies, men have been taking away
        roster spots, playing time, resources, and opportunities from
        women.
-   The American people overwhelmingly agree with President Trump – men
    do not belong in women’s sports.
    -   Roughly seven in 10 Americans oppose men in women’s sports.
    -   More than 7,000 NCAA female athletes have personally reached out
        to the NCAA to change its policies, comply with Title IX, and
        protect women.
-   To date, 26 states have enacted policies to protect equal athletic
    opportunities for women and girls.

**FEMALE ATHLETES ARE SPEAKING OUT:**

-   University of Wyoming volleyball player Macey Boggs: “I was stripped
    of a chance to play my final collegiate matches because we faced a
    situation no woman should ever have to face, either compete against
    a team rostering a male athlete on a woman’s scholarship or forfeit
    the rest of our season. No woman should have to face such a
    decision. We deserve to compete against athletes whose biology
    matches our own, not against a male standard.”
-   Roanoke College swim team captain Lily Mullens: “This has been too
    great a burden to bear for many of our teammates who have lost hours
    of sleep, many tears, and the will to train to race a swimmer who
    has an advantage in the water that our bodies may never possess.”
-   Roanoke College swim team member Susanna Price: “The thought of
    having to compete against a biological man is a message that women
    aren’t worthy, that we don’t actually matter.”
-   American surfing legend Bethany Hamilton: “California state law
    allows for males in female surfing events. This is not fair game. I
    do not support this.”
-   Professional golfer Alison Crenshaw: “This movement was born because
    there have been numerous incidents where female athletes have had
    their hard work and potential stolen from them because male athletes
    were allowed to compete in the female division. It’s wrong, it’s
    cheating, and female athletes deserve to have their rights as
    athletes fought for.”

**PRESIDENT TRUMP PROMISES EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS:**
President Trump has vowed to defend women from gender ideology extremism
and restore biological truth to the Federal government.

-   President Trump campaigned on banning men from competing in women’s
    sports: “You just ban it. You just don’t let it happen.”
-   On Day One, President Trump signed an Executive Order establishing
    Government-wide the biological reality of two sexes and clearly
    defining male and female.
-   Earlier this week, President Trump signed Executive Orders to
    protect children from chemical and surgical mutilation and to
    prohibit federal funding of the indoctrination of children with
    radical gender ideology.
-   Today’s Executive Order upholds the original promise of Title IX,
    keeping his campaign promise to the American people.
