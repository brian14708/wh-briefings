  Deconstruction of Unconstitutional Administrative State'

**ENSURING LAWFUL ENFORCEMENT:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed
an Executive Order ensuring lawful governance and implementing the
President’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) deregulatory
initiative. The Executive Order will end Federal overreach in regulation
and enforcement and restore the constitutional separation of powers:

-   Agency heads shall, in coordination with their DOGE team leads and
    the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), review all regulations
    subject to their jurisdiction for consistency with law and Trump
    Administration policy, prioritizing rules that impose heavy costs.
    -   A Unified Agenda will be developed to rescind and/or modify
        regulations that are inconsistent with law or the Trump
        Administration’s policy.
-   Agencies shall utilize enforcement discretion to de-prioritize
    enforcement actions that stretch statutory authority or exceed the
    constitutional powers of the Federal Government.
-   The Order exempts, among other things, any action respecting a
    military, national security, homeland security, foreign affairs, or
    immigration-related function of the United States.

**ELIMINATING UNLAWFUL REGULATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT:** The accumulation
of federal regulations and their burdensome enforcement, including
legally suspect regulations, has stifled economic growth and constrained
Americans’ freedom.    

-   The Biden Administration imposed a historic $1.7 trillion in costs
    on the American people. 
-   This Executive Order stops and reverses the regulatory overreach and
    abusive enforcement, ensuring that the operation of the government
    is responsible, lawful, and efficient.

**BUILDING ON PAST SUCCESS:** President Trump’s first term was the most
successful deregulatory undertaking in American history. This Executive
Order builds on these foundations and furthers the deregulatory project
to improve the daily lives of the American people and unleash a new
Golden Age of America.
