  \ Amendment Rights"

**STOPPING FEDERAL INFRINGEMENT ON CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to end the federal
government’s violation of Americans’ fundamental Second Amendment right
to protect themselves, their families, and their freedoms.

-   This Executive Order will halt existing policies designed to curtail
    the clear right of law-abiding citizens to keep and bear arms.
-   The order directs the incoming Attorney General to immediately
    complete a specific review of all orders, regulations, guidance,
    plans, and other actions by the Biden Administration regarding
    firearms—listing several specific documents to be reviewed—and
    deliver a plan of action to the President to eliminate all
    infringements on Americans’ Second Amendment rights. 

**ENDING THE ATTACKS ON LAW-ABIDING GUN OWNERS AND GUN BUSINESSES:** The
Biden Administration has flagrantly sought to eliminate Second Amendment
rights. Among other infringements, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
Firearms and Explosives (ATF) was weaponized to end the livelihoods of
law-abiding small business owners in an effort to limit Americans’
ability to acquire firearms:

-   The so-called “zero tolerance” or “enhanced regulatory enforcement
    policy” put in place under the previous administration led to a
    nearly six-fold increase in enforcement actions against Federal
    Firearms Licensees (FFL’s), many of whom are mom-and-pop shop small
    businesses who made innocent paperwork errors.
-   Firearms manufacturers have been de-banked or denied services simply
    because they make guns—which allow Americans to exercise a
    constitutional right.

**DEFENDING OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS:** President
Trump is standing up for our constitutional Second Amendment right to
keep and bear arms, building on progress made during his first term:

-   President Trump removed the United States from the United Nations
    (UN) misguided Arms Trade Treaty to protect Americans from the
    threat of global regulations of conventional firearms.
-   President Trump’s Department of Justice narrowed the definition of
    “fugitive from justice” to more specific guidelines when determining
    who is prohibited from buying a gun.

During the pandemic, President Trump designated the firearms industry
“essential” in order to protect gun stores, shooting ranges, and
ammunition dealers from being shut down.
