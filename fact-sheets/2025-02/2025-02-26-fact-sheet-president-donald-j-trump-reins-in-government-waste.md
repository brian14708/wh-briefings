title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Reins in Government Waste'
---
 
**ENSURING EFFICIENCY IN GOVERNMENT COSTS AND CONTRACTS:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order Implementing the
President’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cost efficiency
initiative.

-   The Executive Order will use modern technology to transform Federal
    spending on contracts and grants by subjecting it to rigorous
    standards.
    -   Agencies must immediately review all contracts and grants for
        waste, fraud, and abuse.

    <!-- -->

    -   Government payments and travel expenses must be justified and
        made publicly available where possible.

    <!-- -->

    -   Agency heads will work with the DOGE team leads employed by
        their agencies to review and terminate all unnecessary
        contracts.
-   The Order will reform the way the Federal government manages its
    real property.
    -   The General Services Administration (GSA) will submit a plan for
        disposing of unnecessary government-owned or leased real
        property.

**BRINGING DISCIPLINE TO A WASTEFUL SYSTEM:** The existing system fails
to safeguard taxpayer dollars or promote merit among contractors and
grant recipients.

-   The federal government expends large sums on contracts and grants.
    -   In fiscal year 2023, the federal government committed about $759
        billion on contracts.  This flood of spending historically had
        minimal safeguards.
-   In the Biden Administration, GSA directed its efforts to promoting
    diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) rather than merit and
    efficiency.

**BUILDING ON PAST SUCCESS:** President Trump has made cutting federal
expenditures and promoting governmental efficiency a priority in his
second term.

-   In his first term, President Trump spurred economic growth through
    significant regulatory reform.
    -   The Executive Order’s program for reforming contracting and
        grantmaking is a natural extension of these efforts to improve
        government for the American people it serves.
