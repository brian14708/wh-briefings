  \ Lee Jae Myung"
---
 
President Lee Jae Myung of the Republic of Korea (ROK) welcomed
President Donald J. Trump of the United States of America (United States
or U.S.) for a State Visit to ROK on October 29. This marks the first
time in Korean history that a State Visit has been hosted in Gyeongju
and follows on the two leaders’ first meeting in Washington on August
25. Notably, it is also the first time that the ROK has welcomed the
same leader for a second state visit.

In light of President Trump’s historic 2024 victory and President Lee’s
election demonstrating the ROK’s democratic strength and resilience,
they declared a new chapter in the U.S.-ROK Alliance, the linchpin for
peace, security and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula and in the
Indo-Pacific region. 

**REBUILDING AND EXPANDING CRITICAL INDUSTRIES**:  President Trump and
President Lee reaffirmed the historic announcement in July of The Korea
Strategic Trade and Investment deal, which reflects the strength and
endurance of the U.S.-ROK Alliance. 

-   Both leaders welcome Korean investments in various sectors to
    advance economic and national security interests, including but not
    limited to shipbuilding, energy, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals,
    critical minerals, and artificial intelligence/quantum computing.
-   This deal includes $150 billion of Korean investment in the
    shipbuilding sector approved by the United States, which is referred
    to as the Approved Investments.
-   This deal also includes $200 billion of additional Korean investment
    committed pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding with respect
    to Strategic Investments (MOU), which is expected to be signed by
    representatives of the United States and ROK.
-   The United States will apply the higher of *either* the U.S.-Korea
    Free Trade Agreement (“KORUS FTA”) or U.S. Most Favored Nation
    (“MFN”) tariff rate, as applicable, *or* a tariff rate of 15 percent
    on originating goods of the ROK, for purposes of the reciprocal
    tariff provided under Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025, as
    amended.
-   The United States will reduce its Section 232 sectoral tariffs on
    automobiles, auto parts, timber, lumber, and wood derivatives of the
    ROK to 15 percent. For such products of the ROK with a KORUS FTA or
    MFN tariff rate, as applicable, equal to or greater than 15 percent,
    no additional Section 232 tariff shall apply. For such products of
    the ROK with a KORUS FTA or MFN tariff, as applicable, less than 15
    percent, the sum of the KORUS FTA or MFN tariff and the additional
    Section 232 tariff shall be 15 percent.
-   For any Section 232 tariffs imposed on pharmaceuticals, the United
    States intends to apply to originating goods of the ROK a Section
    232 tariff rate no greater than 15 percent.
-   For any Section 232 tariffs imposed on semiconductors (including
    semiconductor manufacturing equipment), the United States intends to
    provide terms for such Section 232 tariffs on Korea that are no less
    favorable than terms that may be offered in a future agreement
    covering a volume of semiconductor trade at least as large as
    Korea’s, as determined by the United States.
-   The United States intends to remove supplemental tariffs imposed
    pursuant to Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025, as amended for
    certain products identified on the list of Potential Tariff
    Adjustments for Aligned Partners, such as generic pharmaceuticals,
    generic pharmaceutical ingredients, generic pharmaceutical chemical
    precursors, and certain natural resources unavailable in the United
    States. The United States will also remove tariffs on certain
    aircraft and parts of the ROK from the tariffs imposed pursuant to
    Executive Order 14257, as amended, by Proclamation 9704, as amended,
    Proclamation 9705, as amended, and Proclamation 10962.

**FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET STABILITY: ** The United States and the ROK,
in connection with their respective commitments included in the MOU,
have thoroughly discussed the potential impact of the MOU on the foreign
exchange market stability of the ROK. They have reached a mutual
understanding that commitments in the MOU shall not be allowed to give
rise to market instability. As trusted partners, the two nations agree
that the ROK shall not be required to fund an aggregate amount of U.S.
dollars greater than $20 billion in any calendar year.  The ROK will use
its best efforts, to the greatest extent possible, to source the U.S.
dollars through means other than market purchases so as to minimize any
potential impact on the market. Should it appear that the fulfillment of
the commitments in the MOU may cause market instability, such as
disorderly movements of Korean won, the ROK may request an adjustment in
the amount and timing of the funding, and the United States will, in
good faith, give due consideration to such request.

**ENHANCING COMMERCIAL TIES**:  The two leaders welcomed a series of
commercial commitments in strategic sectors, reflecting the confidence
of the private sector in the strong bilateral economic partnership.

-   The two leaders welcomed the announcement in August by ROK companies
    of foreign direct investments in the United States totaling $150
    billion during President Trump’s term. Both countries will use their
    best efforts to facilitate these investments.
-   The two leaders welcomed the announcement by Korean Air (KAL) in
    August of a purchase order of 103 Boeing aircraft powered by GE
    Aerospace engines. The Boeing commitment is valued at U.S. $36
    billion and will include a mix of Boeing 737 MAX jets, 787
    Dreamliners, and 777X passenger and freighters, bringing KAL’s total
    order in 2025 to more than 150 Boeing airplanes.
-   The United States and the ROK welcome the *Buy America in Seoul*
    initiative, whereby the ROK, in collaboration with the State
    Governments, will organize an annual exhibition featuring U.S.
    companies, including Small and Medium-sized Enterprises, to promote
    the export of U.S. goods into Korea.

**PROMOTING RECIPROCAL TRADE**:  The two leaders recognized that the
recently announced deal reflects a common goal to increase mutually
beneficial trade and investment. In the spirit of the deal, the United
States and the ROK will address non-tariff barriers and memorialize
commitments and a plan of action to promote reciprocal trade, to be
adopted by the KORUS Joint Committee before the end of the year. This
will include but not be limited to the following:

-   The ROK will eliminate the 50,000-unit cap on U.S.-originating
    Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS)-compliant vehicles
    that can enter the ROK without further modifications.  The ROK will
    also reduce regulatory burdens for U.S. automotive exports by not
    requiring additional documentation in its emissions certification
    process other than those submitted to U.S certification authorities.
-   The ROK will work together with the United States to address
    non-tariff barriers affecting trade in food and agricultural
    products, including by: ensuring that existing commitments under
    bilateral agreements and protocols are met; streamlining the
    regulatory approval process for agricultural biotechnology products
    and resolving the backlog of U.S. applications; establishing a U.S.
    Desk dedicated to requests for U.S. horticultural products; and
    preserving market access for U.S. meats and cheeses that use certain
    terms.
-   The United States and the ROK commit to ensure that U.S. companies
    are not discriminated against and do not face unnecessary barriers
    in terms of laws and policies concerning digital services, including
    network usage fees and online platform regulations, and to
    facilitate cross-border transfer of data, including for location,
    reinsurance, and personal data. Further, the United States and the
    ROK will support the permanent moratorium on customs duties on
    electronic transmissions at the World Trade Organization.
-   The ROK commits to provide additional procedural fairness provisions
    in competition proceedings, including the recognition of
    attorney-client privilege.
-   The United States and the ROK will work together to protect
    intellectual property rights. The ROK will continue to take the
    necessary steps to accede to the Patent Law Treaty.
-   The United States and the ROK commit to work together to ensure
    strong protection of internationally-recognized labor rights. The
    United States and the ROK will work together to combat all forms of
    forced labor globally, including by combatting the importation of
    goods made with forced labor.
-   The United States and the ROK reaffirm the importance of ensuring
    differences in environmental protection do not distort trade and
    investment. To this end, the ROK will effectively enforce its
    environmental laws to facilitate reciprocal trade, including by
    fully implementing the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies.

**PROTECTING ECONOMIC PROSPERITY**:  The two leaders acknowledged the
need to strengthen economic and national security alignment in order to
preserve our competitiveness and maintain secure supply chains. This
includes cooperation to combat duty evasion and taking complementary
actions to address unfair and non-market policies and practices,
enhancing inbound investment and outbound investment regulations, and
both countries will ensure that international procurement obligations
provide a benefit to those countries that have taken on the same
commitments.

**MODERNIZING THE U.S.-ROK ALLIANCE: ** The United States underscored
its commitment to the defense of the ROK through the enduring presence
of the U.S. Forces Korea (USFK).

    through consultation mechanisms including the Nuclear Consultative
    Group.
-   President Lee shared the ROK’s plan to increase its defense spending
    to 3.5% of GDP as soon as possible in accordance with ROK legal
    requirements, which President Trump welcomed.
-   The ROK also committed to spending $25 billion on U.S. military
    equipment purchases by 2030, and shared its plan to provide
    comprehensive support for U.S. Forces Korea amounting to $33 billion
    in accordance with ROK legal requirements.
-   The two leaders committed to continue alliance cooperation toward
    the transition of wartime operational control.  With the support of
    the United States, the ROK pledged to accelerate efforts to
    strengthen its military capabilities necessary to lead the combined
    conventional defense against the Democratic People’s Republic of
    Korea (DPRK). These include acquisition of advanced U.S. weapons
    systems and expansion of bilateral defense industrial cooperation,
    including in high-tech weapons systems.
-   The United States and the ROK will enhance U.S. conventional
    deterrence posture against all regional threats to the Alliance,
    including the DPRK. The two sides affirm relevant understandings
    since 2006. Both sides will continue close consultation and report
    the progress on implementation to their leadership.
-   The United States and the ROK pledged to expand cooperation in
    cyberspace and outer space. The two leaders also reaffirmed their
    intention to continue working together on AI in the military domain.

leaders committed to peace, security, and prosperity both on the Korean
Peninsula and in the Indo-Pacific region.

    across the Taiwan Strait. They encouraged the peaceful resolution of
    cross-Strait issues and opposed unilateral changes to the status
    quo.

**FURTHERING OUR MARITIME AND NUCLEAR PARTNERSHIP: ** The United States
welcomed the ROK’s commitment to contribute to modernizing and expanding
the capacity of American shipbuilding industries, including through
investments in U.S. shipyards and America’s workforce.  The ROK welcomed
the United States’ support for the ROK’s civil and naval nuclear power
programs.

-   Both countries committed to collaborate further through a
    shipbuilding working group, including on maintenance, repair, and
    overhaul, workforce development, shipyard modernization, and supply
    chain resilience.
