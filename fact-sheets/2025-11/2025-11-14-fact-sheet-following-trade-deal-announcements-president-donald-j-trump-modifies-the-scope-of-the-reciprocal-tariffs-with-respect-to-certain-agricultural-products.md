title: 'Fact Sheet: Following Trade Deal Announcements, President Donald J. Trump
  Modifies the Scope of the Reciprocal Tariffs with Respect to Certain Agricultural
  Products'

**STRENGTHENING THE ECONOMY AND NATIONAL SECURITY THROUGH TARIFFS AND
TRADE DEALS:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive
Order modifying the scope of the reciprocal tariffs that he first
announced on April 2, 2025. Specifically, certain qualifying
agricultural products will no longer be subject to those tariffs.

-   President Trump is strengthening the U.S. economy and national
    security by modifying the scope of the reciprocal tariffs.
    -   On April 2, the President announced global reciprocal tariffs to
        address the national emergency posed by our large and persistent
        trade deficits, which are driven by the absence of reciprocity
        in our bilateral trade relationships, among other things. The
        President also determined not to impose reciprocal tariffs on
        certain products, including certain critical minerals, energy,
        and energy products.

    <!-- -->

    -   On September 5, the President modified the scope of the
        reciprocal tariffs. Some goods were added to Annex II of
        Executive Order 14257, meaning they would no longer be subject
        to reciprocal tariffs. Other goods were removed from Annex II,
        meaning they are now subject to reciprocal tariffs. The
        President also established a framework to implement existing and
        future trade deals, and he identified certain goods that may not
        be subject to reciprocal tariffs in the future.

    <!-- -->

    -   Given the substantial progress in reciprocal trade
        negotiations—including the conclusion of 9 framework deals, 2
        final agreements on reciprocal trade, and 2 investment
        agreements—current domestic demand for certain products, and
        current domestic capacity to produce certain products, among
        other things, President Trump has now determined that it is
        necessary and appropriate to further modify the scope of the
        reciprocal tariffs. Specifically, certain qualifying
        agricultural products will no longer be subject to those
        tariffs, such as certain food not grown in the United States.
-   Today’s Order follows the significant progress the President has
    made in securing more reciprocal terms for our bilateral trade
    relationships. President Trump’s deals have had and will continue to
    have broad impacts on domestic production and the economy as a
    whole, including enhanced market access for our agriculture
    exporters.
    -   For example, many of the announced trade deals and ongoing
        negotiations involve countries that produce substantial volumes
        of agricultural products that are not grown or produced in
        sufficient quantities in the United States.

    <!-- -->

    -   The President has thus determined that certain agricultural
        products shall no longer be subject to the reciprocal tariffs.
        Some of these products include:
        -   coffee and tea;

        <!-- -->

        -   tropical fruits and fruit juices;

        <!-- -->

        -   cocoa and spices;

        <!-- -->

        -   bananas, oranges, and tomatoes;

        <!-- -->

        -   beef; and

        <!-- -->

        -   additional fertilizers (some fertilizers have never been
            subject to the reciprocal tariffs).

    <!-- -->

    -   The products that will no longer be subject to the reciprocal
        tariffs have been added to Annex II of Executive Order 14257, as
        amended, and, as appropriate, have been removed from the
        “Potential Tariff Adjustments for Aligned Partners” (PTAAP)
        Annex.
        -   The PTAAP Annex continues to contain other natural resources
            not available in the United States for reasons of geology or
            climate, generic pharmaceutical inputs, and aircraft and
            aircraft parts.

        <!-- -->

        -   The President may be willing to remove the reciprocal
            tariffs from these products upon the conclusion of any
            reciprocal trade and security deal.

    <!-- -->

    -   A modified Annex II and PTAAP Annex are attached to today’s
        Order, and the modifications will take effect on November 13,
        2025.

**ACHIEVING RECIPROCAL TRADE:** In less than one year into his second
term, President Trump has strengthened the international economic
position of the United States by delivering a series of historic wins
for the American people.

-   The President has announced Agreements on Reciprocal Trade with
    Malaysia and Cambodia, and Joint Statements on Frameworks for such
    agreements with El Salvador, Argentina, Ecuador, and Guatemala;
    Thailand and Vietnam; the United Kingdom and European Union, and
    Switzerland; as well as investment deals with Japan and Korea.  The
    President has also made significant progress on reciprocal trade
    negotiations with many other countries around the world.

**DELIVERING FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE:** President Trump’s tariff
policies have delivered significant and lasting wins for the American
people through fair, tough, and strategic trade negotiations,
strengthening the U.S. economy and national security while breaking down
unfair trade barriers that have harmed American workers for decades.

-   By imposing tariffs on countries with nonreciprocal trade practices,
    President Trump is incentivizing manufacturing on American soil and
    defending our industries.
-   The Trump Administration has worked with America’s trading partners
    to craft tailor-made trade deals designed to eliminate their most
    distortive trade practices and to ensure that trading partners align
    with the United States on key economic and national security
    matters.
-   In a massive deal with the European Union, the EU has agreed to
    purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and make new investments of
    $600 billion in the United States, all by 2028, while accepting a
    15% tariff rate, and charging American companies zero.
-   During his historic trip to Asia in October, President Trump signed
    trade deals with Malaysia and Cambodia and reached reciprocal trade
    frameworks with Thailand and Vietnam.
    -   Cambodia will eliminate tariffs on 100% of U.S. industrial and
        agricultural goods, unlocking new market access for American
        workers and producers.

    <!-- -->

    -   Malaysia agreed to slash trade barriers facing American
        exporters and expand market access for U.S. goods, ranging from
        passenger vehicles and machinery to dairy and poultry.
-   Deals with four Latin American countries further opens those markets
    for U.S. exports by eliminating tariffs and non-tariff barriers, and
    strengthens our economic security relationships with these important
    neighbors.
-   With billions in reshoring investments already announced, President
    Trump is bringing manufacturing jobs back to America, revitalizing
    communities, and strengthening supply chains.
-   The Administration will continue to use all available tools to
    protect our national security, advance our economic interests, and
    uphold a system of trade based in fairness and reciprocity.
