  Trade Deal'

**LOWERING AMERICA’S TRADE DEFICIT AND WELCOMING HUGE INVESTMENT
COMMITMENTS: **Today, President Donald J. Trump announced a Framework
for a historic trade deal with the Swiss Confederation (Switzerland) and
the Principality of Liechtenstein (Liechtenstein) that will provide U.S.
exporters unprecedented access to Swiss and Liechtenstein markets and
drive billions of dollars in investment on U.S. soil, creating thousands
of jobs across America.

-   The Agreement on Reciprocal, Fair, and Balanced Trade will remove
    barriers to U.S. exports to Switzerland and Liechtenstein, helping
    to secure U.S. national and economic security.
-   This trade deal will lock in the largest expansion ever of U.S.
    exporter access to Swiss markets, creating new opportunities for
    U.S. manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, fishermen, and other
    producers.
-   Under the President’s leadership, billions of dollars of investment
    by major Swiss companies such as Roche, Novartis, ABB, and Stadler
    have already been announced in connection with the Framework, with
    more on the way.
-   Swiss and Liechtenstein companies will invest at least $200 billion
    into the United States, with at least $67 billion worth of
    investment occurring in 2026.
    -   These investments will create thousands of well-paying American
        jobs across all 50 states in a number of sectors, such as
        pharmaceuticals, machinery, medical devices, aerospace,
        construction, advanced manufacturing, gold manufacturing, and
        energy infrastructure.
-   Swiss and Liechtenstein enterprises have committed to investing in
    American workers through the use of Registered Apprenticeships and
    other training programs in key high-growth sectors.
-   Switzerland has made commitments to balance its trade with the
    United States.
-   As part of President Trump’s strategy to establish more balanced
    trade with Switzerland and Liechtenstein, the trading partners will
    pay a cumulative reciprocal tariff rate of no higher than 15%, the
    same treatment given to the European Union.

**PROMOTING RECIPRCAL TRADE:** The Framework breaks new ground in terms
of securing global supply chains, boosting U.S. national and economic
security, and increasing U.S. access to Swiss and Liechtenstein markets,
particularly for America’s agricultural exporters of poultry, bison, and
beef. The key terms of the Agreement between the United States,
Switzerland, and Liechtenstein will include:

-   Switzerland and Liechtenstein intend to remove a range of tariffs
    across agriculture and industrial sectors, including various fresh
    and dried nuts, fish and seafood, certain fruits, chemicals, and
    spirits such as whiskey and rum. In addition, Switzerland will
    establish tariff rate quotas for American poultry, beef, and bison.
-   Switzerland and Liechtenstein intend to address a range of
    non-tariff barriers that, for decades, have prevented U.S. goods
    from entering their markets. They will work to make our trade more
    seamless by:
    -   addressing restrictive measures on U.S. poultry and streamlining
        requirements for U.S. dairy products;

    <!-- -->

    -   opening Swiss and Liechtenstein markets for U.S. medical
        devices;

    <!-- -->

    -   streamlining customs processes to make it easier for U.S. goods
        to enter;

    <!-- -->

    -   negotiating robust commitments related to intellectual property
        rights protection and enforcement, including transparent and
        fair treatment of geographical indications;

    <!-- -->

    -   working to address forced labor in their supply chains and
        increasing cooperation on labor-related trade issues;

    <!-- -->

    -   adopting and maintaining high-levels of environmental
        protections and discussing commitments related to other
        environmental measures;

    <!-- -->

    -   enhancing cooperation on the identification and alignment of
        international standards to reduce barriers for U.S. exports; and

    <!-- -->

    -   recognizing U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.
-   The United States, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein have committed to
    a robust set of digital trade principles, including refraining from
    harmful digital services taxes.
-   The United States, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein intend to
    strengthen supply chain resilience by addressing non-market policies
    of third countries.
    -   Switzerland and Liechtenstein intend to close loopholes that
        currently allow non-Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) and
        Free Trade Agreement (FTA) parties to access their procurement
        markets, in order to ensure greater reciprocal benefits for U.S.
        products and services.

    <!-- -->

    -   Additionally, the Framework bolsters our shared national and
        economic security by expanding cooperation on export controls,
        sanctions, and investment screening.
-   The United States, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein will work
    expeditiously to finalize the Agreement on Reciprocal, Fair, and
    Balanced Trade, with the aim of concluding negotiations in early
    2026, in order to lock in these benefits and create a level playing
    field for American businesses and workers.
-   The U.S. goods trade deficit with Switzerland and Liechtenstein was
    $38.5 billion in 2024, and this deal with Switzerland will put us on
    a path to eliminate that deficit by 2028.

**LIBERATING AMERICA FROM UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES:** Since Day One,
President Trump challenged the assumption that American workers and
businesses must tolerate unfair trade practices that have disadvantaged
them for decades and contributed to our historic trade deficit.

-   On April 2, President Trump declared a national emergency in
    response to the unprecedented threat caused to the United States by
    the large and persistent trade deficit caused by a lack of
    reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships, disparate tariff
    rates and non-tariff barriers, and U.S. trading partners’ economic
    policies that suppress domestic wages and consumption.

<!-- -->

-   President Trump continues to advance the interests of the American
    people and our agricultural sector by removing tariff and non-tariff
    barriers and expanding market access for American exporters.
-   Today’s announcement provides a tangible path forward with
    Switzerland that underscores the President’s dedication to bringing
    balanced, reciprocal trade with an important trading partner.
