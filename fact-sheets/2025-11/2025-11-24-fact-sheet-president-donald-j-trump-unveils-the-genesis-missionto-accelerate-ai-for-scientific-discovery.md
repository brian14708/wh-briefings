title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Unveils the Genesis Missionto Accelerate
  AI for Scientific Discovery'

**USHERING IN A NEW ERA OF DISCOVERY:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
signed an Executive Order launching the Genesis Mission, a new national
effort to use artificial intelligence (AI) to transform how scientific
research is conducted and accelerate the speed of scientific discovery.

-   The Genesis Mission charges the Secretary of Energy with leveraging
    our National Laboratories to unite America’s brightest minds, most
    powerful computers, and vast scientific data into one cooperative
    system for research.
-   The Order directs the Department of Energy to create a closed-loop
    AI experimentation platform that integrates our Nation’s world-class
    supercomputers and unique data assets to generate scientific
    foundation models and power robotic laboratories.
-   The Order instructs the Assistant to the President for Science and
    Technology (APST) to coordinate the national initiative and the
    integration of data and infrastructure from across the Federal
    government.
-   The Secretary of Energy, APST, and the Special Advisor for AI &
    Crypto will collaborate with academia and private-sector innovators
    to support and enhance the Genesis Mission.
-   Priority areas of focus include the greatest scientific challenges
    of our time that can dramatically improve our Nation’s national,
    economic, and health security, including biotechnology, critical
    materials, nuclear fission and fusion energy, space exploration,
    quantum information science, and semiconductors and
    microelectronics.

**HARNESSING AI FOR OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT**:
With the Genesis Mission, the Trump Administration intends to
dramatically expand the productivity and impact of Federal research and
development within a decade.

-   Despite research budgets soaring since the 1990s, scientific
    progress has stalled—new drug approvals have declined, and more
    researchers are needed to achieve the same outputs.
-   Harnessing AI as a scientific tool will revolutionize the way
    scientific research is conducted.
    -   For example, AI technologies can generate models of protein
        structures and novel materials, design and analyze experiments,
        and aggregate and generate new data faster and more effectively.
        Research that once took years could now take weeks or months.
-   To do this, AI needs large amounts of organized and high-quality
    data and significant computing power. These datasets and computing
    technology already exist within DOE’s National Laboratories. With
    the Genesis Mission, the Trump Administration is bringing the power
    of AI to bear on our already expansive data infrastructure and
    creating a platform for multiple Federal research agencies and the
    private sector to collaborate to achieve breakthroughs currently
    thought impossible, and to win and stay ahead in the AI race.

**STRENGTHENING AMERICA’S AI DOMINANCE:** President Trump continues to
prioritize America’s global dominance in AI to usher in a new golden age
of human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security. 

-   In January, President Trump signed an Executive Order to reverse
    harmful Biden Administration AI policies and enhance America’s
    global AI dominance.
-   In April, President Trump signed an Executive Order to advance AI
    education for America’s youth.
-   In July, President Trump signed Executive Orders to prevent woke AI
    in the Federal government and promote the export of full-stack
    American AI technologies.
-   In July, President Trump issued America’s AI Action Plan, a policy
    agenda identifying nearly a hundred Federal actions to accelerate
    American AI innovation, build AI infrastructure at home, and lead in
    international diplomacy and security.
    -   The AI Action Plan includes recommended policies for investing
        in AI-enabled science, including the direction to build
        world-class data sets.
-   In September, the President signed an Executive Order on harnessing
    AI innovation to unlock cures for pediatric cancer, using the
    Childhood Cancer Data Initiative, which President Trump initially
    established in 2019 to collect, generate, and analyze childhood
    cancer data.
