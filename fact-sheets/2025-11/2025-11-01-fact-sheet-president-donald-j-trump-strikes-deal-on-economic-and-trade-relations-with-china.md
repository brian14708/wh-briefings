title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Strikes Deal on Economic and Trade Relations
  with China'
---
 
**REBALANCING TRADE WITH CHINA:** This week in the Republic of Korea,
President Donald J. Trump reached a trade and economic deal with
President Xi Jinping of China—a massive victory that safeguards U.S.
economic strength and national security while putting American workers,
farmers, and families first.

-   This historic agreement includes Chinese commitments to:
    -   Halt the flow of precursors used to make fentanyl into the
        United States.

    <!-- -->

    -   Effectively eliminate China’s current and proposed export
        controls on rare earth elements and other critical minerals.

    <!-- -->

    -   End Chinese retaliation against U.S. semiconductor manufacturers
        and other major U.S. companies.

    <!-- -->

    -   Open China’s market to U.S. soybeans and other agricultural
        exports. 

**CHINESE ACTIONS:**

-   China will suspend the global implementation of the expansive new
    export controls on rare earths and related measures that it
    announced on October 9, 2025. 
-   China will issue general licenses valid for exports of rare earths,
    gallium, germanium, antimony, and graphite for the benefit of U.S.
    end users and their suppliers around the world. The general license
    means the de facto removal of controls China imposed since 2023.
-   China will take significant measures to end the flow of fentanyl to
    the United States. Specifically, China will stop the shipment of
    certain designated chemicals to North America and strictly control
    exports of certain other chemicals to all destinations in the world.
-   China will suspend all of the retaliatory tariffs that it has
    announced since March 4, 2025.  This includes tariffs on a vast
    swath of U.S. agricultural products: chicken, wheat, corn, cotton,
    sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, aquatic products, fruits, vegetables,
    and dairy products.
-   China will suspend or remove all of the retaliatory non-tariff
    countermeasures taken against the United States since March 4, 2025,
    including China’s listing of certain American companies on its end
    user and unreliable entity lists.
-   China will purchase at least 12 million metric tons (MMT) of U.S.
    soybeans during the last two months of 2025 and also purchase at
    least 25 MMT of U.S. soybeans in each of 2026, 2027, and 2028. 
    Additionally, China will resume purchases of U.S. sorghum and
    hardwood and softwood logs.
-   China will take appropriate measures to ensure the resumption of
    trade from Nexperia’s facilities in China, allowing production of
    critical legacy chips to flow to the rest of the world.
-   China will remove measures it took in retaliation for the U.S.’s
    announcement of a Section 301 investigation on China’s Targeting the
    Maritime, Logistics, and Shipbuilding Sectors for Dominance, and
    remove sanctions imposed on various shipping entities.
-   China will further extend the expiration of its market-based tariff
    exclusion process for imports from the United States and exclusions
    will remain valid until December 31, 2026.
-   China will terminate its various investigations targeting U.S.
    companies in the semiconductor supply chain, including its
    antitrust, anti-monopoly, and anti-dumping  investigations.

**AMERICAN ACTIONS:**

-   The United States will lower the tariffs on Chinese imports imposed
    to curb fentanyl flows by removing 10 percentage points of the
    cumulative rate, effective November 10, 2025, and will maintain its
    suspension of heightened reciprocal tariffs on Chinese imports until
    November 10, 2026.  (The current 10% reciprocal tariff will remain
    in effect during this suspension period.)
-   The United States will further extend the expiration of certain
    Section 301 tariff exclusions, currently due to expire on November
    29, 2025, until November 10, 2026.
-   The United States will suspend for one year, starting on November
    10, 2025, the implementation of the interim final rule titled
    *Expansion of End-User Controls to Cover Affiliates of Certain
    Listed Entities*.
-   The United States will suspend for one year, starting on November
    10, 2025, implementation of the responsive actions taken pursuant to
    the Section 301 investigation on China’s Targeting the Maritime,
    Logistics, and Shipbuilding Sectors for Dominance.  In the meantime,
    the United States will negotiate with China pursuant to Section 301
    while continuing its historic cooperation with the Republic of Korea
    and Japan on revitalizing American shipbuilding.

**SECURING ANOTHER WIN FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE: **This trade and
economic deal caps President Trump’s successful trip to Asia, where he
delivered a series of historic wins for the American people.

-   In Malaysia, President Trump signed Agreements on Reciprocal Trade
    with Malaysia and Cambodia, and the United States announced joint
    frameworks for trade negotiations with Thailand and Vietnam. He also
    signed critical minerals cooperation agreements with Thailand and
    Malaysia.
-   In Japan, President Trump announced major projects advancing Japan’s
    previous $550 billion investment commitment to the United States to
    further revitalize the U.S. industrial base, signed a landmark
    critical minerals agreement with Japan, secured historic purchases
    of U.S. energy from Japan, and deepened U.S.-Japan cooperation to
    combat illegal drug trafficking.
-   In the Republic of Korea, the President secured billions in landmark
    commitments, including investments to support American jobs, further
    America’s energy dominance, promote American leadership in the
    technology revolution, and build the U.S.-Korea maritime
    partnership.
