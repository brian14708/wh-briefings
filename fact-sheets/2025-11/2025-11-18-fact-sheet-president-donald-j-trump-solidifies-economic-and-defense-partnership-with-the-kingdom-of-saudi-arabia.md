  with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia'
---
 
**STRENGTHENING OUR STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP:** Today, President Donald J.
Trump and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of the Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia (Saudi Arabia, or the Kingdom) finalized a series of landmark
agreements that deepen the U.S.-Saudi strategic partnership, expand
opportunities for high-paying American jobs, strengthen critical supply
chains, and reinforce regional stability—all while putting American
workers, industry, and security first.  

-   These agreements build directly on the President’s highly successful
    May visit to Riyadh and the $600 billion in Saudi investment
    commitments secured for the United States at that time.
-   In a major expansion of this partnership, the Crown Prince announced
    today that Saudi Arabia will be increasing their investment
    commitments in the United States to almost $1 trillion, reflecting
    deepening trust and momentum for the United States under President
    Trump’s leadership.
-   Key achievements include the Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement,
    advancements in critical minerals cooperation, and an AI Memorandum
    of Understanding—all of which underscore the United States’
    commitment to securing deals that directly benefit the American
    people.
-   These agreements demonstrate the Trump Administration’s “America
    First” approach, reinforcing the United States as a leader on the
    world stage while securing our economic future.

**ACHIEVING NUCLEAR ENERGY, CRITICAL MINERALS, AND TECHNOLOGY
DOMINANCE:** Through deals reached today with Saudi Arabia, President
Trump is positioning America as a leader in energy and advanced
technology while ensuring our supply chains remain resilient.

-   The United States and Saudi Arabia signed a Joint Declaration on the
    Completion of Negotiations on Civil Nuclear Energy Cooperation,
    which builds the legal foundation for a decades-long,
    multi-billion-dollar nuclear energy partnership with the Kingdom;
    confirms that the United States and American companies will be the
    Kingdom’s civil nuclear cooperation partners of choice; and ensures
    that all cooperation will be conducted in a manner consistent with
    strong nonproliferation standards.
-   The United States and Saudi Arabia also signed a Critical Minerals
    Framework, deepening collaboration and aligning our national
    strategies to diversify critical mineral supply chains. This
    agreement builds on similar deals President Trump secured with other
    trading partners to safeguard America’s supply chain resilience for
    essential minerals.
-   The United States and Saudi Arabia signed a landmark AI Memorandum
    of Understanding that gives the Kingdom access to world-leading
    American systems while protecting U.S. technology from foreign
    influence, ensuring that American innovators will shape the future
    of global AI.

**DEEPENING DEFENSE COOPERATION AND REGIONAL SECURITY:** President Trump
is advancing U.S. national security by forging agreements that enhance
regional deterrence, grow the American industrial base, and ensure that
partners like Saudi Arabia shoulder more responsibility for countering
shared threats.

-   President Trump and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman signed the
    U.S.-Saudi Strategic Defense Agreement (SDA), a historic agreement
    that strengthens our more than 80-year defense partnership and
    fortifies deterrence across the Middle East.
    -   The SDA is a win for the America First agenda, making it easier
        for U.S. defense firms to operate in Saudi Arabia, securing new
        burden-sharing funds from the Saudi Arabia to defray U.S. costs,
        and affirming that the Kingdom views the United States as its
        primary strategic partner.

-   The President secured agreements reinforcing America’s role as a
    regional security enabler, enhancing our U.S. military partnerships
    to better allow partners to deter and defeat threats.

<!-- -->

-   President Trump approved a major defense sale package, including
    future F-35 deliveries, which strengthens the U.S. defense
    industrial base and ensures Saudi Arabia continues to buy American.
-   The President secured an agreement for Saudi Arabia to purchase
    nearly 300 American tanks, enabling Saudi Arabia to build up its own
    defense capabilities and safeguarding hundreds of American jobs.

**DRIVING AMERICAN ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AND JOB CREATION:** President
Trump is unlocking unprecedented opportunities for U.S. businesses,
exporters, and workers by expanding market access, reducing barriers,
and channeling massive Saudi investments into American innovation and
infrastructure.

-   Saudi Arabia’s nearly $1 trillion investment commitment into U.S.
    infrastructure, technology, and industry—rising from the $600
    billion initially secured during the President’s May visit and now
    expanded this week—will flow directly into American communities.
-   The United States and Saudi Arabia have agreed to intensify their
    engagement in the coming weeks on trade issues of mutual interest,
    including in areas related to reducing non-tariff barriers,
    recognition of standards, and improving the investment environment. 
    -   A concrete example of this engagement includes the
        recently-signed agreement to ensure recognition by Saudi Arabia
        that motor vehicles and parts complying with U.S. Federal Motor
        Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) meet its motor vehicle safety
        requirements. 

    <!-- -->

    -   The United States and Saudi Arabia also reiterate the importance
        of the existing Trade and Investment Framework Agreement, and
        intend to use this mechanism for their intensified engagement to
        support the goal of facilitating bilateral trade.
-   The Treasury Department and Saudi Ministry of Finance signed
    agreements to enhance collaboration on capital markets technology,
    standards, and regulations, and deepen partnership in international
    financial institutions.
-   The United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia advanced new
    investment opportunities that will expand U.S. exports and reduce
    trade barriers—direct wins for American manufacturers.
-   Combined with the critical minerals, nuclear, AI, and defense
    initiatives announced today, these deals will create high-paying
    American jobs, boost U.S. technological leadership, and deliver
    massive returns for American workers and families for decades to
    come.
