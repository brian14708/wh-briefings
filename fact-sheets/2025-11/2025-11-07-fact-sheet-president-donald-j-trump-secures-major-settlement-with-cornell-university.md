  University'
---
 
**SECURING A HISTORIC SETTLEMENT WITH CORNELL UNIVERSITY:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump secured a historic settlement with Cornell
University to restore accountability and fairness in higher education.

-   The agreement ensures Cornell will comply with Federal civil rights
    laws and end any unlawful racial discrimination in admissions or
    university programming. Cornell will provide the Federal government
    access to all relevant data and information to rigorously assess
    compliance with its commitment to merit-based admissions.
-   Cornell will pay a $30 million penalty to the United States, payable
    in equal installments over three years.
-   Cornell will also invest $30 million in research programs that
    directly benefit U.S. farmers, payable in equal installments over
    three years.
-   Cornell will conduct annual campus climate surveys to ensure that
    Jewish students are safe and that anti-Semitism is being addressed.
-   The agreement reinstates all Federal grants to Cornell, restores
    Cornell’s eligibility for future grants and awards, and closes
    pending Title VI and Title IX investigations into the university.
    -   Title VII investigations related to allegations of
        discrimination in Cornell’s employment practices remain ongoing
        and are not addressed under this agreement.
-   Cornell’s president must certify quarterly, under penalty of
    perjury, that Cornell is in full compliance with all provisions of
    this agreement, including compliance with Title VI, Title IX, and
    other civil rights laws. Cornell agrees to use the Department of
    Justice’s July 2025 “Guidance for Recipients of Federal Funding
    Regarding Unlawful Discrimination” as a training resource for
    faculty and staff.

**ADDRESSING DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES AT CORNELL:** The Trump
Administration took action to address concerns about violations of
Federal civil rights laws, protecting students and upholding fairness in
higher education.

-   The settlement comes after public outcry over incidents at Cornell
    and civil rights investigations into Cornell’s alleged
    discrimination on the basis of race and national origin.
-   Cornell’s policies and practices—including alleged use of DEI
    rubrics in faculty hiring, racial identity-based scholarships, and
    alleged anti-Semitic discrimination in campus programs and
    policies—raised urgent concerns about equal opportunity and
    potential noncompliance with Federal law.
-   By securing this settlement, the Trump Administration is ensuring
    that Cornell upholds merit-based standards, complies with Federal
    law, and fosters an environment of academic excellence and safety
    for all students.

**ADVANCING REFORMS IN HIGHER EDUCATION:** President Trump is holding
elite universities accountable, ensuring they prioritize fairness,
merit, and American values.  

-   The Administration has challenged elite universities like Harvard,
    Columbia, Brown, and Cornell for discriminating against students and
    staff, failing to protect students from violent anti-Semitism, and
    otherwise failing to be a responsible steward of taxpayer dollars.
-   The Administration successfully negotiated a resolution with the
    University of Pennsylvania to keep men out of women’s sports and
    restore the trophies and records of women.
-   President Trump secured a more than $200 million settlement with
    Columbia University and a $50 million settlement with Brown
    University to resolve claims related to discriminatory practices,
    marking significant wins for accountability in academia.
