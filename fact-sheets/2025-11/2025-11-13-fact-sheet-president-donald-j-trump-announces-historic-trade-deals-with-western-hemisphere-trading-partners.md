  Western Hemisphere Trading Partners'
---
 
**DELIVERING ON RECIPROCAL TRADE:** Today, President Donald J. Trump
announced breakthrough trade deals with El Salvador, Argentina, Ecuador,
and Guatemala, allowing greater and more streamlined market access in
some of America’s most critical strategic partners in the Western
Hemisphere.

-   These deals secure commitments on economic and national security
    issues to strengthen supply chains and trade partnerships in the
    region, deepening bilateral trade and investment cooperation to
    provide American exporters with unprecedented access to markets in
    Central and South America.
-   The deals will help U.S. farmers, ranchers, fishermen, small
    businesses, and manufacturers to increase U.S. exports to and expand
    business opportunities with these trading partners.
-   Today’s announcements underscore the Administration’s unwavering
    commitment to fair and balanced trade at every opportunity to
    protect and strengthen our economic and national security.

Statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/11/joint-statement-on-framework-for-united-states-el-salvador-agreement-on-reciprocal-trade/)
with **El Salvador** include:

-   El Salvador has committed to addressing a range of non-tariff
    barriers, including by streamlining regulatory requirements and
    approvals for U.S. exports, such as accepting vehicles and
    automotive parts built to U.S. motor vehicle safety and emissions
    standards and accepting FDA certificates and prior marketing
    authorizations for medical devices and pharmaceuticals.
-   El Salvador will also break down non-tariff barriers for U.S.
    agricultural products in its market, including ensuring that U.S.
    agricultural exporters will not be restricted due to the mere use of
    certain cheese and meat terms.

with **Argentina** include:

-   Argentina will provide preferential market access for U.S. goods
    exports, including certain medicines, chemicals, machinery,
    information technology products, medical devices, motor vehicles,
    and a wide range of agricultural products.
-   Argentina has also committed to addressing structural challenges
    cited in the Office of the United States Trade Representative’s 2025
    Special 301 report, including patentability criteria, patent
    backlog, and geographical indications, as well as to working towards
    aligning its intellectual property regime with international
    standards.

with **Guatemala** include:

-   Guatemala has committed to facilitating digital trade, including by
    refraining from imposing digital services taxes or other measures
    that discriminate against U.S. digital services or U.S. products
    distributed digitally, ensuring the free transfer of data across
    trusted borders, and supporting a permanent multilateral moratorium
    on customs duties on electronic transmissions at the World Trade
    Organization (WTO).
-   Guatemala has committed to protect internationally recognized labor
    rights. In furtherance of this commitment, Guatemala will prohibit
    the importation of goods produced by forced or compulsory labor and
    strengthen its labor laws and their enforcement.

Key terms of the [Joint
Statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/11/joint-statement-on-framework-for-united-states-ecuador-agreement-on-reciprocal-trade/)
with **Ecuador** include:

-   Ecuador has committed to adopt and maintain high levels of
    environmental protection, take measures to improve forest sector
    governance and combat illegal logging, and fully implement the
    obligations of the WTO *Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies*.
-   Ecuador will remove or decrease a range of tariff barriers across
    key goods sectors, including tree nuts, fresh fruit, pulses, wheat,
    wine, and distilled spirits, and fully eliminate a variable tariff
    on many agricultural products it had imposed through the Andean
    Price Band System. These actions will create commercially meaningful
    market access opportunities for U.S. exports, supporting
    high-quality American jobs.

**THE PROSPEROUS PATH FORWARD:** Today’s momentous trade deals reinforce
America’s aligned trade relationships with these allies while fostering
more reciprocal conditions that prioritize American workers and
industries, protecting U.S. national security, and strengthening supply
chains in the Western Hemisphere.

-   In the coming weeks, the United States and El Salvador, Argentina,
    Ecuador, and Guatemala will work expeditiously to finalize the
    Agreements for signature.
-   The United States will also give Most Favored Nation (MFN)-tariff
    treatment for certain originating goods from these countries that
    cannot be grown, mined, or naturally produced in the United States
    in sufficient quantities.
-   For El Salvador and Guatemala, the United States will also remove
    the reciprocal tariffs from certain products, such as textiles and
    apparel products, originating under the Dominican Republic-Central
    America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA). This will be a boon for
    U.S. textile production and El Salvador’s and Guatemala’s economic
    growth, and will strengthen the resilience of textile and apparel
    supply chains.

**LIBERATING AMERICA FROM UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES:**  President Trump has
challenged the assumption that American workers and businesses must
tolerate unfair trade practices that have disadvantaged them for decades
and contributed to our historic global trade deficit.

-   On April 2, President Trump declared a national emergency in
    response to the large and persistent U.S. goods trade deficit caused
    by a lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships,
    unfair tariff and non-tariff barriers, and U.S. trading partners’
    economic policies that suppress domestic wages and consumption.
-   President Trump continues to advance the interests of the American
    people and our agricultural sector by removing tariff and non-tariff
    barriers and expanding market access for American exporters.
-   Most recently, President Trump delivered a series of historic wins
    for the American people during his successful trip to Asia, signing
    Agreements on Reciprocal Trade with Malaysia and Cambodia, securing
    investments in Japan and Korea, and announcing joint frameworks for
    trade negotiations with Thailand and Vietnam.
-   Today’s announcement shows that America can defend its domestic
    production while obtaining expansive market access with our trading
    partners.
