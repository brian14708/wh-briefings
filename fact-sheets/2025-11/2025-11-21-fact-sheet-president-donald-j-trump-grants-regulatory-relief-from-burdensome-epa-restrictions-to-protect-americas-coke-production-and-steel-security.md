title: "Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Grants Regulatory Relief from Burdensome\
  \ EPA Restrictions to Protect America\u2019s Coke Production and Steel Security"
---
 
**PROVIDING REGULATORY RELIEF:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed
a Proclamation granting two years of regulatory relief from a stringent
Biden-Era EPA rule on coke oven facilities—a sector vital to America’s
steelmaking capacity, national security, and industrial strength.

-   The Proclamation allows the facilities listed in the Proclamation to
    comply with the EPA standards that were in place before the Biden
    Administration rulemakings for two years.
-   This exemption ensures that critical coke production assets can
    continue to operate uninterrupted to support national security
    without incurring substantial costs to comply with unattainable
    compliance requirements.

**REDUCING BURDENSOME RESTRICTIONS:** President Trump recognizes that
America’s domestic steel supply chain—powered by metallurgical coke—is
indispensable to national security and economic prosperity.  

-   Approximately 70% of all steel production relies on metallurgical
    coke used in blast furnaces to smelt iron ore for critical
    industries and defense applications.
-   The Biden-era emissions standard imposes costly and unattainable
    compliance requirements on coke ovens, as the technologies necessary
    to comply do not yet exist in commercially viable or cost-effective
    forms.
-   Facilities would be forced to engineer and deploy novel systems on
    unrealistic timelines, risking closures, production shutdowns, job
    losses, and long-term damage to America’s steel industrial base.
-   Without this relief, the United States would face weakened steel
    capacity, increased reliance on foreign adversaries for critical
    metals, reduced military readiness, and threats to construction,
    infrastructure, transportation, and manufacturing sectors.

**BALANCING ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS WITH AMERICAN PROSPERITY:**
President Trump has consistently prioritized a pragmatic approach,
ensuring environmental policies support, rather than undermine,
America’s economic strength and national security.

-   President Trump has sought to protect American industries while
    maintaining standards that allow Americans to have among the
    cleanest air and water in the world.
-   He directed the EPA to repeal the Obama-era Clean Power Plan during
    his first term, replacing it with the Affordable Clean Energy rule
    in 2019 that set achievable standards to preserve jobs while
    addressing emissions.
-   He paused the expansion of windmills, recognizing their detrimental
    environmental impact, particularly on wildlife, often outweighs
    their benefits.
-   He has championed an energy dominance strategy, boosting domestic
    oil and gas production to reduce reliance on foreign energy while
    maintaining practical environmental oversight.
-   He granted two years of similar regulatory relief from stringent
    Biden-era regulations that impacted other sectors vital to national
    security, including copper smelting, coal plants, taconite iron ore
    processing facilities, and certain chemical manufacturers that
    produce chemicals related to semiconductors, medical device
    sterilization, advanced manufacturing, and national defense systems.
-   Using Section 232 authorities, he imposed a 50% tariff on steel
    imports to counter national security threats from foreign
    overproduction and bolster domestic steel production.
-   His approach encourages industry to develop cost-effective solutions
    like improved emissions technologies rather than imposing unfeasible
    mandates that risk economic disruption.
