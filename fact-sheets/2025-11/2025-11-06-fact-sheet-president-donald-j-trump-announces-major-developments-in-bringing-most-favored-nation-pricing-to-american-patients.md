title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Announces Major Developments in Bringing
  Most-Favored-Nation Pricing to American Patients'
---
 
**ADVANCING MOST-FAVORED-NATION (MFN) PRICING:** Today, President Donald
J. Trump announced the latest in a series of the most significant
actions ever taken by our Federal government to lower prescription drug
prices, unveiling agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers Eli Lilly
and Company and Novo Nordisk to dramatically reduce the prices Americans
pay for some of the world’s most popular drugs.

-   The agreement represents a historic reduction in prices for
    Americans on the two drugs with the highest annual expenditures in
    the United States, both of which help adults struggling with
    diabetes, heart disease (Ozempic and Wegovy only), obesity, and
    other conditions.
    -   The prices of Ozempic and Wegovy will fall from $1,000 and
        $1,350 per month, respectively, to $350 when purchased through
        *TrumpRx*.

    <!-- -->

    -   The price of Zepbound and Orforglipron, if approved, will fall
        from $1,086 per month to an average of $346 when purchased
        through *TrumpRx*.

    <!-- -->

    -   In the event that the FDA later approves the Wegovy pill, or
        certain similar “GLP-1” drugs in each company’s pipeline
        intended to be taken orally rather than as a shot, the initial
        dose of those drugs will be priced at $150 per month through
        *TrumpRx*.
-   The historic reduction in prices negotiated by President Trump will
    enable Medicare and Medicaid to cover obesity drugs for adults at a
    dramatically lower cost to taxpayers than that proposed by the Biden
    Administration.
    -   The Medicare prices of Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound
        will be $245, less than half the prices proposed by the Biden
        Administration on such drugs. State Medicaid programs will also
        have access to these medications at these prices.

    <!-- -->

    -   These low prices will enable Medicare to cover Wegovy and
        Zepbound for patients with obesity and related comorbidities for
        the first time.

    <!-- -->

    -   Medicare beneficiaries will pay a co-pay of just $50 per month.
-   Additionally, the agreement provides for reduced costs on other Eli
    Lilly and Novo Nordisk medicines when purchased through *TrumpRx*.
    For example:
    -   Eli Lilly will provide Emgality, a treatment for migraines, at
        $299 per pen, a discount of $443 off of the list price.

    <!-- -->

    -   Eli Lilly will provide Trulicity, a commonly used diabetes
        medicine, at $389 per month, a discount of $598 off of the list
        price.

    <!-- -->

    -   Novo Nordisk will provide widely-used insulin products,
        including NovoLog and Tresiba, at $35 per month of supply.
-   The agreement also provides that Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk will
    guarantee MFN prices on all new medicines that they bring to market,
    repatriate increased foreign revenue on existing products, and
    provide every State Medicaid program in the country access to MFN
    drug prices on their products.

**INVESTING IN AMERICA TO SECURE PHARMACEUTICAL SUPPLY CHAINS:** Eli
Lilly and Novo Nordisk are also announcing large investments to expand
U.S. manufacturing capacity.

-   Novo Nordisk has committed an additional $10 billion investment to
    strengthen its domestic footprint, including producing the Wegovy
    tablet, if approved, end-to-end in the U.S.
-   Under President Trump’s leadership, Eli Lilly has announced at least
    $27 billion in new U.S. manufacturing investments.

**MAKING AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN:** President Trump promised to ensure the
American healthcare system is promoting health and addressing the root
causes of chronic disease. Today’s announcements represent historic
progress on meeting this promise.

-   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate the
    prevalence of obesity among American adults to be 40%.
-   Obesity is one of the key drivers of chronic disease, increasing the
    risk of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, strokes, and
    certain cancers, among other conditions.
-   Today’s announcement makes available potentially life-changing
    medications to adults struggling with obesity, representing a
    historic opportunity to reverse the obesity epidemic and associated
    chronic disease crisis when coupled with lifestyle changes to
    preserve and improve health gains long-term.
-   The Administration remains committed to a comprehensive Make America
    Healthy Again approach that realigns incentives, fosters
    private-sector collaboration, increases public awareness of the
    importance of diet and exercise, and advances critical research.

**ENDING GLOBAL FREELOADING ON AMERICAN PHARMACEUTICAL
INNOVATION:  **President Trump is taking decisive action to rebalance a
system that has allowed pharmaceutical manufacturers to offer low prices
to other wealthy nations while charging Americans significantly higher
prices. 

-   According to recent data, the prices Americans pay for brand-name
    drugs are more than three times the price other Organization for
    Economic Cooperation and Development nations pay, even after
    accounting for discounts manufacturers provide in the U.S.
-   The United States has less than five percent of the world’s
    population, yet roughly 75% of global pharmaceutical profits come
    from American taxpayers.
-   Drug manufacturers benefit from generous research subsidies and
    enormous healthcare spending by the U.S. Government. Instead of
    passing that benefit through to American consumers, drug
    manufacturers then discount their products abroad to gain access to
    foreign markets and subsidize those discounts through high prices
    charged in America. Americans are subsidizing drug-manufacturer
    profits and foreign health systems, both in development and once the
    drugs are sold.

**DELIVERING ON PROMISES TO PUT AMERICAN PATIENTS FIRST:** President
Trump is delivering on promises for American patients that the political
establishment did not believe were possible.

-   On May 12, 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order titled:
    “Delivering Most-Favored-Nation Prescription Drug Pricing to
    American Patients” directing the Administration to take numerous
    actions to bring American drug prices in line with those paid by
    similar nations.
-   On July 31, 2025, President Trump sent letters to leading
    pharmaceutical manufacturers outlining the steps they must take to
    bring down the prices of prescription drugs in the United States to
    match the lowest price offered in other developed nations.
-   Since September 30, 2025, President Trump has announced five deals
    with major pharmaceutical manufacturers to bring prices in line with
    those paid in other developed nations, which will provide
    substantial price relief on numerous products taken by millions of
    Americans.
-   President Trump has been relentless in his effort to address the
    unfair and outrageous prices Americans pay for prescription drugs:
    -   President Trump: “In case after case, our citizens pay massively
        higher prices than other nations pay for the same exact pill,
        from the same factory, effectively subsidizing socialism abroad
        with skyrocketing prices at home. So we would spend tremendous
        amounts of money in order to provide inexpensive drugs to
        another country. And when I say the price is different, you can
        see some examples where the price is beyond anything — four
        times, five times different.”
