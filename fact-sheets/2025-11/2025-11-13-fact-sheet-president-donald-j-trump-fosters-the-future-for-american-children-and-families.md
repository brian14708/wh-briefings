title: 'Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Fosters the Future for American Children
  and Families'
---
 
**FOSTERING THE FUTURE FOR AMERICAN CHILDREN AND FAMILIES:** Today,
President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to modernize
America’s foster care system and empower young Americans transitioning
out of foster care with greater tools, resources, and opportunities to
promote lifelong independence and success. This Executive Order
represents a major milestone that will have lasting impact on the lives
of children and families across the Nation.

-   The Order launches the “Fostering the Future” initiative, led by
    First Lady Melania Trump, to enhance the quality of Federal
    resources and capabilities while developing public- and
    private-sector partnerships that expand educational, employment, and
    mentorship opportunities for youth transitioning from foster care to
    adulthood.
-   It establishes an online “Fostering the Future” platform to connect
    youth to critical resources and build personalized plans to support
    their education, housing, career development, and pathway toward
    independence.
-   It sets forth a strategy to reallocate underutilized Federal funds
    to promote educational success, career advancement, financial
    literacy, and self-sufficiency for individuals transitioning out of
    foster care.
-   The Order increases flexibility in Education and Training Vouchers
    for short-term, career-focused programs and facilitates tax-credit
    scholarships for foster children.
-   It strengthens partnerships with faith-based organizations and
    houses of worship and directs action to stop discrimination based on
    religious beliefs, ensuring every qualified person is able to serve
    families and children in need.
-   The Order directs that the Secretary of Health and Human Services
    update regulations and improve State-level child-welfare data
    collection, transparency, and publication to strengthen positive
    outcomes for children and families.
-   It promotes the modernization of State child-welfare information
    systems and the use of AI-powered tools to improve caregiver
    recruitment, retention, and child matching.
-   The Order requires an annual scorecard to evaluate State performance
    in reducing unnecessary foster care entries, shortening
    investigation times, reducing child injuries and placement
    disruptions, and accelerating permanent family care placements.

**MODERNIZING THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM:** President Trump and First Lady
Melania Trump are ensuring our Nation’s foster care system harnesses the
unparalleled generosity and resources available across our Nation to
serve every child.

-   Today, too many children who age out of foster care face starkly
    inadequate long-term socioeconomic outcomes, leaving them
    disproportionately behind in building stable, prosperous lives.
-   Many young people transitioning out of foster care lack access to
    stable housing, mentorship, and workforce opportunities—challenges
    the “Fostering the Future” initiative directly addresses through
    public- and private-sector collaboration.
-   Without the strong support systems and quality mentorship this
    Executive Order will bring, youth aging out of foster care often
    face steeper paths to success: only about half complete high school,
    fewer than 5% earn a four-year college degree, roughly one in five
    experience homelessness upon leaving care, and just half are
    gainfully employed by age 24.
-   Caseworkers are often overburdened, and child-welfare systems rely
    on outdated technology that hinder effective outcomes.
-   Some jurisdictions and organizations maintain policies that prohibit
    qualified families from fostering or adopting due to sincerely-held
    religious beliefs or adherence to basic biological truth.

**SUPPORTING CHILDREN:** The Trump Administration has been a champion of
policies that empower families, faith-based organizations, and
communities to support children in need.

-   During President Trump’s first term, the First Lady launched BE BEST
    to focus on the social, emotional, and physical health of children,
    and she continues to use this platform to highlight the people and
    programs dedicated to ensuring a better future for the next
    generation.
-   The First Lady championed passage of the TAKE IT DOWN Act within the
    first 100 days of the second Trump term, which provides protections
    for children from online exploitation.
-   President Trump’s Working Families Tax Cuts increased access to the
    Adoption Tax Credit, increased and made permanent the Child Tax
    Credit, and established Trump Accounts for newborns to give the next
    generation a jump start on saving. 
-   The Trump Administration is expanding educational freedom and
    opportunity for families and returning power over education to
    parents and communities.
-   President Trump is modernizing America’s workforce programs to
    replace the failed “college for all” model with career-focused
    training that meets the real needs of today’s youth.
