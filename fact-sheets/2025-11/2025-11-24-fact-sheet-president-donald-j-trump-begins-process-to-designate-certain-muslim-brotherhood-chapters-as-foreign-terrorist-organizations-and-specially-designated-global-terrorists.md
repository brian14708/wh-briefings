  Muslim Brotherhood Chapters as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated
  Global Terrorists'

**SECURING AMERICA FROM EXTRAORDINARY THREATS:** Today, President Donald
J. Trump signed an Executive Order directing the Secretary of State and
the Secretary of the Treasury to consider whether certain chapters of
the Muslim Brotherhood should be designated as Foreign Terrorist
Organizations (FTOs) and Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs).

-   The Order directs the two aforementioned Secretaries, in
    consultation with the Attorney General and the Director of National
    Intelligence, to submit a report on whether to designate any Muslim
    Brotherhood chapters, such as those in Lebanon, Egypt, and Jordan,
    as FTOs under 8 U.S.C. 1189 and SDGTs under with 50 U.S.C. 1702 and
    Executive Order 13224.
-   It mandates the Secretary of State and Secretary of Treasury take
    action within 45 days after the report to designate chapters as FTOs
    and SDGTs if appropriate.
-   The Order’s ultimate aim is to eliminate the designated chapters’
    capabilities and operations, deprive them of resources, and end any
    threat such chapters pose to U.S. nationals and the national
    security of the United States.

**COUNTERING TERRORIST THREATS:** President Trump is confronting the
Muslim Brotherhood’s transnational network, which fuels terrorism and
destabilization campaigns against U.S. interests and allies in the
Middle East.

-   In the aftermath of the October 7, 2023, attack, the military wing
    of the Lebanese chapter of the Muslim Brotherhood helped terror
    groups launch multiple rocket attacks against both civilian and
    military targets within Israel.
-   A senior Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood leader encouraged violent
    attacks against U.S. partners and equities in the Middle East on the
    same day that Hamas perpetrated the October 7 attack.
-   Reports indicate Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood leaders have long
    provided material support to the militant wing of Hamas.

**SAFEGUARDING AMERICAN SECURITY AND DEFENDING U.S. INTERESTS ABROAD:**
President Trump continues to prioritize robust counterterrorism measures
to protect Americans and strengthen national security against foreign
threats, while promoting peace and stability around the world.

-   In January, President Trump initiated the process to designate Ansar
    Allah, also known as the Houthis, as an FTO to ensure the safety and
    stability of our closest regional partners in the Middle East.
-   In February, President Trump’s State Department designated eight
    cartels as FTOs and SDGTs, including Tren de Aragua and MS-13, to
    combat their violence and drug trafficking.
    -   This Administration has deported hundreds of terrorist gang
        members, and will never allow foreign terrorist enemies to
        operate on American soil and endanger our people.
-   In June, President Trump signed a Proclamation to restrict the entry
    of non-immigrants from countries with a history of terrorism or
    other lawlessness.
-   President Trump has repeatedly ordered lethal strikes against
    narcoterrorists to stop drugs from flooding into our country.
-   With today’s Order, President Trump is once again taking steps to
    preserve international peace and stability and keep America safe.
