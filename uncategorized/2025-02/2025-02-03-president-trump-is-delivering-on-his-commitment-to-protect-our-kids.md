title: President Trump is Delivering on His Commitment to Protect our Kids
---
 
Last week, President Donald J. Trump [took executive
action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/) to
protect American children from irreversible chemical and surgical
mutilation.  
  
**It’s already having its intended effect — preventing children from
being maimed and sterilized by adults perpetuating a radical, false
claim that they can somehow change a child’s sex. **Hospitals around the
country are taking action to downsize or eliminate their so-called
“gender-affirming care” programs:

-   **NEW YORK: **NYU Langone Health
    has [started](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/nyregion/nyu-langone-hospital-trans-care-youth.html) canceling
    appointments for so-called “gender-affirming care” involving minors.
    They canceled appointments for “two 12-year-olds who had been
    scheduled to receive implants that dispense puberty-blocking
    medication.”
-   **COLORADO: **Denver
    Health [announced](https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/hospitals-pause-gender-affirming-care-trump-transgender-order-rcna190164) it
    would stop performing sex change surgeries on minor children, while
    UCHealth [said](https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/local-politics/denver-health-pauses-gender-affirming-surgeries-minors-federal-funding/73-e61f598b-e32d-474e-94b4-4b11d4c5c8af) it
    is ending so-called “gender-affirming care” for all minors.
-   **VIRGINIA:** VCU Health and Children’s Hospital of Richmond
    have [“suspended”](https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/hospitals-pause-gender-affirming-care-trump-transgender-order-rcna190164) providing
    transgender-related medication and surgeries for minors, while UVA
    Health
    has [“suspended”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/01/31/trans-children-trump-hormones-healthcare/) all
    transgender-related services for minors.
-   **WASHINGTON, D.C.: **Children’s National Hospital
    has [“paused”](https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/hospitals-pause-gender-affirming-care-trump-transgender-order-rcna190164) prescribing
    puberty blockers and hormone therapies for minors, while Northwest
    Washington Hospital has [done the
    same](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/01/31/trans-children-trump-hormones-healthcare/).
-   **ILLINOIS: **Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago
    is [“reviewing”](https://fox59.com/news/health/ap-health/ap-some-hospitals-pause-gender-affirming-care-to-evaluate-trumps-executive-order/) their
    transgender-related services for minors.
-   **PENNSYLVANIA: **Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia is [“closely
    reviewing”](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/legal-regulatory-issues/hospitals-halt-gender-care-for-minors-following-executive-order.html) the
    transgender-related services they provide for minors.

President Trump will always protect American children.  
  
**Promises made, promises kept – again.**
