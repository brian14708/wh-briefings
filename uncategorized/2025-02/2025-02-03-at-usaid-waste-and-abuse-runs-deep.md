title: At USAID, Waste and Abuse Runs Deep
---
 
For decades, the United States Agency for International Development
(USAID) has been unaccountable to taxpayers as it funnels massive sums
of money to the ridiculous — and, in many cases, malicious — pet
projects of entrenched bureaucrats, with next-to-no oversight.  
  
**Here are only a few examples of the WASTE and ABUSE:**

-   [$1.5
    million](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14344255/trump-millions-dei-foreign-aid-programs-funding.html) to
    “advance diversity equity and inclusion in Serbia’s workplaces and
    business communities”
-   [$70,000](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14344255/trump-millions-dei-foreign-aid-programs-funding.html) for
    production of a “DEI musical” in Ireland
-   [$2.5
    million](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14344255/trump-millions-dei-foreign-aid-programs-funding.html) for
    electric vehicles for Vietnam
-   [$47,000](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14344255/trump-millions-dei-foreign-aid-programs-funding.html) for
    a “transgender opera” in Colombia
-   [$32,000](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14344255/trump-millions-dei-foreign-aid-programs-funding.html) for
    a “transgender comic book” in Peru
-   [$2
    million](https://dailycaller.com/2024/09/19/feds-dump-millions-in-one-latin-american-country-to-fund-sex-changes-lgbt-activism/) for
    sex changes and “LGBT activism” in Guatemala
-   [$6
    million](https://2017-2020.usaid.gov/egypt/press-releases/dec-16-2019-united-states-commits-6-million-bilateral-assistance-egypt) to
    fund tourism in Egypt
-   [Hundreds of thousands of
    dollars](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/foreign-policy/2865305/usaid-watchdog-tax-dollars-terrorism-tied-ngo-biden-sent-more-cash/) for
    a non-profit linked to designated terrorist organizations — even
    AFTER an inspector general launched an investigation
-   [Millions](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/486983/usaid-wont-give-details-on-4-67-million-grant-to-wuhan-lab-collaborator-ecohealth-alliance/) to
    EcoHealth Alliance — which was involved in research at the Wuhan lab
-   [“Hundreds of thousands of meals that went to al Qaeda-affiliated
    fighters in
    Syria”](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/nov/22/usaid-paid-meals-went-syrian-terrorists/)
-   [Funding](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/pharme3d-backed-by-usaid-to-3d-print-less-intrusive-contraceptives-for-women-206073/) to
    print “personalized” contraceptives birth control devices in
    developing countries
-   [Hundreds of millions of
    dollars](https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2018/06/21/feds-u-s-taxpayer-funds-helping-irrigate-fertilize-afghan-opium-funding-taliban/) to
    fund “irrigation canals, farming equipment, and even fertilizer used
    to support the unprecedented poppy cultivation and heroin production
    in Afghanistan,” benefiting the Taliban

**The list literally goes on and on — and it has all been happening for
decades.**  
  
Under President Trump, the waste, fraud, and abuse ENDS NOW.
