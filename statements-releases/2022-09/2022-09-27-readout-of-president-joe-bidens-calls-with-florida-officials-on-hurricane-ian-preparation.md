President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. held separate calls today with Mayor Jane
Castor of Tampa, Mayor Ken Welch of St. Petersburg, and Mayor Frank
Hibbard of Clearwater to discuss preparations for the potential impacts
from Hurricane Ian. Hurricane Ian is expected to make landfall on the
Gulf Coast of Florida as a Major Hurricane as soon as Thursday morning.
The President spoke with the Mayors about the potential impacts of Ian
and ongoing efforts Federal, State and local governments are taking to
pre-position resources and continue to initiate evacuation operations,
including the resources made available through the Federal Emergency
Declaration President Biden approved over the weekend. President Biden
said that he has directed FEMA Administrator Criswell to ensure that all
available federal support is surged to prepare in advance and to respond
in the aftermath of the storm to augment state and local emergency
response efforts, and emphasized the importance of encouraging families
to heed evacuation orders.
