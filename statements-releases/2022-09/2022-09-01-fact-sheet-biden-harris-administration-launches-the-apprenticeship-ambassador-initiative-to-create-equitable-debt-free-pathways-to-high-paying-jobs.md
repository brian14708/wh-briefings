title: "FACT SHEET:  \_Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Launches the Apprenticeship\
  \ Ambassador Initiative to Create Equitable, Debt-Free Pathways to High-Paying Jobs"
---
 
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing the launch of the
[Apprenticeship Ambassador
Initiative](https://www.apprenticeship.gov/apprenticeship-ambassador-initiative),
a national network of [more than
200](https://www.apprenticeship.gov/apprenticeship-ambassador-initiative/apprenticeship-ambassadors)
employers and industry organizations, labor organizations, educators,
workforce intermediaries, and community-based organizations who are
committed to strengthening and diversifying Registered Apprenticeship.
Registered Apprenticeship is a high-quality, debt-free, equitable “earn
and learn” model with a nationally recognized credential system that
helps employers hire a more demographically diverse workforce and
provides workers with on-the-job learning experience, job-related
instruction with a mentor, and a clear pathway to a good-paying job.
First Lady Jill Biden, Secretary Marty Walsh, and Secretary Gina
Raimondo are hosting a discussion at the White House today with leaders
of the Initiative.  
  
The Apprenticeship Ambassadors have existing Registered Apprenticeship
programs in over 40 in-demand industries and have committed to expand
and diversify these programs over the next year by collectively:
**developing 460 new Registered Apprenticeship programs across their 40
industries, hiring over 10,000 new apprentices, and holding 5,000
outreach, promotional, and training events to help other business,
labor, and education leaders launch similar programs.** Ambassadors will
also use their expertise to scale innovative practices and increase
access to Registered Apprenticeship for underserved populations,
including women, youth, people of color, rural communities, people with
arrest or conviction records, and people with disabilities.  
  
This new Initiative builds on President Biden’s efforts to expand
Registered Apprenticeships, which include investing hundreds of millions
of dollars in Registered Apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeships and
launching an Apprenticeship Accelerator that speeds up the time it takes
to get approval to start a new program from months to days. The
Administration’s efforts have already helped develop over 4,000 new
Registered Apprenticeship programs, add 6,700 new employer partners
participating in Registered Apprenticeship programs, and led to **the
hiring of more than one million apprentices**.

The Apprenticeship Ambassador Initiative will have long-lasting and
mutually beneficial economic benefits for both workers and employers.
About [93
percent](https://www.apprenticeship.gov/employers/explore-apprenticeship)
of workers who complete Registered Apprenticeships gain employment and
earn an annual average starting wage of $77,000. Registered
Apprenticeships also help employers attract, train, and retain a
[skilled and diverse
workforce](https://www.brookings.edu/research/desegregating-work-and-learning/)
and reap a
[$1.47](https://cupdf.com/document/it-pays-to-hire-an-apprentice-nova-scotia-a-sites-a-default-a-files-a.html?page=1#tabSectionPart)
return for every dollar spent on Registered Apprenticeships. The
Initiative will help to ensure there is a skilled, diverse workforce to
implement the President’s economic agenda – including tackling the
supply chain challenge and filling new clean energy jobs created by the
Inflation Reduction Act, manufacturing and technology jobs created by
the CHIPS and Science Act, infrastructure jobs created by the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, and roles in other high-demand sectors like health
care and cybersecurity.  
  
For example, through the Initiative:

-   IBM has committed to invest $250 million globally in Registered
    Apprenticeship and other training programs by 2025. IBM has also
    committed to share its Apprenticeship Playbook with other employers
    and partner with national coalitions to advocate for skills-based
    hiring practices. Already, IBM expanded its Registered
    Apprenticeship programs to more than 30 roles with more than 900
    apprentices in cybersecurity, software development, data science,
    and design – some of which have earned recognition from the American
    Council on Education for college credits.  
-   Siemens, which leverages its apprenticeship program to develop
    talent for roles in advanced manufacturing and engineering, recently
    launched an Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Registered Apprenticeship
    program at its manufacturing hub in North Carolina, Created in
    partnership with Wake Technical Community College, this new program
    will help high school students earn credits towards an associate
    degree while receiving hands-on training, supporting the [Biden
    Administration’s Talent Pipeline
    Challenge](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/17/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administration-launches-the-talent-pipeline-challenge-supporting-employer-investments-in-equitable-workforce-development-for-infrastructure-jobs/).
    Siemens also committed to expand its apprenticeship program and the
    number of apprentices hired in EV charging infrastructure, advanced
    manufacturing, and supply chain.  
-   Yellow Corporation committed to developing new dockworker and truck
    mechanic Registered Apprenticeship programs and launching
    initiatives to determine ways its Registered Apprenticeship Driving
    Academies can introduce more women and people of color to truck
    driving careers. This builds on their establishment of 20 Registered
    Apprenticeship Driving Academies over the past two years, in
    partnership with Teamsters, and their commitment to hire 1,000 truck
    driver apprentices in 2022 as part of the [Biden Administration’s
    Trucking
    Challenge](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/04/fact-sheet-the-biden-administrations-unprecedented-actions-to-expand-and-improve-trucking-jobs/).  
-   The North American Building Trades Union (NABTU), which has 1,900
    training centers across the country, committed to training 250,000
    new apprentices over the next five years. It recently launched
    TradesFuture, a nonprofit organization that is piloting two programs
    offering child care to apprentices in New York City and Wisconsin –
    with the goal of assisting women, veterans, and people of color
    establish and maintain careers in the construction industry. This
    builds on NABTU’s efforts to expand apprenticeship readiness
    (sometimes called pre-apprenticeship) programs. Over the last five
    years, 12,000 people, including 78% people of color have graduated
    from these programs.  
-   Trident Technical College, which serves as a Registered
    Apprenticeship program sponsor for over 70 active employers as the
    education provider and intermediary for the program, plans to expand
    to 400 apprentices across 10 industry sectors in the next year.
    Trident committed to working with more local employers, K-12
    partners, and community organizers and develop new Registered
    Apprenticeship programs in mechatronics, transportation, and
    education. As a partner in New America’s Partnership to Advance
    Youth Apprenticeship (PAYA) Initiative, Trident is committed to
    offering its technical training curriculum to communities across the
    country so they can rapidly adopt Registered Apprenticeships.  
-   Focus: HOPE, a Detroit-based nonprofit, committed to expand its
    Registered Apprenticeship programs to serve 300 apprentices in
    advanced manufacturing and cybersecurity occupations. Focus: HOPE
    also recently launched two new pre-apprenticeship programs in
    partnership with IBEW and Carpenters Union, which offer guaranteed
    pathways into an apprenticeship upon completion. The organization
    committed to hosting recruitment events focused on communities of
    color and veterans.  
-   The Texas Workforce Commission (TWC), a state agency, worked with a
    large hospital district in Texas to develop the first ever
    Registered Nurse Apprenticeship program. TWC has now committed to
    invest $15 million to pay for clinicals for these nursing students,
    resulting in more than 2,000 additional apprenticeships in the next
    two years. The Commission has also committed to developing two
    Registered Apprenticeship programs in nursing, as well as programs
    in software engineering, IT for their own state agency and to
    promote the value of Registered Apprenticeship programs to other
    state agencies as a way to recruit, retain and upskill employees.
    And, the Commission committed to holding conferences and outreach
    events focused on people of color, including “signing days” for high
    schoolers entering apprenticeship programs.  
-   Prairie View A&M University, a public HBCU in Texas, runs a U.S.
    Department of Commerce funded Rural Workforce Academy, which
    provides skilled trades training certification and job placement in
    rural counties impacted by disasters. In partnership with the Texas
    Workforce Commission, Prairie View committed to provide training and
    accommodations for students with disabilities and, with the support
    of USDA, expand its apprenticeship occupations to include butchery,
    forestry, and veterinary technician.

These efforts complement the Administration’s efforts to expand
Registered Apprenticeships to build a skilled, diverse workforce in high
demand areas—including those that are bolstered by President’s economic
agenda. For example,  the Administration launched the [Talent Pipeline
Challenge](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/17/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administration-launches-the-talent-pipeline-challenge-supporting-employer-investments-in-equitable-workforce-development-for-infrastructure-jobs/),
a nationwide call to action for employers, education and training
providers, states, local, Tribal, and territorial governments, and
philanthropic organizations to make tangible commitments that support
equitable workforce development – including launching or scaling
Registered Apprenticeships – in critical infrastructure sectors:
broadband, construction, electric vehicle charging, and battery
manufacturing. Clean energy tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act
include a significant bonus for businesses that hire using Registered
Apprenticeship programs and pay prevailing wage rates – ensuring our
clean energy investments create high-quality training pathways that lead
to good-paying jobs. State and local governments are using [American
Rescue
Plan](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/12/fact-sheet-white-house-announces-over-40-billion-in-american-rescue-plan-investments-in-our-workforce-with-more-coming/)
Fiscal Recovery Funds to expand pre-apprenticeships and Registered
Apprenticeships in response to the negative economic impacts of the
pandemic. 

The Department of Labor is also taking additional steps to expand
Registered Apprenticeship to serve at least 1 million apprentices
annually within the next 5 years. These steps include:

-   Investing over $330 million through grants to states, employers,
    labor organizations, and workforce intermediaries to expand and
    diversify Registered Apprenticeships. This includes $50 million to
    support [nine
    hubs](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20220824#:~:text=Apprenticeship%20Building%20America%20grant%20recipients,engagement%20and%20ease%20of%20access.)
    that help employers design, develop and deliver programs.  
-   Catalyzing lasting changes, like answering the President’s call to
    re-establish the [Advisory Committee on
    Apprenticeship](https://www.apprenticeship.gov/advisory-committee-apprenticeship)
    to help modernize the Registered Apprenticeship system.  
-   Launching four new technical assistance centers to support employers
    and industry as they aim to expand Registered Apprenticeship
    opportunities for underserved populations.  
-   Partnering with the Department of Commerce on sector-based
    challenges like the [Trucking
    Challenge](https://www.apprenticeship.gov/90-day-trucking-apprenticeship-challenge)
    and the [Cybersecurity Apprenticeship
    Sprint](https://www.apprenticeship.gov/cybersecurity-apprenticeship-sprint).

The Department of Commerce is expanding Registered Apprenticeships,
including by:

-   Launching the [Good Jobs
    Challenge](https://eda.gov/news/press-releases/2022/08/03/good-jobs-challenge-awardees.htm)
    a $500 million program funded through the American Rescue Plan that
    is investing in 32 awardees to develop high-quality worker training
    systems and partnerships, with an emphasis on Registered
    Apprenticeships. Grants were awarded to [WTIA Workforce
    Institute](https://eda.gov/arpa/good-jobs-challenge/awardees/WTIA-Workforce-Institute.htm)
    to scale its proven technology Registered Apprenticeship model in
    the high-paying cloud computing sector, the [Maryland Department of
    Labor](https://eda.gov/arpa/good-jobs-challenge/awardees/Maryland-Department-of-Labor.htm)
    to implement Registered Apprenticeships with leading wind power
    employers,
    [Persevere](https://eda.gov/arpa/good-jobs-challenge/awardees/Persevere.htm)
    to deliver technology Registered Apprenticeships to formerly
    incarcerated individuals, and [Alaska Primary Care
    Association](https://eda.gov/arpa/good-jobs-challenge/awardees/Alaska-Primary-Care-Association.htm)
    to administer registered healthcare apprenticeship programs with a
    focus on rural, tribal communities.
-   Requiring the use of a highly-skilled workforce, which can be
    fulfilled through use of graduates of Registered Apprenticeships,
    for the $42 billion infrastructure deployment of the Broadband
    Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program.

The Department of Education is expanding Registered Apprenticeship,
including by:

-   Developing a [Work-Based Learning
    Toolkit](https://cte.ed.gov/wbltoolkit/) that encourages the
    development of a State work-based learning strategy, which can
    include job shadowing, cooperative education experiences (or
    co-ops), school-based enterprises, internships, and
    apprenticeships.  
-   Producing an [online
    course](https://courses.lincs.ed.gov/course/info.php?id=261) on
    creating pre-apprenticeship programs to help individuals develop the
    skills and knowledge they need to succeed in apprenticeship
    programs.
