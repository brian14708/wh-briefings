This afternoon, the President met with the White House Competition
Council in the State Dining Room to discuss the significant progress
made since he signed the Competition Executive Order just over a year
ago, and to call on the Council to continue taking aggressive actions to
deliver concrete costs savings to American families.

The July 9, 2021 Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the
American Economy established the Competition Council to drive forward
the Administration’s whole-of-government effort to promoting
competition. Its purpose is to coordinate progress on the Order’s 72
initiatives to restore competition in the economy, to collaborate on
addressing pressing competition problems across the economy, and to find
new ways of delivering concrete benefits to America’s consumers,
workers, farmers, and small businesses. The Council is comprised of ten
Cabinet members and the heads of seven independent agencies.

The President commended the Council’s members for the impressive work
done over the last year, and highlighted several examples of initiatives
to delivering cost-savings for American consumers:

1.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has taken steps to address
    the nearly $30 billion in ”junk fees”—such as late fees, overdraft
    fees, bounced check fees—that Americans pay every year. Spurred by
    CFPB actions, three-quarters of the nation’s 20 largest banks are
    getting rid of bounced check charges. And the overall level of
    overdraft fees is on track to be down $3 billion in 2022, compared
    to pre-pandemic levels.    
2.  Last month, if your flight was canceled or delayed, no top airline
    guaranteed to cover meal or hotel costs, and only one guaranteed
    free booking—even when the delay or cancelation was the airline’s
    fault. The Department of Transportation called them out and launched
    a transparency dashboard. As a result, now nine of the top ten
    airlines cover hotels and meals, and ten provide free guaranteed
    rebooking.  
3.  Today, the Department of Transportation is issuing new rules that,
    when fully implemented, will require airlines and online search
    sites to disclose up front—while you are shopping for the best
    fare—any fees to sit next to one’s kid, for baggage, and for changes
    or cancellations. This will stop airlines from hiding the true cost
    of a ticket, so that consumers can find the actual best deal—saving
    Americans money and spurring more competition on prices.  
4.  The Federal Communication Commission is pursuing similar rules that
    will require internet companies to display a standardized “Broadband
    Nutrition Label” that discloses their monthly prices, fees, and
    internet speeds—so customers can see which company is cheapest and
    companies will have to compete for business.

The President emphasized that hidden, surprise fees hit the most
vulnerable Americans the hardest, and that too often companies impose
non-transparent fees that don’t allow customers to see the full price of
what they’re buying, and use termination fees to make it harder for
consumers to switch their service providers, like their cell phone
company. The President called on all agencies to reduce or eliminate
such fees, and to deliver concrete results by the next Competition
Council meeting.

The Council’s members then used the rest of the meeting to discuss their
plans for the coming months, including strategizing on how best to
deliver on the President’s call to action to reduce or eliminate unfair
fees that Americans shouldn’t have to pay. The Council’s members also
discussed additional actions expected in the coming months, such as:

1.  Progress on banning or limiting noncompete agreements, which prevent
    millions of workers from seeking out better-paying
    jobs: Non-competes – which are used by nearly 1/3 of
    companies, including for many low-wage workers – stifle wage growth
    for American workers by making it more difficult for them to leave
    for higher-paying jobs. The Federal Trade Commission is working
    towards banning or limiting noncompete clauses.  
2.  Funding for smaller meat processors to bring more competition to a
    highly concentrated sector: USDA will soon announce the distribution
    of millions in funding to help expand and diversify meat and poultry
    processing capacity, helping give consumers more and cheaper
    options.  
3.  Implementing the over-the-counter hearing aids rule: The Food and
    Drug Administration has issued final rules allowing hearing aids to
    be sold over the counter, without a prescription or exam, starting
    next month. This is anticipated to save Americans as much as $3,000
    per pair, providing more breathing room for the estimated 30 million
    Americans with hearing loss – including nearly 10 million adults
    under 60.  
4.  Strengthening enforcement against illegal mergers: The Department of
    Justice and Federal Trade Commission are working to finalize
    revisions to the merger guidelines—the framework for their analysis
    of mergers under the antitrust laws. The agencies are working to
    modernize the federal merger guidelines to better detect and prevent
    illegal, anticompetitive deals in today’s modern markets.

Participants in today’s meeting included:

1.  Lloyd Austin, Secretary of Defense
2.  Tom Vilsack, Secretary of Agriculture
3.  Xavier Becerra, Secretary of Health and Human Services
4.  Pete Buttigieg, Secretary of Transportation
