Vice President Kamala Harris today spoke with Prime Minister Mateusz
Morawiecki of Poland.  The Vice President recognized Poland’s generosity
and leadership in hosting millions of Ukrainian refugees and providing
critical humanitarian assistance, while also providing vital security
assistance to help the Ukrainian people defend their democracy from
Russia’s ongoing aggression.  The Vice President reaffirmed the enduring
strength of the U.S.-Polish relationship and efforts to bolster our
collective security,  including the permanent stationing of the  U.S.
Army V Corps Headquarters Forward Command Post in Poznan, which
President Biden recently announced as the first permanently-stationed
U.S. force presence on NATO’s Eastern Flank.  The Vice President also
discussed opportunities to enhance bilateral cooperation on civil
nuclear power generation in Poland, which would advance European energy
security, support global climate solutions, and create thousands of
clean energy jobs in both Poland and the United States.
