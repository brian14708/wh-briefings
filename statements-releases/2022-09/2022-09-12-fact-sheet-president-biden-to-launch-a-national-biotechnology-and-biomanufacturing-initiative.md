title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden to Launch a National Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing\_\
  Initiative"
---
 
Today, President Biden signed an Executive Order to launch a National
Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Initiative that will ensure we can
make in the United States all that we invent in the United States. This
Initiative will create jobs at home, build stronger supply chains, and
lower prices for American families. On Wednesday, the White House will
host a Summit on the National Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing
Initiative during which cabinet agencies will announce a wide range of
new investments and resources that will allow the United States to
harness the full potential of biotechnology and biomanufacturing and
advance the President’s Executive Order. 

Global industry is on the cusp of an industrial revolution powered by
biotechnology. Other countries are positioning themselves to become the
world’s resource for biotechnology solutions and products. The United
States has relied too heavily on foreign materials and bioproduction,
and our past off-shoring of critical industries, including
biotechnology, threatens our ability to access materials like important
chemicals and active pharmaceutical ingredients. Yet, bioeconomy remains
an American strength—as well as a huge opportunity—given our industries,
our innovators, and our robust research enterprise. By responsibly
harnessing the full potential of biotechnology and biomanufacturing, we
will be able to realize the potential of biology that can make almost
anything that we use in our day-to-day lives, from medicines to fuels to
plastics, and continue to drive U.S. innovation into economic and
societal success.

With biotechnology, we can program microbes to make specialty chemicals
and compounds, a process called “biomanufacturing.” These advances have
led industry to embrace biomanufacturing—as an alternative to
petrochemical-based production—to make things like plastics, fuels,
materials, and medicines. Industry analysis suggests that bioengineering
could account for more than a third of global output of manufacturing
industries before the end of the decade—almost $30 trillion in terms of
value.  

The Initiative will accelerate biotechnology innovation and grow
America’s bioeconomy across multiple sectors, including a range of
industries, including health, agriculture, and energy. The Initiative
will drive advances in biomanufacturing that substitute fragile supply
chains from abroad with strong chains at home, anchored by well-paying
jobs in communities all across America. It will improve food and energy
security, and drive agricultural innovation while mitigating the impacts
of climate change. And it will help people live longer and healthier
lives through advances in medicine.  
  
Specifically, the Initiative will:

-   **Grow Domestic Biomanufacturing Capacity.** Today, many U.S.
    bio-companies perform their manufacturing abroad owing to the lack
    of domestic infrastructure. This Initiative will build, revitalize,
    and secure national infrastructure for biomanufacturing across
    America, including through investments in regional innovation and
    enhanced bio-education, while strengthening the U.S. supply chain
    that produces domestic fuels, chemicals, and materials.
-   **Expand Market Opportunities for Bio-based Products.** The
    BioPreferred Program is the standard for sustainable procurement by
    government agencies, both providing an alternative to
    petroleum-based products and supporting good-paying jobs for
    American workers**.** The Initiative will increase mandatory
    bio-based purchasing by Federal agencies, including through training
    and support for contracting officers, and ensure that the Office of
    Management and Budget and the U.S. Department of Agriculture are
    regularly publishing assessments of progress. In so doing, it will
    provide specific directions to industry about gaps in biobased
    product options, leading to the creation of new products and new
    markets. Together, the Initiative will grow and strengthen the
    BioPreferred Program, increase the use of renewable agricultural
    materials, and position American companies to continue to lead the
    world in bio-innovation.
-   **Drive Research and Development (R&D) to Solve Our Greatest
    Challenges.** Focused government support for biotechnology can
    quickly produce solutions, as seen with the first-of-their-kind mRNA
    vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic. This Initiative directs
    Federal agencies to identify priority R&D needs to translate
    bioscience and biotechnology discoveries into medical breakthroughs,
    climate change solutions, food and agricultural innovation, and
    stronger U.S. supply chains.
-   **Improve Access to Quality Federal Data.** Combining biotechnology
    with massive computing power and artificial intelligence can produce
    significant breakthroughs for health, energy, agriculture, and the
    environment. This Data for the Bioeconomy Initiative will ensure
    that biotechnology developers have streamlined access to
    high-quality, secure, and wide-ranging biological data sets that can
    drive solutions to urgent societal and global problems.
-   **Train a Diverse Skilled Workforce.** The United States is facing a
    shortage of relevant talent spanning all levels, from community
    college to graduate school. The Initiative will expand training and
    education opportunities for all Americans in biotechnology and
    biomanufacturing, with a focus on advancing racial and gender equity
    and support for talent development in underserved communities.
-   **Streamline Regulations for Products of Biotechnology.** Advances
    in biotechnology are rapidly altering the agricultural, industrial,
    technological, and medical products landscape, which can create
    challenges for developers and innovators. The Initiative will
    improve the clarity and efficiency of the regulatory process for
    products of biotechnology so that valuable inventions and products
    can come to market faster without sacrificing safety.
-   **Advance Biosafety and Biosecurity to Reduce Risk.** The Initiative
    will prioritize investments in applied biosafety research and
    incentivize innovations in biosecurity to reduce risk throughout the
    biotechnology research and development lifecycles.
-   **Protect the U.S. Biotechnology Ecosystem.** The Initiative will
    protect the U.S. biotechnology ecosystem by advancing privacy
    standards and practices for human biological data, cybersecurity
    practices for biological data, standards development for bio-related
    software, and mitigation measures for risks posed by foreign
    adversary involvement in the biomanufacturing supply chain.
-   **Build a Thriving, Secure Global Bioeconomy with Partners and
    Allies.** The Initiative advances international cooperation to
    leverage biotechnology and biomanufacturing to tackle the most
    urgent global challenges – from climate change to health security –
    and to work together to ensure that biotechnology product
    development and use aligns with our shared democratic ethics and
    values, and that biotechnology breakthroughs benefit all citizens.
