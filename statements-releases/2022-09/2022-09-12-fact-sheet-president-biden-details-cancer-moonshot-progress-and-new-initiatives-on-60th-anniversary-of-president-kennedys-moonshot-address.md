title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Details Cancer Moonshot Progress and New Initiatives\
  \ on 60th Anniversary of President Kennedy\u2019s Moonshot\_Address"
---
 
Sixty years ago today, President John F. Kennedy delivered his Moonshot
speech at Rice University, committing to putting a man on the moon and
bring him back. This afternoon at the John F. Kennedy Presidential
Library and Museum in Boston, President Biden will discuss his bold
vision for another American moonshot: ending cancer as we know it. It is
a vision that will change people’s lives for the better, improve their
health, and decrease the burden of the disease.  
  
Cancer not only afflicts Democrats and Republicans, but all Americans.
When we come together as a nation around ideas that unite us – like
fighting cancer – we can show the world that anything is possible. The
President has long believed that America can be defined with one word:
possibilities. And the American people demonstrate every day what is
possible.

When President Kennedy delivered his Moonshot speech, the United States
had the building blocks to know what was possible. However, there were
major scientific and societal advances that needed to happen. As a
nation, we needed to fully commit to a future in which traveling to the
moon was possible – and we did just that. 

Today, we have many of the building blocks needed to make significant
progress combatting cancer, but we must come together to equitably
deliver on this promise. 

President Biden will announce new actions the Biden-Harris
Administration is taking to deliver on this mission for the American
people, and discuss progress made to date, including:

-   [Announcing Dr. Renee Wegrzyn as the inaugural Director of
    ARPA-H](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/12/president-biden-announces-intent-to-appoint-dr-renee-wegrzyn-as-inaugural-director-of-advanced-research-projects-agency-for-health-arpa-h/),
    a new agency to drive biomedical innovation that supports the health
    of all Americans; and
-   [Signing an Executive Order to launch a National Biotechnology and
    Biomanufacturing
    Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/12/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-launch-a-national-biotechnology-and-biomanufacturing-initiative/)
    to ensure the United States makes cutting-edge biotechnologies and
    other innovations;
-   The Cancer Cabinet’s progress towards delivering game-changing
    cancer detection technologies and support talented researchers from
    across the United States.

**INAUGURAL ARPA-H DIRECTOR**

In March, President Biden created the [Advanced Research Projects Agency
for Health
(ARPA-H)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/advanced-research-projects-agency-for-health-arpa-h/)
to improve the U.S. government’s ability to speed health and biomedical
research. Today, President Biden is announcing his intention to appoint
Dr. Renee Wegrzyn as the inaugural director of the new agency.  
  
Dr. Wegrzyn, a leading biomedical scientist with professional experience
working for two of the institutions that inspired the creation of ARPA-H
– the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and Intelligence
Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) – will deliver the strategy
for the agency’s nascent research portfolio and inaugural budget.    
  
America has an extraordinary biomedical system that has delivered
stunning advances previously seen as inconceivable – from COVID-19
vaccines to drugs that can eliminate certain cancers. Under Dr.
Wegrzyn’s leadership, ARPA-H will support programs and projects that
undertake challenges ranging from the molecular to the societal, with
the potential to transform entire areas of medicine and health in order
to prevent, detect, and treat some of the most complex diseases such as
Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and cancer, providing benefits for all
Americans.  
  
**NATIONAL BIOTECHNOLOGY & BIOMANUFACTURING INITIATIVE**  
  
Today, President Biden will sign an executive order that establishes the
Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Initiative to ensure cutting-edge
biotechnologies necessary to end cancer as we know it and other
innovations will be developed and manufactured in America. This will
save lives, create jobs at home, build stronger supply chains, and lower
prices for American families even in times of global turbulence.  
  
Other countries are positioning themselves to become the world’s
resource for biotechnology solutions and bio-manufactured products —
this new initiative adds to President Biden’s economic plan to bring
back manufacturing jobs to the United States. The United States has for
too long relied heavily on foreign materials for bioproduction, and our
past off-shoring of critical industries, including biotechnology,
presents a threat to our ability to access key materials like including
the active pharmaceutical ingredients for life-saving medications.  
  
This initiative will grow the strength and diversity of domestic
biomanufacturing capacity, expand market opportunities for bio-based
products through the federal programs, drive research and development
across all relevant agencies, streamline and harmonize appropriate
regulation, and prioritize investments in applied biosafety research in
biosecurity to reduce risk throughout research and development
lifecycles. This initiative is rooted in the principles of equity,
ethics, safety, and security that will help benefit all Americans and
the global community, and maintain United States technological
leadership and economic competitiveness.  
  
  
**CANCER CABINET’S PROGRESS TOWARDS ENDING CANCER AS WE KNOW IT**  
  
When the President and First Lady reignited the Cancer Moonshot seven
months ago, the first-ever Cancer Cabinet was formed to mobilize all
levers of the federal government and realize the President’s vision of
ending cancer as we know it. In July 2022, the Cancer Cabinet [unveiled
priority
actions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/13/fact-sheet-president-biden-appoints-cancer-panel-members-and-cancer-cabinet-unveils-priority-actions/)
to: (1) close the screening gap, (2) understand and address
environmental exposure, (3) decrease the impact of preventable cancers,
(4) bring cutting edge research through the pipeline to patients and
communities, and (5) support patients and caregivers.  
  
The Cancer Cabinet is announcing the following progress made towards
reaching these goals:  

-   **Inflation Reduction Act Lowers Costs of Prescription Drugs for
    Cancer Patients:** Because President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act
    caps out-of-pocket prescription drug costs at $2,000 per year for
    Medicare beneficiaries, tens of thousands of cancer patients could
    see their prescription drug costs go down by thousands annually. For
    example, in 2019, Zytiga, a drug used to treat prostate cancer, had
    an expected out-of-pocket cost of $8,181 per year,
    [researchers](https://www.kff.org/report-section/the-out-of-pocket-cost-burden-for-specialty-drugs-in-medicare-part-d-in-2019-findings/)
    found. Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, seniors and other
    beneficiaries who use that drug could save over $6,000 each year.
    Moreover, the number of beneficiaries who benefit from the cap is
    likely to increase, since 30% of Medicare unsubsidized beneficiaries
    fail to fill prescriptions for cancer drugs when faced with such
    high costs, a recent
    [study](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2021.01742)
    found.  
     
-   **National Cancer Institute (NCI) Launches Vanguard Study on
    Multi-Cancer Detection:** As a central component of the Cancer
    Moonshot, the National Cancer Institute launched a large national
    trial that, if successful will identify effective blood tests for
    the detection of one or more cancers, providing the opportunity for
    additional, less-invasive tools for early detection. A [new
    four-year pilot
    study](https://prevention.cancer.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/major_program/Cancer-Screening-Research-Network-MCED-20220615.pdf)
    will enroll 24,000 people ages 45 to 70 years to lay the groundwork
    for a large randomized controlled trial that will enroll 225,000
    people. The studies will be funded in part by 21<sup>st</sup>
    Century Cures Act Cancer Moonshot funds and will begin enrolling
    in 2024. Grant opportunities studies have recently been opened with
    more to be released before the end of 2022.  
-   **Cancer Moonshot Scholars Program Now Accepts Applications from the
    Next Generation of Cancer Innovators**: The National Cancer
    Institute has opened a brand-new early-career grant opportunity to
    invest in the next generation of innovative cancer researchers with
    a focus on developing a cancer research workforce that is more
    representative of the U.S. population. The goal of the [Cancer
    Moonshot
    Scholars](/Users/DMCarnival/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/IOC35A3B/cancer.gov/moonshotscholars)
    program is to inspire and support the next generation of world-class
    and diverse researchers focused on scientific breakthroughs that
    will make a difference for patients and drive progress toward the
    goal of ending cancer as we know it today. NCI expects to support
    cohorts of dozens of Cancer Moonshot Scholars in initial rounds,
    beginning in 2023 with project periods of up to five years.  
-   **White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) Issues
    Guidance to Make Federally-Funded Research Available: **Recently,
    the Biden-Harris Administration [updated U.S. policy
    guidance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/08/25/ostp-issues-guidance-to-make-federally-funded-research-freely-available-without-delay/)
    to make the results of taxpayer-supported research immediately
    available to the American public at no cost. In
    a [memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-OSTP-Public-Access-Memo.pdf) to
    federal departments and agencies, Dr. Alondra Nelson, the head of
    OSTP, delivered guidance for agencies to update their public access
    policies as soon as possible and no later than December 31, 2025 to
    make publications and research funded by taxpayers publicly
    accessible, without an embargo or cost. This updated guidance will
    affect the more than 200,000 federally-funded studies each year,
    delivering to all areas of scientific discovery what was already
    required of Cancer Moonshot grants from the National Cancer
    Institute as part of then-Vice President Biden’s vision for how to
    bring the benefits of federally-funded research to all Americans.  
-   **Department of Defense Creates Research Program to Understand
    Military Toxic Exposure:** The Department of Defense’s [Murtha
    Cancer Center Research
    Program](https://medschool.usuhs.edu/sur/research/murtha-cancer-center)
    has launched a new program with the goal of understanding the impact
    of service-related toxic exposure on the development of cancer in
    members of the military.
    [PROMETHEUS](https://medschool.usuhs.edu/sur/research/murtha-cancer-center/research),
    or the PROject for Military Exposures and Toxin History Evaluation
    in U.S. service members will bring together agency and private
    sector innovators to understand and address cancer in exposed
    service members. It brings together significant DoD capabilities
    including the DoD Serum Repository which contains blood samples for
    all service members; the Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record
    (ILER) which tracks toxin exposures; the DOD Tumor Registry which
    tracks cancer diagnoses in active duty; DoD Framingham which
    analyzes blood proteins in active duty with cancer; the Joint
    Pathology Center which is the DoD’s pathology center of excellence;
    and APOLLO, which was created in response to the Cancer Moonshot in
    2016 now with a network of 13 hospitals to carry out
    military-specific research.  
-   **NCI Establishes Telehealth Centers of Excellence to Improve Cancer
    Care:** Last month, NCI announced $23 million to support the
    creation of a [Telehealth Research Centers of Excellence
    (TRACE),](https://healthcaredelivery.cancer.gov/telehealth/trace.html)
    which will study the role of telehealth in cancer prevention,
    screening, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, and equity of access
    and outcomes. Four funded research centers will conduct large trials
    in real-world clinical settings, including hospitals, nd primary
    care offices, to determine whether the use of telehealth —used
    broadly during the COVID-19 pandemic – can effectively deliver
    quality cancer care. This ground-breaking program will identify best
    practices for cancer telehealth to drive implementation of
    sustainable telehealth practices to offer many benefits to
    patients.   
-   **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Expands
    Partnerships to Deliver New Cancer Technologies:** NIST and the
    Department of Commerce-sponsored Manufacturing USA institute, The
    National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing
    Biopharmaceuticals, recently [awarded funding to two project
    teams](https://niimbl.force.com/s/news/a0a3u00000Aglx2AAB/niimbl-announces-158m-to-fund-14-new-biopharmaceutical-manufacturing-projects)
    to ensure that cellular therapies for cancer can be more efficiently
    and consistently manufactured. Together, the projects will produce
    innovative and scalable manufacturing processes and create new
    partnerships for workforce training in cell and gene-therapy
    manufacturing. NIST and the [Medical Device Innovation
    Consortium](https://www.nist.gov/mml/bbd/bioassay-methods/cancer)
    signed a cooperative research and development agreement to develop
    and manufacture DNA reference samples engineered to contain
    mutations commonly tested for diagnosing and targeting drugs for
    cancer. These investments hold the promise to speed progress in the
    development of advancing cancer precision medicine by simplifying
    the process for validating diagnostics and enabling technology,
    bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence developers to optimize
    and demonstrate accuracy of their methods.  
-   **Facilitate Data Sharing Advances the Bioeconomy:** As part of the
    new Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Initiative, the National
    Institutes of Health is expanding the [Cancer Research Data
    Ecosystem](https://www.cancer.gov/research/infrastructure/bioinformatics/cancer-research-data-ecosystem-infographic),
    a national data infrastructure that encourages data sharing to
    support cancer care for individual patients and enables discovery of
    new treatments. USDA is working with NIH to ensure that data on
    persistent poverty can be integrated with cancer surveillance. The
    National Science Foundation recently announced a competition for a
    new $20 million biosciences data center to increase our
    understanding of living systems at small scales, which will produce
    new biotechnology designs to make products in agriculture, medicine
    and health, and materials.
