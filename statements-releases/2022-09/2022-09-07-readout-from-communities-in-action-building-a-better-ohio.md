title: "Readout from Communities in Action: Building A Better\_Ohio"
---
 
Today, the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and the
Office of Public Engagement hosted nearly 50 local elected officials and
community leaders from across Ohio in a “Communities in Action: Building
a Better Ohio” event. During the half-day forum, participants spoke with
senior Biden-Harris Administration officials – including Secretary
Marcia Fudge, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Keisha Lance
Bottoms, Senior Advisor and Director of Public Engagement, and Julie
Rodriguez, Senior Advisor and Director of Intergovernmental Affairs –
about the benefits of President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act, and the CHIPS and Science
Act for working families in the state of Ohio. U.S. Representative Joyce
Beatty also joined the event. Administration officials discussed how the
Biden-Harris Administration will continue to bring together states and
local governments, labor leaders, businesses, non-profits, and health
care leaders to leverage these historic investments to create and expand
opportunities for working families in the Buckeye state and share
stories of impact with their communities. Second Gentleman Douglas
Emhoff and Counselor to the President Steve Ricchetti, a native of Ohio,
also joined a group photograph with the Ohio leaders. The event was the
first in a series of “Communities in Action” events that the White House
will host with state and local leaders to demonstrate how the
Biden-Harris Administration is delivering results for the American
people.
