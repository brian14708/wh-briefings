title: "President\_Biden Announces Intent to Appoint Dr. Renee Wegrzyn as Inaugural\
  \ Director of Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health\_(ARPA-H)"
---
 
Today, President Joe Biden announced his intent to appoint Dr. Renee
Wegrzyn as the first director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency
for Health (ARPA-H), a new agency established to drive biomedical
innovation that supports the health of all Americans.  On the
60<sup>th</sup> anniversary of President John F. Kennedy’s Moonshot
speech, Dr. Wegrzyn will join President Biden today at the John F.
Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston as he discusses his bold vision
for another American Moonshot: ending cancer as we know it.  
   
Dr. Wegrzyn, a scientist with professional experience working for two of
the institutions that inspired the creation of ARPA-H – the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and Intelligence Advanced
Research Projects Activity (IARPA) – will be responsible for driving the
agency’s nascent research portfolio and associated budget. The budget is
expected to support a broad range of programs in order to develop
capabilities to prevent, detect and treat some of the most intractable
diseases including cancer.    
   
President Biden created ARPA-H in March 2022 to push the limits of U.S.
biomedical and health research and innovation. ARPA-H will embrace
proven models of tapping talent and expertise from across industry,
academia, and government to bring new ideas and approaches, as well as
the ability to marshal resources through public-private partnerships.
Equity will be important to ARPA-H’s mission, which will ensure all
projects consider equity in their design, support impactful
breakthroughs, expand health care access, and improve access for all
patients regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual
orientation, disability, and income level.  
   
**<u>Dr. Renee Wegrzyn, Inaugural Director, Advanced Research Projects
Agency for Health (ARPA-H)</u>**  
Dr. Renee Wegrzyn is currently a vice president of business development
at Ginkgo Bioworks and Head of Innovation at Concentric by Ginkgo, where
she is focused on applying synthetic biology to outpace infectious
diseases – including COVID-19 – through biomanufacturing, vaccine
innovation, and biosurveillance of pathogens at scale.  
   
Prior to Ginkgo Bioworks, Wegrzyn was program manager in the Biological
Technologies Office (BTO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency (DARPA), where she leveraged the tools of synthetic biology and
gene editing to enhance biosecurity, promote public health, and support
the domestic bioeconomy. Her DARPA portfolio included the Living
Foundries: 1000 Molecules, Safe Genes, Preemptive Expression of
Protective Alleles and Response Elements (PREPARE), and Detect it with
Gene Editing Technologies (DIGET) programs.  
   
Wegrzyn received the Superior Public Service Medal for her work and
contributions at DARPA. Prior to joining DARPA as a program manager,
Wegrzyn led technical teams in private industry in the areas of
biosecurity, gene therapies, emerging infectious disease,
neuromodulation, synthetic biology, as well as research and development
teams commercializing multiplex immunoassays and peptide-based disease
diagnostics.  
   
Wegrzyn served on the scientific advisory boards for the National
Academies of Science Board on Army Research and Development, Revive &
Restore, Air Force Research Labs, Nuclear Threat Initiative, and the
Innovative Genomics Institute. She holds doctorate and bachelor’s
degrees in applied biology from the Georgia Institute of Technology, was
a fellow in the Center for Health Security Emerging Leaders in
Biosecurity Initiative (ELBI), and completed her postdoctoral training
as an Alexander von Humboldt Fellow in Heidelberg, Germany.
