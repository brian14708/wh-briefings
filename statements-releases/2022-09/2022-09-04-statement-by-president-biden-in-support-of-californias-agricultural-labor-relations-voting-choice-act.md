title: "Statement by President\_Biden in Support of California\u2019s Agricultural\
  \ Labor Relations Voting Choice\_Act"
---
 
I strongly support California’s Agricultural Labor Relations Voting
Choice Act (AB 2183), which will give California’s agricultural workers
greater opportunity to organize and collectively bargain for better
wages, benefits, and working conditions. Farmworkers worked tirelessly
and at great personal risk to keep food on America’s tables during the
pandemic. In the state with the largest population of farmworkers, the
least we owe them is an easier path to make a free and fair choice to
organize a union. I am grateful to California’s elected officials and
union leaders for leading the way.  
  
Government should work to remove – not erect – barriers to workers
organizing. But ultimately workers must make the choice whether to
organize a union.  
  
Unions transform how we work and live: higher wages, better benefits,
like health insurance and paid leave, protections against discrimination
and harassment, and a safer and healthier workplace. Unions built the
middle class. And, unions give workers a voice. Workers’ voices are
heard and heeded. Organizing or joining a union, that’s democracy in
action. And it’s especially important today for Black and Brown workers
whose voices have long been silenced through shameful race-based laws
and policies.   
  
It is long past time that we ensure America’s farmworkers and other
essential workers have the same right to join a union as other
Americans.
