title: "Statement by NSC Spokesperson Adrienne Watson on Iran\u2019s Cyberattack against\_\
  Albania"

The United States strongly condemns Iran’s cyberattack against our
NATO Ally, Albania. We [join in Prime Minister Rama’s
call](https://www.kryeministria.al/en/newsroom/videomesazh-i-kryeministrit-edi-rama/)
for Iran to be held accountable for this unprecedented cyber
incident. The United States will take further action to hold Iran
accountable for actions that threaten the security of a U.S. ally and
set a troubling precedent for cyberspace.

For weeks, the U.S. government has been on the ground working alongside
private sector partners to support Albania’s efforts to mitigate,
recover from, and investigate the July 15 cyberattack that destroyed
government data and disrupted government services to the public. We have
concluded that the Government of Iran conducted this reckless and
irresponsible cyberattack and that it is responsible for subsequent hack
and leak operations.

Iran’s conduct disregards norms of responsible peacetime State behavior
in cyberspace, which includes a norm on refraining from damaging
critical infrastructure that provides services to the public. Albania
views impacted government networks as critical infrastructure. Malicious
cyber activity by a State that intentionally damages critical
infrastructure or otherwise impairs its use and operation to provide
services to the public can have cascading domestic, regional, and global
effects; pose an elevated risk of harm to the population; and may lead
to escalation and conflict. 

We will continue to support Albania’s remediation efforts over the
longer-term, and we invite partners and Allies to join us in holding
malicious cyber actors accountable and building a secure and resilient
digital future.
