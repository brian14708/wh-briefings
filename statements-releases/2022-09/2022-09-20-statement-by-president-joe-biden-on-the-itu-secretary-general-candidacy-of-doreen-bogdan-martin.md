  \ Doreen\_Bogdan-Martin"

I strongly support Doreen Bogdan-Martin for the next Secretary-General
of the International Telecommunication Union.  Ms. Bogdan-Martin
possesses the integrity, experience, and vision necessary to transform
the digital landscape.  

She understands the importance of connecting every school to the
Internet and making sure every student can access virtual learning,
providing women and girls the digital tools they need to succeed, and
extending the benefits of online health and educational resources.  It
is hard to believe that in today’s digital world, 2.9 billion people
globally have no access to the Internet and its many benefits.  That’s a
challenge that holds all of us back.

The next Secretary-General of the International Telecommunication Union
will play an important role in making our digital future inclusive and
accessible for everyone, especially in the developing world.  I ask all
UN Member States to join the United States in voting for Doreen
Bogdan-Martin at the upcoming International Telecommunication Union
elections in Bucharest, Romania.
