title: "Statement from President\_Biden on Russia\u2019s Sham Referenda in\_Ukraine"
---
 
The United States will never recognize Ukrainian territory as anything
other than part of Ukraine. Russia’s referenda are a sham – a false
pretext to try to annex parts of Ukraine by force in flagrant
violation of international law, including the United Nations Charter. We
will work with our allies and partners to impose additional swift and
severe economic costs on Russia. The United States stands with our
partners around the world – and with every nation that respects the core
tenets of the UN charter – in rejecting whatever fabricated outcomes
Russia will announce. We will continue to support the Ukrainian people
and provide them with security assistance to help them defend themselves
as they courageously resist Russia’s invasion.
