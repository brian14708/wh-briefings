  \ of Evolving National Security Risks by the Committee on Foreign Investment in\
  \ the United\_States"

*First-Ever Presidential Directive Defining Additional National Security
Factors for CFIUS to Consider in Evaluating Transactions*

  
The United States’ commitment to open investment is a cornerstone of our
economic policy, benefits the millions of American workers employed by
foreign firms operating in the United States, and helps to maintain our
economic and technological edge. However, the United States has long
recognized that certain investments in the United States from foreign
persons, particularly those from competitor or adversarial nations, can
present risks to U.S. national security. The United States therefore
maintains a robust foreign investment review process to identify and
address such risks. As the national security environment, including the
behavior of countries and individuals that seek to impair U.S. national
security, evolves, the review process of the Committee on Foreign
Investment in the United States (CFIUS, or the Committee) also must
evolve.

This Executive Order (E.O. or the Order) is the first E.O. since CFIUS
was established in 1975 to provide formal Presidential direction on the
risks that the Committee should consider when reviewing a covered
transaction. The Order explicitly recognizes that some countries use
foreign investment to obtain access to sensitive data and technologies
for purposes that are detrimental to U.S. national security, and seeks
to ensure that CFIUS remains an effective tool to combat these threats
now and in the future. More broadly, this Order explicitly ties CFIUS’
role, actions, and capabilities with the Administration’s overall
national security priorities—including preserving U.S. technological
leadership, protecting Americans’ sensitive data, and enhancing U.S.
supply chain resilience—to ensure that the United States’ national
security tools and objectives are consistent and mutually reinforcing.

Specifically, this E.O. provides direction to CFIUS by elaborating on
existing statutory factors and adds several national security factors
for CFIUS to consider during its review process. The Order also
acknowledges the importance of continuous improvements to the foreign
investment review process and directs CFIUS to continue to regularly
review its processes, practices, and regulations to ensure that they
remain responsive to evolving national security threats.

This E.O. does not change CFIUS processes or legal jurisdiction. It
should be read in conjunction with the national security factors already
set out in section 721(f) of the CFIUS statute, and with the
understanding that these lists of factors are illustrative. CFIUS may
consider any national security risk arising out of a transaction over
which it has jurisdiction. 

The E.O. directs the Committee to consider five specific sets of
factors:

-   ***A given transaction’s effect on the resilience of critical U.S.
    supply chains that may have national security implications,
    including those outside of the defense industrial base.*** Foreign
    investment that shifts ownership, rights, or control to a foreign
    person in certain manufacturing capabilities, services, critical
    mineral resources, or technologies that are fundamental to national
    security may make the United States vulnerable to future supply
    disruptions of critical goods and services. The Order states that
    the Committee shall consider, as appropriate, a covered
    transaction’s effect on supply chain resilience and security, both
    within and outside of the defense industrial base. These
    considerations include the degree of diversification through
    alternative suppliers across the supply chain, including suppliers
    located in allied or partner countries; supply relationships with
    the U.S. government; and the concentration of ownership or control
    by the foreign person in a given supply chain.  
-   ***A given transaction’s effect on U.S. technological leadership in
    areas affecting U.S. national security, including but not limited to
    microelectronics, artificial intelligence, biotechnology and
    biomanufacturing, quantum computing, advanced clean energy, and
    climate adaptation technologies.*** Although foreign investments can
    in many circumstances help to foster domestic innovation, it is
    vital to protect U.S. technological leadership, especially when
    foreign investments involve sectors that are critical to U.S.
    national security. The Order specifically identifies sectors that
    are fundamental to U.S. technological leadership and therefore
    national security, including but not limited to microelectronics,
    artificial intelligence, biotechnology and biomanufacturing, quantum
    computing, advanced clean energy, climate adaptation technologies,
    and elements of the agricultural industrial base that have
    implications for food security, and instructs the Committee to
    consider whether a covered transaction involves manufacturing
    capabilities, services, critical mineral resources, or technologies
    in such fields. The Committee shall consider whether a covered
    transaction could reasonably result in future advancements and
    applications in technology that could undermine national security,
    and whether a foreign person involved in the transaction has ties to
    third parties that may pose a threat to U.S. national security.  
-   ***Industry investment trends that may have consequences for a given
    transaction’s impact on U.S. national security.*** Certain
    investments by a foreign person in a sector or technology may appear
    to pose a limited threat when viewed in isolation, but when viewed
    in the context of previous transactions, it may become apparent that
    such investments can facilitate sensitive technology transfer in key
    industries or otherwise harm national security. For example, there
    may be a comparatively low threat associated with a foreign company
    or country acquiring a single firm in a sector, but a much higher
    threat associated with a foreign company or country acquiring
    multiple firms within the sector. To respond to such threats, the
    Order states that the Committee shall consider, as appropriate, the
    risks arising from a covered transaction in the context of multiple
    acquisitions or investments in a single sector or in related
    sectors.  
-   ***Cybersecurity risks that threaten to impair national security.***
    Investments by foreign persons with the capability and intent to
    conduct cyber intrusions or other malicious cyber-enabled activity
    may pose a risk to national security. The Order states that the
    Committee shall consider whether a covered transaction may provide a
    foreign person, or their relevant third-party ties, with access to
    conduct such activities, in addition to the cybersecurity posture,
    practices, capabilities, and access of all parties to the
    transaction that could allow a foreign person, or their relevant
    third-party ties, to manifest such activities.  
-   ***Risks to U.S. persons’ sensitive data.*** Data is an increasingly
    powerful tool for the surveillance, tracing, tracking, and targeting
    of individuals or groups of individuals, with potentially adverse
    impacts on national security. Moreover, advances in technology,
    combined with access to large data sets, increasingly enable the
    re‑identification or de-anonymization of what once was
    unidentifiable data. The Order states that the Committee shall
    consider whether a covered transaction involves a U.S. business with
    access to U.S. persons’ sensitive data, and whether the foreign
    investor has, or the parties to whom the foreign investor has ties,
    have sought or have the ability to exploit such information to the
    detriment of national security, including through the use of
    commercial or other means.

Today’s Executive Order is a part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s
broader strategy to maintain U.S. economic and technological leadership,
specifically with respect to protecting national security. This involves
both strengthening domestic investments and competitiveness at home and
in partnership with our allies, while using all available tools to
protect America’s edge and prevent our competitors and adversaries from
undermining our national security.
