*The Biden-Harris Administration announces U.S. commitments to implement
the Declaration on U.S.-Pacific Partnership*

The first-ever United States-Pacific Island Country Summit marks a new
milestone in U.S.-Pacific cooperation. It builds on a long history,
forged in sacrifice in World War II and reinforced by strong
people-to-people ties. As an outcome of the Summit, the President and
Pacific leaders issued the Declaration on U.S.-Pacific Partnership, a
forward-looking vision statement reflecting our shared commitment to
expand and deepen our cooperation in the years ahead. The Biden-Harris
Administration is committed to implementing this vision; to that end,
President Biden announced a slate of ambitious initiatives to meet
Pacific priorities.

**The United States has directly provided over $1.5 billion to support
the Pacific Islands over the past decade and today has announced over
$810 million in additional expanded programs.** These initiatives seek
to improve the lives and wellbeing of all Pacific Islanders by expanding
diplomatic engagement, including through the historic announcement that
the United States will recognize Cook Islands and Niue, following
appropriate consultations; combatting the climate crisis; launching a
new Trade and Investment Dialogue; providing development assistance;
enhancing maritime security; expanding educational opportunities;
enhancing security, health, and digital capacity; and addressing painful
legacies of war. These new initiatives include the 10-year $600 million
Economic Assistance Agreement request to Congress, which is associated
with the South Pacific Tuna Treaty. Additionally, the Administration’s
Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment aims to deliver
game-changing projects in the region.

Under the Biden-Harris Administration we will:

**I. STRENGTHEN AND SUPPORT U.S.-PACIFIC ISLANDS PARTNERSHIP**

The foundation of the U.S. approach in the Pacific is strong and
productive partnership with the Pacific Islands.

-   ***First-ever National U.S. Strategy for the Pacific Islands*:** The
    Biden-Harris Administration has launched the first-ever U.S. Pacific
    Partnership Strategy for the Pacific Islands. This strategy is an
    addendum to the Indo-Pacific Strategy of the United States and will
    align with the Pacific Islands Forum’s 2050 Strategy for the Blue
    Pacific Continent.  
-   ***Recognition of Cook Islands and Niue*:** The United States will
    recognize the Cook Islands and Niue as sovereign states, following
    appropriate consultations.  
-   ***Executive Education for Rising Pacific Leaders*:** The United
    States will encourage and support opportunities for rising leaders
    in public service across the Pacific Islands. As an example, Johns
    Hopkins SAIS is establishing a first-of-its-kind
    executive-leadership program in Washington, D.C. for such leaders.  
-   ***Supporting the Tuna Treaty*:** The United States has pledged to
    request a ten-year, $600 million Economic Assistance Agreement
    associated with the South-Pacific Tuna Treaty. This assistance will
    support fisheries economic development, collaboration on climate
    resilience, blue economy and maritime security. State Department has
    already committed $10 million to support broader cooperation under
    the treaty.  
-   ***Resilience and Adaptation Fellowship Program for Rising
    Leaders*:** The Administration will work with Congress to commit $5M
    to establish a fellowship program in partnership with the University
    of the South Pacific and premier universities in the United States,
    such as the University of Hawaii and University of California Santa
    Barbara. The program will offer rising leaders in the Pacific
    Islands the opportunity to gain expertise in natural resource
    economics and management, climate resilience, sustainable food
    systems, renewable energy development, water security and waste
    management.  
-   ***Compacts of Free Association*:** Compacts of Free Association
    with the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the
    Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau have formed a bedrock of
    U.S.-Pacific cooperation for nearly four decades. In light of the
    critical nature of these complex negotiations, President Biden
    appointed Ambassador Joseph Yun as Special Presidential Envoy for
    Compact Negotiations in March. Since then, Yun has led an
    interagency team that includes senior officials from the Departments
    of State, Interior, Defense, Energy, and the White House in multiple
    rounds of negotiations. We expect the negotiations for all three
    Compact agreements to conclude by the end of this year; current
    agreements expire in September 2023 for the FSM and RMI, and one
    year later for Palau. At the Summit, leaders of FSM, RMI, and Palau
    expressed appreciation at the progress in the negotiations and
    expressed a strong desire to conclude the negotiations by the end of
    this year.

**  
II. BUILD U.S. CAPACITY IN THE PACIFIC**

The United States is investing in diplomacy across the Pacific by
expanding the number of facilities, officers and programs active in the
region. By expanding our own capacity, we will better meet the needs of
our Pacific partners. In addition to the establishment of U.S. Embassies
in Solomon Islands, Tonga and Kiribati, the United States is announcing:

-   ***First-Ever Envoy to the Pacific Islands Forum:*** The
    Biden-Harris Administration is committed to Pacific regionalism,
    with the Pacific Islands Forum at the center, as a vital part of the
    Indo-Pacific regional architecture. To that end, President Biden
    designated former Ambassador to Fiji, Kiribati, Tonga, Nauru, and
    Tuvalu Ambassador Frankie Reed as the first-ever U.S. Envoy to the
    Pacific Islands Forum. In this new capacity, the Ambassador will
    expand U.S. ties and coordination with the Pacific Islands Forum and
    its members.  
-   ***Elevate USAID Presence in the Pacific:*** Working with Congress,
    the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) will
    open a Pacific regional mission in Suva, Fiji by September 2023, and
    elevate its presence in Papua New Guinea through a country
    representative office.  
-   ***Return and Expansion of the Peace Corps:*** Peace Corps
    volunteers will return to Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, and Vanuatu to support
    communities on education, health, community economic development,
    and climate action. Additionally, the Peace Corps is finalizing its
    assessment of Solomon Islands and exploring options for returning to
    other Pacific countries.

**  
III. COORDINATE WITH ALLIES AND PARTNERS**

The United States will amplify its efforts to support the Pacific in
close partnership with its allies and partners, including through the
new Partners in the Blue Pacific initiative.

***Partners in the Blue Pacific:*** The Partners in the Blue Pacific
(PBP), launched in 2022, is a new effort from the United States,
Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom to make our
partnership, individually and collectively, with the Pacific more
efficient and effective. The Partners welcome the intent of Canada and
Germany to join, as well as the engagement of France, the European
Union, the Republic of Korea, and India; the PBP invites further
cooperation with all those that share its values, objectives, and
approach – principally that of consultation and partnership with the
Pacific. The PBP will focus on six prospective lines of effort:

-   *Climate Change Resilience, Adaptation, and Disasters*
-   *Secure and Resilient Technology and Connectivity*
-   *Protection of the Ocean and Environment*
-   *People Centered Development*
-   *Resources and Economic Development*
-   *Political Leadership and Regionalism*

**  
IV. TAKE URGENT ACTION ON THE CLIMATE CRISIS, CLEAN ENERGY, AND
SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE**

The United States will continue to play a leading role in accelerating
global efforts to combat the climate crisis in this decisive decade,
recognizing the existential threats this crisis presents to the Pacific
Islands. The United States will address climate challenges in the
Pacific with an investment of over $130 million in substantial
resourcing, support, and partnerships, and leverage an additional $400
million in private financing.

-   ***Support for Climate Forecasting and Research***: The Biden-Harris
    Administration will provide new funding, subject to Congressional
    notification and domestic procedures, to help forecast climate and
    extreme weather events in the Pacific Islands. The Administration
    intends to:
    -   Provide $15 million to help Pacific Islands adapt and build
        resilience to climate change and extreme weather events by
        enhancing their ability to identify, anticipate, and prepare for
        climate impacts on public health and safety, food security,
        water resources, coastal and ecosystem management, and overall
        sustainable development.
    -   Provide $7 million to expand Pacific Island weather and ocean
        data collection that will provide more accurate and reliable
        information on ocean conditions that are critical to sea-state
        forecasts and formulating advisories and warnings to ensure
        public safety.  
              
-   ***Ocean Mapping Support:*** The United States is partnering with
    Palau and other Pacific Island countries to advance ocean mapping
    projects that will be used to make informed decisions about how to
    use ocean resources sustainably.  
-   ***Resilient Pacific Blue Economy Program*:** The Administration is
    working with Congress to provide $4.8 million to establish a
    Resilient Blue Economies program. The program will help the Pacific
    Islands climate-proof their “blue” economies. The program will
    strengthen the capacity of the Pacific Community to combine climate
    science, marine spatial planning, sustainable fisheries and
    aquaculture governance, and marine conservation to promote resilient
    Pacific economies across the region.  
-   ***Climate-Smart Infrastructure*:** Under its Global Partnership for
    Climate Smart Infrastructure, the United States Trade and
    Development Agency (USTDA) will help mobilize more than $400 million
    in financing for climate projects that advance Pacific Island
    countries’ net-zero goals. These activities will also facilitate the
    deployment of U.S. private-sector solutions in renewable energy and
    grid modernization to Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and Tonga, while
    helping these countries meet their clean energy, energy security and
    decarbonization goals.  
-   ***Cooperation to Combat Wildlife Trafficking*:** The Biden-Harris
    Administration will provide $3.25 million in capacity-building to
    Fiji, Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu
    to combat wildlife trafficking and support implementation of the
    Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
    Fauna and Flora.  
-   ***Sea-Level Rise*:** The United States is adopting a new policy on
    sea-level rise and maritime zones. This policy recognizes that new
    trends are developing in the practices and views of States on the
    need for stable maritime zones in the face of sea-level rise, is
    mindful of the Pacific Island Forum’s Declaration Preserving
    Maritime Zones in the Face of Climate Change-related Sea-Level Rise,
    commits to working with Pacific Island States and other countries
    toward the goal of lawfully establishing and maintaining baselines
    and maritime zone limits, and encourages other countries to do the
    same.   
-   ***Natural Disaster Relief and Humanitarian Assistance*:** Together
    with its Partners in the Blue Pacific, the United States will
    provide $5 million, pending Congressional notification and domestic
    procedures, to bolster the Pacific Islands’ ability to detect and
    respond to devastating natural disasters. In addition, in 2022,
    USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance is providing over $14
    million to Pacific Islands countries in both humanitarian response
    and early recovery, risk reduction, and resilience programming in
    the region.  
-   ***Pacific American Fund*:** In 2022, USAID awarded eight new
    sub-grants under the Pacific American Fund with a total value of
    $4.9 million that benefit eight Pacific Island countries (Federated
    States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Republic of Marshall Islands, Palau,
    Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu). Subject to
    availability of funds, USAID intends to award a new round of grants
    under the Pacific American Fund in 2023 with a value of up to $6
    million. These grants seek to bolster communities’ resilience to
    disasters and climate risks; enhance livelihoods; improve food
    security, access to water, health and education; support governance;
    and encourage sustainable natural resources management and
    biodiversity conservation.  
-   ***Climate Adaptation and Other Foreign Assistance*:** The State
    Department and USAID intend to support $27 million in programs and
    technical assistance with the Pacific Islands that invest in
    adaptation and energy resilience and advance good governance. For
    example, these programs may support the region’s transition to low
    emission development by promoting sustainable forest management and
    improving the sustainability of clean energy investments.  
-   ***Addressing Pacific Regional Challenges***: The FY 2023
    President’s Budget includes $51 million for the State Department and
    USAID Pacific Islands Regional programming. Programming will address
    transnational challenges including transborder natural resource
    issues and biodiversity, regional connectivity and energy security,
    climate change, and health security. 

**  
V. FORGE ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP AND SUPPORT ECONOMIC RECOVERY**

The United States will target more than $50 million in direct support
for Pacific Island recovery to enable strong growth for years to come.

-   ***Trade and Investment Dialogue*:** The United States will
    establish a Trade and Investment Dialogue with the Pacific Islands
    to promote trade and address market access barriers. We will work
    with Pacific partners to establish this dialogue by the end of 2022,
    to credibly target economic, investment, and market-access needs in
    2023.  
-   ***Memorandum of Commercial Cooperation with Pacific Island
    countries*:** The United States will develop a tailored Memorandum
    of Commercial Cooperation to facilitate U.S. private-sector
    engagement in Pacific Island countries on priority projects in

        Initiative, $3 million in technical assistance from USTDA to
        support feasibility studies, environmental-impact studies, and
        other project preparation assistance required to help unlock
        financing for public infrastructure projects, pending
        Congressional notification and domestic procedures.  
-   ***Global Innovation through Science and Technology (GIST)*:** The
    United States is committing $500,000 to expanding GIST into the
    Pacific to help island countries increase environmental and economic
    resilience by kick-starting businesses that focus on technology
    solutions to resiliency challenges, pending Congressional
    notification and domestic procedures.  
-   ***Transportation Partnership with the Pacific Islands*:** The
    Administration will provide $7 million in new funding through USTDA
    and the Department of Transportation, pending Congressional
    notification and domestic procedures, to support technical
    assistance on sustainable transportation infrastructure and
    accelerate decarbonization of the transportation sector. The

    aviation security representatives from Fiji, Kiribati and Samoa to
    the United States.  
-   ***Indo-Pacific Opportunities Program*:** USAID will invest $1
    million to strengthen Pacific Islands’ abilities to manage domestic
    financial resources to respond to economic shocks, improving
    capacity to better plan for, finance, implement, and manage
    infrastructure investments.  
-   ***Tourism in Solomon Islands*:** The Millennium Challenge
    Corporation (MCC) and the International Finance Corporation (IFC)
    will launch a new partnership with the Solomon Islands Ministry of
    Culture and Tourism aiming to spur tourism investments and jobs in
    the Solomon Islands. The United States and Solomon Islands signed a
    $20 million threshold program grant agreement to reduce poverty by
    addressing constraints to economic growth in the tourism and
    forestry sectors.

**  
VI. BOLSTER SECURITY COOPERATION AND MARITIME PROTECTION**

Geography links the United States’ security to the Pacific Islands. In
addition to its existing capacities in the region, the United States
will focus on investing in the Pacific Islands security capacity,
including coast guards, law enforcement, and disaster response.

-   ***Maritime Security and Marine Protection*:** The State Department
    is partnering with the U.S. Coast Guard to provide over $3 million
    to enhance U.S. Coast Guard training and capacity-building in the
    Pacific Islands for maritime security and marine protection.  
-   ***Law-Enforcement Training*:** The State Department is partnering
    with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to provide $2.8
    million for FBI-led law enforcement training to Pacific Island
    countries. Launched to enhance the capacity of the law-enforcement
    community in the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the
    Marshall Islands, and Palau, this program will expand in 2022 to

    currently engaged in bilateral security negotiations with Fiji for a
    new Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) and will soon
    begin negotiations with Papua New Guinea on a Defense Cooperation
    Agreement (DCA). The United States will pursue other opportunities
    to negotiate agreements that support Pacific objectives to respond
    to humanitarian disasters and protect their maritime domains.  
-   ***Global Defense Reform Program*:** The State Department will
    deliver $2 million in new assistance to improve security-sector
    governance and institutional capacity of select U.S. partners
    through advisory support efforts.

**  
VII. IMPROVE DIGITAL CONNECTIVITY AND CYBER SECURITY**

The United States will invest in work with the Pacific Islands to
improve the region’s connectivity, bandwidth, and cybersecurity.

-   ***Digital Connectivity and Cybersecurity Partnership*:** The
    Digital Connectivity and Cybersecurity Program will support up to
    $3.5 million over five years to support the digital transformation
    of Pacific Islands countries. It aims to foster an open,
    interoperable, reliable, and secure digital ecosystem in the Pacific
    Islands. Its priorities are to improve broadband access, strengthen
    digital policy and regulations, advance digital platforms and
    solutions for the delivery of public services, and enhance digital
    skills and literacy.

    Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu to detect, disrupt, and
    successfully prosecute cybercrimes.

**  
VIII. COMBAT COVID-19 AND SUPPORT HEALTH SECURITY**

COVID-19 has wrought devastation on the world, including in the Pacific;
the United States will provide further assistance to the Pacific,
including additional vaccines and economic assistance.

-   ***COVID-19 Vaccines*:** To date, the US has provided over 1 million
    life-saving doses of the Pfizer vaccine to the Pacific Island
    countries and continues important efforts to get “shots in arms”. We
    are proud to have delivered over 620 million doses to over 116
    countries. We continue to stand ready to offer vaccine doses to
    countries who need them through our partnership with COVAX to AMC
    eligible countries in the pacific rim region and around the world.  
-   ***Global Health Security Expansion to Pacific*:** Building on the
    $57 million in COVID assistance USAID has provided to the region
    since 2020, USAID plans to invest $5 million in Global Health
    Security (GHS) funds, to strengthen prevention, detection, and
    response capacities in PICs to minimize threats posed by emerging
    infectious diseases.  
-   ***Diminishing Dengue with Climate Services*:** The State Department
    intends to provide an additional $500,000 to develop dengue early
    warning and response systems in the Republic of the Marshall
    Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of
    Palau, to advance regional health security and climate resilience.

**  
IX. ADDRESS WAR LEGACIES**

The United States is committed to addressing the scars of war across the
Pacific region.

-   ***Addressing Unexploded Ordnance*:** Throughout the Pacific, the
    United States directly assists nations to expand safe land use for
    agriculture, infrastructure, development, and tourism projects
    through remediating unexploded ordnance (UXO). In Palau, the United
    States just provided $1.1 million to continue its support to a
    sustainable national UXO clearance program through the National UXO
    Safety Office. In the Solomon Islands, the United States is
    initiating a $1 million project to assist the Royal Solomon Islands
    Police Force to survey and remove UXO. The United States is also
    exploring UXO assistance options for Kiribati and the Marshall
    Islands in late 2022 and maintains a Quick Reaction Force to support
    UXO engagements across the Pacific at the request of host nation
    partners.
