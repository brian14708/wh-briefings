  19 Global Response and Recovery\_Framework"

Today, the Administration is releasing an updated COVID-19 Global
Response and Recovery Framework. The world is in a very different place
than when the first U.S. COVID-19 Global Response and Recovery Framework
was released in July 2021. At that time, tens of thousands of people
were dying from COVID-19 globally every week.  Vaccine doses were in
short supply globally, especially in low and lower-middle income
countries, and oral antiviral treatments had not yet been approved.  
  
Thanks to the leadership of the Biden Administration, the United States
is leading the global fight against COVID-19, donating over 620 million
doses of COVID-19 vaccines to 116 countries for free, more than any
other country, and supporting global efforts to get shots into arms. The
United States is proud to be an arsenal of vaccines for the world. 
Estimates indicate that global vaccinations averted nearly 20 million
deaths in 2021 alone, and almost 70% of the world’s population is now
vaccinated.  
  
While this is real progress, inequities persist, and our work is not
finished. Too many countries lack equitable access to vaccines, tests,
treatments and oxygen, and the capabilities needed to effectively
deliver them. COVID-19 has also disrupted other essential health
services and has placed an extraordinary burden on frontline health
workers. Gaps in the global health security architecture remain, leaving
us vulnerable to future COVID-19 variants and other pandemic threats.  
  
Despite these challenges, the U.S. commitment to an equitable COVID-19
response and recovery remains unwavering, and we recognize that the
United States and its international partners have the tools, expertise,
and global leadership to turn COVID-19 from a global emergency into a
manageable illness. Through driving forward in these areas, we hope to
honor the more than 6.5 million people globally whose lives have been
lost to this disease.  
  
This updated Framework aims to end the emergency phase of the pandemic,
asserting that the United States must work with its international
partners to minimize COVID-19-related cases, hospitalizations and
deaths; integrate COVID-19 response activities into existing health
systems while ensuring impacts on other health services are minimized;
and strengthen global readiness for future pandemic threats. To achieve
these goals, we must work with partners to vaccinate the highest risk
and hardest-to-reach; scale and integrate testing and treatment; and,
prepare for future variants and pandemic threats.  
  
Through this Framework, we aim to foster an equitable global recovery
and safeguard the economic well-being and security of people in the
United States and around the world.
