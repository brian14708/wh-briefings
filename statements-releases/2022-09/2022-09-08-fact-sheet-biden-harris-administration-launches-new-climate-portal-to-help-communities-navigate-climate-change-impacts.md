title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Launches New Climate Portal\
  \ to Help Communities Navigate Climate Change\_Impacts"
---
 
* Interactive Mapping Features Will Provide Communities with
Location-Based Information on Extreme Heat, Drought, Wildfires, and
Other Climate Impacts*

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is launching a website that, for
the first time, provides a live dashboard to help communities see
extreme weather and other hazards from climate change they are facing,
while also providing maps projecting how each community could be
impacted in the future. The new [Climate Mapping for Resilience and
Adaptation portal](https://resilience.climate.gov) will help state,
local, Tribal, and territorial governments and leaders better track
real-time impacts and access federal resources for long-term
planning.   

Americans are feeling the intensifying impacts of the climate
crisis—from extreme heat across the country, including the dangerous
“heat dome” gripping California this week; record-breaking floods across
the South and Midwest; Western drought straining the water supplies that
millions depend on; and more wildfires threatening communities. Last
year, the 20 largest climate-related disasters alone took hundreds of
lives, caused untold hardships, and racked up more than [$150 billion in
damages](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/time-series).

In addition to providing more detailed, location-specific data about
climate threats, the new portal also brings together multiple federal
information sources and funding opportunities to help communities better
prepare for and respond to climate impacts—including historic resilience
funding from the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for states
and communities around the country. Together with the Inflation
Reduction Act, the Biden-Harris Administration is providing historic
levels of support to expand resilience programs, protect U.S.
communities, economies, and infrastructure from the worsening impacts of
climate change, and improve the nation’s climate mapping and data
capabilities.

**<u>Helping Communities Better Understand and Plan for Climate
Risk</u>**

The Climate Mapping for Resilience and Adaptation portal is a
first-of-its kind hub that will help communities, federal agencies, and
other levels of government better understand current exposure to climate
risks to strengthen their resilience plans. The portal, which will
continue to evolve to meet community needs, includes:

-   **Real-time monitoring dashboard:** To help track the
    climate-related hazards that are affecting communities each day, a
    new dashboard brings together maps showing areas currently under
    extreme heat advisories, drought conditions, and inland and coastal
    flooding warnings, as well as the locations of active wildfires and
    areas of poor air quality they produce.  
-   **Assessments of local climate exposure:** In addition to real-time
    data about extreme weather events, the portal also helps communities
    understand their historic and future exposure to various climate
    impacts. The portal’s [Assessment
    Tool](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/assessment-tool) provides
    hazard reports on heat, drought, and flooding down to the census
    tract level, including projections of future impacts in both low and
    high-emissions scenarios, based on climate models used in the U.S.
    National Climate Assessment. This interactive application will [help
    local resilience planners and other
    users](https://resilience.climate.gov/pages/learn-more) understand
    how future temperature, precipitation, and flooding conditions may
    impact their community in the near-term and by mid- and
    late-century.
-   **Funding opportunities and other federal resources:** The portal
    also centralizes federal data, programs, and funding opportunities
    that are available to support resilience efforts—including
    [resources](https://resilience.climate.gov/#hazard-info) for extreme
    heat, drought, wildfire, flooding, and coastal inundation and sea
    level rise. The CMRA Assessment Tool will also help state, local,
    Tribal, and territorial governments develop data-driven proposals to
    access federal funding.

**<u>Building on Climate Data Efforts Across the Administration</u>**

The new web portal is an outgrowth of a [National Climate Task Force
initiative to provide more accessible climate information and decision
tools](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/12/fact-sheet-biden-administration-makes-climate-information-and-decision-tools-more-accessible/),
as directed by President Biden in his Executive Order on Tackling the
Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad. As part of this initiative, last year
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) launched a
redesigned [Climate.gov](https://www.climate.gov/) and this year the
National Integrated Heat Health Information System launched the new
[Heat.gov](https://www.heat.gov/)—using data sources that are now
incorporated into the CMRA portal.

The Assessment Tool also integrates information from federal initiatives
including:

-   **Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool:** As part of the
    Biden-Harris Administration’s Justice40 Initiative, this [screening
    tool](https://screeningtool.geoplatform.gov/) identifies
    disadvantaged communities that are marginalized, underserved, and
    overburdened by pollution. The Assessment Tool identifies these
    census tracts as well, helping planners at all levels of government
    prioritize equity as they design and implement resilience
    projects.  
-   **Building Code Adoption Tracking Portal:** As part of the
    Biden-Harris Administration’s [National Initiative to Advance
    Building
    Codes](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/01/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-launches-initiative-to-modernize-building-codes-improve-climate-resilience-and-reduce-energy-costs/),
    FEMA continues to update its Building Code Adoption Tracking portal
    on the status of state, local, Tribal, and territorial building
    codes and whether these codes provide resistance to hazards such as
    floods, hurricanes, and tornados. This information on whether an
    area is covered by a hazard-resistant building code is shown in the
    Assessment Tool.  
-   **Updated Sea Level Rise data:** Earlier this year, the
    Administration issued the [2022 Sea Level Rise Technical
    Report](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/hazards/sealevelrise/sealevelrise-tech-report.html),
    with updated sea level rise projections out to the year 2150 for all
    U.S. states and territories. This data is incorporated throughout
    the portal’s resources on coastal inundation.

Under President Biden’s leadership, the Administration has secured
historic new investments to further improve our nation’s climate mapping
and data capabilities. NOAA is using resources [ from the Bipartisan
Infrastructure
Law](https://www.noaa.gov/infrastructure-law/infrastructure-law-climate-data-and-services)
to enhance a wide array of climate data and services, including flood
forecasting, soil moisture monitoring, and wildfire prediction and
detection. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act provides resources
for NOAA to improve computing capacity, forecasting, and research for
weather and climate impacts, as well as over funding for the Council on
Environmental Quality to boost data collection on disproportionate
environmental harms and climate impacts.
