President Biden and Prime Minister Lapid launched the U.S.-Israel
Strategic High-Level Dialogue on Technology in July to establish a
partnership on critical and emerging technologies to bring the
cooperation between the countries to new heights.  On September 28,
National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Israeli National Security
Advisor Dr. Eyal Hulata led the first meeting of the Dialogue in
Washington, DC. 

The U.S.-Israel technological partnership has never been stronger, and
senior representatives from the White House National Security Council,
the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Department
of State, the Department of Commerce, the Department of the Treasury,
the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, the Department of
Agriculture, the Department of Health and Human Services, including the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Science
Foundation held discussions with senior representatives from the Israel
National Security Council, the Ministry of Innovation, Science and
Technology, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Energy, the Ministry

existing collaboration mechanisms or creating new bilateral avenues on
an as-needed basis. The United States and Israel look forward to
reviewing progress on cooperation at the next meeting of the Dialogue in
