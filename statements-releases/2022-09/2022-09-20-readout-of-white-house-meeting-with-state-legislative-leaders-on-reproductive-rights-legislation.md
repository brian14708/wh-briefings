  \ Rights\_Legislation"

Today, Jen Klein, Director of the White House Gender Policy Council, and
Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Senior Advisor to the President and Director of
the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, chaired a meeting
with state legislative leaders on state legislative efforts to advance
access to reproductive health care amidst unprecedented attacks from
Republican officials.  
   
So far in 2022, 12 states have enacted more than 25 bills to protect and
expand access to abortion, including by expanding who can provide
abortions; advancing private and state funding of abortion services;
taking steps to protect providers and patients; and codifying the right
to abortion into state law. In May, prior to the Supreme Court’s
decision in *Dobbs v. Jackson*, White House Senior Officials [met

legislative leaders from states working on proactive reproductive rights
legislation. A week after the decision, the President met with
[Governors](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/01/readout-of-president-bidens-meeting-with-governors-on-reproductive-rights/)
to discuss opportunities for executive action and their support for
proactive state legislative agendas to protect and expand access to
reproductive health care. Since then, several states have passed
legislation to support access to abortion, including California,
Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York.  
   
In the meeting, state legislative leaders discussed the affirmative
steps they have taken so far, and shared proposals to protect
reproductive health and rights under consideration for the 2023 state
legislative session. White House Senior Officials thanked the leaders
for their efforts and ongoing partnership with the White House.
