Carnahan, and Deputy National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi Announced the
Actions While Visiting Cleveland-Cliffs Direct Reduction steel plant in
Toledo*

Today, as America’s manufacturing resurgence continues, the Biden-Harris
Administration is announcing new actions under its [Federal Buy Clean
Initiative](/Users/CRRidgeway/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/WKEEMFUC/sustainability.gov/buyclean)
in Toledo, Ohio, to spur the development of low-carbon construction
materials made in America while supporting good-paying jobs.
Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, U.S. General Services
Administration  Administrator Robin Carnahan, and Deputy National
Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi announced the Federal Government will
prioritize the purchase of key low carbon construction materials,
covering 98% of materials purchased by the Federal Government, while
visiting a Cleveland-Cliffs Direct Reduction steel plant in Toledo.  
  
The Cleveland-Cliffs Direct Reduction steel plant represents the future
of U.S. clean manufacturing, producing a lower-carbon intermediary
feedstock product that is integrated into steel plate used in a wide
variety of products purchased by the Federal Government, including
automobiles, electricity grid transformers, bridge decks, offshore wind
platforms, naval submarines, and train tracks.  
  
The Federal Buy Clean Initiative is a part of President Biden’s economic
plan—including the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction
Act, and CHIPS and Science Act—to usher in a manufacturing boom in
America. The Initiative ensures that federal financing and purchasing
power are creating good-paying jobs, protecting public health, enhancing
American competitiveness, and strengthening national security. Today’s
Federal Buy Clean actions build on [Buy Clean
commitments](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/15/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-advances-cleaner-industrial-sector-to-reduce-emissions-and-reinvigorate-american-manufacturing/)
made earlier this year, including standing up the first ever Federal Buy
Clean Task Force, and complements a comeback for American factories
since President Biden took office, with 668,000 manufacturing jobs
added.  
  
The Federal Government is the largest direct purchaser in the world and
a major infrastructure funder. By leveraging the U.S. Government’s
purchasing power, President Biden is ensuring that American
manufacturing is positioned to compete and lead, while catalyzing
markets and accelerating innovation across the country. In addition to
the historic funding in the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,
his Inflation Reduction Act provides a boost for the Federal Buy Clean
Initiative with $4.5 billion in funding for the General Services
Administration, Department of Transportation, and Environmental
Protection Agency to designate and use construction materials and
products that produce substantially lower levels of greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions. The Inflation Reduction Act also provides the Department of
Energy with billions to invest in retrofitting industrial facilities and
tax credits for clean technology manufacturing.  
  
The U.S. manufacturing sector produces the materials that are critical
to rebuilding and strengthening the nation’s infrastructure but is
responsible for nearly a third of U.S. greenhouse emissions from
industrial processes. Through the Biden-Harris Administration’s Federal
Buy Clean Initiative and Task Force, the Federal Government is for the
first time providing a market differentiation and incentives for
lower-carbon materials. Companies across the nation will be rewarded for
cutting carbon pollution across their entire value chains while
supporting good American manufacturing jobs.  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration will:

-   **Prioritize the Federal Government’s purchase of steel, concrete,
    asphalt and flat glass that have lower levels of emissions.** The
    Federal Government will purchase these key construction materials
    when they have fewer embodied emissions, the greenhouse gas (GHG)
    emissions associated with their manufacturing, transportation,
    installation, maintenance, and disposal. These four construction
    materials are some of the most carbon-intensive, accounting for
    nearly half of all U.S. manufacturing GHG emissions, and
    representing 98% of the government’s purchased construction
    materials. The Buy Clean Task Force will provide instructions to
    agencies for integrating Buy Clean into federal procurement and
    funding processes. The Biden Administration anticipates prioritizing
    additional construction materials and pollutants for Buy Clean
    Federal procurement.  
-   **Expand lower-carbon construction materials used in
    federally-funded projects.** In addition to federal procurement, Buy
    Clean will cover federally-funded projects. For example, the
    Department of Transportation, which is administering more than $120
    billion in infrastructure spending in FY22, is announcing the first
    agency-wide Buy Clean policy and Embodied Carbon Work Group to drive
    progress. The initiative will jumpstart better data and reporting,
    better procurement and purchasing policies, and better education and
    research to ensure the use of sustainable materials across its
    programs.  
-   **Convening states to partner on Buy Clean:** The Federal Buy Clean
    Initiative is jumpstarting a new partnership, bringing together
    state governments alongside federal partners to align state-based
    Buy Clean policies with federal incentives to expand markets for
    clean manufacturing and low carbon materials across the nation’s
    buildings and infrastructure. Next month, the White House will
    convene States to share knowledge and build capacity for public
    construction projects that support American workers and lower carbon
    emissions.  
-   **Increase data transparency through supplier reporting to help
    American manufacturers track and reduce emissions**. The
    administration will expand the reliability, transparency and
    verification of environmental product declarations (EPDs) including
    GHG emissions reporting for actual supply chain production of these
    materials. This will be supported by $100 million for program costs
    and $250 million for grants and technical assistance by the
    Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  
-   **Launch pilot programs to advance federal procurement of clean
    construction materials.** Federal Buy Clean Initiative pilots have
    already broken ground across the country—from Denver, Colorado to
    Salt Lake City, Utah to Champlain, New York to Lukeville, Arizona—in
    partnership with regional contractors and subcontractors including
    engineering, architecture and materials firms, with technical
    support from DOE, EPA and USDA.

**What agencies are doing to implement Buy Clean**: The Buy Clean Task
Force will lead by example and increase its members to eight additional
agencies: the Departments of Commerce, Homeland Security, Housing and
Urban Development, Health and Human Services, Interior, and State, the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and Veterans
Administration. These members join the Departments of Agriculture,
Defense, Energy and Transportation as well as the Council on
Environmental Quality (CEQ), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
General Services Administration (GSA), Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) and the White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy. Together,
the expanded Task Force agencies account for 90% of all
federally-financed and purchased construction materials. The Buy Clean
Task Force will continue to launch pilots, expand the scope of
industrial pollutants and materials, engage industry, and establish
mechanisms for collection and public disclosure of the data.  
  
Building on

Buy Clean efforts, agencies continue to deliver on the Federal Buy Clean
Initiative: 

-   The **Department of Agriculture (USDA)** is supporting innovations
    in construction materials made from sustainably-harvested and waste
    bio-materials to integrate into and potentially replace
    carbon-intensive materials.  
-   The **Department of Transportation (DOT)** has successfully included
    criteria in several discretionary grant programs to incentivize the
    use of materials that reduce carbon emissions. In June 2022, the
    Department’s Chief Sustainability Officer along with the Office of
    the Senior Procurement Executive also launched a Lower Carbon
    Procurement Pilot to increase utilization of environmental product
    declarations (EPDs) and encourage the acquisition of products and
    materials with low embodied carbon emissions. In April 2022, the
    Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) issued a *Climate Challenge*
    with grant funding to reduce the lifecycle emissions associated with
    the design, construction, and maintenance of pavements that received
    40 submissions from 25 states. FHWA also launched a tool, known as
    LCA PAVE, that can be used to assess environmental impacts of
    pavement material and design decisions. The Department’s Embodied
    Carbon Working Group will support the new efforts to ensure all of
    USDOT’s modal administrations are prioritizing Buy Clean.  
     
-   The **Department of Energy** (**DOE)** is supporting Buy Clean with
    training, technical assistance, and innovation grants. The Building
    Technology Office is building tools such
    as [GREET](https://greet.es.anl.gov/greet_building) for whole
    building lifecycle analysis and the Advanced Manufacturing Office is
    supporting with tools such as
    [LIGHTEnUp](https://eta.lbl.gov/publications/lifecycle-industry-greenhouse-gas)
    and [MFI](https://www.nrel.gov/manufacturing/mfi-modeling-tool.html)
    to support standard-setting for specific products.  
     
-   The **Department of Defense** (**DOD)** and the military departments
    are analyzing modernization requirements for process, guidance,
    criteria, and specifications to accelerate the transition to
    low-carbon building materials. This includes screening potential
    projects to implement Buy Clean specifications and coordinating with
    U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center’s Geotechnical
    and Structures Laboratory and Construction Engineering Research
    Laboratory to analyze the life-cycle carbon footprint, costs,
    resilience, and timeliness of low-carbon building materials.  
-   The **Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)** is supporting the
    Federal Buy Clean Initiative by emphasizing the urgency of investing
    in energy efficiency across manufacturing facilities with access to
    the ENERGY STAR program for industry’s plant energy performance
    benchmarking tools, and enabling facility-level industrial carbon
    emissions via facility benchmarking data in the GHG Reporting
    Program and EPA’s Center for Corporate Climate Leadership. EPA is
    also working with external partners to standardize and improve
    environmental product declaration (EPDs) guidelines.  
-   The **General Services Administration (GSA)** on March 30, 2022,
    issued their first [“Buy Clean”
    standards](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/gsa-lightens-the-environmental-footprint-of-its-building-materials-03302022)
    for the concrete and asphalt used in all future projects with more
    than one truckload of material. GSA will require suppliers to
    provide environmental product declarations and meet low-carbon
    concrete and environmentally preferable asphalt standards informed
    by insights from industry. This policy is being used immediately for
    the Land Port of Entry improvement projects funded by the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law and will be accelerated with funding from the
    Inflation Reduction Act. GSA will also issue a request for
    information (RFI) to hear directly from manufacturers — including
    small businesses — on the availability of construction material and
    products with lower embodied carbon. Findings from that RFI will
    help the government understand industry trends and opportunities.  
-   The **Department of State** and U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for
    Climate are aggregating corporate purchasing commitments of near and
    net-zero materials through the [First Movers
    Coalition](https://www.state.gov/launching-the-first-movers-coalition-at-the-2021-un-climate-change-conference/).
    The Department has also launched a Decarbonization Initiative,
    focused on reducing embodied emissions in overseas construction at
    embassies and other facilities.  
-   The **Department of Commerce** through the [National Institute for
    Standards and Technology
    (NIST)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/06/14/2022-12744/low-carbon-cements-and-concretes-consortium)
    is assessing standards for lower-carbon cement and concrete and
    integrating embodied emissions considerations through EPDs into the
    widely-used Building for Environmental and Economic Sustainability
     tool.
