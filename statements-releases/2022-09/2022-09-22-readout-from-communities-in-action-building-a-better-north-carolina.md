---
 
Today, the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and the
Office of Public Engagement hosted nearly 50 state and local elected
officials, Tribal leaders, and community leaders from across North
Carolina in a “Communities in Action: Building a Better North Carolina”
event. During the half-day forum, participants spoke with senior
Biden-Harris Administration officials – including Second Gentleman
Douglas Emhoff, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael
Regan, Senior Advisor and Director of Intergovernmental Affairs Julie
Rodriguez, Senior Advisor and Director of Public Engagement Keisha Lance
Bottoms, White House Infrastructure Implementation Coordinator Mitch
Landrieu, and White House American Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene Sperling
– about the benefits and impact of President Biden’s American Rescue
Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act, and the
CHIPS and Science Act for working families in the state of North
Carolina. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper provided video remarks, and
U.S. Congresswoman Kathy Manning (NC-6) also participated in the event.
White House officials discussed how the Biden-Harris Administration will
continue to work together with states and local governments, labor
leaders, businesses, non-profits, and health care leaders to leverage
these historic investments to create and expand opportunities for
working families in the Tar Heel state. They also discussed how the
state has already experienced a significant addition of manufacturing
jobs as a result of the Biden-Harris Economic Blueprint and the
President’s focus on revitalizing American manufacturing while building
a clean energy economy. This was the second in a series of “Communities
in Action” events that the White House will host with state, local and
Tribal leaders to demonstrate how the Biden-Harris Administration is
delivering results for the American people.
