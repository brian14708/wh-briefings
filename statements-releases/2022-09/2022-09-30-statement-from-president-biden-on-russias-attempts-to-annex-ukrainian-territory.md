title: "Statement from President\_Biden on Russia\u2019s Attempts to Annex Ukrainian\_\
  Territory"
---
 
The United States condemns Russia’s fraudulent attempt today to annex
sovereign Ukrainian territory. Russia is violating international law,
trampling on the United Nations Charter, and showing its contempt for
peaceful nations everywhere.  
   
Make no mistake: these actions have no legitimacy. The United States
will always honor Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders. We will
continue to support Ukraine’s efforts to regain control of its territory
by strengthening its hand militarily and diplomatically, including
through the $1.1 billion in additional security assistance the United
States announced this week.  
   
In response to Russia’s phony claims of annexation, the United States,
together with our Allies and partners, are announcing new sanctions
today. These sanctions will impose costs on individuals and entities —
inside and outside of Russia — that provide political or economic
support to illegal attempts to change the status of Ukrainian
territory. We will rally the international community to both denounce
these moves and to hold Russia accountable. We will continue to provide
Ukraine with the equipment it needs to defend itself, undeterred by
Russia’s brazen effort to redraw the borders of its neighbor. And I look
forward to signing legislation from Congress that will provide an
additional $12 billion to support Ukraine.  
   
I urge all members of the international community to reject Russia’s
illegal attempts at annexation and to stand with the people of Ukraine
for as long as it takes.
