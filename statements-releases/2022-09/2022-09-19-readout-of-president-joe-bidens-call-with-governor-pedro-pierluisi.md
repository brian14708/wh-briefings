title: "Readout of President Joe\_Biden\u2019s Call with Governor Pedro\_Pierluisi"
---
 
President Biden spoke to Governor Pedro Pierluisi today from Air Force
One while returning from the State Funeral for Queen Elizabeth II. 
President Biden and the Governor discussed the immediate needs of the
people of Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Fiona.  President Biden
described the surge of Federal support to the island, where more than
300 Federal personnel are already working to assist with response and
recovery.  In the coming days, as damage assessments are conducted, the
President said that number of support personnel will increase
substantially.  
  
The President said that he will ensure that the Federal team remains on
the job to get it done, especially given that Puerto Rico is still
recovering from the damage of Hurricane Maria five years ago this week.
 Governor Pierluisi expressed his appreciation for the partnership and
support that he is receiving already from the Biden Administration.    
  
FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell will travel to Puerto Rico tomorrow
to meet with State and local officials and impacted citizens and assess
urgent needs that the President has directed FEMA to meet.
