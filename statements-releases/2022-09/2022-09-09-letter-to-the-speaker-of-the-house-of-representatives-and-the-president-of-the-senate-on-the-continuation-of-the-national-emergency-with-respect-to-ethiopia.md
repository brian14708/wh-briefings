Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)  
  
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d))
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless,
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the
President publishes in the *Federal Register* and transmits to the
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect
beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have
sent to the *Federal Register* for publication the enclosed notice
stating that the national emergency with respect to Ethiopia that was
declared in Executive Order 14046 of September 17, 2021, is to continue
in effect beyond September 17, 2022.  
  
The situation in and in relation to northern Ethiopia, has been marked
by activities that threaten the peace, security, and stability of
Ethiopia and the greater Horn of Africa region — in particular,
widespread violence, atrocities, and serious human rights abuse,
including those involving ethnic-based violence, rape and other forms of
gender-based violence, and obstruction of humanitarian operations —
continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national
security and foreign policy of the United States.  Therefore, I have
determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency
declared in Executive Order 14046 with respect to Ethiopia.

                               Sincerely,    
  
                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
