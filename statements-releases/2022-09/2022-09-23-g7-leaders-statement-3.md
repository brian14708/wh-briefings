We, the Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7), [strongly
condemn](https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/aktuelles/g7-leaders-statement-2129348)
the sham referenda that Russia attempts to use to create a phony pretext
for changing the status of Ukrainian sovereign territory, which is
subject to an ongoing Russian aggression. These actions clearly breach
the United Nations Charter and international law and go diametrically
against the rule of law among nations.  
   
These sham referenda initiated today by Russia and its proxies have no
legal effect or legitimacy, as demonstrated by Russia’s hasty methods of
organisation, which in no way respect democratic norms, and its blatant
intimidation of local populations. These referenda in areas that have
been forcibly put under Russia’s temporary control in no way represent a
legitimate expression of the will of the Ukrainian people, who have
consistently resisted Russian efforts to change borders by force. We
will never recognise these referenda which appear to be a step toward
Russian annexation and we will never recognise a purported annexation if
it occurs.  
   
In addition, we deplore deliberate Russian escalatory steps, including
the partial mobilisation of reservists and irresponsible nuclear
rhetoric.  
   
We call upon all countries to unequivocally reject these sham referenda
as Russia’s attempt to give false cover to its violations of
international law. We stand ready to impose further economic costs on
Russia, and on individuals and entities – inside and outside of Russia
–providing political or economic support for Russia’s illegal attempts
to change the status of Ukrainian territory.  
  
We are steadfast in our commitment to providing the support Ukraine
needs to uphold ist sovereignty and territorial integrity, to defend
itself, and to choose its own future. We will continue to provide
financial, humanitarian, military, diplomatic and legal support, and
will move ahead on reconstruction efforts, including through the
International Expert Conference on the Recovery, Reconstruction and
Modernisation of Ukraine in Berlin on 25 October.  
   
We will stand firmly with Ukraine for as long as it takes.
