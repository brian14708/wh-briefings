title: "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:  Biden-\u2060Harris Administration National Strategy on\
  \ Hunger, Nutrition, and\_Health"
---
 
More than 50 years since the first White House Conference on Food,
Nutrition, and Health, the U.S. has yet to end hunger and is facing an
urgent, nutrition-related health crisis*—*the rising prevalence of
diet-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension,
and certain cancers. The consequences of food insecurity and
diet-related diseases are significant, far reaching, and
disproportionately impact historically underserved communities. Yet,
food insecurity and diet-related diseases are largely preventable, if we
prioritize the health of the nation.

The Biden-Harris Administration envisions an America where no one
wonders whether they will have enough money to put food on the table,
where the healthy food choice is the easier choice, and where everyone
has the same opportunity to be physically active. Transformative
programs, policies, and system changes are needed within and outside
government to achieve this vision. There is no silver bullet to address
these complex issues, and there is no overnight fix. Making progress
requires collective, sustained action and mobilization across every
segment of society. **That is why President Biden announced a goal of
ending hunger and increasing healthy eating and physical activity by
2030 so fewer Americans experience diet-related diseases***—* **while
reducing related health disparities.**

To advance the President’s goal*—*and build on the federal government’s
existing work to address hunger and diet-related diseases*—*this
strategy identifies ambitious and achievable actions the Biden-Harris
Administration will pursue across five pillars:

1.  **Improving food access and affordability,** including by advancing
    economic security; increasing access to free and nourishing school
    meals; providing Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) benefits
    to more children; and expanding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
    Program (SNAP) eligibility to more underserved populations;  
2.  **Integrating nutrition and health,** including by working with
    Congress to pilot coverage of medically tailored meals in Medicare;
    testing Medicaid coverage of nutrition education and other nutrition
    supports using Medicaid section 1115 demonstration projects; and
    expanding Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries’ access to nutrition
    and obesity counseling;  
3.  **Empowering all consumers to make and have access to healthy
    choices,** including by proposing to develop a front-of-package
    labeling scheme for food packages; proposing to update the nutrition
    criteria for the “healthy” claim on food packages; expanding
    incentives for fruits and vegetables in SNAP; facilitating sodium
    reduction in the food supply by issuing longer-term, voluntary
    sodium targets for industry; and assessing additional steps to
    reduce added sugar consumption, including potential voluntary
    targets;  
4.  **Supporting physical activity for all,** including by expanding the
    U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Centers for Disease
    Control and Prevention’s (CDC) State Physical Activity and Nutrition
    Program to all states and territories; investing in efforts to
    connect people to parks and other outdoor spaces; and funding
    regular updates to and promotion of the *Physical Activity
    Guidelines for Americans*; and  
5.  **Enhancing nutrition and food security research,** including by
    bolstering funding to improve metrics, data collection, and research
    to inform nutrition and food security policy, particularly on issues
    of equity and access; and implementing a vision for advancing
    nutrition science.

The federal government cannot end hunger and reduce diet-related
diseases alone. The private sector; state, Tribal, local, and territory
governments; academia; and nonprofit and community groups must act as
well. This strategy details Calls to Action for all these entities to do
their part. Taken together, these collective efforts will make a
difference and move us closer to achieving the 2030 goal.
