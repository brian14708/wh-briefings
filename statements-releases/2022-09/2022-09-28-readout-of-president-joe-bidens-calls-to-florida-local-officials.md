---
 
President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. today made separate calls to the Mayors
of Fort Myers, Cape Coral, Sarasota and the Chair of Charlotte County,
Florida to let them know their communities have the full force of the
Federal government behind them as Hurricane Ian makes landfall in
Florida. President Biden was able to reach Mayor Kevin Anderson, and
they discussed Fort Myersâ€™ ongoing needs including support for the
elderly members of the community, families that live in mobile homes and
other community members who are particularly vulnerable to the impacts
of the storm. Messages were left for the Mayors of Cape Coral and
Sarasota, as well as the Chair of Charlotte County.
