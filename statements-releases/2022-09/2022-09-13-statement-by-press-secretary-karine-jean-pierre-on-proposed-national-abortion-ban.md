title: "Statement by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Proposed National Abortion\_\
  Ban"
---
 
Today, Senator Graham introduced a national ban on abortion which would
strip away women’s rights in all 50 states. This bill is wildly out of
step with what Americans believe.  
   
While President Biden and Vice President Harris are focused on the
historic passage of the Inflation Reduction Act to reduce the cost of
prescription drugs, health care, and energy – and to take unprecedented
action to address climate change – Republicans in Congress are focused
on taking rights away from millions of women. The President and Vice
President are fighting for progress, while Republicans are fighting to
take us back.  
   
President Biden and Congressional Democrats are committed to restoring
the protections of *Roe v. Wade* in the face of continued radical steps
by elected Republicans to put personal health care decisions in the
hands of politicians instead of women and their doctors, threatening
women’s health and lives.
