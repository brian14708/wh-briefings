title: "Declaration on U.S.-Pacific\_Partnership"
---
 
We—the governments of Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia,
Fiji, French Polynesia, Nauru, New Caledonia, Palau, Papua New Guinea,
Republic of the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu,
Vanuatu, and the United States of America—meet on the occasion of the
first-ever U.S.- Pacific Islands Summit, held at the White House in
Washington, D.C. from 28-29 September 2022. Forged by shared history,
sacrifice, and values, our partnership has contributed to prosperity,
peace, and security in the Pacific Islands, the United States, and the
world for generations. Today, in the face of a worsening climate crisis
and an increasingly complex geopolitical environment, we recommit
ourselves to working together in genuine partnership to address the
mounting challenges of our time.  
**  
First, we resolve to strengthening our partnership.**        
      
We share a vision for a resilient Pacific region of peace, harmony,
security, social inclusion, and prosperity, where individuals can reach
their potential, the environment can thrive, and democracy will be able
to flourish. The Pacific Islands vision is reflected in its guiding
documents which include the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific
Continent, a vision that the United States strongly supports. Achieving
our shared vision requires a sustained partnership that is rooted in
mutual respect, transparency, and accountability. This long-term
partnership will require greater capacity; Pacific leaders welcome the
United States’ commitment to enhance its engagement, including by
expanding its diplomatic presence, the ties between our peoples, and
U.S. development cooperation across the region.  
   
We place the highest priority on the resolution of unresolved issues and
the timely and successful completion of negotiations relating to the
Compacts of Free Association between the United States and the Federated
States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the
Republic of Palau—one of the cornerstones of U.S.-Pacific cooperation
for nearly four decades. The United States recognizes that new resources
must be part of any successful negotiation. The United States will
amplify its efforts as a Dialogue Partner in the Pacific Islands Forum
and will work with partners in consultation with the Pacific to deliver
results for the region efficiently, effectively, and transparently.  
   
**Second, we commit to bolstering Pacific regionalism.**  
   
The Pacific Islands region is stronger united. We acknowledge the
important role played by the Pacific Islands Forum in this regard.  
      
Together we commit to bolstering Pacific regionalism, elevating and
strengthening Pacific voices in international fora, and enhancing U.S.
engagement with relevant Pacific regional organizations, including the
Pacific Islands Forum and the Council of Regional Organizations of the
Pacific agencies. We will seek greater connectivity between these
organizations and other partners who share Pacific objectives and
values.  
   
We recognize the central role of the international system, particularly
the United Nations, in addressing transnational challenges. Crises will
continue to affect our global community in the future. We therefore
recognize the urgency of strengthening the global governance
architecture to make it fit for purpose and to ensure effective and
timely responses to such crises, taking into account the special
circumstances of small island developing states (SIDS).   
   
**Third, we are committed to tackling the climate crisis together as a
priority.**  
      
We take the climate crisis as the highest priority of our partnership,
for it remains the single greatest existential threat to the
livelihoods, security, traditional and customary practices, and
wellbeing of people in the Pacific region, including as reflected in the
*Boe Declaration on Regional Security*.     
      
We are united in our commitment to implement the Paris Agreement and we
are committed to work together to advance progress at COP27 and beyond.
We urge all countries – especially major emitters – whose 2030
nationally determined contributions targets are not yet aligned with the
Paris temperature goal to increase their ambition and align such targets
with a 1.5 °C pathway  before COP27. We urge all developed countries to
deliver on their commitment to the goal of mobilizing $100 billion
annually through 2025 to support developing countries, in the context of
meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation. We
urge all countries to reduce collective anthropogenic methane emissions
at least 30 percent by 2030 from 2020 levels.        
   
We recognize the importance of international collaboration and
accelerated action especially within this decade on aviation and
shipping emissions, to help put both sectors on a pathway aligned with
keeping a 1.5 °C limit to temperature rise within reach.      
       
As we combat the climate crisis, we will also work together to enhance
the Pacific Islands’ climate resilience; increase their access to
climate finance; cooperate to support the Pacific Islands to adapt to
the impacts of climate change, from rising sea levels to more frequent
flooding, cyclones and typhoons, drought and extreme weather events that
contribute to the heightened risk of water, energy; and food and health
insecurity.  We are further committed to working together and with other
countries and stakeholders to scale up finance and support related to
averting, minimizing and addressing loss and damage, in particular for
vulnerable developing countries.  
   
**Fourth**, **we** **are committed to enhancing** **our cooperation to
advance economic growth and sustainable development in the Pacific**.  
   
We commit to linking our economies more closely for the benefit of all
our peoples.  
      
We also seek to forge links within the region, supporting
infrastructure, transportation connectivity, cybersecurity capacities,
and digital infrastructure in the Pacific.  
   
We will be expanding our cooperation to enhance the development of the
sustainable blue economy, including small- and medium-sized enterprises,
labor, forestry, fisheries, agriculture, trade, tourism, and addressing
supply chains issues and food security.  
      
We recognize that the COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on Pacific
economies. Economic recovery will be a top priority requiring finance
not only for rebuilding purposes but to meet the commitments we made in
the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable
Development Goals. To this end, we support the work of the UN Panel on
Multidimensional Vulnerability Index (MVI) for Small Island Developing
States and look forward to their recommendations. We encourage relevant
international institutions to consider incorporating the MVI into their
assessment processes where appropriate.  
   
We further acknowledge the urgent and immediate need for assistance with
vulnerability to debt, post-COVID-19.  
      
**Fifth, we are committed to supporting each other to better prepare and
respond to natural disasters.**  
   
The Pacific region continues to bear the brunt of extreme natural
disasters from dangerous high tides, tsunamis, ashfalls and volcanic
eruptions, earthquakes, and increasing frequency of severe cyclones,
hurricanes, and droughts. The increasing occurrence of these natural
disasters poses existential threats to Pacific SIDS and require
protracted periods of recovery, putting further pressure on limited
fiscal spending space. To this end, urgent actions and long-term
planning are required to increase the capacity of Pacific SIDS to
predict and cope with these disasters and to implement adaptation,
disaster risk reduction, and resilience strategies. The recent events in
Tonga, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and Kiribati in recent years clearly
demonstrate the devastation of natural disasters in the region.  
   
**Sixth**, **we resolve to protect the Blue Pacific and enhance the laws
that govern it.**  
   
Together we will strengthen our cooperation on maritime security,
maritime conservation, and the sustainable use of the Pacific Ocean
based on the rule of law.  
   
We acknowledge the threats posed by climate change-related sea-level
rise to regional security, peace, prosperity, and development. It is
essential that maritime zones and the rights and entitlements that flow
from them must be maintained without reduction, notwithstanding any
physical changes connected to climate change-related sea-level rise,
recognizing that SIDS and other coastal States have planned their
development in reliance on their rights to such maritime zones. We will
continue to cooperate on fisheries-related economic development and
oceans resilience through the Multilateral Treaty on Fisheries between
the Pacific Islands States and the Government of the United States of
America and its related Economic Assistance Agreement, while also
forging new ties to improve maritime domain awareness, search and
rescue, and maritime security; to curb the scourge of marine debris and
plastic pollution; and to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated
fishing—a threat to the Pacific environment and livelihoods.  
   
We will build partner capacity and capability to ensure rapid response
to contingencies and emerging threats, including maritime security and
safety.  
   
Together we will find solutions to the major challenges facing the Ocean
including through our commitment to conserve and protect 30% of the
Ocean by 2030. We further commit to concluding very soon negotiations on
the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework under the Convention on
Biological Diversity and a robust international legally binding
instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on
the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of
areas beyond national jurisdiction. We renew our commitment to
implementing Sustainable Development Goal 14 of the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development including its targets through genuine and
durable partnerships, in a manner that fully addresses the special
circumstances of SIDS.  
   
We reaffirm the legal rights and obligations that apply with respect to
all states under international law as reflected in UNCLOS.  
   
**Seventh,** **we resolve to maintain peace and security across the Blue
Pacific Continent.**  
   
The Blue Pacific Continent has been a place of peace for nearly eight
decades. We seek to ensure it remains so. In promoting peace and
security, we recognize the importance of international law as reflected
in UNCLOS, including on freedom of navigation and overflight. We will
oppose all efforts to undermine the territorial integrity and
sovereignty of any country, large or small. We condemn all wars of
aggression, including Russia’s brutal war against Ukraine.
                      
      
We reaffirm our respect for the ability of nations to make sovereign
decisions in the best interests of their people. The Pacific Islands
note the United States’ commitment to enhance and deepen its security
cooperation in the region. All of us in the Pacific region and the
global economy benefit from peace and stability.   
  
**Eighth, we commit to continuing our cooperation in addressing COVID-19
concerns and other health-related issues.**  
   
We will continue to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and other
infectious-disease threats while strengthening regional and national
health systems and capabilities, and strengthening the capability to
prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats, including
through relevant regional organizations; and increase our collective
commitments towards adequate, stronger, and sustainable global financing
for future pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response.   
   
Non-communicable disease is a top health priority for the Pacific
Islands. We recognize the importance of addressing this issue given its
impact on the health of our populations and the economic prosperity of
our nations.  
   
**Ninth, we commit to expanding opportunities for all our peoples.**  
  
Our deepest ties are between our peoples. We will strengthen connections
between the United States and Pacific Islands through support for
education, training, youth development, and exchange opportunities. We
will identify priority areas for strengthening people-to-people ties and
ways to address them.  
   
We will redouble our commitment to gender equity and equality, including
the elimination of gender-based violence, both online and offline,
taking full account of the *2012 Pacific Leaders Gender Equality
Declaration.* Together we will continue to strengthen democratic
institutions across the Pacific**,** including through support for
accountability, transparency, anti-corruption, civil society, human
rights, and an independent and free media environment.    
                  
   
We acknowledge the critical role of the diaspora in the sustainable
development of Pacific Islands and commit to strengthen links between
the diaspora and local communities. We encourage expanding opportunities
for diaspora investments.  
   
We recognize the power of sports in bringing people together and commit
to support the development of sports in the Pacific region.  Expanding
sports ties between our countries and peoples will lead to greater
understanding of one another’s societies and build support for areas
like health and youth development.  We also recognize the positive
influence of coaching and the structures which support sport.  
      
**Tenth, we reaffirm our commitment to comprehensively address the
legacies of conflict and the promotion of nuclear nonproliferation.**  
   
World War II ended nearly 80 years ago, but its scars remain in the
Pacific. We, too, acknowledge the nuclear legacy of the Cold War. The
United States remains committed to addressing the Republic of the
Marshall Islands’ ongoing environmental, public health concerns, and
other welfare concerns.  
   
The United States is committed to the safe removal and disposal of
unexploded ordnance, and hereby acknowledges the concerns of Pacific
Island States regarding other remnants of World War II. We are united in
our support for the nuclear nonproliferation regime, including the South
Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty; as well as the important role of the International Atomic Energy
Agency.  
   
**Eleventh, way forward and future implementation of the
Partnership.**  
   
This joint vision will guide us as we enter the most consequential
period in the history of our partnership. Its implementation will
proceed in accordance with, and be guided by, the principles it sets
out: mutual respect, transparency, and accountability. To that end, our
political leaders, as appropriate, and our officials will meet
regularly, bilaterally and collectively, to ensure our partnership
continues to deliver practical results for our people and the world. We
welcome cooperation with all partners, in the region and beyond, who
share in the objectives and values stated hereto. This statement is made
in the respect of the competences of the signatories and of the
respective governments.
