title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Tentative Railway Labor\_Agreement"
---
 
The tentative agreement reached tonight is an important win for our
economy and the American people. It is a win for tens of thousands of
rail workers who worked tirelessly through the pandemic to ensure that
America’s families and communities got deliveries of what have kept us
going during these difficult years. These rail workers will get better
pay, improved working conditions, and peace of mind around their health
care costs: all hard-earned. The agreement is also a victory for railway
companies who will be able to retain and recruit more workers for an
industry that will continue to be part of the backbone of the American
economy for decades to come.

I thank the unions and rail companies for negotiating in good faith and
reaching a tentative agreement that will keep our critical rail system
working and avoid disruption of our economy.

I am grateful for the hard work that Secretaries Walsh, Buttigieg, and
Vilsack, and NEC Director Deese put into reaching this tentative
agreement. I especially want to thank Secretary Walsh for his tireless,
around-the-clock efforts that delivered a win for the hard working
people of the US rail industry: as a result, we will keep Americans on
the job in all the industries in this country that are touched by this
vital industry.

For the American people, the hard work done to reach this tentative
agreement means that our economy can avert the significant damage any
shutdown would have brought. With unemployment still near record lows
and signs of progress in lowering costs, tonight’s agreement allows us
to continue to fight for long term economic growth that finally works
for working families.
