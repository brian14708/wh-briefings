title: "Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Making \u201CBack to School\u201D Drive\
  \ to Help Students and Families Get Free High-Speed\_Internet"
---
 
As America’s kids get back to school and continue to recover from the
challenges of the pandemic, ensuring that all families have access to
affordable high-speed internet is more important than ever. Access to
high-speed internet is a necessity, especially for students whose
classes and homework assignments increasingly require internet access.
Still, too many families and students go without high-speed internet
because of the cost, making it difficult to participate equally in
school and to combat learning loss from the impacts of the pandemic.
That’s why President Biden and Vice President Harris worked with
Democrats, Republicans, and Independents to create the Affordable
Connectivity Program (ACP) in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

The ACP provides eligible households up to $30/month (or $75/month on
Tribal lands) off internet bills, as well as a one-time $100 discount
off a connected device. To further lower costs, the Administration
secured commitments from internet service providers across the country
to offer high-speed plans that are fully covered by the ACP—meaning
millions of working families can now get high-speed internet without
paying a dime.

Nearly 40% of U.S. households qualify for ACP—including millions of
families with kids. Households are eligible if they make up to 200% of
the federal poverty level ($55,500 for a family of four), and are also
eligible, regardless of income, if they participate in certain federal
programs. In particular, families are eligible if any member of the
household: (1) participates in the Free and Reduced-Price School Lunch
or Breakfast program, including a child who attends a [Community
Eligibility Provision
school](https://frac.org/research/resource-library/community-eligibility-cep-database);
or (2) is receiving a Pell Grant this school year.

[GetInternet.gov](http://www.GetInternet.gov) is a one-stop shop where
families can check their eligibility and sign up. Families can also call
877-384-2575 for more ways to apply.

**The Biden-Harris Administration’s “Back to School” enrollment drive
includes:**

-   Working with local leaders to help families in their community sign
    up. Today, White House Infrastructure Coordinator Mitch Landrieu
    [published a
    letter](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2022.09.14-Letter-from-Landrieu-to-Local-Leaders-on-ACP.pdf)
    to local government leaders across the country – including mayors,
    county executives, state legislators, school leaders, and others –
    asking them to commit to taking three simple steps to help families
    sign up: Local leaders can help by working to mobilize their local
    schools, directly contacting eligible or likely eligible households
    to let them know about the program, and using every tool available
    to spread the word about GetInternet.gov.

<!-- -->

-   Providing a “Back to School” toolkit for schools. The
    [toolkit](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/School-Outreach-Toolkit-FINAL.docx)
    includes specific, actionable recommendations for how school leaders
    can help their students’ families sign up and includes a ready-to-go
    backpack flyer that schools can distribute providing all the details
    families need. Schools can also use the Federal Communication
    Commission’s [ACP outreach
    tools](https://www.fcc.gov/acp-consumer-outreach-toolkit) to spread
    the word in their communities.

<!-- -->

-   Raising ACP awareness through the Department of Education’s “Back to
    School” outreach. This week, as part of the Department of
    Education’s “Back to School” Bus Tour, Department of Education and
    Federal Communications Commission officials are visiting elementary
    schools, a public housing authority, and other community-based
    organizations in North Carolina to help distribute information about
    ACP to families and to hear directly from families, educators, and
    other community members and leaders about how internet access
    supports a student’s education. The Department of Education will
    also share outreach tools and recommendations with hundreds of
    family engagement centers, recipients of grant funding, and other
    local partners. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona also recently
    launched a [social media
    campaign](https://twitter.com/SecCardona/status/1565411712098078724?s=20&t=aODfaa7DuQu5TT-OjjwQXQ)
    to raise awareness among Spanish-speaking families.

-   Reaching out to principals at key schools. Families with a student
    at one of the more than 33,000 schools across the country where
    every student automatically receives free meals – Community
    Eligibility Provision (CEP) schools – are automatically eligible for
    ACP. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will work with State
    Agencies to send information to CEP-eligible schools that includes
    outreach materials and asks their principals to let students’
    families know that they qualify for free or discounted high-speed
    internet. The USDA will also include a link to its ACP resources on
    its landing pages for [CEP
    schools](https://www.fns.usda.gov/cn/community-eligibility-provision)
    and for [families](https://www.fns.usda.gov/nslp/household). In
    August, USDA contacted State Directors of Child Nutrition Programs
    and School Meal Programs Administering Agencies to provide
    information about ACP and encourage them to help schools enroll
    families.

<!-- -->

-   Emailing all Pell Grant awardees to notify them of their eligibility
    and encourage them to sign up. Households with a student who are
    receiving a Pell Grant during this award year are automatically
    eligible for the ACP. The Department of Education is emailing over
    six million students awarded a Pell Grant this award year to let
    them know that they are eligible and how to sign up.

<!-- -->

-   Conducting outreach to Tribal communities. The Department of the
    Interior is distributing the toolkit to all Bureau of Indian
    Education students, families, and communities by email and hard
    copy. The Bureau of Trust Funds Administration has also sent out a
    direct mailing with information about ACP to 400,000 beneficiaries.
