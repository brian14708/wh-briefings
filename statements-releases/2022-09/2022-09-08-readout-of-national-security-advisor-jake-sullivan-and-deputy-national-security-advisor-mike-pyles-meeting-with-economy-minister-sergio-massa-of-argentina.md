Fund, and to advance bilateral cooperation on a wide-ranging agenda
including climate and energy, food security, critical minerals, and
technology.  
   
Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Pyle underscored the importance of Argentina’s

macroeconomic stability, economic growth, and opportunity for working

by President Biden and President Fernandez at the Summit of the Americas
to help promote food security and access to energy for the world to
address the global impacts of Russia’s war against Ukraine.
