  \ Hurricane\_Ian"
---
 
In the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Ian, President Biden has
directed his entire Administration to prioritize lifesaving actions and
ensure delivery of essential services and support to survivors.  
  
The recent steps the President has taken to ensure everything possible
is done to help the communities impacted by Hurricane Ian include:  
  
**Additional actions taken in the last 24 hours:**

-   Today, President Biden spoke with Governor DeSantis and FEMA
    Administrator Deanne Criswell to receive an update on response
    efforts. At the direction of President Biden, FEMA Administrator
    Criswell is in Florida to ensure the state’s needs are being met and
    assess where additional support is most urgently needed.  
-   Last night, an additional four counties in Florida were approved for
    Individual Assistance and Debris Removal as part of the major
    disaster declaration for the state of Florida, and more may be added
    in the coming days.  
-   The President approved a pre-landfall emergency declaration for
    South Carolina last night, again prepositioning life-saving Federal
    resources as Hurricane Ian strengthened again in the Atlantic and is
    expected to make landfall later today.  
-   The President directed the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
    Agency to speed the deployment of additional Cells on Wheels (COWS)
    and Cells on Light Trucks (COLTS) to provide access to cell service
    in communities where communications have been degraded by the storm
    or where demand for access is impacted by the deployment of large
    numbers of response personnel who depend upon wireless
    communications to deliver urgently needed assistance.  
-   The President spoke with Governor DeSantis to again offer full
    Federal support. The President also spoke with the County
    Commissioner of Lee County, Florida, to offer his support. Over the
    last few days, the President has spoken with Mayors across the State
    to better understand the needs of their communities and ensure those
    needs are being met.  
-   Yesterday, the President received an operational briefing early
    Thursday afternoon from  Department of Homeland Security Secretary
    Alejandro Mayorkas, FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell, National
    Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Administrator Dr. Richard
    Spinrad, Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Linda Fagan, Chief of
    Engineers and Commanding General of the U. S. Army Corps of
    Engineers Scott Spellmon, and President and Chief Executive Officer
    of the American Red Cross on the situation on the ground in Florida
    and ongoing response and recovery efforts, as well as preparations
    for Ian’s anticipated landfall along the Atlantic coast.

**Supporting life-saving response work and surging support on the
ground:**

-   The President authorized the deployment nearly 2,000 Federal
    response personnel to Florida within 24 hours of the storm making
    landfall to enable immediate response operations.  
-   The President directed the deployment of an unprecedented Search and
    Rescue Coordination Group before the storm made landfall.  This
    group, led by FEMA, began conducting search and rescue operations
    before daylight at 4:00 AM ET on September 29. Teams came from
    across the Federal government and included skilled rescuers from
    FEMA Urban Search and Rescue task forces, the U.S. Coast Guard, the
    Department of Defense, Customs and Border Protection, the Department
    of the Interior, and state and local responders. By the end of the
    day, they had already saved hundreds of lives.  
-   At the President’s direction, dozens of Coast Guard helicopters and
    rescue boats were pre-deployed to support search and rescue
    operations, and the Department of Defense readied additional
    helicopters, highwater vehicles, high water ladders and other
    materiel to support rescue operations.  Up to 16 Coast Guard
    aircraft flew near continuously since daybreak yesterday, rescuing
    over 80 people along the southwest Florida coast, including both
    rooftop and inland rescues.   
-   At the President’s direction, the Army Corps of Engineers deployed
    over 400 personnel to conduct engineering evaluations about the
    safety of bridges, roads, and other infrastructure and to assess
    emergency power needs. They are installing generators to support
    critical infrastructure, focusing on hospitals and long-term care
    facilities, water treatment and wastewater plants, and public safety
    organizations such as 911 call centers. This supplements 44,000
    utility workers from Florida and 32 states that have been surged to
    the region by electric utilities to support power restoration
    efforts via mutual aid agreements.  
-   The Department of Health and Human Services promptly declared a
    Public Health Emergency and deployed three disaster medical
    assistance teams to the region to support emerging health and
    medical needs.     
-   Looking ahead to the urgent needs of hurricane survivors, the
    President has asked FEMA to focus on the housing needs of survivors
    as well as other immediate challenges they will face in recovering
    from Ian.  FEMA Administrator Criswell established an interagency
    Recovery Leadership Team to proactively address the recovery needs
    of individual survivors and expedite assistance to those in
    desperate need of help

**Issuing Federal disaster assistance:**

-   Early Thursday morning, President Biden approved an expedited major
    disaster declaration for the state of Florida, providing Individual
    Assistance and Debris Removal for 9 counties, and 100% direct
    Federal assistance for costs associated with search and rescue,
    sheltering, feeding, and other emergency measures to save lives for
    30 days.  
-   President Biden approved a pre-landfall emergency declaration for
    Florida on September 24, to ensure lifesaving resources and Federal
    responders were pre-positioned in advance of potential storm
    impacts.
