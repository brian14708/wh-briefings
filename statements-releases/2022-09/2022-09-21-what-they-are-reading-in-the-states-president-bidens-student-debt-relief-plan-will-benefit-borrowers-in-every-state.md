title: "What They Are Reading in the States:\_President\_Biden\u2019s Student Debt\
  \ Relief Plan Will Benefit Borrowers in Every\_State"
---
 
  
Local news outlets across the country – from Oregon to Ohio– are
reporting on new state-by-state data that demonstrates how the
Biden-Harris Administration’s plan for student debt relief will benefit
borrowers in all fifty states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico.  
  
The Biden-Harris Administration expects that over 40 million borrowers
are eligible for its student debt relief plan, and nearly 20 million
borrowers could see their entire remaining balance discharged. Nearly
90% of relief dollars will go to those earning less than $75,000 per
year – and no relief will go to any individual or household in the top
5% of incomes in the United States.
