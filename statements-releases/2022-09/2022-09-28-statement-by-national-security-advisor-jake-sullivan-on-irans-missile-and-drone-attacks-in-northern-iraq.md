title: "Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Iran\u2019s Missile\
  \ and Drone Attacks in Northern\_Iraq"
---
 
The United States strongly condemns the drone and missile attack
launched against Iraq’s Kurdistan region earlier today.  We stand with
Iraq’s leaders in the Kurdistan region and Baghdad in condemning these
attacks as an assault on the sovereignty of Iraq and its people. 
Iranian leaders continue to demonstrate flagrant disregard not only for
the lives of their own people, but also for their neighbors and the core
principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity enshrined in the UN
Charter.  Iran cannot deflect blame from its internal problems and the
legitimate grievances of its population with attacks across its borders.
 Its flagrant use of missiles and drones against its neighbors, as well
as its providing of drones to Russia for its war of aggression in
Ukraine and to proxies throughout the Middle East region, should be
universally condemned.  The United States will continue to pursue
sanctions and other means to disrupt Iran’s destabilizing activities
across the Middle East region.
