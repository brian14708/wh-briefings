  \ Hooper and Aviation Survival Technician Second Class Zach Loesch of the U. S.\
  \ Coast\_Guard"

President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with Lieutenant Commander
Christopher Hooper and Aviation Survival Technician Second Class Zach
Loesch to personally thank them for the heroic work that they and their
Coast Guard colleagues have performed during search and rescue
operations in response to Hurricane Ian. The President thanked them for
saving lives and asked for a report on the work that continues to rescue
Floridians. He also asked if they needed any additional support that he
can provide to accelerate successful rescues; they indicated they have
gotten what they need to execute their vital mission.  
   
At the President’s direction, dozens of Coast Guard helicopters and
rescue boats were pre-deployed to support Federal, state, and local
search and rescue operations as part of an unprecedented interagency
Search and Rescue Coordination Group led by FEMA. As of today, their
work has saved hundreds of lives. The role of the U.S. Coast Guard was
particularly notable in driving those efforts. Up to 16 Coast Guard
aircraft have been in the air in search of survivors in need of help
since daybreak yesterday, rescuing over 100 people along the southwest
Florida coast.
