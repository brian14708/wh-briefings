President Biden will host the first ever U.S.- Pacific Island Country
Summit, which will be held in Washington, D.C. on September 28-29, 2022.

The Summit will demonstrate the United States’ deep and enduring
partnership with Pacific Island countries and the Pacific region that is
underpinned by shared history, values, and people-to-people ties. The
Summit will reflect our broadening and deepening cooperation on key
issues such as climate change, pandemic response, economic recovery,
maritime security, environmental protection, and advancing a free and
open Indo-Pacific.
