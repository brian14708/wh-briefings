title: "Readout of Los Angeles Declaration Implementation\_Launch"
---
 
On Monday, September 26, 2022, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan
and Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall welcomed
representatives from countries across the Western Hemisphere to the
White House to launch the implementation process of the Los Angeles
Declaration on Migration and Protection. The Declaration was announced
by President Biden and fellow heads of state from across the hemisphere
at June’s Summit of the Americas.  
   
Representatives from the Argentine Republic, the Federative Republic of
Brazil, Canada, the Republic of Chile, the Republic of Colombia, the
Republic of Costa Rica, the Republic of Ecuador, the Republic of El
Salvador, the Republic of Guatemala, the Co‑operative Republic of
Guyana, the Republic of Haiti, the Republic of Honduras, Jamaica, the
United Mexican States, the Republic of Panama, the Republic of Paraguay,
the Republic of Peru, and the Oriental Republic of Uruguay joined senior
U.S. Government officials to reaffirm their respective governments’
commitments to the principles of the Los Angeles Declaration and launch
a shared implementation plan to advance a regional response to migration
management.  
   
During their remarks, Mr. Sullivan and Dr. Sherwood-Randall reiterated
that irregular migration and forced displacement in the Western
Hemisphere have changed dramatically from past decades – requiring new,
coordinated regional solutions to meet a growing challenge.
Consequently, endorsing governments reaffirmed their readiness to deepen
cooperation and align policies to reduce irregular migration.  
   
U.S. Government representatives also outlined the progress the
Biden-Harris Administration has made on
its [commitments](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/10/fact-sheet-the-los-angeles-declaration-on-migration-and-protection-u-s-government-and-foreign-partner-deliverables/) under
the Los Angeles Declaration, including disrupting human smuggling
networks, increasing opportunities for labor migration, expanding
refugee resettlement from the region, and redoubling support to
countries that host large migrant populations.   
   
The United States and other Los Angeles Declaration endorsing countries
will continue close coordination on this effort at the October 6 Los
Angeles Declaration meeting of Foreign Ministers in Lima, Peru.  
   
**<u>Following the Los Angeles Declaration launch, countries committed
to:</u>**

-   A shared implementation plan to make good on the commitments and
    principles of the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and
    Protection. 
-   Country leads for joint plans of action along the Los Angeles
    Declaration’s thematic areas. Those include promoting stability and
    assistance for displaced populations, legal pathways as an
    alternative to irregular migration, and humane border management.
-   Reconvening at the Foreign Minister level to ensure continuing
    progress.
-   Announcing additional achievements and new lines of effort at the
    October 6 meeting of Foreign Ministers in Lima, Peru.

**<u>The United States continues to fulfill commitments made under the
Los Angeles Declaration in June of 2022:</u>**

-   Last week, the State Department announced $376 million in additional
    humanitarian assistance for the Venezuela regional crisis.
-   The United States approximately doubled the number seasonal labor
    visas for Northern Central America this year and significantly
    expanded the program for Mexican nationals. 
-   The United States relaunched the Cuban Family Reunification Parole
    (CFRP) program and is surging staff to accelerate case processing. 
-   The State Department announced that, beginning in early 2023, the
    U.S. Embassy in Havana will resume full immigrant visa processing
    for the first time since 2017, which will provide Cubans seeking to
    come to the United States an alternative to migrating irregularly. 
-   The United States made over 5,000 arrests in five months as part of
    a concerted law enforcement campaign cracking down on the
    multi-billion-dollar human smuggling networks preying on vulnerable
    migrants.
-   The United States significantly expanded refugee resettlement from
    the region, including for Haitian, Venezuelan, and Nicaraguan
    nationals. 

**<u>Other countries in the region have also stepped up to deliver
swiftly on commitments made under the Los Angeles Declaration:</u>**

-   Mexico is modeling a commitment to all the pillars of the Los
    Angeles Declaration, providing access to asylum, expanding labor
    programs, while humanely managing its borders. Going forward, we are
    actively considering new ways we might expand cooperation with
    Mexico to target human smugglers and reduce irregular migration to
    our shared border.
-   Ecuador successfully launched a regularization program for
    Venezuelans in the country, providing an opportunity for stability
    and integration for more than 500,000 displaced Venezuelans.
-   Belize successfully launched a regularization program for Central
    American and Caribbean migrants and refugees present in the country
    who had been in irregular migratory status.
-   Guatemalan authorities dismantled a deadly transnational human
    smuggling organization. This major disruption was the result of more
    than a year of bilateral law enforcement cooperation between our two
    countries.
-   Canada recently announced three new projects to bolster support for
    displaced persons and their host countries, including responding to
    protection needs of individuals in vulnerable situations in Panama
    and Costa Rica, strengthening the capacity of governments and civil
    society organizations in the Western Hemisphere to develop and
    implement effective and humane migration policies, and bolstering
    the United Nations Refugee Agency’s efforts to support asylum
    capacity development in Panama.
