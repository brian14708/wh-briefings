title: "Readout of Vice President Kamala\_Harris\u2019s Meeting with Civil Rights\
  \ and Reproductive Rights\_Leaders"
---
 
Yesterday, Vice President Kamala Harris convened civil rights and
reproductive rights leaders at the White House to discuss coalition
building between their organizations to protect reproductive health care
and abortion access in the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s overturning
of *Roe v. Wade* in *Dobbs*. The participants discussed the intersection
between the civil rights movement and the reproductive rights and
justice movement, and shared how they are standing shoulder-to-shoulder
to defend civil and human rights of all Americans.  
   
During the roundtable, the participants discussed the impact of *Dobbs*
on communities that are already made vulnerable by the attacks on voting
rights, including people of color, women, and Americans with
disabilities. They also discussed how *Dobbs* endangers other important
civil rights, including the right to contraception and marriage
equality. They discussed how the United States is an example of
democracy and freedom for nations around the world, and that *Dobbs* is
a danger not only to the women of America but to women around the world.
The participants discussed the importance of the United States
protecting and expanding rights. The participants thanked the Vice
President for the actions the Biden-Harris Administration has taken to
protect reproductive health, and they committed to continuing to work
together in partnership. The Vice President applauded the participants
for their leadership defending access to reproductive health care and
abortion care.  
   
The Vice President has brought together leaders from across the nation
who are on the frontlines fighting to protect a woman’s right to make
her own reproductive health decisions. Since May, the Vice President has
held more than 20 convenings about the fight to protect reproductive
rights. The Vice President has met with 150+ state legislators from 18
states to discuss protecting reproductive rights. She has also convened
health care providers, constitutional law experts, faith leaders, state
attorneys general, disability rights leaders, higher education leaders,
and advocates.
