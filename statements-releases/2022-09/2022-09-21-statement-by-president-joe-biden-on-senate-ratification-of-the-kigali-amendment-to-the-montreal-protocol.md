title: "Statement by President Joe\_Biden on Senate Ratification of the Kigali Amendment\
  \ to the Montreal\_Protocol"
---
 
Today, the Senate delivered a historic, bipartisan win for American
workers and industry. Ratifying the Kigali Amendment will allow us to
lead the clean technology markets of the future, by innovating and
manufacturing those technologies here in America. Ratification will spur
the growth of manufacturing jobs, strengthen U.S. competitiveness, and
advance the global effort to combat the climate crisis.   
   
The Kigali Amendment will phase down global production and consumption
of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), super-polluting chemicals that are
hundreds to thousands of times more powerful than carbon dioxide.
American companies are already leading on innovation and manufacturing
of HFC alternatives—and today’s vote will help our nation unlock an
estimated 33,000 new domestic manufacturing jobs, $4.8 billion each year
in increased exports, and $12.5 billion each year in increased economic
output. This builds on the [steps my Administration is already
taking](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/23/fact-sheet-biden-administration-combats-super-pollutants-and-bolsters-domestic-manufacturing-with-new-programs-and-historic-commitments/)
to phase down these dangerous super pollutants, with the support of
Democrats and Republicans, industry leaders, and environmental
organizations.  
   
The United States is back at the table leading the fight against climate
change. As more countries join the United States in ratifying this
amendment, we can prevent up to half a degree Celsius of warming this
century, a significant contribution to fighting climate change and
protecting communities from more extreme impacts.  
   
I want to thank Chairman Menendez, Ranking Member Risch, and Senators
Carper and Kennedy for their leadership to get this done. I look forward
to signing the instrument of ratification for the Kigali Amendment, so
that as we continue our domestic manufacturing resurgence, we will
deliver economic and environmental progress on the world stage.
