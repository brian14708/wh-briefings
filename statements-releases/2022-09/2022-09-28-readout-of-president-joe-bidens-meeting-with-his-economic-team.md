title: "Readout of President Joe\_Biden\u2019s Meeting with his Economic\_Team"
---
 
The President met with members of his economic team – including the
Secretaries of Treasury, Energy, and Labor and the Chair of the Council
of Economic Advisers – for an update on global financial and energy
markets. They reported that the United States economy remains resilient
in the face of global challenges, thanks in part to the President’s
economic plan, which has helped spur a historic recovery. The team
discussed the need to continue to making progress in reducing prices and
implementing the Administration’s once-in-a-generation fiscally
responsible public investment plan in our infrastructure, manufacturing,
and the clean energy transition. The President directed his team to stay
in frequent touch with partners, allies, and key market actors, and to
brief him regularly as conditions evolve.
