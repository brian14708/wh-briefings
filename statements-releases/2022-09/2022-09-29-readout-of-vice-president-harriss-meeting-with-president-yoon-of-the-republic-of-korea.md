Vice President Kamala Harris today met with President Yoon Suk Yeol of
the Republic of Korea (ROK) in Seoul. The Vice President underscored
that the U.S.-ROK Alliance remains a linchpin of peace, stability, and
prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and around the world. The Vice President
emphasized the importance of upholding the international rules-based
order and welcomed our close cooperation with the ROK across a range of
issues to strengthen rules and norms and to stand up for our common
values and interests.   
   
Vice President Harris underscored that the United States is committed to
defending the ROK and strengthening our combined defense posture. The
Vice President reaffirmed the U.S. extended deterrence commitment to the
ROK, which is underwritten by the full range of U.S. defense
capabilities.   
   
The Vice President and the President reaffirmed our alignment on the
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) and our goal of the
complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. They condemned the
DPRK’s provocative nuclear rhetoric and ballistic missile launches, in
violation of UN Security Council resolutions, and they discussed our
response to potential future provocations, including through trilateral
cooperation with Japan. The Vice President underscored that the DPRK’s
actions threaten peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region and the
entire international community.  
   
The Vice President and the President discussed China and Taiwan and the
effort to preserve peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, which
the Vice President underscored is an essential element of a free and
open Indo-Pacific.   
   
The Vice President and the President also discussed the growing
strategic economic and technology partnership between the United States
and the ROK.  Specifically, they reviewed the significant progress made
to broaden and enhance cooperation since the May leaders’ summit.  
   
The Vice President and the President agreed to deepen bilateral
cooperation on space. In this regard, the Vice President welcomed the
ROK’s plan to announce its commitment not to conduct destructive
direct-ascent anti-satellite missile testing, a commitment that the Vice
President announced on behalf of the United States earlier this year as
part of her efforts to develop international rules and norms for
space.  
   
The Vice President and the President discussed our shared work to
address the climate crisis, including the historic investments made in
clean energy under the Inflation Reduction Act. The Vice President
underscored that she understood the ROK’s concerns regarding the Act’s
tax incentives for electric vehicles, and they pledged to continue to
consult as the law is implemented.  
   
The Vice President underscored the priority that the Biden-Harris
Administration places on gender equity and women’s empowerment in the
ROK and around the world.   
   
The Vice President emphasized the importance of U.S-Japan-ROK trilateral
cooperation and welcomed additional initiatives on this front given our
shared goals and security concerns. She also underscored the benefits of
improving Japan-Republic of Korea bilateral ties. \###
