Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Jake Sullivan
hosted Israeli National Security Advisor Dr. Eyal Hulata at the White
House on September 28.  They discussed the launch of the U.S.-Israel
Strategic High-Level Dialogue on Technology that same day, a new vehicle
announced by the President and Prime Minister Lapid in July in Israel to
enhance technological collaboration to address pandemic preparedness and
climate change, promote trustworthy artificial intelligence, and protect
our technology ecosystems.  They consulted on a wide range of global and
regional issues of mutual concern, including the need to counter threats
from Iran and its proxies.  Additionally, they discussed the importance
of concluding the maritime boundary negotiations between Israel and
Lebanon as soon as possible.  Sullivan stressed the need to take steps
to de-escalate tensions in the West Bank, and to continue to take steps
to improve the lives of Palestinians, which are critical to peace,
security, and prosperity.  Sullivan welcomed positive progress on
expanded access for Palestinians at Allenby Bridge and 4G access in the
West Bank and Gaza.
