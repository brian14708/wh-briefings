  \ Funding to Address the Overdose Epidemic and Support\_Recovery"
---
 
*$1.5 billion awarded to all states and territories to beat the opioid
crisis and support people in recovery*

  
 President Biden recognizes the devastating impact the overdose epidemic
has had on this nation – reaching large cities, small towns, tribal
lands, and every community in between. That’s why in his first State of
the Union, President Biden made beating the opioid crisis a key pillar
of his Unity Agenda, and outlined [critical
actions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/briefing-room/2022/04/21/president-biden-releases-national-drug-control-strategy-to-save-lives-expand-treatment-and-disrupt-trafficking/) the
Biden-Harris Administration is taking to address this crisis and support
the tens of millions of Americans in recovery.

Today, the White House announced the following new and recent actions as
part of [National Recovery
Month](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/08/31/a-proclamation-on-national-recovery-month-2022/):

**Awarding $1.5 Billion for all States and Territories to Address
Addiction and the Opioid Crisis. **The U.S Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS), through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration (SAMHSA), awarded nearly $1.5 billion to support
states, tribal lands, and territories’ efforts to address the opioid
crisis and support individuals in recovery. The grants are part of
SAMHSA’s State Opioid Response and Tribal Opioid Response grant
programs. The grant programs provide funding to states and territories
to increase access to treatment for substance use disorder, remove
barriers to public-health interventions like naloxone, and expand access
to recovery support services such as 24/7 Opioid Treatment Programs. 
The funding will also allow states to increase investments in overdose
education, peer support specialists in emergency departments, and allow
states to invest in other strategies that will help save lives in
hard-hit communities. The full funding tables can be found below.

**Investing over $104 Million to Expand Substance Use Treatment and
Prevention in Rural Communities to Beat the Overdose Epidemic.** HHS’s
Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announced
investments of over $104 million to public, private, and non-profit
entities working to expand access to treatment and prevention services
for substance use disorder in rural communities. This effort is part of
the Rural Communities Opioid Response Program (RCORP), a multi-year
initiative aimed at reducing the prevalence of substance use disorder
and preventing overdose deaths in rural America. This funding will help
create new sites that provide medication-assisted treatment for opioid
use disorder in rural communities, support workforce mentorship and
training, and allow communities to invest in education and outreach to
prevent and treat substance use disorder.

**Investing $20.5 Million to Increase Access to Recovery Supports.** HHS
through SAMHSA, is awarding $20.5 million in grant funding to
organizations that help connect individuals who have substance use
disorders with community resources. This funding will help individuals
with substance use disorders who are moving through the drug court
system restabilize their lives by expanding prevention and treatment
programs and increasing access to community behavioral health promotion
services.

**Releasing New Guidance to Support and Facilitate Greater Access to
FDA-approved naloxone products. **Today, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) issued guidance intended to facilitate the
distribution of FDA-approved naloxone products, with the goal of saving
lives by supporting the drug’s increased availability to underserved
communities who need access the most. The guidance, which is effective
immediately, helps to address some of the obstacles that have existed in
obtaining access to naloxone and may help eligible community-based
programs acquire FDA-approved drugs directly from manufacturers and
distributors. 

**Announcing Additional Funding for Law Enforcement Officials on the
Front Lines of the Overdose Epidemic. **In April, to support
implementation of President Biden’s National Drug Control Strategy,
ONDCP [announced $275
million](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/briefing-room/2022/04/28/to-support-new-strategy-ondcp-announces-275-million-to-disrupt-drug-trafficking-and-illicit-finance/) for
the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) Program to support law
enforcement officials working to reduce violent crime, improve data
sharing, and dismantle illicit finance operations of drug traffickers.
To further support these efforts, today ONDCP announced an additional
$12 million for new HIDTAs, public health and public safety partnerships
working to prevent overdoses, and efforts to prevent gun crimes
associated with drug trafficking, all of which will make our communities
safer and healthier.

**Releasing New Guidance for Employers to Create Recovery-Ready
Workplaces. **The Department of Labor’s Employment and Training
Administration (ETA) launched the [Recovery-Ready Workplace Resource
Hub](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/RRW-hub) with information and
resources for businesses, unions, and others exploring the benefits of
becoming recovery-ready workplaces. The hub was developed with support
from numerous federal partners and will be updated and expanded over
time.

**Deploying Financial Sanctions to Disrupt Global Drug Trafficking
Operations. **Since the issuance of President Biden’s [Executive Order
(E.O.)
14059](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/15/fact-sheet-the-biden-administration-launches-new-efforts-to-counter-transnational-criminal-organizations-and-illicit-drugs/) in
December, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control
(OFAC) has used this new authority to designate 27 individuals and 17
entities involved in drug trafficking. Recent actions include
designations of individuals tied to the Cartel de Jalisco Nueva
Generacion (CJNG), a violent Mexico-based organization that traffics a
significant proportion of illicit fentanyl and other deadly drugs that
enter the United States. Working with the U.S., foreign partners, and
industries, the U.S. Department of the Treasury will use sanctions to
target the global fentanyl supply chain, particularly in Mexico, to
disrupt the illicit production of synthetic opioids like fentanyl, which
continue to drive overdose deaths. For more on the Treasury Department’s
counter narcotics sanctions program,
see [here](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information/counter-narcotics-trafficking-sanctions).

To support these and other efforts, President Biden’s [FY 2023
budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/briefing-room/2022/03/28/president-biden-calls-for-increased-funding-to-address-addiction-and-the-overdose-epidemic/#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2C%20D.C.%20%E2%80%93%20Today%2C%20President,deaths%2C%20driven%20primarily%20by%20illicitly) request
calls for a historic investment of $42.5 billion for National Drug
Control Program agencies, a $3.2 billion increase over the FY 2022.
Significant increases in funding are for critical public health
interventions including research, prevention, treatment, and recovery
support services, with targeted investments to meet the needs of
populations at greatest risk for overdose and substance use disorder.
President Biden’s budget request also includes increased investments for
law enforcement officials working to reduce the supply of illicit drugs
like fentanyl that are driving the overdose epidemic.

Consistent with federal law, none of the initiatives or investments
announced today will be used to purchase or distribute drug
paraphernalia, including pipes.
