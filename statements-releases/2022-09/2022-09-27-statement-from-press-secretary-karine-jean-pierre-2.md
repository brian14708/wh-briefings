We support Senator Manchin’s decision not to press for a floor vote
given the misguided Republican decision to put politics over progress by
opposing his permitting reform plan. The President supports Senator
Manchin’s plan because it is necessary for our energy security, and to
make more clean energy available to the American people. We will
continue to work with him to find a vehicle to bring this bill to the
floor and get it passed and to the President’s desk.
