  \ Legislation"

In recognition of Suicide Prevention Awareness Month, officials from the
White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, Domestic Policy
Council, and the Department of Health and Human Services chaired a
meeting today with bipartisan state legislative leaders on efforts to
address the mental health crisis and advance access to mental health and
substance use care.

Suicide remains a leading cause of death in the United States, claiming
the lives of more than 45,000 individuals in 2020. The Biden-Harris
Administration has [invested unprecedented
resources](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/30/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-actions-to-prevent-suicide/)
in improving suicide prevention and care, and in providing Americans the
support, resources, and care they need to safeguard and strengthen their
mental health. In May 2022, the Biden-Harris Administration released a
[comprehensive strategy to address the national mental health
crisis](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/31/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-highlights-strategy-to-address-the-national-mental-health-crisis/).
This strategy includes supporting the launch of the “988” crisis
response line to strengthen community-based crisis response, training
and recruiting a diverse pipeline of behavioral health professionals,
investing in prevention and research, and building the capacity of
long-term care facilities to deliver behavioral health care. The Biden
Administration has invested $432 million – an 18-fold increase in
federal support – to help states prepare for the transition to 988,
providing critical resources to help ensure access to trained crisis
counselors via phone, chat, and text.

In the meeting, state legislative leaders discussed steps they are
taking to address the mental health crisis, including funding for “988”
services which depend on state support for call centers and follow-on
behavioral health crisis services. Legislators also shared their efforts
to address mental health workforce shortages, increase accessibility of
in-person and telehealth services, and ensure that individuals in the
criminal justice system have access to behavioral health services.
Senior White House Officials thanked the leaders for their efforts and
ongoing partnership with the White House.
