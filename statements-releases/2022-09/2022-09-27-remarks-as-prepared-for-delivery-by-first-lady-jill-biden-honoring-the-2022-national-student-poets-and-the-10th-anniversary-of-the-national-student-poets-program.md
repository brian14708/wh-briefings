The White House

Welcome to the White House!  
   
In so many moments of my life, when my heart was bursting with an
emotion that I couldn’t quite describe— when I laid awake in the early
morning hours, worry running through my mind— when I felt lost and
utterly without a map; I turned to poetry.  
   
In the words of others, I found the contours of my own joy. I found a
place to lay down my fears. I found a compass that would lead me through
the darkest of woods. And on the page, tangled in hurried lines and
smudges of ink, I found myself.  
   
So, it’s truly special to be able to welcome the 2022 National Student
Poets—along with ten years of alumni—to the White House.  
   
As many of you know, I teach writing at a community college, and every
semester, I start by reading a poem to my class, called, “Where I’m
From,” by George Ella Lyon. Its verses tell the story of the author’s
hometown, not in locations, but in sensations and experiences and
memories. I use it to tell them about myself:  
   
I’m from ribbons of pasta, drying on the linoleum counter in my
grandfather’s Italian kitchen, tomato sauce bubbling on the stove.  
   
I’m from five sisters, glued together—messy rooms and borrowed jeans and
standing up to bullies who lived on our block.      
   
I’m from running through the yellow streetlights on hot July nights,
feeling like summer would never end.   
   
And then I say, it’s your turn! And, yes—a sheen of terror washes over
many of their faces at the thought of writing their own poem. I can
almost hear them internally screaming, “No!” But I show them other
students’ examples and we talk it through. And when they come in the
next day, not only do they have finished poems—beautiful poems—they are
competing to read them to the class. The structure helps them find their
voice and take risks. And overnight, my class of nursing and paralegal
and automotive technician students becomes a community of poets.   
   
Anyone can be a poet. But that doesn’t mean it’s easy.  
   
No, in fact, it’s anything but.  
   
It takes faith to ignore the critics that surround us or swirl in our
heads—the voices that ask us: What makes you think you deserve to be
heard?  
   
It takes nerve and strength to pull those words from our hearts and pin
them down on the page.  
   
It takes courage—so much courage—to dig into the dark and messy depths
of ourselves with curiosity and humility; to hold what we find up to the
light; to open our throats and say something true.  
   
It isn’t easy. But it is essential. To help us see the beauty we too
often pass by; to untangle the meaning of this twisted life; to remind
us that we are never alone.  
   
And so, those with enough nerve and strength, with faith and courage—we
follow Mary Oliver’s instructions for living a life:  
   
*Pay attention.*  
*Be astonished.*  
*Tell about it.*  
   
We celebrate with Lucille Clifton what she “shaped into a kind of
life…here on this bridge between starshine and clay.”  
   
When doubt creeps in, and we question our voice, we remember the words
of another young poet, Amanda Gorman:  
   
“Like light, we can’t be broken, even when we bend.”  
And we vow to live by the words of Rumi, and “Let the beauty we love be
what we do.”  
   
That is why we’re here today—the students on this stage, all the poets
in our audience, the parents, and everyone who makes this incredible
program possible.  I can’t wait to hear your work.  
   
So now, I’m proud and honored to introduce our MC for the evening, one
of my favorite poets and the Poet Laureate of the United States, Ada
Limón.
