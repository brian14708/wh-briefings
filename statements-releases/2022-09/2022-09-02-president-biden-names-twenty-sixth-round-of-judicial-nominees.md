title: "President\_Biden Names Twenty-Sixth Round of Judicial\_Nominees"
---
 
  
The President is announcing the nominations of eight new federal
judicial nominees and his intent to nominate nine federal judicial
nominees —all of whom are extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and
devoted to the rule of law and our Constitution.

These choices also continue to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure
that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our
greatest assets as a country—both in terms of personal and professional
backgrounds.

For example, if confirmed, this slate would include:

-   The first women of color to serve on the United States District
    Court for the Eastern District of Washington and the first Black
    women to serve on a United States District Court in the state of
    Washington
-   The first South Asian judge to serve on the United States District
    Court for the Southern District of New York
-   The second Hispanic man to serve on the United States District Court
    for the Eastern District of New York
-   The only LGBT Article III judge actively serving on the United
    States District Court for the Northern District of California

This is President Biden’s twenty-sixth round of nominees for federal
judicial positions and his thirteenth slate of nominations in 2022,
bringing the number of announced federal judicial nominees to 143. 

President Biden has spent decades committed to strengthening the federal
bench, which is why he continues to move rapidly to fill judicial
vacancies. And he has won confirmation of the most lower court judges
for the first year of a presidency since the Kennedy Administration.
