title: "FACT SHEET: \_ The Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces More Than $8\
  \ Billion in New Commitments as Part of Call to Action for White\_House Conference\
  \ on Hunger, Nutrition, and\_Health"
---
 
Today, for the first time in more than half a century, President Biden
is hosting the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health
to catalyze action for the millions of Americans struggling with food
insecurity and diet-related diseases like diabetes, obesity, and
hypertension. The Conference will lay out a transformational vision for
ending hunger and reducing diet-related disease by 2030 – all while
closing disparities among the communities that are impacted most.

Achieving our goals will require more than just the resources of the
federal government. That’s why, this summer, the White House launched a
nationwide call to action to meet the ambitious goals laid out by the
President. Across the whole of society, Americans responded – and
advanced more than $8 billion in private- and public-sector commitments.
These range from bold philanthropic contributions and in-kind donations
to community-based organizations, to catalytic investments in new
businesses and new ways of screening for and integrating nutrition into
health care delivery. At least $2.5 billion will be invested in start-up
companies that are pioneering solutions to hunger and food insecurity.
Over $4 billion will be dedicated toward philanthropy that improves
access to nutritious food, promotes healthy choices, and increases
physical activity.

Today, the White House announces a historic package of new actions that
business, civic, academic, and philanthropic leaders will take to end
hunger and to reduce diet-related disease.

**Pillar 1 – Improve Food Access and Affordability**

-   **AARP:** AARP and AARP Foundation will expand research on older
    adults’ access to SNAP and use this research to improve SNAP
    enrollment rates for older adults, which still lag behind other
    populations. By 2024, AARP will additionally complete new research
    to identify the key characteristics of non-participating yet
    eligible older adults and the key drivers of low SNAP enrollment,
    which it will share widely to inform policy, advocacy, and
    on-the-ground efforts to boost awareness and enrollment among older
    adults.  
     
-   **BENEFITS DATA TRUST: **National nonprofit Benefits Data Trust will
    leverage technology to improve access to public benefits, including
    by publishing a new toolkit in early 2023 to help states and higher
    education institutions identify and enroll eligible college students
    in public benefit programs like SNAP, Medicaid, and the new
    Affordable Connectivity Program, the FCC’s broadband benefit program
    to help low-income households access the internet. Benefits Data
    Trust’s toolkit will be the first in a series it develops to help
    eligible students enroll in public benefits.

    of pounds in fresh produce to the Tarrant Area Food Bank – serving
    Fort Worth, Arlington, and Dallas – and to the Atlanta Community
    Food Bank. This fall, Bowery will also launch a new partnership with
    East Brooklyn Mutual Aid to donate and distribute fresh produce
    across East Brooklyn. Finally, the company will expand its
    partnership with DC Central Kitchen’s Healthy Corners program to
    provide a new line of salad kits at a significant discount to 53
    corner stores in DC’s Wards 7 and 8 that currently lack access to
    healthy food options. In total, in 2023 Bowery commits to donating
    over 10,000 pounds of produce through both these partnerships and
    additional existing donation efforts in Maryland, Pennsylvania, and
    New Jersey.  
     
-   **CHOBANI: **Chobani will launch a national corporate responsibility
    initiative – *Food Access in Reach (F.A.I.R.) *– to encourage
    businesses of all sizes to “adopt-a-school” and pledge to make it
    food- and nutrition-secure. As part of this initiative, businesses
    including Chobani will pledge to help schools meet child nutrition
    standards, and pay their employees at least a $15/hour minimum wage
    to reduce hunger within their own ranks. Chobani itself will adopt 3
    schools (in Twin Falls, ID; Central New York; and New York City) in
    2023, with a goal for businesses and partners across the country to

    by addressing transportation barriers to accessing healthy food. The
    company will provide targeted support through: $1 million in
    DoorDash Community Credits, which community-based organizations can
    use to provide free food delivery; access to Project DASH on the
    DoorDash logistics platform, which food banks, food pantries, and
    other charitable organizations can use to power charitable food
    delivery; and direct funding of in-kind charitable food deliveries
    through the platform.

    also update its search experience to enable Americans already
    enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid to find and schedule health care
    appointments directly within the Google Search tool. Finally,
    YouTube is launching a *Personal Stories* feature for sharing
    personal experiences on specific health topics.

    per month. Hunger Free Oklahoma will also collaborate with Tribal
    Nations, state government, and the private sector to develop a new,
    coordinated WIC outreach and enrollment effort, with a commitment to

    children through the Department of Health & Human Service’s new SNAP
    eligibility pathway. Through this new pathway, NHSA will target
    technical assistance to programs serving populations and areas with
    the highest rates of food insecurity, and help state Head Start
    State Associations and Head Start State Collaboration Offices
    establish partnerships with SNAP offices to boost local enrollment.
    Separately, NHSA will launch a three-year research partnership with

    University will work with local counties to maximize student SNAP
    enrollment, provide food for students who do not qualify for

    participants to spend their monthly fruit and vegetable cash value
    benefit at farmers’ markets, in addition to traditional grocery
    stores. This change alone will make approximately $10 million of WIC
    cash value benefits available for redemption at Washington farmers’
    markets in 2023. At the same time, the Department commits to
    transitioning its fruit and vegetable prescriptions next year from a
