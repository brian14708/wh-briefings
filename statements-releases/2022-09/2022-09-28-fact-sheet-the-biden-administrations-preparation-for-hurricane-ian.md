title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden Administration\u2019s Preparation for Hurricane\_Ian"
---
 
As Hurricane Ian approaches Florida, President Biden has directed the
heads of Federal agencies across the government to surge all available
resources to the region in preparation for potential impacts and to
support response and recovery efforts in the aftermath of the storm.

Yesterday, the President held calls with Governor Ron DeSantis of
Florida, Mayor Jane Castor of Tampa, Mayor Ken Welch of St. Petersburg,
and Mayor Frank Hibbard of Clearwater to discuss preparations for the
potential impacts from Hurricane Ian. In the last week, FEMA
Administrator Deanne Criswell has held calls with Governor Ron DeSantis
of Florida, Governor Henry McMaster of South Carolina, and Governor
Brian Kemp of Georgia, and she visited Florida on Monday, September 26.

On Saturday, September 24, President Biden approved an Emergency
Declaration for the State of Florida within hours of receiving the
request from Governor DeSantis, to support preparedness efforts and
ensure resources are pre-positioned in advance of potential storm
impacts.  
  
At President Biden’s direction, FEMA is coordinating across the Federal
government to support State and local preparations. And, the President
and the Administration urge everyone to follow the guidance of local
officials.

**Pre-staging equipment and resources across the region in advance of
landfall:**

-   The Administration pre-staged 110,000 gallons of fuel and 18,000
    pounds of propane for immediate deployment and personnel and
    equipment to support distribution.  
     
-   The Administration moved in a variety of generators of all sizes and
    types and pre-positioned assessment and installation teams–to
    provide temporary emergency power to critical infrastructure.   
     
-   The Administration is staging 3.7 million meals and 3.5 million
    liters of water in Alabama.  
     
-   The Administration has 300 ambulances already in the state working
    side by side with local officials.

**Pre-positioning Federal responders to support emergency response:**

-   As of September 28, there are more than 1,300 Federal response
    workers on the ground in Florida to support emergency preparations
    including operations, planning, power restoration, debris removal,
    and urban search and rescue.  
     
-   FEMA Regional Administrator Gracia Szczech has been embedded in the
    State of Florida to ensure needs are being met.  
     
-   FEMA has established a Federal search and rescue coordination group,
    including FEMA Urban Search and Rescue personnel and search and
    rescue personnel from multiple additional Federal departments and
    agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Department of Defense,
    the Department of the Interior, and the State of Florida. These
    teams are on the ground and ready to deploy search and rescue
    efforts by sea, air, and land as soon as they are needed.  
     
-   The Army Corps of Engineers has pre-staged 300 personnel to support
    power and fuel assessments as soon as the storm passes. The
    Administration is in close coordination with local power companies.
    Florida Power & Light, Duke Energy, and Tampa Electric have 30,000
    personnel ready to assist in power restoration. Thousands more are
    being made available through utility sector mutual aid agreements
    with neighboring utilities in other states.  
     
-   The Department of Health and Human Services has deployed a 38-person
    disaster medical assistance team to Miami, Florida. Two additional
    disaster medical assistance teams have been deployed to Robin Air
    Force Base in Georgia. They have also deployed 15-person incident
