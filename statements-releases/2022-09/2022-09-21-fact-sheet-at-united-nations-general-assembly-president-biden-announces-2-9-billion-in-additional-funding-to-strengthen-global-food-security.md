title: "FACT SHEET:\_At United Nations General Assembly, President\_Biden Announces\
  \ $2.9 Billion in Additional Funding to Strengthen Global Food\_Security"
---
 
Today, in his address to the 77th session of the United Nations General
Assembly President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. announced over $2.9 billion in
new assistance from the U.S. Government to address global food
insecurity. President Biden’s announcement builds on the $6.9 billion in
U.S. government assistance to support global food security already
committed this year.

The compounding impacts of the pandemic, the deepening climate crisis,
rising energy and fertilizer costs, and protracted conflicts – including
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – have disrupted global supply chains and
dramatically increased global food prices. A multi-year drought in the
Horn of Africa has created a dire humanitarian emergency, with parts of
Somalia at risk of famine for the second time in just over a decade.
This new announcement of $2.9 billion will save lives through emergency
interventions and invest in medium to long term food security assistance
in order to protect the world’s most vulnerable populations from the
escalating global food security crisis.  
  
Yesterday, the United States convened a Global Food Security Summit
co-chaired by Secretary of State Antony Blinken with the leaders of the
European Union, African Union, and Spain, and co-hosted with Germany,
Nigeria, Indonesia, and Colombia, on the margins of the UN General
Assembly’s High-Level Week. The Global Food Security Summit reaffirmed
the commitment of world leaders to act with urgency and at scale to
respond to the pressing global food crisis and avert extreme hunger for
hundreds of millions of people around the world. President Biden will
also convene the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and
Health, on September 28, to end hunger and reduce diet-related diseases
here at home.  
  
**Today, President Biden announced the following additional
investments** **in lifesaving humanitarian and food security assistance
this year:**

**Global Humanitarian Assistance:** President Biden announced an
additional $2 billion in global humanitarian assistance through USAID.
This funding will help save lives in countries facing food security
crises, including through food and nutrition assistance, health care,
safe drinking water, protection for the most vulnerable, and other vital
relief. This funding increase emergency food security programming in
those countries most impacted by the pandemic, the climate crisis, and
the rise in food prices and supply chain constraints resulting from
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  
  
**Global Development Assistance**: President Biden also announced $783
million in global development assistance funding, including:

-   $140 million in new development funding, subject to Congressional
    notification, to accelerate last-mile delivery of agricultural
    tools, technologies, and production methods that will help
    smallholder farmers to boost their productivity, efficiency, and
    incomes. This funding will go towards the U.S. government’s [Feed
    the Future](http://www.feedthefuture.gov) Initiative to scale a
    rapid response for smallholder systems in sub-Saharan Africa through
    the new Accelerated Innovation Delivery Initiative. This will
    support smallholder producers, small and medium agricultural
    enterprises, and national partners to maintain food production in
    the face of volatile global commodity prices and disrupted supply
    chains.  
-   $220 million, through the U.S. Department of Agriculture, for eight
    new school feeding projects that are expected to benefit nearly a
    million children in food-insecure countries in Africa and East Asia.
    Funds are being awarded through the [McGovern-Dole International
    Food for Education and Child Nutrition
    Program](https://www.fas.usda.gov/programs/mcgovern-dole-food-education-program).  
-   $178 million, through the U.S. Department of Agriculture, for seven
    international development projects on four continents to support
    U.S. government priorities including promoting climate-smart
    agriculture, facilitating trade, and addressing the root causes of
    migration in Central America.  The funds are being awarded under the
    [Food for Progress
    Program](https://www.fas.usda.gov/programs/food-progress), through
    which USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service partners with
    non-governmental organizations and foreign governments on projects
    that help developing countries strengthen their agricultural systems
    and boost their trade capacity.  
-   Through the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), the U.S.
    government and the Government of Malawi will also sign a new Malawi
    compact later this month. This compact includes a $245 million
    Accelerated Growth Corridors Project, which sets out an ambitious
    agenda to reduce transport costs and better connect goods, farms,
    and rural populations to markets. 

**Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP):** President
Biden announced that the United States has contributed $150 million to
the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program, enabling the first new
Call for Proposals since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S.
contribution will encourage other donors—both government, multilaterals,
and philanthropic groups—to match and announce additional commitments to
support GAFSP’s Call. Given the scale of the challenge, the United
States believes we can only overcome global food insecurity by working
together to create innovative partnerships with international financial
institutions, international organizations, and other key stakeholders.
Through the Call, GAFSP will enable us to collaboratively respond to the
most urgent needs of the growing food security crisis.
