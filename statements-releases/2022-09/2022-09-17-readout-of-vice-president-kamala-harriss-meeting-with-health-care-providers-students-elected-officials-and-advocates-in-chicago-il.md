title: "Readout of Vice President Kamala\_Harris\u2019s Meeting with Health Care Providers,\
  \ Students, Elected Officials, and Advocates in Chicago,\_IL"
---
 
Yesterday, in Chicago, Illinois, Vice President Kamala Harris convened
a roundtable with health care providers, students, elected officials,
and reproductive health advocates to discuss reproductive health care
and abortion access in the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s overturning
of *Roe v. Wade* in *Dobbs*. The Vice President’s visit followed a week
of extreme actions by Congressional Republicans to further restrict
women’s reproductive freedom, including proposing a national abortion
ban and attempting to obstruct women’s access to medication. On the
state level, abortion bans went into effect in West Virginia and
Indiana.  
   
During the roundtable, the Vice President thanked the participants for
their work protecting reproductive rights in Illinois. She also
applauded them for their work providing care to women from across the
country who are being denied reproductive health care they need in their
own states. Participants expressed concerns about the dangers of
misinformation, and they shared stories about how *Dobbs* is harming the
health and safety of women. The health care providers discussed the
impact of *Dobbs* on the health care work force – making it difficult to
train the next generation of health care professionals and growing
concern for the mental health and well-being of reproductive health care
providers. The participants thanked the Vice President for the actions
the Biden-Harris Administration has taken to protect reproductive health
care and abortion access.  
  
The Vice President has brought together leaders from across the nation
who are on the frontlines fighting to protect a woman’s right to make
her own reproductive health decisions. Since May, the Vice President has
held more than 20 convenings about the fight to protect reproductive
rights. The Vice President has met with 150+ state legislators from 18
states, and has also convened health care providers, constitutional law
experts, faith leaders, state attorneys general, disability rights
leaders, higher education leaders, advocates, and civil rights and
reproductive rights leaders.
