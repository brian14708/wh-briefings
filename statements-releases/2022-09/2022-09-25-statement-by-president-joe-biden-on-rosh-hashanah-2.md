This Rosh Hashanah, Jewish communities throughout America and across the
globe will celebrate the birth of the world and the beginning of a new
year.  
   
With the piercing sound of the shofar and the sweetness of apples dipped
in honey, the Jewish New Year ushers in a sacred time of reflection,
repentance, and renewal. A time to pause and look inward*.* During these
Days of Awe, we have the opportunity to ask what kind of person we want
to be and how we have measured up.  
   
Just as individuals can seek renewal, so too can nations. This past year
has seen encouraging progress for our nation. More Americans are
securing the dignity of a good-paying job. Fewer children are living in
poverty. With COVID-19 no longer the same disruptive threat it was,
families can once more gather around the Rosh Hashanah dinner table and
sit together in their synagogues.  
   
At the same time, we have much more work to do to realize the values
that bind us as Americans and to restore the soul of our nation. In the
coming year, we must not only look inward, but also look to each other.
We must rebuild our communities through empathy and acts of kindness,
bridging the gap between the world we see and the future we seek.  
   
Jill and I offer our warmest wishes to everyone celebrating Rosh
Hashanah in the United States, Israel, and around the world. May your
prayers be heard and your faith revitalized—and may we all be inscribed
in the Book of Life. *Shana Tovah.*
