title: "Statement of President Joe\_Biden on Consumer Price Index in\_September"
---
 
Today’s data show more progress in bringing global inflation down in the
US economy.  Overall, prices have been essentially flat in our country
these last two months: that is welcome news for American families, with
more work still to do.  Gas prices are down an average of $1.30 a gallon
since the beginning of the summer.  This month, we saw some price
increases slow from the month before at the grocery store.  And real
wages went up again for a second month in a row, giving hard-working
families a little breathing room.  
   
It will take more time and resolve to bring inflation down, which is why
we passed the Inflation Reduction Act to lower the cost of healthcare,
prescription drugs and energy. And my economic plan is showing that, as
we bring prices down, we are creating good paying jobs and bringing
manufacturing back to America.
