Today’s announcement by Micron is another big win for America.  Just
this week, we’ve seen First Solar, Toyota, Honda, and Corning make major
announcements of new investments and new jobs as a direct result of my
economic plan.  In our future, we will make EVs, chips, fiber optics,
and other critical components here in America, and we will have an
economy built from the bottom up and middle out.
