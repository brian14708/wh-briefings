title: "FACT SHEET: New Actions from the Biden-\u2060Harris Administration and the\
  \ Public and Private Sectors to Foster Unity and Prevent Hate-Motivated\_Violence"
---
 
Today, at the White House, President Biden is hosting the United We
Stand Summit to counter the corrosive effects of hate-fueled violence on
our democracy and public safety. The Summit will honor the resilience of
communities who are healing from hateful attacks, including mass
shootings, from Oak Creek to Orlando, Charleston, Pittsburgh, El Paso,
Atlanta, Buffalo, and beyond. The Summit will put forward a shared
vision for a more united America, demonstrating that the vast majority
of Americans agree that there is no place for hate-fueled violence in
our country, and that when Americans stand united to renew civic bonds
and heal divides, we can help prevent acts of hate and violence. Today’s
Summit is just the beginning of this work and every American has a role
to play in this cause. Today at the Summit, President Biden will rally a
whole-of-society response to prevent, respond to, and recover from
hate-fueled violence, and to foster national unity.  
<span style="text-decoration: underline">  
**New Actions by the Federal Government**</span>  
  
To help meet these challenges, the Administration will take new steps,
including the following:  
  
*<span style="text-decoration: underline">Actions to strengthen federal
coordination on preventing, confronting, and recovering from
hate-motivated violence and fostering unity</span>*  
  
The White House Initiative on Hate-Motivated Violence established today
will strengthen interagency coordination in preventing and responding to
hate-motivated violence, leverage federal research and resources, and
enhance engagement and consultation with diverse stakeholders, including
communities targeted for who they are or what they believe.  
  
*<span style="text-decoration: underline">Actions to help prevent
hate-fueled violence</span>*

-   **Support educational authorities and educational institutions to
    improve their ability to prevent hate-based threats and bullying and
    recover from hate-based violence.** The Department of Education and
    the Department of Health and Human Services will issue a call to
    action to education and health leaders and partners across the
    country – including public health agencies and health providers – to
    develop and strengthen evidence-informed strategies that prevent and
    respond to hate-based threats, bullying, and harassment in schools.
    The Departments will support that call to action in several ways.
    Today, the Department of Education is informing states of their
    share of $1 billion in new funds made available through the
    Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to support safer and healthier
    learning environments. The Department of Health and Human Services
    will also soon announce additional funds from the Bipartisan Safer
    Communities Act to support student wellbeing and resilience in the
    face of hate and trauma. And both Departments will issue guidance
    about the ways in which their funding, including the funding
    released today, may be used for these purposes. The Departments will
    also offer expanded assistance in helping states, school districts,
    schools, and other youth-serving providers effectively access,
    navigate, and leverage evidence-based federal resources that support
    prevention, recovery, and resilience. Finally, the Departments will
    lift up a variety of best practices among innovative education and
    health leaders and partners that respond to the call to action.  
      
    The Department of Education will issue a parallel call to action for
    institutions of higher education, to strengthen their efforts to
    prevent and respond to hate-based violence on their campuses and in
    their surrounding communities. In addition, the Department will
    gather leaders from institutions of higher education in communities
    that have experienced hate-fueled violence, including HBCUs
    subjected to recent threats, to spotlight effective practices in
    prevention and response. The Department will also expedite
    applications for its grants assisting higher-education institutions
    in preventing and responding to hate-motivated violence, including
    Project SERV, which funds short-term education-related services for
    local education agencies and institutions of higher education to
    help them recover from a violent or traumatic event in which the
    learning environment has been disrupted. In addition to the Project
    SERV grant to the Southern University Law Center awarded earlier
    this year, the Department announced today Project SERV grant awards
    to  Tougaloo College and Fayetteville State University, and will
    further support HBCUs and other Project SERV applicants by providing
    technical assistance, such as providing sample methods to
    demonstrate the impact on students and examples of allowable
    recovery activities, to help expedite the application process.  
-   **Increase access to federal prevention resources for organizations
    and local communities.** The Administration will launch an online
    resource finder for federal  resources to prevent targeted violence
    in support of the [2021 National Strategy for Countering Domestic
    Terrorism](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/National-Strategy-for-Countering-Domestic-Terrorism.pdf).
    This website will be a user-friendly website for diverse
    institutional, governmental and organizational users. It will
    provide access to federal grants, program guidance, information
    sharing platforms, research, training, and community support efforts
    related to preventing targeted violence, including hate-based
    targeted violence.  
      
    The Department of Homeland Security is also announcing the awarding
    of $20 million in grants for state, local, Tribal, and territorial
    governments, nonprofits, and colleges and universities establish or
    enhance capabilities to prevent targeted violence. This year, DHS
    grantees for the program include, for the first time, two
    Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and two
    organizations working in the LGBTQI+ community.   
      
    In December 2022, the U.S. Secret Service’s National Threat
    Assessment Center (NTAC), a source of deep expertise for
    identifying, assessing, and preventing targeted violence, will
    release a comprehensive analysis of mass attacks in public spaces
    from 2016 to 2020, providing a better understanding of the
    circumstances and factors that lead to mass violence, including
    identifying and addressing the connections between online abuse and
    violence in communities. In addition, NTAC will collaborate with
    federal partners and national groups to provide threat assessment
    guidance and training to communities throughout the United States.
    NTAC training on threat assessment and prevention of targeted
    violence will be available to state, local, Tribal, and territorial
    law enforcement, schools, universities, workplaces, faith-based
    organizations, public health agencies, and other agencies and
    organizations with public safety responsibilities. NTAC is also
    adding to its research on the nexus between online misogyny and
    targeted violence by preparing a report examining the role of
    domestic violence as a motive and precursor to mass violence.
-   **Assist financial institutions and law enforcement to detect and
    combat the financing of domestic violent extremism.** The Department
    of Treasury’s Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence will
    develop a website of key reports and resources on financing domestic
    violent extremism to help inform the public and private
    sectors. Treasury will also undertake strategic engagement with
    regional financial institutions across the United States to discuss
    risks associated with financing domestic violent extremism, and hold
    a workshop with virtual currency firms on domestic violent extremist
    use of virtual assets.
-   **Support information literacy to improve resilience against online
    attempts to foment hate-motivated violence. **In the coming months,
    the National Telecommunications and Information Administration will
    award up to $69 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to
    assist states, Tribal entities, and U.S. territories as they develop
    programs to improve digital literacy and online skills. These
    programs include improving Americans’ ability to locate, evaluate,
    and effectively use information online. The Institute of Museum and
    Library Services will also announce new federal funding and support
    to advance information literacy. Additionally, IMLS will launch an
    interagency taskforce facilitating the development of a portal of
    resources bridging information literacy research and practice for
    how to advance information literacy within communities.
-   **Enhance school safety.** The Departments of Justice, Homeland
    Security, Education, and Health and Human Services will release a
    summary of federal resources for parents, caregivers, and community
    members designed to provide information on how to improve incident
    preparedness; promote and expand programs for secure firearm storage
    at home; and access trauma-informed services and other resources for
    children, parents, and communities in the aftermath of an incident.
    The summary will be published on
    [SchoolSafety.gov](https://www.schoolsafety.gov/), a collaborative,
    interagency website that provides K-12 schools and districts with
    resources, guidance, and best practices for creating a safe and
    supportive learning environment.

*<span style="text-decoration: underline">Actions to improve the federal
response when violence occurs and to help communities recover</span>*

-   **Strengthen ties between law enforcement and impacted
    communities.** The Department of Justice is announcing the national
    expansion of its United Against Hate initiative, convening local
    forums that connect community groups to federal, state, and local
    law enforcement to increase community understanding and reporting of
    hate crimes; build trust between law enforcement and communities;
    and create and strengthen alliances between law enforcement and
    other government partners and groups to combat hate. DOJ
    successfully piloted the program earlier this year in the U.S.
    Attorney’s Offices for Massachusetts, New Jersey, and the Eastern
    District of Washington. The Department is expanding to 16 additional
    U.S. Attorney’s Offices this fall and will expand to all 94 U.S.
    Attorney’s Offices next year.
-   **Improve federal government assistance and support responding to
    hate-based incidents.** Agencies across the Administration, with
    feedback and consultation from the communities involved, will
    carefully evaluate government support following past incidents and
    offer recommendations for improvements in the delivery of government
    assistance to affected individuals and communities, including
    legislative changes where necessary.
-   **Commit cultural resources at the local and national levels for
    prevention and community healing in the face of hate-based
    violence. **The arts and humanities help us develop the skills
    needed to find connection, common purpose, and recognition of our
    shared humanity. They strengthen mutual understanding and remind us
    of the norms and agreements that we rely on to care for one another.
    The National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for
    the Humanities are launching a new initiative to connect communities
    through cultural engagement. This initiative will include funding
    opportunities for partners in every state, the District of Columbia,
    and all U.S. jurisdictions for programming promoting civic and
    social engagement, and cross-cultural understanding. The initiative
    will also include resources and capacity building to protect
    cultural institutions targeted by ongoing domestic extremism and
    hate-based violence, like cultural centers serving groups victimized
    by hate; partnerships with local organizations to host communal
    gatherings such as meals, concerts, and convenings to help process
    grief and build resilience after hate-based incidents; and emergency
    “second responder” relief assisting local cultural and educational
    institutions with programming, such as oral history projects that
    document survivors’ experiences.   

*<span style="text-decoration: underline">Actions to promote civic
renewal and foster national unity</span>*

-   **Facilitate expanded access to national service and volunteerism
    through a United We Serve campaign.** The campaign, launched through
    [serve.gov](http://www.serve.gov), will encourage and create
    opportunities for Americans to come together in common purpose, with
    an emphasis on bridgebuilding and social cohesion, around a
    Presidential call to action to engage in service and volunteerism.
    Building on the model of FEMA Corps, the National Partnership for
    Student Success, and Public Health AmeriCorps, agencies across the
    federal government will evaluate opportunities for service
    partnerships, including leveraging agency authorities to deliver
    service in underserved communities with tools like outreach and
    training. Recognizing the skills and capacity of national service
    alumni, and the need to attract the next generation of talent to the
    federal government, the Office of Personnel Management will review
    opportunities to enhance pathways from national service into federal
    service. AmeriCorps, working with Peace Corps, will also will
    develop new training opportunities for members in skills like
    bridgebuilding, promoting civic engagement, and fostering social
    cohesion, and will develop new mechanisms to evaluate the impact and
    cost-effectiveness of national service and volunteerism
    interventions. 

In addition to the executive and agency actions outlined above,
President Biden is calling on **Congress** to enact substantially
increased investments in national service and civics education, which
are vital to strengthening our social fabric and forging a deeper sense
of common purpose and national unity.

-   President Biden believes that Americans from all walks of life
    should have the opportunity to serve their country and community
    through programs like AmeriCorps, including AmeriCorps Seniors. 
    When Americans of all backgrounds and beliefs work side-by-side to
    tackle our nation’s toughest challenges, they come to know one
    another, to bridge differences, and understand that there is more we
    have in common than divides us. 
-   The Biden-Harris Administration has already increased AmeriCorps
    members’ living allowance, including with funds provided by the
    American Rescue Plan, but we must do more to make service an
    accessible pathway to success for all Americans.  President Biden
    urges Congress to raise the AmeriCorps education award to follow
    increases in Pell grants and to increase the AmeriCorps living
    allowance to the equivalent of $15 per hour over FY24 and FY25.
-   It is essential to equip Americans with the tools to engage
    effectively as citizens by improving understanding of our
    Constitution and our unique democratic system of government.  Civics
    education builds the skills required for full participation in local
    and national civic life, while strengthening our communities as we
    work together in self-governance. The President calls on Congress to
    significantly expand federal support for civics education, through a
    competitive grant program that will help states and school districts
    to design and develop new programs or expand programs grounded in
    evidence-based strategies.

President Biden also calls on Congress to build on the landmark public
safety legislation he signed over the last year, including the COVID-19
Hate Crimes Act and the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, with new
legislation to make the country safer by helping to prevent
hate-motivated violence.

-   The Department of Homeland Security’s Nonprofit Security Grant
    Program helps protect houses of worship and nonprofit institutions
    serving at-risk communities against terrorist attacks and targeted
    violence, including security enhancements that can help deter
    attacks against people and property.  It is available to help
    safeguard houses of worship including Catholic, Evangelical, or
    Mainline churches; synagogues; mosques, temples, gurdwaras, and
    other sacred spaces.  This program is also available to assist
    community centers and recreational centers as well as other bulwarks
    of civil society, including the Historically Black Colleges and
    Universities subject to appalling threats this year.  The
    Biden-Harris Administration appreciates the need to keep all such
    institutions safe and secure. President Biden’s FY23 budget request
    significantly increases funding for this program, and calls on
    Congress to deliver that vital increase and to continue significant
    investments in the program into the future. 
-   Tech platforms currently have special legal protections under
    Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that broadly shield
    them from liability. This immunity extends beyond what the First
    Amendment requires and what newspapers and other media receive.  It
    also effectively permits hate-fueled content mobilizing users to
    violence to be amplified on large tech platforms.  President Biden
    has long urged fundamental reforms to Section 230, and consistent
    with the [Principles for Enhancing Competition and Tech Platform
    Accountability](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/08/readout-of-white-house-listening-session-on-tech-platform-accountability/)
    released on September 8, he reiterates his call for Congress to
    fundamentally reform Section 230. 
-   Americans deserve to know how the algorithms that drive large tech
    platforms may amplify divisions and contribute to hate-fueled
    violence, among other critical harms.  Consistent with those same
    principles for accountability, President Biden supports requiring
    platform transparency sufficient to allow the public and researchers
    to understand how and why such decisions are made, their potential
    effects on users, and the very real dangers these decisions may
    pose.                                  

**<span style="text-decoration: underline">New Actions from Non-Federal
Public and Private Institutions to Foster Civic Unity</span>**  
  
President Biden understands that addressing hate-based violence takes an
all-of-society effort. That is why it is so important to have engagement
from **non-federal public and private institutions** to prevent, respond
to, and recover from hate-fueled violence, and to build bridges and
foster greater social cohesion:

-   **Dignity.us, A Citizens’ Initiative to Address Hate-Fueled Violence
    in America.** Four former Directors of the White House Domestic
    Policy Council under Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and
    Donald J. Trump — together with four Presidential Centers or
    Foundations (Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, William J.
    Clinton, and Gerald R. Ford) — are launching Dignity.us, a Citizens’
    Initiative to address our growing national crisis of hate-fueled
    violence. This initiative will build on the work of the Summit by
    continuing the conversation in communities around the country,
    conducting an exhaustive national search for first-hand
    testimonials, insights, and solutions on preventing and responding
    to hate-fueled violence. The Initiative will begin with an initial
    phase of listening and learning, by engaging:
    -   Communities across 50 states, D.C., the territories, and Tribal
        lands that have directly experienced hate-fueled violence and
        those that are working to address it—including leaders in
        schools, workplaces, faith-based institutions, law enforcement,
        and government, and among youth;
    -   Researchers and experts who have studied the problem and have
        evidence of effective solutions;
    -   Nonprofits, associations, and foundations that have worked to
        address hatred, violence and division and build bridges across
        differences; and
    -   Those who have left groups affiliated with hatred and violence,
        to understand their motivations for joining and why they left. 

As part of this effort to gather inputs from Americans of all regions
and backgrounds, the Citizens’ Initiative will host virtual and
in-person public listening sessions this fall, with details to come in
the weeks ahead. The public – especially individuals in communities that
have suffered hate-motivated violence – are invited to share their
experiences and recommendations for addressing this shared challenge at
Dignity.us.  
  
After several months of this learning, the Citizens’ Initiative will
develop a set of recommendations and drive the implementation of a plan
of action “from the nation, for the nation,” with a focus on greatly
scaling effective community-based efforts.  This effort is supported by
a diverse group of foundations, including the David and Lucile Packard
Foundation, Democracy Fund, Ford Foundation, Kettering Foundation,
MacArthur Foundation, Omidyar Network, Open Society Foundations,
Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Silicon Valley Community Foundation, Stand
Together, W.K. Kellogg Foundation, William and Flora Hewlett Foundation,
and more than 40 community foundations across the country.

-   **More than 140 mayors have signed a new Mayors’ Compact to Combat
    Hate and Extremism.** For decades, America’s mayors have fought for
    civil rights and in opposition to racism and discrimination. Today,
    city leaders from across the country and from both parties are
    continuing this tradition by joining a new Compact, organized by the
    U.S. Conference of Mayors and the Anti-Defamation League, committing
    to taking key actions to prevent and address hate-fueled violence
    and build bridges across differences to create respect for and
    inclusion of all peoples within their communities.
-   **Leading civic institutions will launch *A Nation of
    Bridgebuilders* initiative.** Interfaith America, Habitat for
    Humanity, and the YMCA of the USA are responding to the President’s
    call to action by engaging tens of thousands of Americans in rural,
    urban, and suburban communities across the nation in meaningful
    opportunities to bridge diverse identities and divergent ideologies.
    Through *A Nation of Bridgebuilders*, these organizations will train
    10,000 leaders across the nation in bridgebuilding skills and host
    over 1,000 events with a bridgebuilding focus in over 300
    communities. Those trained in bridgebuilding will be equipped to
    play leadership roles in civic and service activities, such as a
    Habitat build where diverse Americans discuss shared values while
    building homes for their community or a local YMCA incorporating
    age-appropriate listening and empathy-building activities into
    summer camp activities. This approach—focusing on personal
    relationships, shared values, storytelling, and working together in
    common purpose—leverages [longstanding
    research](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/images/uploads/Bridging_Differences_Playbook-Final.pdf?_ga=2.133051974.931724261.1661455081-455065926.1661455081)
    demonstrating the power of personal encounter to build bonds among
    Americans with different backgrounds and perspectives.
-   **New Pluralists will galvanize funders to invest $1 billion toward
    building a culture of respect, peace, and cooperation.** New
    Pluralists, a cross-ideological group of philanthropists, social
    changemakers, and local leaders working together to build a culture
    of respect, belonging and collaboration in communities and
    organizations across America, is announcing today that they will
    galvanize funders to invest $1 billion over 10 years to support the
    field and stand behind the essential work of courageous uniters,
    healers, and bridgers. This work will enable millions of Americans
    to better understand and collaborate with their neighbors to solve
    their communities’ most significant challenges.
-   **Foundations and philanthropists commit to launch the Trust for
    Civic Infrastructure.** A group of foundations and philanthropists
    will launch a new Trust for Civic Infrastructure to bring the nation
    closer together and build a vibrant, diverse democracy for
    generations to come, as recently recommended in the American Academy
    of Arts and Sciences report, [Our Common
    Purpose](https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amacad.org%2Fourcommonpurpose%2Frecommendation-4-1&data=05%7C01%7Csheintz%40rbf.org%7Cb012264dd6ce4056057e08da904614ea%7Cce1d5fdfa1934be1a2daae839aaeedbe%7C0%7C0%7C637980927935367721%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=N%2Fl%2FV5jcv6WUqB9Z%2BQMHJbe6RGAPemu%2FYJ9e2qvRGFg%3D&reserved=0).
    The Trust will support community-led eﬀorts to strengthen and expand
    the places, programs, people, and information that bolster civic
    capacity and create opportunities for communities to build common
    ground and solve problems together. The group has set a goal of at
    least $30 million for a pilot phase, during which the Trust will
    invest in local innovations to strengthen and expand existing civic
    infrastructure, inspire the invention of new civic infrastructure
    models, and explore ways to harness the digital age.
-   **McCain Institute builds a Prevention Practitioners Network.**
    Funded in part by a Department of Homeland Security grant, the
    McCain Institute at Arizona State University has built the
    Prevention Practitioners Network. The PPN is a resource repository
    and learning network for practitioners from various disciplines
    interested in expanding their knowledge related to risk assessment
    and prevention approaches to address targeted violence. The Network
    will also host intensive workshops that address common challenges
    among professionals in this area, including privacy concerns in
    interactions with law enforcement. Today, in support of the Network,
    the McCain Institute is launching SCREEN Hate, a national campaign
    for parents and concerned adults to raise awareness about how youth
    may be exposed to violent extremism online.

**Commitments from the Technology Sector:** As the President and Vice
President have underscored, technology plays a critical and necessary
role in Americans’ lives, but advancements in digital technologies,
including social media and other online platforms, have also led to
unintended consequences—including the spread of violent extremist
ideologies and mobilization to violence—for which the technology sector
must bear responsibility. Americans know how the internet can fuel hate,
misogyny, and abuse with spillover effects that threaten the safety of
our communities offline. Today’s announcements from the tech sector take
a step towards recognizing the important role companies play in
designing their products and platforms to curb the spread of hate-fueled
violence both online and off.

-   **YouTube is expanding its policies to combat violent extremism** by
    removing content glorifying violent acts for the purpose of
    inspiring others to commit harm, fundraise, or recruit, even if the
    creators of such content are not related to a designated terrorist
    group. YouTube will also launch an educational media literacy
    campaign across its platform to assist younger users in particular
    in identifying different manipulation tactics used to spread
    misinformation – from using emotional language to cherry picking
    information. This campaign will first launch in the U.S. before
    expanding to other countries over time. Finally, YouTube will
    support the McCain Institute and EdVenture Partners’ Invent2Prevent
    program with ongoing funding and training. The program challenges
    college students to develop their own dynamic products, tools, or
    initiatives to prevent targeted violence and terrorism.\]
-   **Twitch will accelerate its ongoing commitment to deterring hate in
    the livestreaming space this year by releasing a new tool** that
    empowers its streamers and their communities to help counter hate
    and harassment and further individualize the safety experience of
    their channels. Twitch will also launch new community education
    initiatives on topics including identifying harmful misinformation
    and deterring hateful violence.
-   **Microsoft is expanding its application of violence detection and
    prevention artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)
    tools and using gaming to build empathy in young people**. The
    company has developed AI/ML tools with appropriate privacy
    protections that can help detect credible threats of violence or to
    public safety, and is making a basic, more affordable version of
    these tools accessible to schools and smaller organizations to
    assist in violence prevention. Microsoft is also developing a new
    experience on Minecraft: Education Edition to help students,
    families and educators learn ways to build a better and safer online
    and offline world through respect, empathy, trust and safety.
-   **Meta is forging a new research partnership with the Middlebury
    Institute of International Studies’ Center on Terrorism, Extremism,
    and Counterterrorism** to analyze trends in violent extremism and
    tools that help communities combat it. Meta will also partner
    with Search For Common Ground to provide trainings, workshops, and
    skill-building to equip community-based partners working locally to
    counter hate-fueled violence with tools to help amplify their work.
