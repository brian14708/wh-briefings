title: 'FACT SHEET: Vice President Harris Announces Commitments to Inspire, Prepare,
  and Employ the Space Workforce'
---
 
Today, at the second convening of the National Space Council, Vice
President Kamala Harris is announcing new commitments from the U.S.
government, private sector companies, education and training providers,
and philanthropic organizations to support space-related STEM
initiatives to inspire, prepare, and employ the next generation of the
space workforce.  
  
In order to address the challenges of today and prepare for the
discoveries of tomorrow, the country needs a skilled and diverse space
workforce. This is why the White House released [the Interagency Roadmap
to Support Space-Related STEM Education and
Workforce.](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=09053688eb&e=0ca263633c)
This Roadmap outlines the initial set of coordinated Administration
actions to bolster our nation’s capacity to inspire, prepare and employ
a diverse and inclusive space workforce, starting with increasing
awareness of the wide range of space careers, providing resources and
opportunities to better prepare jobseekers for the workplace, and
placing a focus on strategies to recruit, retain and advance
professionals of all backgrounds in the space workforce.   
  
In order to meet the current and future needs of a thriving space
workforce, the public, private, and philanthropic sectors must work
together.  To magnify the Administration’s efforts, **the Vice President
is announcing a new coalition of space companies that will focus on
increasing the space industry’s capacity to meet the rising demand for
the skilled technical workforce.** The new coalition’s work will kick
off in October 2022 and be anchored by Blue Origin, Boeing, Lockheed
Martin, and Northrop Grumman.  Other industry partners will include
Amazon, Jacobs, L3Harris, Planet Labs PBC, Rocket Lab, Sierra Space,
Space X and Virgin Orbit, and will be joined by the Florida Space Coast
Consortium Apprenticeship Program and its sponsors, SpaceTEC, Airbus
OneWeb Satellites, Vaya Space, and Morf3D.   
  
The coalition, with the support of Aerospace Industries Association and
American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, will stand up three
regional pilot programs in Florida’s Space Coast, the Gulf Coast of
Louisiana and Mississippi, and Southern California, and collaborate with
service providers such as community colleges, unions and others, to
demonstrate a replicable and scalable approach to attracting, training
and creating employment opportunities particularly for people from
backgrounds traditionally underrepresented in STEM jobs.   
  
Additionally, federal agencies and the private sector have coordinated
their efforts to promote space STEM education and workforce with the
following commitments:
