title: "FACT SHEET: The United We Stand Summit: Taking Action to Prevent and Address\
  \ Hate-Motivated Violence and Foster\_Unity"
---
 
Today, at the White House, President Biden is hosting the United We
Stand Summit to counter the corrosive effects of hate-fueled violence on
our democracy and public safety. The Summit will honor the resilience of
communities who are healing from hateful attacks, including mass
shootings, from Oak Creek to Orlando, Charleston, Pittsburgh, El Paso,
Atlanta, Buffalo, and beyond.

The Summit will put forward a shared vision for a more united America,
demonstrating that the vast majority of Americans agree that there is no
place for hate-fueled violence in our country, and that when Americans
stand united to renew civic bonds and heal divides, we can help prevent
acts of hate and violence. Today’s Summit is just the beginning of this
work, and every American has a role to play in this cause. Today,
President Biden will rally a whole-of-society response to prevent,
respond to, and recover from hate-fueled violence, and to foster
national unity.

The White House is announcing a historic package of new actions the
federal government, civic, faith, philanthropic, and business leaders
will take to address hate-fueled violence and advance national unity:

-   The President will announce new agency actions to strengthen the
    federal government’s coordination and community engagement to
    prevent, respond to, and recover from hate-fueled violence.
-   [Federal agencies are announcing new

    available to local schools, law enforcement agencies, and cultural
    institutions like museums and libraries to prevent and respond to
    hate-fueled violence.
-   Bipartisan former White House officials will launch Dignity.us, a
    Citizens’ Initiative to Address Hate-Fueled Violence in America, to
    foster dialogue in communities across the country and identify
    solutions to address hate-fueled violence. The Citizens’ Initiative
    will be coordinated by four former Directors of the White House
    Domestic Policy Council under Republican and Democratic presidents.
    The Presidential Centers or Foundations of Presidents Obama,
    George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Gerald Ford will support the
    initiative.
-   New Pluralists, a cross-partisan group of philanthropic and field
    leaders, is mobilizing [$1 billion in new
    investments](http://www.unitedwestand.gov) to increase support for
    programs that build bridges among Americans of different backgrounds
    to foster unity.
