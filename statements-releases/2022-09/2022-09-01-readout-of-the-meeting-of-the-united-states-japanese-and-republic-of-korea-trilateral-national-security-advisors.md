National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan of the United States met with
National Security Secretariat Secretary General Akiba Takeo of Japan and
National Security Office Director Kim Sung-han of the Republic of Korea
(ROK) on September 1, 2022 at the Headquarters of the United States
Indo-Pacific Command in Honolulu, Hawaii to address protecting and
advancing the rules based international order.  They discussed their
joint commitment to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and
condemned the DPRK’s continued development of its ballistic missile and
weapons of mass destruction programs, and Russian aggression in
Ukraine.  The United States reaffirmed its ironclad alliance commitments
to both the ROK and Japan, including our commitment to extended
deterrence to both countries and underscored the importance of bilateral
ties and trilateral cooperation to the security and prosperity of our
citizens, the region, and the world.  The national security advisors
discussed ways to strengthen their ties, grounded in our shared vision
for the free and open Indo-Pacific.
