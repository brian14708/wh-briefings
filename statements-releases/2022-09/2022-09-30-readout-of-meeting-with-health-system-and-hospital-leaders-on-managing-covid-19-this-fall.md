title: "Readout of Meeting with Health System and Hospital Leaders on Managing COVID-\u2060\
  19 This\_Fall"
---
 
Yesterday, White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha,
Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, and U.S. Surgeon
General Dr. Vivek Murthy met with health system and hospital leaders to
discuss the importance of acting aggressively this fall to protect their
patients, health care workers, and communities from COVID-19 and the
flu. Administration officials conveyed that while our nation has made
tremendous progress on COVID-19, there is more work to do ahead of the
winter, when contagious diseases like COVID-19 and flu can spread more
quickly. Administration officials emphasized that there have been major
surges in COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths the last two winters,
which strained the health care workforce and hospitals, but that it does
not have to be this way this year if everyone does their part and uses
the lifesaving tools we now have, including updated COVID-19 vaccines,
flu vaccines, and highly-effective treatments for COVID-19. The
discussion focused on steps hospitals and health systems can take to
help ensure all Americans, including health care workers, get their
updated COVID-19 vaccine this fall, and encourage people to get tested
and seek treatment when they get sick—steps that will save lives, reduce
burden on the health care system, minimize disruptions to daily life,
and help the U.S. effectively manage COVID-19. The meeting also included
a discussion on the Administration’s gratitude to frontline health care
workers for their heroic efforts in fighting COVID-19, as well as the
physical, emotional and mental toll the virus has had on America’s
health care workforce, and the importance of tackling health care worker
burnout.
