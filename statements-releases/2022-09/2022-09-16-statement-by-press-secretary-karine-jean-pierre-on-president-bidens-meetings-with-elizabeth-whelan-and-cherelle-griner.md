title: "Statement by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on President\_Biden\u2019\
  s Meetings with Elizabeth Whelan and Cherelle\_Griner"
---
 
President Biden met today with Elizabeth Whelan and Cherelle Griner, the
loved ones of two American citizens who are wrongfully detained in
Russia under intolerable circumstances. Elizabeth Whelan, the sister of
Paul Whelan, and Cherelle Griner, the wife of Brittney Griner, met
separately with the President in the Oval Office.

The President held the meetings to reiterate his continued commitment to
working through all available avenues to bring Brittney and Paul home
safely. He asked after the wellbeing of Elizabeth and Cherelle and their
respective families during this painful time. The President appreciated
the opportunity to learn more about Brittney and Paul from those who
love them most, and acknowledged that every minute they are being held
is a minute too long.

Todayâ€™s meetings come after earlier meetings and conversations that the
President, his national security team, and the State Department have
held with the Whelan and Griner families to keep them updated on efforts
to secure the release of their loved ones as quickly as possible. We all
admire the courage of the Whelan and Griner families in the face of
these unimaginable circumstances, and we remain committed to reuniting
them with their loved ones.
