title: "Readout of Meeting Between President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. and President Cyril\
  \ Ramaphosa of South\_Africa"
---
 
President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with President Cyril Ramaphosa
of South Africa to address opportunities to deepen our relationship,
identify next steps on issues of mutual importance, and discuss regional
and global challenges.  Together they discussed progress on several of
the topics outlined during their initial call in April, including trade
and investment and climate and energy.  To this end, President Biden
announced the creation of a South Africa-U.S. Investment Advisory Task
Force and a planned $45 million investment toward the Just Energy
Transition Partnership. 

The two leaders also committed to addressing several of the world’s most
urgent challenges over which we both share concern, including the
Russia-Ukraine conflict and its negative consequences for food security
in Africa.  The meeting reaffirmed the value of our longstanding
partnership, and underscored South Africa’s influential voice in global
affairs.
