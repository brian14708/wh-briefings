*Biden Administration facilitated air shipment of 5 million 8-ounce
bottle equivalents of Danone Aptamil Gold Plus routine infant formula on
August 29 and September 2*

  
Today, President Biden is announcing that his Administration has sourced
two flights, facilitated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS), for Operation Fly Formula to transport Danone Aptamil
Gold Plus infant formula from New Zealand to, Chicago, Illinois on
August 29 and September 2. These deliveries will include approximately
333,338 pounds of Aptamil Gold Plus, the equivalent of 5 million 8-ounce
bottles. These products will be distributed through retailers.

In May, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that the agency
is exercising enforcement discretion so that Danone can export
additional infant formula, including Neocate Infant DHA/ARA and Aptamil
First Infant Milk Stage 1. Danone plans to export a total of
approximately 39 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents from across its
brands into the U.S. market, which also includes their Aptamil baby
formula from Ireland and New Zealand.

President Biden launched Operation Fly Formula to speed up the import of
infant formula and start getting more formula to stores as soon as
possible. Under Operation Fly Formula, the Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the
General Services Administration (GSA), and the Department of Defense
(DOD) are partnering to pick up overseas infant formula that meets U.S.
health and safety standards, so it can get to store shelves, hospitals
and home health care providers faster. To date, Operation Fly Formula
has transported over 83 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents to the U.S.

In addition, the Biden Administration has taken a number of other
important actions to ensure there is enough safe infant formula for
families, including invoking the Defense Production Act, entering into a
consent agreement between the FDA and Abbott Nutrition to reopen the
company’s Sturgis facility, and issuing FDA guidance so that major
formula manufacturers can safely import formula that is not currently
being produced for the U.S. market. Details of our actions can be found
