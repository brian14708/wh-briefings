title: "FACT SHEET:\_The Biden Administration Continues to Support Hurricane Fiona\
  \ Response Efforts in Puerto\_Rico"
---
 
President Biden remains focused on response and recovery efforts in the
wake of Hurricane Fiona. The President has made clear that Puerto Rico
officials, first responders, and all those impacted by the storm have
the full support of the Federal Government. He approved an Emergency
Declaration prior to landfall and immediately approved the Governor of
Puerto Rico’s request for a Major Disaster Declaration for Individual
and Public Assistance. He has been in regular contact with Puerto Rico
Governor Pierluisi and asked FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell to
travel to the island as soon as the hurricane made landfall.    
  
At a briefing in New York last week with the FEMA Administrator, the
Governor of Puerto Rico, New York Governor Kathy Hochul, New York Mayor
Eric Adams, and other Federal and local officials, President Biden
announced additional financial support for the Commonwealth of Puerto
Rico and pledged to support Puerto Rico in its recovery efforts in the
weeks to come.  
  
Consistent with the President’s direction for a robust and
well-coordinated Federal response, the Administration has taken swift
action to support Hurricane Fiona response and recovery efforts.  
  
**Approved an Emergency Declaration in Before Landfall and a Major
Disaster Declaration for Individual and Public Assistance:**

-   On September 18, before Hurricane Fiona made landfall, the President
    approved an Emergency Declaration for the Commonwealth of Puerto
    Rico. The declaration authorized FEMA to provide assistance for
    emergency measures to save lives and to protect property and public
    health and safety and fund emergency protective measures.  
-   On September 21, President Biden approved a Major Disaster
    Declaration for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, authorizing
    Individual and Public Assistance for impacted municipalities and
    hazard mitigation.  
-   On September 22, the President authorized 100% Federal Cost Share
    for the Government of Puerto Rico to support Public Assistance for
    30 days. This will provide 100% Federal funding for Debris Removal
    and Emergency Protective Measures and help the Commonwealth begin
    their recovery without adding additional financial burden to
    communities that are working to recover. He also increased Critical
    Needs Assistance from $500 to $700 to support individuals and
    families with immediate or critical needs as a result of being
    displaced from their primary dwelling. These could include
    life-saving and life-sustaining items, such as water, food, medical
    support, infant formula, personal hygiene items, and fuel for
    transportation.  
-   As of September 27, Individual Assistance has been approved for all
    municipalities in Puerto Rico.

**Supporting Emergency Response:**

-   As of September 28, there are over 1,000 Federal response workers on
    the ground in Puerto Rico supporting operations, planning, power
    restoration, debris removal, and urban search and rescue. This
    includes over 100 urban search and rescue personnel deployed to
    Puerto Rico in support of the Puerto Rico National Guard and local
    responders.  
-   More than 450 members of the Puerto Rico National Guard are
    conducting search and rescue operations, commodity distribution,
    security operations, and other response and recovery activities.

-   Today, the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway
    Administration announced the immediate availability of $8 million in
    Emergency Relief funds for use by the Puerto Rico Highways and
    Transportation Authority. The funds will offset costs of repair work
    needed as a result of flooding and landslide damage to highways and
    bridges.  
-   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared a Public
    Health Emergency for Puerto Rico due to the flooding impact of
    Hurricane Fiona. The declaration gives the Centers for Medicare and
    Medicaid Services beneficiaries and their health care providers and
    suppliers greater flexibility in meeting emergency health needs.  
-   The U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service
    approved a waiver for the Puerto Rico Department of the Family to
    allow hot foods to be purchased with Nutrition Assistance Program
    benefits through October 9.  
-   FEMA prepositioned supplies on the island including four
    strategically located warehouses throughout the island, more than 7
    million liters of water, more than 4 million ready-to-eat meals,
    more than 215 generators, more than 100,000 tarps, more than 28,000
    plastic covers and more than 10,300 cots and other emergency
    supplies.  
-   The U.S. Coast Guard conducted port assessments and verified proper
    Aids to Navigation to ensure the safe and timely resumption of
    commerce.

**Expediting Power Restoration to Impacted Communities: **

-   Today, the Department of Homeland Security approved a temporary and
    targeted Jones Act waiver allowing 300,000 gallons of much-needed
    diesel fuel to be discharged to Puerto Rico. The Administration
    continues to urge all petroleum refiners to help ensure Puerto Rico
    has adequate fuels supplies, and to use Jones Act compliant vessels
    whenever possible.  
-   Subject matter experts and personnel from FEMA, the Department of
    Energy and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are working intensively
    with Puerto Rico officials on urgent power restoration efforts.  
-   In the aftermath of the Hurricane, Federal responders have worked to
    identify and assess requirements for generators to provide temporary
    back up power to critical facilities and install generators where
    they are needed. There are now more than 200 generators on the
    island available to support key facilities across the island.  

**Investing in Long-term Climate Resilience:**

-   The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides an opportunity to make a
    historic investment in Puerto Rico’s infrastructure to bolster
    resilience against future climate change and extreme weather events.
    To date, more than $184 million has been allocated to Puerto Rico
    for infrastructure resilience in 2022, including $163 million in
    funding for the Caño Martín Peña Channel Restoration from the US
    Army Corps of Engineers.  
-   The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also makes significant investments
    to increase the resilience of Puerto Rico’s grid. The Department of
    Energy’s Preventing Outages and Enhancing the Resilience of the
    Electric Grid formula grant program allocates $3.7 million to Puerto
    Rico in 2022 to improve the resilience of the electric grid against
    disruptive events. The Department’s State Energy Program also
    allocates $4.7 million to Puerto Rico to enhance energy security,
    advance state-led clean energy initiatives, and increase energy
    affordability.  
-   An additional $38 million was allocated to Puerto Rico in 2022 for
    weatherization under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  The
    Weatherization Assistance Program helps low-income families reduce
    household energy expenditures. Examples of weatherization include
    more efficient cooling systems, light fixtures, and household
    appliances, installation of solar water heaters, and measures to
    reduce hot water use.
