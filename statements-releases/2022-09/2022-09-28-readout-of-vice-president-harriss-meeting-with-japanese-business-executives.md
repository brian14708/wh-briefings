Vice President Kamala Harris today convened a group of Japanese business
executives involved in the semiconductor industry for a discussion on
increasing investment in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, strengthening
semiconductor supply chains, and bolstering cooperation on semiconductor
research and development. The Vice President outlined the ongoing
efforts by the Biden-Harris Administration to revitalize domestic
manufacturing, create good-paying jobs, strengthen supply chains, and
accelerate the industries of the future, including through the
bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which makes historic
investments in each of these areas. Participants discussed recent and
future investments by Japanese companies in the U.S. semiconductor
industry and furthering U.S.-Japan collaboration on research and
development. They also discussed continued collaboration to ensure a
more resilient supply chain and to minimize supply chain
vulnerabilities. The Vice President emphasized the strength of the
U.S.-Japan economic partnership and how it directly benefits the
prosperity of the American and Japanese people.
