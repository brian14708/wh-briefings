title: "Readout of President Joe\_Biden Meeting with Economic\_Team"
---
 
The President and Vice President met with members of their economic team
– including the Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce, and the Chair of
the Council of Economic Advisers – for an update on global economic
developments.  They reported that the U.S. economic strategy, focused on
long-term growth and investment, increased manufacturing, and fiscal
discipline, has positioned our country to navigate challenging global
times from the strongest possible position. The President reiterated his
commitment to bring down prices, including by implementing the historic
reforms in the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPs and
Science Act, with the goal of transitioning to more stable growth
without giving up our historic economic gains. He also directed the team
to press the energy industry to ensure that the drop in global oil
prices is passed along at the pump to consumers.”
