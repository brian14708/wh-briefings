title: "Statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on\_Arizona\u2019s Court\_\
  Decision"
---
 
Yesterday’s ruling in Arizona is dangerous and will set Arizona
women back more than a century – to a time before Arizona was even a
state. If this decision stands, health care providers would face
imprisonment of up to five years for fulfilling their duty of
care; survivors of rape and incest would be forced to bear the children
of their assaulters; and women with medical conditions would face dire
health risks. While we await next steps on any implementation of the
law, the potential consequences of this ruling are catastrophic,
dangerous, and unacceptable. Make no mistake: this backwards
decision exemplifies the disturbing trend across the country of
Republican officials at the local and national level dead-set on
stripping women of their rights, including through Senator Graham’s
proposed national abortion ban. The contrast between the President and
his focus on moving the country forward and Republican officials’
obsession with taking our country backwards could not be more stark. The
President and Vice President will continue to push Congress to codify
Roe to protect women’s access to abortion and health care.
