title: "Statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Projected Famine in\
  \ Parts of Somalia this\_Year"
---
 
This week, the humanitarian community’s expert Famine Review Committee
projected that parts of Somalia will likely experience famine between
October and December without significant expansion of assistance. The
United States is gravely concerned by this dire projection and the
significant scale of need throughout the country and region.

This likely famine is the result of a combination of factors. Climate
change continues to wreak havoc on the region, including the worst
drought in the Horn of Africa in 70 years. The region has yet to recover
from the devasting effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. On top of this,
Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine increased the cost of food,
fertilizer, and fuel, further exacerbating humanitarian needs and making
assistance more expensive, thus limiting its reach.  

An official declaration of famine is relatively rare, and takes place
when people experience critical acute malnutrition, starvation, and
death. It can be prevented by timely assistance at scale. The United
States has rapidly ramped up relief efforts to provide emergency
assistance, including food to over 3.5 million people per month, vital
malnutrition treatment, rapid response to disease outbreaks, provision
of shelter and protection services, and ensuring communities have safe
drinking water, sanitation, and improved hygiene. 

U.S. funding to address drought in Somalia is more than $706 million
this fiscal year alone, representing more than half of all humanitarian
funding for Somalia to date in 2022. Sadly, we have not yet seen
additional donors step up with further significant contributions, and
assistance has not met the rising levels of need. It is imperative that
the international community acts immediately in order to save lives and
prevent this projection from becoming reality.
