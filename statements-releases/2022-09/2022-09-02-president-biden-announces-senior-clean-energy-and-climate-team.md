 Today, President Biden announced that John Podesta will serve as Senior

*Statement from President Biden*: “Under Gina McCarthy and Ali Zaidi’s
leadership, my administration has taken the most aggressive action ever,
from historic legislation to bold executive actions, to confront the
climate crisis head-on. The Inflation Reduction Act is the biggest step
forward on clean energy and climate in history, and it paves the way for
additional steps we will take to meet our clean energy and climate
goals.  
   
“We are fortunate that John Podesta will lead our continued innovation
and implementation. His deep roots in climate and clean energy policy
and his experience at senior levels of government mean we can truly hit
the ground running to take advantage of the massive clean energy
opportunity in front of us.  
   
“I am immensely grateful for Gina’s service, and I am proud to announce
the promotion of Ali to National Climate Advisor. Gina has been an
invaluable member of my senior staff since day 1 of the Administration,
and I wish her the best as she moves forward.”
