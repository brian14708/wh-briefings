title: "Joint Leaders Statement to Mark One Year of\_AUKUS"
---
 
In September 2021, the leaders of Australia, the United Kingdom, and the
United States announced AUKUS, an enhanced trilateral security
partnership. The need for this partnership is as clear today as it was a
year ago.  We stand together to support an international order that
respects human rights, the rule of law, and the peaceful resolution of
disputes free from coercion. AUKUS is a central element in our efforts
to achieve these aims.  
   
Over the last 12 months, we have made significant progress towards
Australia acquiring conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines. We
are steadfast in our commitment to Australia acquiring this capability
at the earliest possible date.  
   
As leaders, we remain committed to ensuring the highest level of nuclear
safety, security, and stewardship in this endeavor. Australia does not
seek and will not acquire nuclear weapons. The United States and United
Kingdom are fully committed to establishing an approach to sharing naval
nuclear propulsion technology with Australia that meets the highest
non-proliferation standard.  We welcome International Atomic Energy
Agency Director General Grossi’s report to the September IAEA Board of
Governors meeting on this issue, in which the Director General reported
his satisfaction with our engagement. The international community can be
confident that our nations will continue to work transparently with the
IAEA towards an approach that will strengthen the non-proliferation
regime.   
   
Through AUKUS, we have also made significant strides in our trilateral
cooperation on advanced capability initiatives: hypersonics and
counter-hypersonics, electronic warfare capabilities, cyber, artificial
intelligence and autonomy, quantum technologies, and additional undersea
capabilities. To support further progress on these initiatives, we
continue to promote greater information and technology sharing, foster
deeper integration of our industrial bases and supply chains, and
accelerate our defense innovation enterprises.  As our work progresses
on these and other critical defense and security capabilities, we will
seek opportunities to engage allies and close partners.  
   
Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States have a proud
history of working together, along with other allies and partners, to
protect our shared values and uphold the rules based international
order.  Today, as we mark the one-year anniversary of AUKUS, we reaffirm
our commitment to that critical endeavor and to peace and security in
the Indo-Pacific.
