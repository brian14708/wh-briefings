title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Actions to Prevent\_Suicide"
---
 
In recognition of Suicide Prevention Awareness Month, the Biden-Harris
Administration is highlighting key actions it has advanced across the
federal government to improve suicide prevention. Suicide is a complex
problem with no single cause and no single solution, but the
Administration is committed to taking aggressive actions, including:

-   **Tackling the Mental Health Crisis.** President Biden named
    tackling the mental health crisis a key pillar of his Unity Agenda,
    laying out [a strategy to
    transform](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/01/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-announce-strategy-to-address-our-national-mental-health-crisis-as-part-of-unity-agenda-in-his-first-state-of-the-union/)
    how mental health is understood, perceived, accessed, treated, and
    integrated – in and out of health care settings. Released in March,
    the President’s strategy outlined several actions to: (1) strengthen
    system capacity; (2) connect more Americans to care, and: (3) create
    healthy environments to strengthen mental health. Ensuring a robust
    crisis services infrastructure is a key focus area being pursued
    under this strategy.  
-   **Launching 988 as the New National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline**.
    Ensuring timely access to crisis intervention saves lives. In July,
    the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department
    of Veterans Affairs (VA) [successfully transitioned to the new easy
    to remember number
    9-8-8](https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com/policy-value-based-care/news/21280395/hhs-releases-data-on-transition-to-988-suicide-and-crisis-lifeline),
    making it easier for individuals in crisis to access life-saving
    crisis counseling. The Biden Administration has invested $432
    million – an 18-fold increase in federal support – to help states
    prepare for transition, providing critical resources to help ensure
    access to trained crisis counselors via phone, chat, and text.  
-   **Improving Suicide Screening and Risk Detection**. Identifying
    individuals at risk and connecting them to care is essential for
    preventing suicide. In January, the Health Resources and Services
    Administration (HRSA) [Bright Futures
    Program](https://mchb.hrsa.gov/programs-impact/bright-futures)
    updated its national guidelines to include universal screening for
    suicide risk for youth ages 12-21 years. With this update, most
    private health plans will be required to cover this screening at no
    cost to patients. Also in January, the Department of Homeland
    Security (DHS) implemented the DHS-Columbia Protocol Mobile App to
    help identify those at elevated risk for suicide and direct them to
    support and care.  
-   **Promoting Lethal Means Safety**. Suicide crises are often brief,
    and putting time and space between a person in crisis and access to
    lethal means is critical. The Administration has advanced an
    unprecedented focus on promoting firearm safety. In May, CDC
    published a [Vital Signs Report on Firearm
    Safety](https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/firearm-deaths/index.html)
    highlighting the growing disparities in firearm violence, including
    firearm-related suicide, and emphasized the importance of lethal
    mean safety. VA launched the first of its kind paid media campaign,
    [KeepItSecure.net](https://www.va.gov/reach/lethal-means/), to
    highlight the importance of firearm safe storage in preventing
    veteran suicide. In January 2022,
    ATF [issued](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/01/04/2021-28398/secure-gun-storage-and-definition-of-antique-firearm#:~:text=This%20rule%20amends%20ATF%27s%20regulations%20to%20account%20for,are%20sold%20under%20the%20license%20to%20nonlicensed%20individuals.) a
    final rule clarifying firearms dealers’ statutory obligations to
    make available for purchase compatible secure gun storage or safety
    devices. The Department of Defense (DoD)
    [released](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2998717/dod-safe-handling-storage-of-lethal-means-key-to-suicide-prevention/)
    new evidence-informed communication tools, including a public
    service announcement, to encourage safe storage among military
    service members and their families. And, as part of the White House
    strategy to end military and veteran suicide, DOD, HHS, DHS, DOJ,
    and the Office of Emergency Medical Services in the Department of
    Transportation will create a joint plan for educating the public on
    lethal means safety.  
-   **Supporting Populations at High-Risk.** Several populations are at
    high risk for suicide, including American Indians, Alaska Native
    youth, LGTBQI+ youth, rural men, military veterans, law enforcement
    officials and health professionals. In November, the White House
    released a [comprehensive, cross-sector, public health strategy to
    reduce military and veteran
    suicide](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/02/fact-sheet-new-strategy-outlines-five-priorities-for-reducing-military-and-veteran-suicide/).
    This strategy identified five priority goals for harnessing a whole
    of government approach to prevent suicide in the military and
    veteran community. In January, HRSA awarded $103 million in
    [Resiliency
    Awards](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/01/20/biden-harris-administration-awards-103-million-american-rescue-plan-funds-reduce-burnout-promote-mental-health-wellness-among-health-care-workforce.html#:~:text=Promoting%20Resilience%20and%20Mental%20Health%20Among%20Health%20Professional,well-being%20among%20the%20health%20workforce%2C%20including%20their%20employees.)
    to help promote mental wellbeing and reduce suicide occurrences
    among health professionals. In May, HRSA launched the [National
    Maternal Mental Health
    Hotline](https://mchb.hrsa.gov/national-maternal-mental-health-hotline),
    a free, confidential, 24/7 resource for pregnant and postpartum
    individuals facing mental health challenges. HRSA also is supporting
    Rural Health Information Hub [Response to Farmer Mental Health and
    Suicide
    Prevention](https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/topics/farmer-mental-health)
    focusing on programs to address mental health concerns, stress, and
    suicide rates among farmers and ranchers.  In April, the Indian
    Health Service, awarded $10 million for Zero Suicide Initiative
    grants to six Tribes and two Urban Indian Organizations to improve
    the system of care for those at risk for suicide by implementing a
    comprehensive, culturally informed, multi-setting approach to
    suicide prevention in Indian health systems.  
-   **Enhancing Community-Based Prevention Efforts**. There are many
    factors that contribute to risk of suicide, including job strain or
    loss; serious illness, including mental illness; and financial,
    criminal, legal, and relationship problems. Reducing suicide
    requires implementing community-based efforts that address all these
    factors. Earlier this month, CDC announced expansion of their
    [Comprehensive Suicide
    Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/suicide/programs/csp/index.html?ACSTrackingID=USCDC_1228-DM89608&ACSTrackingLabel=CDC%20Expands%20Comprehensive%20Suicide%20Prevention%20Program%2C%20Announcing%20Newly%20Funded%20Groups&deliveryName=USCDC_1228-DM89608)
    (CSP) program to 15 states and 2 universities total, with
    approximately $15 million in annual funding. VA announced $52
    million for 80 community-based organizations to deliver or
    coordinate suicide prevention programs and services for veterans and
    their family members. SAMHSA awarded $1.6 million to the Suicide
    Prevention Resource Center to improve training for the suicide
    prevention workforce, advance the development of community
    infrastructure for suicide prevention, and provide additional
    technical assistance in suicide prevention.  
-   **Improving Mobile Crisis Care**. Ensuring rapid response by trained
    mental health and substance use treatment professionals and
    paraprofessionals safely connects individuals in crisis to needed
    services. With funding from the American Rescue Plan, CMS awarded
    $15 million planning grants to 20 State Medicaid Agencies to develop
    plans to provide qualifying community-based mobile crisis
    intervention services. Earlier this month,
    [HHS](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/09/12/hhs-approves-nations-first-medicaid-mobile-crisis-intervention-services-program-to-be-launched-in-oregon.html)
    approved the nation’s first Medicaid mobile crisis intervention
    services program under the new ARP option in Oregon. And, in May,
    HHS announced an additional $9 million in [Cooperative Agreements
    for Innovative Crisis Response
    Partnerships](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samhsa.gov%2Fgrants%2Fgrant-announcements%2Fsm-22-016&data=05%7C01%7CRichard.McKeon%40samhsa.hhs.gov%7Cd4ec85d70cb94eb38c6408da9ca1edd5%7Cd58addea50534a808499ba4d944910df%7C0%7C0%7C637994516545145674%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=Krajts2tHInbPVvY5duZrFkWNCXAaw3IiCOtO0qvyY8%3D&reserved=0) grants
    for states, territories, tribes and other entities to create or
    enhance existing mobile crisis response teams.  
-   **Preventing Youth Suicide:** SAMHSA announced $7.3 million
    in [Cooperative Agreements for the Garrett Lee Smith (GLS)
    State/Tribal Youth Suicide Prevention and Early Intervention
    Program](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samhsa.gov%2Fgrants%2Fgrant-announcements%2Fsm-22-003&data=05%7C01%7CRichard.McKeon%40samhsa.hhs.gov%7Cd4ec85d70cb94eb38c6408da9ca1edd5%7Cd58addea50534a808499ba4d944910df%7C0%7C0%7C637994516545145674%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=p0kNVStyfmdzHoyZOsW61iK1thd%2B3x6ljQX%2F44oyC1Y%3D&reserved=0) to
    support youth suicide prevention and early intervention strategies
    in schools, institutions of higher education, juvenile justice
    systems, substance use and mental health programs, foster care
    systems, and other child and youth-serving organizations. SAMHSA
    also announced $2.2 for the [GLS Campus Suicide Prevention Grant
    Program](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samhsa.gov%2Fgrants%2Fgrant-announcements%2Fsm-22-004&data=05%7C01%7CRichard.McKeon%40samhsa.hhs.gov%7Cd4ec85d70cb94eb38c6408da9ca1edd5%7Cd58addea50534a808499ba4d944910df%7C0%7C0%7C637994516545145674%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=CqgeJ67uFMmRfPB2AZAyGdsfSuD9S7uYnHOBAMiCO%2Bk%3D&reserved=0) to
    support a comprehensive public health and evidence-based approach
    that enhances mental health services for all college students,
    including those at risk for suicide, depression, serious mental
    illness (SMI)/serious emotional disturbances (SED), and/or substance
    use disorders.  
-   **Understanding Risk Factors and Tailoring Solutions**. To
    facilitate culturally appropriate, evidence-based solutions, we need
    better data on the factors that contribute to suicide. In May, DoD
    established the [Suicide Prevention and Response Independent Review
    Committee](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3034611/dod-announces-suicide-prevention-and-response-independent-review-committee-memb/)
    to comprehensively review programs and factors that may prevent
    suicide in the military. CDC and DoD began linking data systems to
    improve the DoD’s Suicide Event Report and are sharing [National
    Violent Death Reporting
    System](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/datasources/nvdrs/)
    data on veterans and civilian populations to better understand the
    contributors to suicide in these populations.  
-   **Increasing Access to Effective Care**. Decreasing barriers to
    affordable, high quality mental health care is a known, effective
    suicide prevention strategy. To help veterans in need get connected
    to the care or other support services, VA launched the “[Don’t Wait.
    Reach Out](https://www.va.gov/REACH/)” campaign.  In March, the
    Deputy Secretary of Defense issued a message to all Defense
    personnel, including service members, reminding them to prioritize
    their mental health. The memo assured personnel that seeking
    professional mental health care would not jeopardize their security
    clearances and encouraged all leaders to promote help seeking. In
    addition, HRSA funds [Pediatric Mental Health Care
    Access](https://mchb.hrsa.gov/programs-impact/programs/pediatric-mental-health-care-access)
    (PMHCA) grant program, to increase access to pediatric mental health
    care by building workforce capacity.  
-   **Providing Technical Support to Communities.** Helping communities
    focus on activities with the greatest potential to prevent suicide
    is a critical. This fall, CDC will publish the Suicide Prevention
    Resource for Action, an update to their [Suicide Prevention
    Technical
    Package](https://www.cdc.gov/suicide/pdf/suicideTechnicalPackage.pdf).
    CDC is also funding the launch of a Community-Led Suicide Prevention
    website that will provide step-by-step process tools to help
    communities plan and work towards suicide prevention goals. To
    further support communities, HHS and VA expanded their Governor’s
    Challenge for Prevent Suicide Among Service Members, Veterans, and
    their Families to 49 states and 5 territories, all are working to
    develop and implement state-wide suicide prevention best practices
    using a public health approach.  
-   **Promoting Access to Better Data.** CDC is funding the New
    Opportunities for Health and Resilience Measures for Suicide (NO
    HARMS) project to create a ‘living’ data resource through the
    linkage of cross-sector data with seven new data sets. CDC also
    funded 10 states in its [Emergency Department Surveillance of
    Nonfatal Suicide-Related
    Outcomes](https://www.cdc.gov/suicide/programs/ed-snsro/index.html)
    (ED SENSRO) project that tracked and monitored suicide attempts and
    ideation in near real-time, helping jurisdictions detect potential
    suicide spikes, clusters, or outbreaks and rapidly share this
    information with local practitioners and organizations. HRSA also
    expanded the [Fetal, Infant, and Child Death Review
    Program](https://www.hrsa.gov/library/national-fetal-infant-and-child-death-review-program)
    to gather more in-depth information on child deaths by suicide.

Suicide was a leading cause of death in the United States during 2021,
claiming the lives of more than 47,000 individuals. Tragically, suicide
was the second leading cause of death among young people. To those
experiencing emotional distress or those that care for them, please know
that you are loved, and that you are not alone. There is hope, and there
is help. Please call or text 9-8-8 to reach the National Suicide &
Crisis Lifeline.
