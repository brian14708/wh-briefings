  \ on Digital Assets\_Framework"

At the direction of President Biden and after 180 days of determined
work across the Biden-Harris administration, we are releasing the
[first-ever comprehensive federal digital assets
framework](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/16/fact-sheet-white-house-releases-first-ever-comprehensive-framework-for-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/(opens%20in%20a%20new%20tab))–
positioning us to keep playing a leading role in the innovation and
governance of the digital assets ecosystem at home and abroad and in a
way that protects consumers, is consistent with our democratic values,
and advances U.S. global competitiveness.

First, consistent with the President’s directive to place the “highest
urgency” on research and development of a U.S. central bank digital
currency (CBDC), the Administration encourages the Federal Reserve to
continue its research and experimentation. We will also launch an
interagency working group to support Federal Reserve efforts by the
considering policy implications of a potential CBDC, especially for our
national security. The leadership of the Federal Reserve, the National
Economic Council, the National Security Council, the Office of Science
and Technology Policy, the Treasury Department, and other agencies as
appropriate, will meet regularly to discuss updates and progress.
Second, the Administration will execute a comprehensive action plan with
priority steps to mitigate key risks of cryptocurrencies—among others,
money laundering and financing for terrorism. Agencies have developed
recommendations to improve our ability to track, trace, and counter
illicit cryptocurrency use, and urge further steps to redouble U.S.
sanctions enforcement. Third, the reports propose critical measures to
protect consumers, investors, and businesses—a top priority for
President Biden. The reports encourage regulators, as they deem
appropriate, to scale up investigations into digital asset market
misconduct, redouble their enforcement efforts, and strengthen
interagency coordination. To accomplish all the above steps, the reports
call for continued engagement with allies and partners on these issues,
which will reinforce U.S. technological and financial leadership
globally.

Together, we are laying the groundwork for a thoughtful, comprehensive
approach to mitigating digital assets’ acute risks and—where
proven—harnessing their benefits. We remain committed to working with
allies, partners, and the broader digital asset community to shape the
future of this ecosystem.
