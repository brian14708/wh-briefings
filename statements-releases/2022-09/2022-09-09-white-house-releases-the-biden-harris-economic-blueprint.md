title: "White\_House Releases The Biden-\u2060Harris Economic\_Blueprint"
---
 
Today, the White House is releasing the President’s Economic Blueprint,
explaining how his historic legislative successes, and executive actions
the Administration has taken, are rebuilding the economy from the bottom
up and middle out now and for years ahead.

The President’s first two years in office have been two of the most
productive in American history, and as the Blueprint explains, these
accomplishments are all part of one economic vision. This Congressional
session, the President and Congressional Democrats passed the most
aggressive economic recovery package since FDR, the most substantial
infrastructure investment since Eisenhower, the most significant
investment in manufacturing and research and development in history, and
a historic law to lower costs for families and accelerate clean energy
manufacturing.

The Blueprint is being released as the President travels to Ohio for the
groundbreaking of Intel’s new manufacturing facility – the result of the
President’s CHIPS and Science Act – and ahead of next week when he will
sign the Inflation Reduction Act into law.  

President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Congressional Democrats
quickly spurred the strongest and most equitable economic and labor
market recovery in modern history, after inheriting a pandemic economic
crisis. While it will take time and there is more work to do, including
immediate work to support the U.S. economy’s transition from historic
recovery to stable, steady, growth with lower inflation, the
Biden-Harris Administration has laid the foundation to begin tackling
decades-long economic challenges and finally deliver an economy that
works for working families.

***President Biden’s economic blueprint has five pillars:***

1.  **Empowering Workers**, with more, good-paying jobs and greater
    worker power to unionize and have dignity at work.  
2.  **Making and Building it in America**, by investing in
    infrastructure, making America the world’s leader in clean energy
    jobs and innovation, bolstering our manufacturing base, and buying
    American.  
3.  **Giving Families Breathing Room**, by lowering costs and expanding
    access to prescription drugs and high-quality health care,
    high-speed internet, education, child care and long-term care,
    housing, and other essential needs.  
4.  **Making American Industry More Competitive, Less Concentrated, and
    More Resilient**, by taking on corporate concentration, promoting
    small businesses and entrepreneurs including minority and women
    owned businesses, and supporting resilient supply chains.  
5.  **Rewarding Work, Not Wealth**, with worker-centric tax reform that
    ensures the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share,
    while never raising taxes on households with incomes below $400,000,
    as was done in the Inflation Reduction
    Act.[](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Wyoming-BIL-Fact-Sheet.pdf)
