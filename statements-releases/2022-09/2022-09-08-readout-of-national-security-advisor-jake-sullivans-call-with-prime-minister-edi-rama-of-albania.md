National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke today with Prime Minister
Edi Rama of Albania to express the United States’ strong support for our
NATO Ally following Iran’s cyberattack on July 15. They committed
to continue working together on Albania’s remediation efforts and
cybersecurity measures. In addition, Mr. Sullivan expressed appreciation
for Albania’s generous hosting of Afghan nationals who have fled
Afghanistan, many of whom assisted U.S. efforts there. They also
discussed our ongoing partnership on regional and global
issues, including at NATO.
