*$225 Million in Training Grants Awarded Today; American Rescue Plan
Investments for Community Health Workforce Total Over $1.1 Billion*

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is [awarding $225
million](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/09/30/new-american-rescue-plan-funding-hhs-expands-and-strengthens-community-and-public-health-workforce.html) in
American Rescue Plan funds to train over 13,000 Community Health Workers
(CHWs). In response to the acute need to expand the health care
workforce and address pandemic-related burnout, the American Rescue Plan
provided historic investments. Among these investments, President
Biden’s American Rescue Plan provided a total of over $1.1 billion for
community health, outreach, and health education workers—the largest
ever one-time investment in the nation’s community health workforce.
These investments are expected to deploy over 40,000 people in community
health, outreach, and health education roles over the coming years. This
investment will build on the roughly 50,000 CHWs who were already
working in American communities before the pandemic.  
  
CHWs are an
[evidence-based](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4816154/),
[cost-effective](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2019.00981)
public health workforce to improve population health and strengthen
health systems. [Particularly for underserved
communities,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4785041/)
CHWs, as well as outreach and health education workers, serve as trusted
messengers and advocates helping to facilitate communication between
individuals and health care providers. They also play a key role in
addressing pre-existing health inequities that were exacerbated by the
pandemic.  
  
President Biden understands the importance of investing in a modern
public health workforce, and his Administration continues to deliver on
his campaign promise to expand the community health workforce. Although
there is more work to do to secure and build upon this progress, the
American Rescue Plan strengthened our public health system during the
pandemic and is building capacity for the future.  
  
Today’s announcement builds on other critical American Rescue Plan
investments in our community health workforce, including:

-   **Rapid deployment of over 14,000 community outreach workers
    (including CHWs) through over 150 national and local organizations
    to deepen COVID-19 vaccine confidence, increase vaccination rates,
    and serve as trusted messengers in underserved communities.**
    Examples include:
    -   **The Association of Asian/Pacific Community Health
        Organizations** used American Rescue Plan funds to establish the
        CHW Workforce Collaborative (the Collaborative). The
        Collaborative has since hired, trained, and deployed more than
        250 CHWs who speak over 36 Asian, Native Hawaiian and Pacific
        Islander languages in 12 continental U.S. states and Hawaii.
    -   **The Communities RISE Together initiative, supported by WE in
        the World and the Public Health Institute**, is using American
        Rescue Plan funding to recruit, hire, and train CHWs to work
        with Black, Native American, Latinx, Asian American/Pacific
        Islander, immigrant/migrant, and low-income older adult
        populations in 200+ counties across the country. RISE partners
        train and engage vaccine ambassadors and promotors to serve as
        trusted messengers and connect community members with vaccines
        and well-being needs, while working to address underlying
        drivers of health inequities.  
-   **Jurisdictions across the country are also utilizing American
    Rescue Plan State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds to create CHW
    programs tailored to their communities’ needs.** Examples include:
    -   **Chicago, IL** has hired more than 800 local health workers and
        provided them with broader healthcare training. This program is
        building the skills of residents in communities experiencing the
        greatest economic hardship in the healthcare jobs we need
        tomorrow, while supporting critical health needs in the
        community today. 
    -   **New York City, NY** is building a corps of over 500 CHWs
        across the city. These individuals will educate New Yorkers on
        health matters, connecting them to essential healthcare services
        and enabling them to meet their health goals.
    -   **San Diego County, CA** has mobilized over 250 CHWs, who
        collectively speak 26 languages, to provide tailored outreach
        and education to residents who have been traditionally hard to
        reach. They have focused on underserved and under-immunized
        communities, including Black and African American, Latino,
        refugee, and Asian and Pacific Islander communities.
    -   **Detroit, MI** is investing $15 million in a Community Health
        Corps to help Detroit residents who are living significantly
        below the federal poverty line resolve their needs.
-   **Establishment of a first-of-its-kind Public Health AmeriCorps, a
    historic partnership between AmeriCorps and the Centers for Disease
    Control and Prevention (CDC), to build and train the next generation
    of public health leaders. The program will place up to 3,000
    AmeriCorps members during its first year, with thousands more
    expected in the coming years**. Examples include:
    -   **Family Scholar House in Kentucky** is engaging 200 AmeriCorps
        members to provide healthcare support and services to seniors
        and disabled individuals in healthcare facilities across
        Kentucky.
    -   **DeKalb County** **in Georgia** is engaging 16 AmeriCorps
        members to provide capacity, support, and increased awareness of
        COVID-19 testing and vaccination accessibility to support
        equitable health outcomes and COVID-19 recovery in underserved
        communities.
    -   **Houston Health Department** is engaging 25 full-time
        AmeriCorps members to provide navigation services and health
        education in historically underserved and social vulnerability
        index (SVI) priority zip codes in Houston, Texas. The AmeriCorps
        members will provide health education and increase access to
        healthcare and human services.

**<u>Investments in community health and outreach workers are part of
the American Rescue Plan’s historic investment of over $12 billion in
our health workforce</u><u>—among the largest one-time infusions of
resources in history</u><u>; this figure does not include the billions
invested in the workforce for home and community-based services</u>**.
These investments are helping respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, address
long-standing inequities, and build capacity for the future. These
investments include:

-   Recruiting, training, and supporting health care professionals
-   Surging resources to state and local public health departments
-   Helping address America’s mental health and substance use crisis

**<u>Recruiting, Training, and Supporting Health Care
Professionals</u>**  
The U.S. is experiencing a severe shortage of health care professionals,
especially in rural and underserved communities. In 2019, the United
States had nearly [20,000 fewer doctors than
required](https://www.aamc.org/media/54681/download?attachment) to meet
the country’s health care need; that gap could grow as high as [124,000
by
2034](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2022/03/25/health-worker-shortage-forces-states-to-scramble).
Each year through 2031, on average there will be [more than 203,000 job
openings](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/registered-nurses.htm) for
registered nurses. Rural regions are particularly impacted by shortages:
[20% of Americans live in rural areas but only one-tenth of physicians
practice in rural
areas](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6140198/#b2-ms114_p0363).
These shortages have been exacerbated by recruitment challenges and
provider burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic.

-   **Thanks to American Rescue Plan funding, HRSA nearly quadrupled the
    number of National Health Service Corps scholarships awarded and
    nearly doubled the number of Nurse Corps scholarships awarded in
    2021.** With additional support from ARP, a record 22,700 health
    care providers – the largest number ever supported – now practice in
    underserved communities and are treating more than 23 million
    patients thanks to loan repayment and scholarship payments.
-   **The American Rescue Plan is addressing the nation’s provider
    burnout and exhaustion crisis by investing $120 million towards
    health worker resiliency and training programs.** 
-   **The American Rescue Plan is utilizing $330 million to help train
    more primary care physicians and dentists in high-need areas.** This
    investment more than doubles typical annual appropriations for the
    Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education Program, which
    supports primary care residency programs in rural and underserved
    communities.

**<u>Surging Resources to State and Local Public Health
Departments</u>**  
The American public health system has been woefully underfunded;
COVID-19 exposed these inadequacies nationwide. [By some
estimates](/Users/AKSandhu/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/XYHULT6S/Staffing-Up-FINAL.pdf%20(debeaumont.org)),
state and local public health departments needed to increase their
pre-pandemic workforce by 80% to provide a minimum set of public health
services.

-   **The American Rescue Plan provided $2 billion in workforce funding
    through CDC to add over 8,600 staff to help state and local
    governments respond to COVID-19.** These new staff include school
    nurses, clinical staff, and epidemiology staff. Jurisdictions were
    also able to offer training and development opportunities, retain
    staff, provide competitive salaries, and establish paid internships
    and fellowships.
-   **The American Rescue Plan is investing a historic $3 billion to
    help state, local, and territorial public health departments build
    resilience against future public health emergencies.** This flexible
    CDC funding will allow jurisdictions, in part, to make long-term
    investments in their workforce.

**<u>Helping Address America’s Mental Health and Substance Use
Crisis</u>**  
Americans are experiencing an unprecedented mental health and substance
use crisis, with demand for services far greater than the capacity of
the workforce to provide services.

-   **The American Rescue Plan invested $180 million to bolster capacity
    for the National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.** Historically, the
    National Suicide Prevention Lifeline was under-resourced and
    understaffed, leading to low answer rates and response times. These
    funds are also supporting the Lifeline’s transition to 988, an
    easy-to-remember number for individuals to reach the Lifeline and
    gain 24/7 access to trained counselors who can help people
    experiencing suicidal, substance use, and other mental health
    crises.
-   **The American Rescue Plan invested $100 million to train graduate
    students to support behavioral health needs among vulnerable
    populations.** This investment supports placements at health centers
    and other community-based settings where trainees will work in the
    underserved communities where behavioral health services are most
    urgently needed.
