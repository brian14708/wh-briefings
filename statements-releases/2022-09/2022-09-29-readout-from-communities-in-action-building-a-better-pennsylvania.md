title: "Readout from Communities in Action: Building A Better\_Pennsylvania"
---
 
Today, the President spoke with nearly 50 elected officials and
community leaders from across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania during
the White House “Communities in Action: Building a Better Pennsylvania”
event. The half-day forum was hosted by the Office of Intergovernmental
Affairs and the Office of Public Engagement and featured senior
Biden-Harris Administration officials, including Second Gentleman
Douglas Emhoff, Department of Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, Senior
Advisor to the President Anita Dunn, Senior Advisor and Director of
Intergovernmental Affairs Julie Rodriguez, Senior Advisor and Director
of Public Engagement Keisha Lance Bottoms, Council on Environmental
Quality Chair Brenda Mallory, Senior Advisor and White House American
Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene Sperling, and Special Assistant to the
President and Deputy Director of Intergovernmental Affairs Gabe Amo.
U.S. Congresswoman Madeline Dean (PA-4) and U.S. Congresswoman Mary Gay
Scanlon (PA-5) also participated in the event.

During the event, President Biden and administration officials
underscored the impact of the Biden economic plan – including the
American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction
Act, and the CHIPS and Science Act — which is creating good paying jobs,
bringing manufacturing back to America, and lowering costs for
Pennsylvania families. They also discussed how the Biden-Harris
Administration will continue to partner with states and local
governments, labor leaders, businesses, non-profits, and health care
leaders to leverage these historic investments to create and expand
opportunities for working families in the Keystone State. This was the
third in a series of “Communities in Action” events that the White House
will host with state, local and Tribal leaders to demonstrate how the
Biden-Harris Administration is delivering results for the American
people.
