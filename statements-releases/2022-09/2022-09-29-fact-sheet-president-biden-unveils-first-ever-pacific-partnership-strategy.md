[Read the full strategy

*“The United States is a proud Pacific power.  We will continue to be an
active, engaged partner in the region.”*  
*President Joseph R. Biden, Jr.*

*“The history and the future of the Pacific Islands and the United
States are inextricably linked.”*  
*Vice President Kamala Harris*

The Pacific Islands region – an “ocean continent” spanning nearly 15
percent of the Earth’s surface – is a vital sub-region of the
Indo-Pacific. It holds opportunities and challenges, from the climate
crisis to an increasingly complex geopolitical landscape. The United
States recognizes that geography links the Pacific’s future to our own:
U.S. prosperity and security depend on the Pacific region remaining free
and open.  
  
To that end, the Biden-Harris Administration is elevating broader and
deeper engagement with the Pacific Islands as a priority of its foreign
policy. This national strategy, the first-ever from the U.S. government
dedicated to the Pacific Islands, both reflects and advances that
commitment. It supports the Indo-Pacific Strategy of the United States
and is aligned with the goals of the Pacific Island Forum’s 2050
Strategy.  
  
As part of its Pacific strategy, the United States will pursue four
objectives:

I. <span style="text-decoration: underline">A STRONG U.S.-PACIFIC
ISLANDS PARTNERSHIP</span>

 The foundation of our engagement in the Pacific Islands must be strong
ties between the United States and the Pacific Islands, individually and
collectively. We will:

-   **Fulfill and Increase U.S. Commitments to the Pacific:** We will
    fulfill our historical commitments and strengthen our enduring
    relationships with the full Pacific Islands region, including by:
    -   *Successfully completing negotiations on the Compacts of Free
        Association (COFA) with the Republic of Palau, the Republic of
        the Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia*
    -   *Successfully concluding negotiations on the South Pacific Tuna
        Treaty Annex amendments and associated Economic Assistance
        Agreement for 2023 and beyond*  
-   **Build U.S. Capacity to Support the Pacific:** The United States
    will demonstrate the level of diplomatic attention the Pacific
    deserves and position ourselves to best meet the needs of Pacific
    Island countries, including by:
    -   *Expanding U.S. diplomatic missions from six to nine across the
        Pacific*
    -   *Deploying additional personnel across the Pacific*
    -   *Reestablishing a USAID mission in Fiji*

II\. <span style="text-decoration: underline"> A UNITED PACIFIC ISLANDS
REGION CONNECTED WITH THE WORLD</span>

The Pacific Islands region is stronger united, with the Pacific Islands
Forum at its core.  The Pacific Islands Forum provides a platform for
Pacific Islands to speak with a common voice to drive Pacific priorities
and engage other partners, including the United States ‑ a proud
Dialogue Partner of the organization.  We will coordinate with other
nations and do so according to principles of Pacific regional
cooperation, transparency, and accountability. We will:

-   **Bolster Pacific Regionalism and Elevate the Pacific in the
    Regional Architecture:** The Pacific Islands are stronger when
    regional institutions are strong.  The United States will continue
    to support the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), ensuring it remains at
    the center of the regional architecture.  The U.S. will elevate its
    commitment to Pacific regionalism by:
    -   *Appointing the first-ever U.S. envoy to the PIF*
    -   *Encouraging connectivity with existing multilateral groupings,
        including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and
        the Quad*
    -   *Supporting other regional organizations*  
-   **Coordinate with Allies and Partners, within and beyond the
    region:** The United States will continue to closely coordinate with
    our Allies and Partners to ensure our support for the Pacific
    Islands is effective and meets the needs of the people. We will
    prioritize consultation and coordination with the Pacific Islands
    and the PIF, including by:
    -   *Bolstering the Partners in the Blue Pacific, an initiative
        among Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and the United
        Kingdom to better meet the needs of people across the Pacific*

III\. <span style="text-decoration: underline">A RESILIENT PACIFIC
ISLAND REGION PREPARED FOR THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND OTHER 21ST CENTURY
CHALLENGES</span>

The Pacific Islands region faces daunting and mounting challenges. 
Chief among these challenges is the climate crisis, an existential
threat to many Pacific Islands.  The United States is committed to
maintaining its global leadership in combatting the climate crisis,
while partnering with the Pacific Islands in adapting to and managing
the impacts of climate change on lives, health, and livelihoods.  The
region also faces challenges to security and sovereignty, including in
the maritime domain.  The Biden-Harris Administration will work in
partnership with Pacific governments and people to ensure they have the
autonomy and security to advance their own interests.  We support the
Pacific Islands as they guard against corruption and protect the dignity
of Pacific Islanders. We will:

-   **Combat the Climate Crisis and Build Climate Resilience in the
    Pacific:** Of all the 21st-century challenges we face, none is more
    pressing for the Pacific Islands region than climate change. We will
    collaborate with the Pacific Islands to tackle the climate crisis
    and limit its effects on the Pacific, including by:
    -   *Striving to enhance the adaptive capacity and build upon the
        resilience of Pacific Islands to the devastating impacts of
        climate change through the President’s Emergency Plan for
        Adaptation and Resilience (PREPARE) *
    -   *Collaborating with partners and international institutions to
        improve Pacific Island countries’ access to adaptation finance
        from multiple sources*
    -   *Driving action and supporting investment in climate mitigation
        in the region*  
-   **Support Marine Conservation, Maritime Security, and Sovereign
    Rights:** The United States will support the Pacific Islands as they
    continue to shoulder the great responsibility of stewardship over
    the Blue Pacific Continent, including by:
    -   *Increasing United States Coast Guard (USCG), National Oceanic
        and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and Department of Defense
        (DOD) presence*
    -   *Coordinating security cooperation and training with likeminded
        partners and with civil society*
    -   *Developing sustainable, climate resilient “blue” economies to
        sustainably manage Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), including
        fisheries and protected areas and coordinate security
        cooperation and training with other partners*  
-   **Support good governance and the human rights of all people:** The
    Pacific Islands region is home to diverse democracies and
    participatory governance. The United States will continue supporting
    democracy, human rights, and good governance, including by:
    -   *Building capacity among Pacific Island stakeholders in
        government, private sector, media, academia, and civil society*

IV\. <span style="text-decoration: underline">EMPOWERED AND PROSPEROUS
ISLANDERS</span>

To fully empower the Pacific to capitalize on the opportunities of the
21st century, the United States is committed to increasing trade and
investment with the Pacific Islands, including through the Partnership
for Global Infrastructure and Investment; expanding people-to-people
ties, including through the Peace Corps; increasing English-language
programming and overall professional advancement; bolstering health
architecture in the Pacific; and providing educational and development
opportunities for Pacific Islanders, with a particular focus on women
and youth.

-   **Create Economic Opportunities and Forge Connectivity:** The United
    States will partner with the Pacific Islands and partners and allies
    to drive economic growth and prosperity regionally and globally. We
    will focus on key logistics, transportation, and technologies to
    enhance connectivity within the Pacific Islands region and with the
    world, including by:
    -   *Collaborating with partners on submarine cable implementation
        and upgrades and other connectivity options*
    -   *Working with Pacific Island leaders to leverage private sector
        solutions to advance strategic projects and commercial
        priorities in the region.  
        *
-   **Bolster Health Architecture to Promote Health Security:** The
    United States will partner with public-health experts and networks
    to improve how the region effectively prevents, detects, and
    responds to infectious disease threats, including by:
    -   *Working to meet the COVID-19 vaccination needs of the region to
        lift the Pacific Islands out of the emergency phase of COVID-19*
    -   *Strengthening regional health security in preparation for
        future outbreaks  
        *
-   **Partner with Pacific Islanders to Strengthen People-to-People Ties
    and Seize 21st Century Opportunities**. We will support Pacific
    Islands in their objective to ensure that everyone can realize their
    full potential including by:
    -   *Offering enhanced educational experiences through student and
        professional exchange, enhanced curriculum, and the
        establishment of Pacific Studies programs in the United States*
    -   *Empowering Pacific youth through leadership development
        opportunities*
    -   *Returning Peace Corps volunteer presence to Fiji, Tonga, Samoa,
        and Vanuatu this year and actively exploring options for opening
        missions in other countries*
