National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today in Washington with
Executive Vice President of the European Commission Frans Timmermans.
They discussed our shared efforts to address the global climate crisis,
including the recent U.S. passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and
preparations for COP-27 in Egypt. They also discussed transatlantic
cooperation to address Russia’s weaponization of energy and the need to
ensure our ongoing efforts to meet acute near-term energy needs are
matched by a redoubled commitment to accelerating the clean energy
transition and reducing Europe’s dependence on fossil fuels.
