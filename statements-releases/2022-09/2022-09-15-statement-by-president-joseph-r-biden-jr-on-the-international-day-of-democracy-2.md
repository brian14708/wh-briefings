title: "Statement by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. on the International Day of\_\
  Democracy"
---
 
Fifteen years ago, nations from around the world came together to
declare an International Day of Democracy—a day to reflect on our
collective support for representative, transparent governance; equality;
respect for human rights and dignity; and the rule of law. In the years
since, democracy the world over has experienced significant challenges,
with autocrats and illiberal forces increasing the pressure on those who
fight for human rights and fundamental freedoms. We see it in Russia’s
brutal and unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine. And here at
home, we are called to renew our commitment to defend and protect the
core tenets of American democracy.  
   
Our founders established a government of, by, and for the people, built
on the unique idea that all people are created equal. They recognized
that the strength of a democracy rests in the ability of its people to
make their voices heard. And today, I’m proud to be hosting at the White
House the United We Stand Summit to counter hate-fueled violence,
reaffirming that we all have a role to play in fostering a safe,
inclusive, and democratic society.  In recent months, we’ve also
demonstrated that our democracy can still deliver for the American
people. Working together with Congress, I’ve been proud to sign into law
transformative legislation that will grow the American economy and
create more good-paying jobs for American workers, invest in
infrastructure, reduce gun violence, improve access to health care, and
protect our climate.  
   
The United States is also working closely with fellow democracies around
the world to tackle the greatest global challenges of our time, and I
look forward to building on the progress next year at the second Summit
for Democracy. This second gathering of world leaders from governments,
civil society, labor, and the private sector will be an opportunity to
demonstrate how democracies are working to make life better for people
everywhere, and to redouble to our efforts to defend against
authoritarianism, combat corruption, and advance human rights.  
  
On this International Day of Democracy, we pause to reflect on the power
that we hold in our in our hands and our sacred charge to preserve the
soul of our Nation. To preserve that idea of America. To respect the
rule of law, and defend free and fair elections. And we renew our
dedication to uphold and strengthen our precious democracy and to keep
faith with future generations.
