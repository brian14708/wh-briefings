via sham referenda and expressed their firm commitment to Ukraine’s
sovereignty and territorial integrity. In the wake of the apparent
sabotage of Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea, they discussed
protection of critical infrastructure. They also discussed other global
challenges and looked forward to the upcoming meeting of NATO defense
ministers.
