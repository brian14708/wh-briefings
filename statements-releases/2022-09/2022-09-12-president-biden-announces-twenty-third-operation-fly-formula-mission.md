**Biden Administration will facilitate air shipment of approximately 4.9
million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Bellamy’s Organic infant formula
on September 7 and 16**

Today, President Biden is announcing that his Administration is sourcing
two flights, facilitated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS), for Operation Fly Formula to transport Bellamy’s Organic
baby formula from Australia to Dallas, TX via flights on September 7 and
16. These deliveries will include in total approximately 330,000 pounds
of Bellamy’s Organic Infant Formula, the equivalent of approximately 4.9
million 8-ounce bottles. The product will be distributed through
retailers.

In May, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that the agency
is exercising enforcement discretion so that Bellamy’s Organic can
export 1.4 million pounds of infant formula into the U.S., which is
equivalent to 21 million 8-ounce bottles.

President Biden launched Operation Fly Formula to speed up the import of
infant formula and start getting more formula to stores as soon as
possible. Under Operation Fly Formula, the Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the
General Services Administration (GSA), and the Department of Defense
(DOD) are partnering to pick up overseas infant formula that meets U.S.
health and safety standards, so it can get to store shelves faster. By
September 16, Operation Fly Formula will have transported almost 90
million 8-ounce bottle equivalents to the U.S.

In addition, the Biden Administration has taken a number of other
important actions to ensure there is enough safe infant formula for
families, including invoking the Defense Production Act, entering into a
consent agreement between the FDA and Abbott Nutrition to reopen the
company’s Sturgis facility, and issuing FDA guidance so that major
formula manufacturers can safely import formula that is not currently
being produced for the U.S. market. Details of our actions can be found
