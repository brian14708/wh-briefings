*Departments of Energy, Interior, Commerce, and Transportation Launch
Initiatives on Floating Offshore Wind to Deploy 15 GW, Power 5 Million
Homes, and Lower Costs 70% by 2035*

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is launching coordinated actions
to develop new floating offshore wind platforms, an emerging clean
energy technology that will help the United States lead on offshore
wind. In tandem with President Biden’s economic and clean energy agenda,
these actions will create good-paying jobs, lower energy costs for
families, and strengthen U.S. energy security. Since taking office,
President Biden’s vision and leadership has jumpstarted the American
offshore wind industry and made America a magnet for clean energy
investments. The President set a [bold
goal](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/29/fact-sheet-biden-administration-jumpstarts-offshore-wind-energy-projects-to-create-jobs/)
of deploying 30 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind by 2030, enough to power
10 million homes with clean energy, support 77,000 jobs, and spur
private investment up and down the supply chain.  
  
Conventional offshore wind turbines can be secured directly to the sea
floor in shallow waters near the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico.
However, deep-water areas that require floating platforms are home to
two-thirds of America’s offshore wind energy potential, including along
the West Coast and in the Gulf of Maine. The Administration’s new
actions will capture this [vast
potential](http://energy.gov/eere/wind/articles/new-wind-resource-assessment-finds-28-terawatts-floating-offshore-wind-energy)
to power millions of homes and businesses, grow new manufacturing and
maritime industries at home, and tackle the climate crisis.  
  
Today’s actions will position the U.S. to lead the world on floating
offshore wind technology. Globally, only 0.1 GW of floating offshore
wind has been deployed to date, compared with over 50 GW of fixed-bottom
offshore wind. America will seize this opportunity to be a frontrunner
on floating offshore wind technologies, as part of President Biden’s
plan for a clean energy economy built by American workers. 

Today, White House National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy, Energy
Secretary Jennifer Granholm, and Interior Secretary Deb Haaland are
joining state officials to announce:

-   **New Floating Offshore Wind Shot<sup>TM</sup> to Lower Costs by 70
    Percent:** Through the Energy Earthshot<sup>TM</sup> program, the
    Administration will create a new Floating Offshore Wind Shot to
    accelerate breakthroughs across engineering, manufacturing, and
    other innovation areas. The Floating Offshore Wind Shot will aim to
    reduce the costs of floating technologies by more than 70% by 2035,
    to $45 per megawatt-hour.   
-   **New Goal to Reach 15 GW by 2035:** The Administration will advance
    lease areas in deep waters in order to deploy 15 GW of floating
    offshore wind capacity by 2035—building on the President’s existing
    goal of deploying 30 GW of offshore wind by 2030, which will be
    largely met using fixed-bottom technology.
-   **Research & Development Investments:** To support these goals, this
    week the Administration launched a new prize competition for
    floating offshore wind platform technologies; initiatives funded by
    the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to develop modeling tools for
    project design and to analyze port needs; and other funding for
    research, development, and demonstration efforts.

These new goals, initiatives, and investments focus on floating
technologies and build on the Administration’s all-of-government
approach to [developing offshore
wind](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/20/fact-sheetpresident-bidens-executive-actions-on-climate-to-address-extreme-heat-and-boost-offshore-wind/)
while advancing environmental justice, protecting biodiversity, and
promoting ocean co-use. Through the Inflation Reduction Act, President
Biden secured clean energy tax credits that will further accelerate this
new American industry and a thriving domestic supply chain, with support
for Made in America wind turbine blades, fixed-bottom and floating
platforms, installation vessels, and more.  
  
**<u>NEW FLOATING OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY EARTHSHOT</u>**

Secretaries Granholm and Haaland announced the [Floating Offshore Wind
Shot<sup>TM</sup>](http://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/floating-offshore-wind-shot),
a new initiative to grow clean energy capacity and drive U.S. leadership
in floating offshore wind design, development, and manufacturing. The
Floating Offshore Wind Shot is an initiative led by the Departments of
Energy (DOE), Interior (DOI), Commerce, and Transportation. DOE and the
National Science Foundation will also collaborate on research and
workforce development in support of the Floating Offshore Wind Shot. 

The Floating Offshore Wind Shot includes an ambitious goal to reduce the
cost of floating offshore wind energy by more than 70%, to $45 per
megawatt-hour by 2035. Achieving this cost target will require focused
research, development, and demonstration to catalyze continued cost
reductions, with a focus on manufacturing, engineering, and continued
increases of offshore wind turbine capacity. Agencies will also continue
collaborating to develop the robust domestic supply chain and
transmission infrastructure needed to accelerate floating as well as
fixed-bottom offshore wind.

The Floating Offshore Wind Shot will promote ocean co-use, protect
biodiversity, and advance environmental justice—including by making sure
the benefits of offshore wind deployment reach underserved communities,
in support of President Biden’s Justice40 Initiative. This new target is
part of DOE’s [Energy Earthshots<sup>TM</sup>
initiative](https://www.energy.gov/policy/energy-earthshots-initiative)
to tackle key remaining technical challenges to reaching U.S. climate
goals. In addition to harnessing untapped potential for generating clean
electricity, floating offshore wind will also support economy-wide
decarbonization, including by using floating offshore wind for
co-generation of clean fuels and energy storage.

**<u>NEW FLOATING OFFSHORE WIND DEPLOYMENT GOAL</u>**

DOI also announced a new goal to deploy 15 GW of installed floating
offshore wind capacity by 2035—enough clean energy to power over five
million American homes. This builds on the Administration’s goal to
deploy 30 GW of offshore wind by 2030. DOI’s Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management (BOEM) will advance lease areas in deep waters for floating
technology, starting with a lease auction off the coast of California by
the end of 2022. Achieving this ambitious target will spur billions of
dollars of economic opportunities and avoid an estimated 26 million
metric tons of carbon emissions annually.  
  
Bringing floating offshore wind technology to scale will unlock new
opportunities for offshore wind power off the coasts of California and
Oregon, in the Gulf of Maine, and beyond. Tapping into these resources
will expand clean American energy supplies and contribute significantly
to achieving climate goals set by the President and Governors across the
country. States, Tribes, coastal communities, and ocean users will
continue to play a key role throughout the process to ensure that in
meeting our climate goals, we create good-paying union jobs and support
economic opportunities in local and underserved communities.
