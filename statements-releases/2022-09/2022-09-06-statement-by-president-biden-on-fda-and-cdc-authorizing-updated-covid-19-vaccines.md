This week, we begin a new phase in our COVID-19 response. We are
launching a new vaccine – our first in almost two years – with a new
approach. For most Americans, that means one COVID-19 shot, once a year,
each fall.  
   
Starting this week, at tens of thousands of convenient pharmacies,
doctor’s offices, and community health centers, and other places,
Americans age 12 and older can go get this new fall COVID-19
vaccine. The new vaccines provide the strongest protection from the new
Omicron strain of the COVID virus, which did not exist when the original
vaccine was developed. As the virus continues to change, we will now be
able to update our vaccines annually to target the dominant variant.
Just like your annual flu shot, you should get it sometime between Labor
Day and Halloween. It’s safe, it’s easy to get, and it’s free. Go to
Vaccines.gov to find a location near your home or work.  
   
It’s simple, and it’s easy to understand:  If you are vaccinated and 12
and older, get the new COVID-19 shot this fall. This once-a-year shot
can reduce your risk of getting COVID-19, reduce your chance of
spreading it to others, and dramatically reduce your risk of severe
COVID-19.   
   
Winter is not that far away.  The past two years, we have seen COVID-19
cases and deaths soar. It does not have to be that way this year. If you
are 12 and older, go get your new COVID-19 shot this fall.
