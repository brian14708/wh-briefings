  \ College\_Leaders"

Today, Vice President Kamala Harris convened a roundtable with 25
students and young leaders from 12 states to discuss a range of issues
important to young people across the country, including voting rights,
student debt relief, police reform and gun violence, mental health,
climate change, building intergenerational wealth, and reproductive
rights. The Vice President’s meeting concludes a week of student and
youth-focused engagements in Orangeburg, South Carolina; Milwaukee,
Wisconsin; and Washington, D.C.  
   
During the roundtable, the participants thanked Vice President Harris
and the Administration for providing student debt relief, sharing how
student loans have weighed heavily on young people and families. The
participants also discussed the impact of the Administration’s passage
of the Inflation Reduction Act, which will make health care more
affordable for families, and lower prescription drug costs by capping
the price of insulin to $35 per month for seniors.  
   
The Vice President and young leaders also discussed our nation’s
democracy and the work we must do to continue to protect it. The Vice
President thanked the participants for their efforts defending voting
rights, and said they must continue to work together to fight for voting
rights and democracy. During the conversation, the Vice President
encouraged the leaders to continue their work, and to remember to always
keep fighting for equity and justice.
