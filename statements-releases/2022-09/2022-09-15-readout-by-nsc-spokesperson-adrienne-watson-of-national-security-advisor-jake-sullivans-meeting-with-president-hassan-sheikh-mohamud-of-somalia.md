  \ Sullivan\u2019s Meeting with President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud of\_Somalia"

Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Jake Sullivan
hosted President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud for a meeting at the White House
today to reinforce the strong partnership between the United States and
Somalia. 

Mr. Sullivan, joined by Assistant to the President for Homeland Security
Dr. Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, praised Somalia’s leadership in its work
to build a national consensus and
counter the al-Shabaab terrorist threat.  President Hassan
Sheikh thanked the United States for the ongoing military and
civilian partnership to build a stronger, more stable, and
 more peaceful Somalia.  

Mr. Sullivan and President Hassan Sheikh discussed the importance of
political reconciliation in Somalia, particularly
the renewed coordination between the Federal Government of Somalia and
Federal Member States to improve governance, law enforcement, service
delivery, and security for the Somali people.  

They expressed concern over the devastating Horn of Africa drought,
which is impacting Somalis most acutely, and emphasized the urgent need
for additional humanitarian aid.  U.S. funding to address drought in
Somalia is more than $706 million this fiscal year alone, representing
more than half of all humanitarian funding to Somalia.

Mr. Sullivan and President Hassan Sheikh underscored the close
friendship and cooperation between the United States and Somalia and
expressed commitment to reinforce our joint efforts in strengthening
Somalia’s capabilities to counter al-Shabaab and build a future that
meets the needs of the Somali people.
