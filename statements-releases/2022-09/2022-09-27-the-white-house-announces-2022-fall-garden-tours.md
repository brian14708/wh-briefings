Today, the President and First Lady are pleased to announce plans for
the 2022 Fall Garden Tours.   

The President and First Lady will continue the annual tradition of
opening the White House gardens and South Grounds to members of the
public for Fall Garden Tours. This season’s tour weekend is scheduled
for 10:00 AM ET to 4:30 PM ET on Saturday, October 8 and Sunday, October
9.

These tours are free and open to members of the public; however, a
ticket is required for all attendees, including small children. The
National Park Service (NPS) will distribute free, timed tickets outside
the White House Visitor Center, located at 1450 Pennsylvania Avenue NW,
on Saturday, October 8 and Sunday, October 9, beginning at 8:30 AM ET.
Tickets will be distributed, one ticket per person, on a first-come,
first-served basis.

Once you have received your tickets, the South Lawn entry point for all
guests will be located near the intersection of 15th Street NW and E
Street NW. The ADA entrance will be located at 15th Street NW and
Alexander Hamilton Place NW.

The White House will continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 situation
based on recommendations from the CDC and other public health officials
and medical experts. The White House reserves the right to adjust
availability of the tours as necessary to adhere to the latest health
guidance. Anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19, has had any
COVID-19 symptoms, or been in close contact with someone confirmed or
suspected to have COVID-19 within 10 days prior to their visit, may not
attend. Face masks will be available when entering the White House
complex for those who choose to wear them.
