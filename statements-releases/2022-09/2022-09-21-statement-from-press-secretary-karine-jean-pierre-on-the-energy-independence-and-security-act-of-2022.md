title: "Statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre\_on the Energy Independence\
  \ and Security Act of\_2022"
---
 
The President supports this legislation to promote energy security,
boost our ability to get clean energy built, and get that energy
connected to the grid.  Today, far too many energy projects face delays
— keeping us from generating and shipping critical, cost-saving clean
energy to families and businesses across America.  This is an important
step forward to further unlock the potential of these projects and the
good-paying jobs they support.
