Across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, local newspapers and TV
stations are reporting on the White House’s “Communities in Action:
Building a Better Pennsylvania” event, which was attended by nearly 50
elected officials and community leaders from across the Keystone State.

During the half-day forum, President Biden and senior administration
officials highlighted the impact of the President’s economic plan —
including the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,
Inflation Reduction Act, and the CHIPS and Science Act — which is
creating good paying jobs, bringing manufacturing back to America, and
lowering costs for Pennsylvania families. They also discussed how the
Biden-Harris administration will continue to partner with state and
local leaders to create and expand opportunities across Pennsylvania.

In a brief interview on Wednesday, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, the director
of the White House’s Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, told the
Capital-Star that the administration had made a deliberate effort to
obtain the perspective of leaders outside the state’s largest cities…“
We tried to get a good cross-section of the state and throughout the
different regions,” she said. “These are folks that we’ve been working
with over the last 19 months as we’ve been implementing the American
Rescue Plan and the \[Bipartisan\] Infrastructure Law.”

Allentown Mayor Matt Tuerk visited the White House Thursday as part of
President Biden’s “Building a Better America” initiative…Tuerk
participated in a half-day forum along with other Pennsylvania local
leaders and senior members of the Biden-Harris administration…The forum
was a chance for Biden-Harris officials to tout the investments they’ve
made in communities across Pennsylvania, through laws like the American
Rescue Plan Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act. Those acts gave
millions to local municipalities to fund schools, improve
infrastructure, build housing and more.

“I cannot overemphasize how much the Biden-Harris Administration has
positively impacted Allentown residents,” said Mayor Tuerk. “American
Rescue Plan funding allowed us to make critical investments in our
infrastructure and public safety. The new firefighter academy, once
constructed, will prepare men and women for new realities, and keep them
safe as they keep us safe. We’re grateful for continued commitment from
the Administration and look forward to future investment into
Allentown.”
