title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Release of Paul\_Rusesabagina"
---
 
I welcome today’s release of Paul Rusesabagina by the Government of
Rwanda.  Paul’s family is eager to welcome him back to the United
States, and I share their joy at today’s good news.  
   
I thank the Rwandan Government for making this reunion possible, and I
also thank the Government of Qatar for facilitating Paul’s release and
return to the United States.  I add my gratitude to those across the
U.S. Government who have worked with the Government of Rwanda to achieve
today’s happy outcome.
