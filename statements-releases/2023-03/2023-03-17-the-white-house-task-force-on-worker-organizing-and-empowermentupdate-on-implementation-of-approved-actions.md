title: "The White\_House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment: Update on\
  \ Implementation of Approved\_Actions"
---
 
*Agencies act to remove barriers to worker organizing, create
good-paying union jobs, and the number of Federal Government employees
in a union increases by nearly 20%*

A guiding principle of the White House Task Force on Worker Organizing
and Empowerment is the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to
worker rights, including the right to a free and fair choice to join a
union and to dignity in the workplace. As the President says, “unions
built the middle class,” and as we now rebuild America they can help
rebuild the middle class in the process. The Task Force, led by Vice
President Kamala Harris, submitted over 70 recommendations to the
President for tools Executive Branch agencies could use with existing
Executive Branch powers, procedures, and practices, in order to reduce
barriers to worker organizing and position the federal government as a
model employer. President Biden approved all of the recommendations in
February 2022.  
   
In March 2023, the Task Force announced that agencies have advanced the
Task Force recommendations actions with significant results both inside
and outside government, including:  
 

-   **Ensuring that federal grant funding has strong, job quality
    standards, where possible**, including in Department of Energy
    funding for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL);

<!-- -->

-   **Providing information, in plain language, about a worker’s
    organizing rights**, through a “Know Your Rights” effort involving
    multiple agencies, including by creating materials helpful to young
    workers in previously unorganized industries and small businesses,
    as well as a series of actions to ensure that all eligible federal
    employees know of their rights to join a union; and

<!-- -->

-   **Removing impediments to exercising worker rights on federal
    property and federally controlled spaces**, including action taken
    by the Department of Homeland Security to facilitate access for
    organizers at airports.

   
***As a result of this work, the Task Force is proud to announce that
the number of Federal Government employees in a union has increased by
nearly 20%.*** Since the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) began
working with agencies to better inform federal workers of their right to
join a union, nearly *80,000 workers* have done so.  
   
While the Task Force has been focused on its work within the Executive
Branch, the country has seen significant momentum in worker organizing,
spread across multiple industries, including in industries with a
history of low union density, such as digital programming and testing,
and previously unorganized retail. This organizing momentum reflects the
timely nature of the Task Force’s work as a new generation of workers –
many without any previous exposure to collective bargaining – make their
voices heard.  
   
This growth in organizing is noteworthy: In fiscal year 2022, petitions
for union representation increased 53% over the year before, according
to the National Labor Relations Board. Meanwhile, overall union
membership grew by 273,000 in 2022 – growth that reflects the increased
public support for unions, which at 71% is at its highest level in 60
years.  
   
**Tracking the Implementation of Task Force Action Items**  
  
Several accomplishments merit special mention, including:  
  
***Ensuring that federal grant funding has strong, job quality
standards, where possible***  
Following the significant investments through our Invest in America
agenda – specifically through the American Rescue Plan, the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation
Reduction Act -agencies have worked to ensure that the jobs created or
supported by these federal funds are quality jobs that allow workers the
free and fair choice to form or join a union, consistent with law. These
actions will help ensure that as we rebuild our infrastructure, supply
chains, and manufacturing here at home, we will also be building strong
communities with pathways into family sustaining jobs. For example,
agencies have included requirements or preferences to encourage
registered apprenticeships, project labor agreements, and other measures
in investments as diverse as battery materials manufacturing, broadband
installation, mega-infrastructure projects, and clean buses. These
include:  
 

-   Department of Commerce: Inclusion of strong labor standards language
    in more than $42 billion in grants to expand high-speed internet
    nationwide.

<!-- -->

-   Department of Energy: Requiring applicants to submit “[Community
    Benefit
    Plans](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=8874ed200e&e=0ca263633c)”
    as part of all agency Federal financial awards through BIL and IRA
    and encouraging engagement with labor unions and use of project
    labor agreements (PLAs), and ensuring a free and fair choice to join
    or form a union in potential grants and contracts consistent with
    agency’s statutory authorities.

<!-- -->

-   Department of Transportation: Inclusion of additional evaluation
    criteria in grants and contracts through BIL for project proposals
    that will create jobs with the free and fair choice to join a union,
    project labor agreements, registered apprenticeships, and joint
    labor-management training programs.

  
***Providing information in plain language about a worker’s organizing
rights, through a major “Know Your Rights” effort involving multiple
agencies***  
Research shows that while millions of workers would start or join a
union at their workplace if given the opportunity to do so, only a small
percentage – 10 percent – of these workers have information about how to
do so. Closing this gap by providing information on organizing and
bargaining rights is a priority for several Task Force agencies. These
agencies are collaborating to better ensure that workers know their
rights. For example, the Department of Labor (DOL) is leading a “Know
Your Rights” campaign, developing and distributing materials on workers’
organizing and bargaining rights. This includes:  
 

-   Creating the Worker Organizing Resource and Knowledge (WORK) Center,
    a one-stop shop for workers, employers, and government agencies that
    DOL developed in collaboration with the National Labor Relations
    Board (NLRB), the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), and the
    Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS), where workers and
    employers can learn about the union advantage and examples of
    successful organizing and labor-management partnerships.

    a plain-language website with information on major worker protection
    laws, with expanded information on anti-retaliation protections for
    workers exercising their rights under these laws.

   
***Removing impediments to worker rights on federal property***  
Often, private sector workers who work on federal property or in a
federal building face additional and unnecessary barriers to organizing.
Four Task Force agencies – the Departments of Defense and Interior, the
General Services Administration, and the Office of Personnel Management
(OPM) – committed to securely and safely make it easier for union
representatives to reach potential or current union members to discuss
their rights. A fifth agency – the Department of Homeland Security – has
since taken action to facilitate access at airports through the work of
the Transportation Security Administration. These actions will make it
possible for more workers to talk with and hear from union organizers at
their workplaces – a significant step in addressing the imbalance of
information that exists under current law.  
   
***New and strengthened collaborations between agencies***  
Since last year, the Task Force has worked to facilitate new
collaborations between agencies that have not previously worked together
to promote workers’ rights. Examples include:  
   
**Good Jobs Principles **  
The Department of Labor launched the Good Jobs Initiative, which works
with federal agencies to provide technical assistance on grants,
contracts, and other investments designed to improve job quality. The
Good Jobs Initiative and the Departments of Commerce developed “[Good
Jobs
Principles](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=91e96ce981&e=0ca263633c),”
defining the elements of good jobs, including the free and fair chance
to form or join a union.  The Labor Department has used these principles
to help federal agency partners incentivize equity and good jobs,
including those with worker voice, with more than [$97 billion
dollars](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=74bbfd8e0b&e=0ca263633c)
of grant funding.  
   
**Helping workers and employers reach a first agreement**  
The NLRB, FMCS, and the FLRA are collaborating on efforts to help the
parties reach an initial collective bargaining agreement when workers
first organize. The agencies have improved the flow of information
between their agencies about newly-organized units; expanded outreach to
the parties encouraging the use of their agencies’ training and
mediation services; and updated and expanded training (including
cross-training) of agency mediators.  
   
**Bringing sunlight to employer intimidation campaigns**   
The NLRB is sharing information with the Office of Labor Management
Standards (OLMS) at the Department of Labor so that OLMS can communicate
to employers about the legal requirement to file public reports of
employer and third-party consultant “persuader” activity aimed at
persuading employees about unionization.  Data shows that there likely
is significant underreporting of persuader activity – in FY 2021, only
166 employer persuader reports were filed, out of 1,125 representation
elections conducted by the NLRB.  This inter-agency collaboration will
increase awareness and compliance with the persuader reporting
requirements and result in greater transparency.    
   
**The federal government as model employer – success in the Federal
sector**  
For federal sector workers, OPM implemented ten strategies agencies are
using to support worker organizing and bargaining in the federal sector.
Since the initial strategies were announced, OPM developed a survey tool
to comprehensively track agency progress on implementing the strategies,
and sent the survey to relevant agencies in January 2023. Initial
reports show significant progress. OPM reports nearly 80,000 new union
members in the Federal sector since the Task Force actions were
implemented.  
   
**Continuing the Work of the Task Force**  
The Task Force agencies have made significant progress removing barriers
to worker organizing and empowerment.  The Task Force will continue to
work with agencies to implement the recommendations and to look for
opportunities to expand the reach of their work through collaboration
with other agencies. The Task Force will also continue its role as a
forum to hear from workers, organizers, employers, and other economic
stakeholders about ways to reduce the barriers to collective bargaining
and worker empowerment.  
   
Workers are more interested in organizing unions now than they have been
in decades, and the Task Force will continue to provide a powerful
platform for the Biden-Harris Administration to meet this moment of
worker empowerment.
