title: "Readout of White\_House Panel on the Economic Case for the President\u2019\
  s Initiative on Junk\_Fees"
---
 
Today, the White House convened a bipartisan panel of leading scholars
and business leaders to discuss the economic case in support of the
Administration’s efforts to crack down on junk fees. The panelists gave
remarks and participated in a moderated discussion with an audience of
economists and policy advisors from 16 federal agencies, describing how
deceptive pricing harms competition, raises costs for consumers, and
disadvantages companies that want to price in a fair and transparent
manner.  
  
Director of the National Economic Council Lael Brainard delivered
[opening
remarks](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/03/21/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-nec-director-lael-brainard-on-the-economic-case-for-junk-fees-policies/)
on the economic saliency of this issue and its bipartisan support among
voters, highlighting that “junk fee regulation isn’t just popular, and
it isn’t just a real cost savings for millions of families at a time
when every dollar counts – it’s also smart economics.”  
  
In their remarks, the panelists highlighted the prevalence of junk fees
in American’s everyday lives and the academic research that supports the
Administration’s targeted approach to regulation.

-   [David
    Laibson](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/David-Laibson-remarks.pdf),
    Professor of Economics at Harvard, spoke about the strong research
    foundations for the Administration’s junk fees proposals,
    emphasizing how junk fees harm competition and impose the largest
    burdens on the most vulnerable.  
-   [Vicki
    Morwitz](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Vicki-Morwitz-remarks.pdf),
    Professor at Columbia Business School, described the psychology of
    how consumers process price information, focusing on the
    exploitative practices of drip pricing and partitioned pricing that
    inflate the costs of goods and services.  
-   [Bill
    Kovacic](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bill-Kovacic-remarks.pdf),
    Director of the Competition Law Center at George Washington Law
    School and former Chair of the Federal Trade Commission under the
    administration of President George W. Bush, spoke to the
    long-standing bipartisan history of scrutinizing junk fees.  
-   [Laura
    Dooley](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Stubhub-Laura-Dooley-remarks.pdf),
    Head of Government Relations at Stubhub, spoke to her company’s
    attempt at breaking away from the industry standard and introducing
    up front all-in pricing in 2014. Her company experienced such a
    drastic drop-off in customers that they reverted back to the
    traditional model less than a year later. She remarked on how
    Stubhub’s experience – which was [the subject of a study in
    2020](http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/stadelis/AIP.pdf) –
    illustrates the need for federal regulation to create one standard
    and a level playing field for the ticket seller industry.

In addition, today the Council of Economic Advisers published [a blog
post](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2023/03/21/how-junk-fees-distort-competition/)
examining five specific instances of junk fees, and how they illustrate
drip pricing and price obfuscation practices.
