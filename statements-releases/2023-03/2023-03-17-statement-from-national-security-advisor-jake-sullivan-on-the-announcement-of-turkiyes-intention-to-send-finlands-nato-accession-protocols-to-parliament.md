The United States welcomes President Erdogan’s announcement that he will
send Finland’s NATO accession protocols to the Turkish Parliament and
looks forward to the prompt conclusion of that process. We encourage
Türkiye to quickly ratify Sweden’s accession protocols as well. In
addition, we urge Hungary to conclude its ratification process for both
Finland and Sweden without delay.  Sweden and Finland are both strong,
capable partners that share NATO’s values and will strengthen the
Alliance and contribute to European security. The United States believes
that both countries should become members of NATO as soon as possible.
