Asian and Pacific Affairs Mark Lambert, and Special Envoy to the Pacific
Islands Forum Ambassador Frankie Reed – visited Wellington, New Zealand;
Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea; Honiara, Solomon Islands; Port Vila,
Vanuatu; and Suva, Fiji.   
   
The interagency delegation met with the Prime Ministers of Papua New
Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and Fiji in addition to senior
government officials, members of the political opposition, and partner
countries in the region. Throughout the trip, the United States
emphasized its commitment to the Pacific Islands and the important role
Pacific nations play in ensuring a free, open, and resilient
Indo-Pacific. Discussions centered around the importance of meeting the
needs of the Pacific Islanders where they are, supporting capacity
building efforts in the areas of education, healthcare, climate, and
fishing, and furthering collaboration on the Partners in the Blue
Pacific.  
   
In meetings with the New Zealand Ministry of Defence and Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and Trade, officials discussed the importance of
coordinating efforts in the Pacific. The two sides expressed interest in
establishing a working group to discuss emerging technologies and areas
for future collaboration.   
   
In Papua New Guinea, the delegation discussed next steps to conclude
negotiations on a shiprider agreement and Defense Cooperation Agreement.
Both sides emphasized the importance of deepening bilateral ties to
bolster collaboration on critical issues such as combatting illegal
fishing, protecting maritime resources, and strengthening health
infrastructure.  
   
Following up on the April 2022 visit to the Solomon Islands, the two
countries held the first high-level strategic dialogue to discuss a
range of issues important to both sides, including protection of
maritime resources, economic development, and education.  The dialogue
resulted in commitments to establish a technical assistance workshop and
explore an education initiative with Solomon Islands National
University, among other items.  The second session of the dialogue will
be held later this year.     
   
In Vanuatu, Prime Minister Kalsakau emphasized the importance of U.S.
presence in the region and the desire to work with the United States and
other like-minded nations in combatting climate change and building
capacity to combat illegal fishing and protect maritime resources. USAID
announced an additional $3.2 million in humanitarian assistance to
support relief efforts following the Cyclones Judy and Kevin. The United
States has also allocated funds to build an intensive care unit at Vila
Central Hospital which will allow the hospital to provide additional
healthcare services. Moreover, the two countries committed to explore
the establishment of a U.S. embassy in Port Vila as part of U.S. efforts
to demonstrate long-term commitment to the region.  
   
In Fiji, the delegation met with the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat
to discuss the Partners of the Blue Pacific (PBP) and how the PBP can
work to support the PIF and the region’s 2050 Strategy for the Blue
Pacific Continent. In meetings with Prime Minster Rabuka and Fijian
government officials, the two sides discussed the importance of further
enhancing the U.S. – Fiji relationship to support regional capacity
building in the areas of protecting marine resources, resilience to
climate change, and broadening economic and educational opportunities.
The two sides also discussed ways to counter illegal activities such
illegal fishing and trafficking of narcotics.
