title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Urges Congressional Action to Strengthen Accountability\
  \ for Senior Bank\_Executives"

As the President
[said](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/12/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-actions-to-strengthen-confidence-in-the-banking-system/)
on Sunday when his administration took steps to stabilize the banking
system, he is firmly committed to accountability for those responsible.
Already, key executives that ran Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank
– the two banks now under Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)
receivership – have been removed, and investors in these two banks will
take losses. The FDIC, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the
Department of Justice have regulatory authority to investigate the
circumstances leading up to these banks entering receivership, and to
take action against the management of these banks as appropriate.

But the President believes Congress can and should do more to hold
senior bank executives accountable. Congress must take action to
strengthen the ability of the federal government to hold senior
management accountable when their banks fail and enter FDIC
receivership. Specifically, **when banks fail because of mismanagement
and excessive risk taking, it should be easier for regulators to claw
back compensation from executives, to impose civil penalties, and to ban
executives from working in the banking industry again.  
**  
The President is calling on Congress to:

**Expand the FDIC’s authority to claw back compensation – including
gains from stock sales – from executives at failed banks like Silicon
Valley Bank and Signature Bank  
**  
The CEO of Silicon Valley Bank
[reportedly](https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-sec-investigating-silicon-valley-banks-collapse-c192c2b2)
sold more than $3 million worth of shares just days before the bank
entered FDIC receivership. The President urges Congress to expand the
FDIC’s authorities to expressly cover cases like this.

Under current law, the FDIC has limited ability to claw back any
compensation or gains from share sales that senior executives at Silicon
Valley Bank or Signature Bank may have received shortly before their
banks entered FDIC receivership. That is because the FDIC only has
clawback authority [under the Dodd-Frank
Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/5390)’s special
resolution authority, which applies to the very largest financial
institutions. That authority should be extended to cover a broader set
of large banks – including banks the size of Silicon Valley Bank and
Signature Bank.

**Strengthen the FDIC’s authority to bar executives from holding jobs in
the banking industry when their banks enter receivership  
**  
Under existing law, the FDIC can
[bar](https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/examinations/enforcement-actions/ch-06.pdf)
executives from holding jobs at other banks if they engage in “willful
or continuing disregard for the safety and soundness” of their bank.
Congress should strengthen this tool by lowering the legal standard for
imposing this prohibition when a bank is put into FDIC receivership. The
President believes that if you’re responsible for the failure of one
bank, you shouldn’t be able to just turn around and lead another.

**Expand the FDIC’s authority to bring fines against executives of
failed banks  
**  
Under current law, the FDIC may seek monetary penalties from bank
executives who “recklessly” engage in a pattern of “unsafe or unsound”
practices, regardless of whether that bank enters receivership. To help
the agency fully address executive misconduct, Congress should expand
the FDIC’s authority to seek fines from negligent executives of failed
banks when their actions contribute to the failure of their firms.

The President is eager to work with Congress to strengthen
accountability in these three areas – and others that Members of
Congress identify. As the President has said, in his administration, no
one is above the law.
