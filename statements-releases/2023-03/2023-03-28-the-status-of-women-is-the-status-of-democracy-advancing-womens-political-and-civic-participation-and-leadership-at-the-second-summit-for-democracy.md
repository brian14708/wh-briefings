title: "The Status of Women is the Status of Democracy: Advancing Women\u2019s Political\
  \ and Civic Participation and Leadership at the Second Summit for\_Democracy"
---
 
As Vice President Harris has said, “the status of women is the status of
democracy.” The ability of women and girls to participate safely,
freely, and equally in political life and in society is a defining
feature of democracy, but this hard-won progress is increasingly
fragile. Wherever women and girls are under threat, so, too, is
democracy, peace, and stability—from Iran, where women are courageously
demanding respect for their human rights and fundamental freedoms in the
face of oppression; to Ukraine, where we are once more seeing rape used
as a weapon in Russia’s brutal and unjust war; to Afghanistan, where the
Taliban bars women and girls from attending school and fully
participating in society.

As we face unprecedented global challenges, we must harness the full
potential, participation, and leadership of women and girls. In hosting
the second Summit for Democracy, the Biden-Harris Administration is
committed to advancing women’s political and civic participation and
leadership and ensuring that they are at every table where decisions are
being made. Research shows that the status of women and the stability of
nations are inextricably linked, and that societies that foster gender
discrimination and allow oppressive gender norms to flourish are more
likely to be unstable. 

Today, at the second Summit for Democracy, the Biden-Harris
Administration is highlighting key actions and progress made during the
intervening Year of Action.

**Accelerating Women’s and Girls’ Civic and Political Leadership under
the Presidential Initiative for Democratic Renewal.** At the first
Summit, President Biden established the [Presidential
Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/09/fact-sheet-announcing-the-presidential-initiative-for-democratic-renewal/)
for Democratic Renewal, a landmark set of policy and foreign assistance
initiatives that increase the Administration’s ongoing work to bolster
democracy and defend human rights globally. Today, we are building on
those efforts by:

-   **Expanding the Advancing Women’s and Girls’ Civic and Political
    Leadership Initiative, including in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and
    the Middle East.** Announced at the first Summit for Democracy, this
    USAID-led initiative works to dismantle barriers to the political
    empowerment of women and girls by building the pipeline of women
    leaders and facilitating their safe and meaningful participation in
    political, peacebuilding and transition processes. This initiative
    will expand efforts to prevent and mitigate violence against women
    in politics and public life. USAID is providing more than $15
    million to this initiative and is beginning program implementation
    in eight focus countries: Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Tanzania,
    Colombia, Ecuador, Honduras, Kyrgyz Republic, and Yemen.

<!-- -->

-   **Establishing the Network for Gender Inclusive Democracy:** USAID
    is launching a Network for Gender Inclusive Democracy (Network) to
    provide strategic direction and a platform for bilateral donors,
    intergovernmental institutions, civil society and academic partners
    to align their multilateral and country-level efforts in support of
    women’s political and civic participation and leadership.  The
    Network will facilitate coordination, knowledge-sharing, and policy
    advocacy and carry forward the work of the Cohort on Gender Equality
    as a Prerequisite for Democracy, including the policy
    recommendations and roadmap developed during the Year of Action.  
-   **Investing in SHE PERSISTS (Supporting Her Empowerment: Political
    Engagement, Rights, Safety, and Inclusion Strategies to Succeed).**
    The State Department will invest $2 million over this year in
    support of SHE PERSISTS, an initiative announced at the first Summit
    for Democracy that bolsters women’s political participation and
    empowerment to build and sustain good governance and lasting
    democracy globally.  This multi-year program provides funding for
    technical assistance to advance women’s safety, political
    participation and empowerment, and initiatives for inclusive
    democracy, with a focus on diverse groups and marginalized
    populations.

**Advancing Women’s Involvement in Peace and Security Efforts.** Women’s
participation in peace and security processes—as peacekeepers, leaders,
and members of the defense and security sector—is essential to global
security, stability and democracy. To advance women’s meaningful
participation, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken the following
actions:

-   **Investing in SHE WINS (Support Her Empowerment: Women’s Inclusion
    for New Security):** The Department of State is investing an
    additional $1.7 million, working with Congress and subject to the
    availability of funds, for the SHE WINS
    [initiative](https://www.sfcg.org/she-wins/), a nearly $10 million
    program that advances the leadership of local women and women-led
    civil society organizations to address peace and security challenges
    in their communities. Since the first Summit for Democracy, SHE WINS
    has initiated projects in Cameroon, the Central African Republic,
    the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Papua New Guinea, Uzbekistan,
    and Yemen. To provide agile, easy-to-access funds that directly
    support women-led groups facing emerging crises and challenges
    related to Women, Peace, and Security (WPS), the State Department
    launched the SHE WINS Rapid Response Fund in November 2022.  
-   **Co-Chairing the Women, Peace, and Security Focal Points Network.**
    The United States, in partnership with the government of Romania, is
    the 2023 Co-Chair of the UN Women-led Women, Peace, and Security
    Focal Points Network (WPS-FPN), a cross-regional forum coordinated
    by UN Women to share best practices and experiences to advance WPS
    globally**. ** As co-chair, the U.S. will host the WPS-FPN Capital
    Level Meeting in June 2023, bringing together representatives and
    leaders from over 95 different countries and organizations,
    including members of Congress and the Administration.   
-   **Reducing Gaps for Women’s Participation in Security Forces:** In
    consultation with the Department of State, the Department of Defense
    is establishing a pilot program to conduct an assessment of
    opportunities for women’s involvement in the security forces of
    select partner nations.  Through this multi-year program, the
    Department of Defense intends to standardize the way it assesses
    barriers to women’s participation in partner nation security forces,
    in order to inform future security cooperation activities.

**TheGlobal Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online Harassment and
Abuse (Global Partnership).** A commitment from the first Summit for
Democracy and launched at the 66<sup>th</sup> United Nations Commission
on the Status of Women, the [Global
Partnership](https://www.state.gov/2022-roadmap-for-the-global-partnership-for-action-on-gender-based-online-harassment-and-abuse/),
which currently has 12 participating governments, brings together
international organizations, civil society, and the private sector to
prioritize, understand, prevent, and address the growing scourge of
technology-facilitated gender-based violence,  which disproportionately
impacts women and LGBTQI+ political and public figures, leaders,
journalists and activists.

Today, alongside the release of the Global Partnership’s [2023
Roadmap](https://www.state.gov/2023-roadmap-for-the-global-partnership-for-action-on-gender-based-online-harassment-and-abuse/),
the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing key actions and
investments to prevent and respond to technology-facilitated
gender-based violence and counter its chilling effects on women leaders
and democratic participation, including more than $13 million in
targeted funding across USAID and the Department of State. Key actions
include:

-   **Combatting technology-facilitated violence targeting women in
    politics and public life, including gendered disinformation**.  
    -   *Transform Digital Spaces Initiative (Transform).* USAID is
        launching Transform, with planned investments of up to $6
        million over three years, to prevent and address
        technology-facilitated gender-based violence, especially
        violence perpetrated against women in politics and public life.
        Transform’s pilot projects across three countries will integrate
        expertise from women-led civil society organizations working to
        address gender-based violence, women’s political and civic
        participation, and digital democracy.  Transform will synthesize
        and share practical, comparative knowledge drawn from these
        pilots to inform global efforts to address this problem. 
    -   *Promoting Information Integrity and Resilience Initiative
        (ProInfo).* This week, USAID will announce the Promoting
        Information and Resilience Integrity (Pro-Info) Initiative,
        which will build on the work of the Summit for Democracy
        Information Integrity Cohort, and expand efforts by USAID and
        the U.S. Department of State to strengthen information integrity
        and resilience globally, with efforts to address the
        disproportionate targeting of women and LGBTQI+ leaders,
        activists, and public figures.
    -   *Capacity-building to prevent and address technology-facilitated
        gender-based violence globally, including access to services for
        survivors.* Working with Congress and subject to the
        availability of funds, the Department of State will continue to
        invest over $7 million in programs focused on documenting,
        mitigating, preventing and responding to technology-facilitated
        gender-based violence and integrating solutions that address
        online harassment and abuse, including support for women in
        public-facing roles in politics and the media, through: small
        grants for awareness, prevention and digital safety workshops;
        access to legal and psychosocial services for survivors; and
        programs to encourage collaboration between civil society
        organizations focused on gender-based violence and digital
        rights, to support coalitions to promote institutional change.  
-   **Expanding data and research on technology-facilitated gender-based
    violence.  
      
    **
    -   *Deepening the evidence base on gendered disinformation.* Today,
        the State Department Global Engagement Center (GEC) is releasing
        a public [Executive
        Summary](https://www.state.gov/gendered-disinformation-tactics-themes-and-trends-by-foreign-malign-actors/)
        of a joint research report on gendered disinformation. Conducted
        with Canada, the European External Action Service, Germany,
        Slovakia, and the United Kingdom, the groundbreaking global
        study finds that state and non-state actors use gendered
        disinformation to silence women, discourage online political
        discourse, and shape perceptions toward gender and the role of
        women in democracies, and underscore the need for more research
        to tackle this scourge.  
    -   *Measuring technology-facilitated gender-based violence through
        Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS).* In 2023, USAID will pilot
        questions within the DHS Domestic Violence Module in two
        countries with high internet penetration rates to measure
        technology-facilitated gender-based violence.  
-   **Advancing U.S. policies to prevent and respond to
    technology-facilitated gender-based violence.** Countries
    represented on the Global Partnership—including the United
    States—make a commitment to advance activities within their own
    countries to prioritize and address gender-based online harassment
    and abuse.  In support of that commitment, the Administration has
    taken the following key actions:  
    -   *Building a blueprint for action to prevent and address
        technology-facilitated gender-based violence.* To tackle this
        scourge in the U.S, President Biden
        [established](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/06/16/memorandum-on-the-establishment-of-the-white-house-task-force-to-address-online-harassment-and-abuse/)
        a Task Force with a mandate to identify concrete actions in a
        Blueprint to prevent online harassment and abuse, provide
        support for survivors, increase accountability, and expand
        research. Last month, the White House published an [Executive
        Summary](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/03/executive-summary-initial-blueprint-for-the-white-house-task-force-to-address-online-harassment-and-abuse/)
        of the initial Task Force blueprint, which includes a broad
        range of new and expanded commitments from Federal agencies to
        address technology-facilitated gender-based violence across four
        lines of effort: Prevention, Survivor Support, Accountability,
        and Research.   
    -   *Integrating a gender lens in the National Cybersecurity
        Strategy*. Earlier this month, the Administration released the
        [National Cybersecurity
        Strategy,](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/02/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-national-cybersecurity-strategy/)
        which integrates a gender lens across key priorities to secure
        cyberspace and our digital ecosystem, including the imperative
        of increasing the participation of women and LGBTQI+ persons in
        the cybersecurity workforce; recognizing how technologies are
        misused to proliferate online harassment, exploitation, and
        abuse; and prioritizing partnerships, such as the Global
        Partnership, and the Freedom Online Coalition, to advance common
        cybersecurity interests.  
    -   *Prioritizing technology-facilitated gender-based violence in
        the U.S. Strategy to Prevent and Respond to GBV Globally*. In
        December 2022, the Administration released an updated [U.S.
        Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence
        Globally](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GBV-Global-Strategy-Report_v6-Accessible-1292022.pdf),
        which bolsters U.S. commitments to prevent and address this
        global scourge, including a specific objective to prevent and
        respond to technology-facilitated gender-based violence.
