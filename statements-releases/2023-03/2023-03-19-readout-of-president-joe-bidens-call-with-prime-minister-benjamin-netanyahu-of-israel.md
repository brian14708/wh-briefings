President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of Israel. He welcomed the March 19 meeting in Sharm El
Sheikh, Egypt, between senior political and security officials
from Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, Jordan, and the United
States with an aim to reduce tensions. The President reinforced the need
for all sides to take urgent, collaborative steps to enhance security
coordination, condemn all acts of terrorism, and maintain the viability
of a two-state solution.  The President also underscored his belief that
democratic values have always been, and must remain, a hallmark of the
U.S.-Israel relationship, that democratic societies are strengthened by
genuine checks and balances, and that fundamental changes should be
pursued with the broadest possible base of popular support. The
President offered support for efforts underway to forge a compromise on
proposed judicial reforms consistent with those core principles. The two
leaders also discussed tensions and violence in the West Bank. Finally,
President Biden reiterated his unwavering commitment to Israel’s
security and the ongoing cooperation between our national security
teams, including to counter all threats posed by Iran. Both leaders
agreed to stay in regular contact over the coming weeks.
