**<u>Felix Sanchez, Nominee for Member of the Board of Directors of the

Felix R. Sanchez is a nationally recognized media and communications
expert and Chairman of the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts.
Launched in 1997 by then-First Lady Hillary Clinton, the foundation’s
mission is to advance the presence of Latinos in the entertainment
industry. Sanchez has fought against Latino exclusion in entertainment
throughout his career. Most notably, his advocacy spurred institutional
change at the Kennedy Center Honors, resulting in greater
acknowledgement of meritorious Latino/a cultural icons. Sanchez has
devised many pipeline programs for Latino/a graduate students studying
theater and film at NYU, Columbia, Harvard, Yale, Northwestern, USC,
UCLA, and UT Austin. His work on these issues has been honored with the
*Ohtlí* Award, Mexico’s highest national honor bestowed on Latino/a
philanthropy leaders. Sanchez, a native San Antonian, moved to
Washington, D.C. to serve as a Legislative Assistant to then-U.S.
Senator Lloyd M. Bentsen, Jr. In 1988, he was named National Deputy
Campaign Manager for the Paul Simon for President campaign. After
joining the Dukakis-Bentsen campaign, Sanchez pioneered the first Latino
“Celebrity Fly-around” outreach strategy to activate the Latino
Democratic base. He has since served in this role for several other
Democratic presidential campaigns.  
   
Sanchez received his B.A. and M.A. degrees from the University of Texas
at Austin and his J.D. from the University of Houston Law Center. His
daughter Isabella, graduated *summa cum laude* from Boston University,
while his son, First Lieutenant Phil Sanchez, graduated from West Point
in 2020.
