  \ Tariq Al\_Said"

President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with His Majesty Haitham bin
Tariq Al Said, the Sultan of Oman.  The two leaders reaffirmed the
longstanding historical ties between our countries and peoples, and
discussed mutual efforts to forge a more prosperous, peaceful, and
integrated Middle East region.  President Biden thanked Sultan Haitham
for his personal leadership and support for the UN-mediated truce in
Yemen, which over the past year has witnessed its longest period of calm
since the war began over a decade ago.  He also welcomed Oman’s recent
decision to open its airspace to all civilian aircraft, including those
flying to and from Israel.  Both leaders committed to strengthening the
U.S.-Oman strategic partnership, trade and investment opportunities, and
cooperation on clean, diversified, secure energy sources.  President
Biden finally welcomed Oman’s historic role in securing the freedom of
American citizens wrongfully held in Iran.
