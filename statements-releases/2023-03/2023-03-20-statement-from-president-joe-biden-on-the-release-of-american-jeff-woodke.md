title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on the Release of American Jeff\_Woodke"
---
 
Today, I am gratified to share that American Jeff Woodke was released
from captivity in West Africa. Jeff was kidnapped while serving people
in the Sahel as an aid worker, and I am grateful that he will soon be
reunited with his wife, Els, and their family after spending more than
six years held hostage by terrorists. The United States extends our deep
appreciation to the Nigerien government, which was a critical partner in
helping to secure his release. I am also grateful for the hard work of
dedicated public servants across the U.S. Government who made this
possible, including the hard-working patriots of the Hostage Recovery
Fusion Cell based at the FBI, the U.S. military, and of the Office of
the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs based at the
Department of State. We remain committed to keep faith with Americans
held hostage and wrongfully detained all around the world, and there is
no higher priority for this Administration than our work to bring them
home.Â
