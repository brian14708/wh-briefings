title: "FACT SHEET: The Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Continues to Promote Access\
  \ to\_Voting"
---
 
Today, President Biden is traveling to Selma, Alabama to commemorate the
58th Anniversary of Bloody Sunday. In 1965, John Lewis and other civil
rights leaders led peaceful protestors demanding voting rights in a
march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where they were brutally beaten
by state troopers. The Nation’s reaction to Bloody Sunday helped produce
the long overdue landmark Voting Rights Act, which put in place key
protections against racial discrimination in voting and sought to
provide equal access to the ballot for every American.

Since their first days in office, President Biden and Vice President
Harris have prioritized strengthening our democracy and protecting the
sacred right to vote in free, fair, and secure
elections. Unconscionably, state legislatures across the country have
enacted and continue to introduce laws that make it harder to vote and
undermine the will of the people. Congress must restore the protections
of the *Voting Rights Act and take additional steps* to ensure access to
the ballot box by passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act
and the Freedom to Vote Act—it’s the only way we can fully secure the
right to vote in every state. 

In December 2022, President Biden signed into law the Electoral Count
Reform Act, which establishes clear guidelines for our system of
certifying and counting electoral votes for President and Vice
President, to preserve the will of the people and to protect against the
type of attempts to overturn our elections that led to the January 6
insurrection. Congress must apply the same courage and conviction that
it took to secure these reforms to passing the John Lewis Voting Rights
Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. President Biden supports
eliminating the filibuster to prevent a minority of Senators from
blocking action on voting rights—when it comes to protecting majority
rule in America, the majority should rule in the United States Senate.

In the meantime, the Biden-Harris Administration remains committed to
using every tool at its disposal to protect the right to vote. On March
7, 2021, the anniversary of Bloody Sunday, President Biden signed an
[executive
order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/07/executive-order-on-promoting-access-to-voting/)
directing an all-of-government effort to promote access to voting. As
[previously
outlined](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/blog/2022/09/20/how-the-biden-harris-administration-is-continuing-to-promote-voting-access/),
agencies continue leveraging their resources to provide Americans with
access to voter registration services and nonpartisan information about
elections:

-   **U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).** The ability
    to vote is both a right and a responsibility that comes with U.S.
    citizenship. The Department of Homeland Security’s USCIS strives to
    ensure all newly naturalized citizens understand this privilege and
    have the opportunity to register to vote following their
    naturalization ceremony. To improve and strengthen these efforts,
    USCIS will issue updated policy guidance to its 88 field offices to
    standardize and lift up best practices for voter registration
    services, including providing a clear roadmap for how to
    successfully partner with state and local election administration
    officials and nonpartisan organizations to provide voter
    registration applications to all new Americans. In Fiscal Year 2022,
    USCIS administered the Oath of Allegiance for 967,400 new Americans,
    across more than 20,000 naturalization ceremonies. Voter
    registration information and additional resources for newly
    naturalized Americans are available on the USCIS website for [New
    U.S.
    Citizens](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship-resource-center/new-us-citizens).  
-   **Department of Education.** By the end of March, the Department of
    Education will use StudentAid.gov to help connect borrowers to voter
    registration services by linking to vote.gov. StudentAid.gov is the
    Department’s primary customer website about postsecondary education.
    With more than 355 million visits in 2022, StudentAid.gov provides
    critical information and tools for students, families, and borrowers
    as they prepare and plan for college, apply for and receive federal
    student aid, and repay student loans. Building off guidance issued
    in April 2022, the Department continues to encourage colleges and
    career schools to make good-faith efforts to register students to
    vote.
-   **Department of Agriculture**. The Department of Agriculture (USDA)
    will enhance efforts to promote access to voting by encouraging all
    USDA agency field offices to make nonpartisan information about
    voter registration available in customer service locations, which
    exist across the country in thousands of rural, suburban, and urban
    communities.
-   **Indian Health Service.** The Indian Health Service (IHS) will
    promote access to voting in Indian Country by piloting high-quality
    voter registration services to patients across five IHS facilities
    by the end 2023.
-   **General Services Administration**. Vote.gov is now accessible in
    twelve languages, with more translations coming online soon, and GSA
    will continue working to enhance the website to make it easier for
    Americans to register to vote and obtain nonpartisan information
    about voting.
-   **Department of Treasury**. In addition to supporting the
    third-party Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) partners in
    offering voter registration services to individuals who seek tax
    assistance, Treasury is now providing information about voter
    registration in the instructions for IRS Form 1040 and in direct
    mail pieces delivered to approximately 900,000 Americans who receive
    Social Security Benefits, Railroad Pension benefits, and federal
    retirement benefits.
-   **Department of the Interior.** In 1993, Congress passed the
    National Voter Registration Act, which authorized states to request
    that federal agencies provide voter registration services. For
    nearly 30 years, no federal agency was designated as a voter
    registration agency. Last year, the Department of the Interior
    became the first agency to be designated as voter registration
    agency when two Bureau of Indian Education-operated post-secondary
    institutions—Haskell Indian Nations University in Kansas and the
    Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute in New Mexico—formed
    partnerships with state election authorities to provide the
    opportunity to register to vote. Additionally, because federal
    public lands are one of the most common touch points between the
    federal government and the American people, the Department will
    explore options to expand access to voter registration on public
    lands across the country.
-   **Department of Justice.** Promoting voting access and education is
    an important part of preparing individuals who are exiting the
    criminal justice system for a successful return to society, because
    encouraging full citizenship helps make them stakeholders in the
    communities to which they return. The Department has developed a
    program to educate individuals about their voting rights, specific
    to each state and territory. The Department is also promoting access
    to voting for those who remain eligible to vote while in federal
    custody, including by putting in place procedures to facilitate
    voter registration and voting.
-   **Department of Defense.** The Federal Voting Assistance Program,
    which works to ensure Service members and overseas citizens have
    access to voting, will make the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA)
    for voter registration or ballot request and the Federal Write-in
    Absentee Ballot (FWAB) available in seven languages. Additionally,
    in February 2023, the Department began the Effective Absentee
    Systems for Elections (EASE) grant program to provide state and
    local election offices with funding to increase the percentage of
    ballots successfully returned by Uniformed and Overseas Citizens
    Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) voters, reduce the failure rates for
    UOCAVA voters, and establish and maintain a pipeline of ideas,
    techniques, and best practices of election officials and the
    services they provide for UOCAVA voters.
-   **Department of State.** Travel.state.gov now reflects up-to-date
    information on absentee voting and registration for U.S. citizens
    abroad. This coming year, the Department will promote Vote.gov in
    the waiting rooms of its 26 public passport agencies.
