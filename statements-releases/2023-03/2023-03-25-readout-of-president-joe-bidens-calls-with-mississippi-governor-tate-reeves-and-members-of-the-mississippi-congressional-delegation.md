Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. held separate calls with Governor
Tate Reeves, Senators Roger Wicker and Cindy Hyde-Smith, and Congressman
Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, to express his condolences for the lives
lost and the damage resulting from the tornadoes and extreme weather
that impacted Mississippi overnight. The President asked what the people
of Mississippi need and how he can be most supportive. The President
expressed his commitment to delivering federal assistance as quickly as
possible to impacted areas and to helping these communities recover from
the impacts of these storms. The President also spoke with FEMA
Administrator Deanne Criswell, who will travel to Mississippi tomorrow
to ensure the fullest possible Federal response to those in need.
