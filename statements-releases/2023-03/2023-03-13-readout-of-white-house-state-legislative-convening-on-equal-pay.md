Ahead of Equal Pay Day 2023, Jennifer Klein, Assistant to the President
and Director of the Gender Policy Council, Wendy Chun-Hoon, Director of
the Department of Labor Women’s Bureau, and White House senior staff
convened legislators on the frontlines of advancing equal pay at the
state level.

President Biden has taken executive action to tackle the gender wage
gap, including promoting efforts to achieve pay equity and transparency
for Federal workers as well as for job applicants and employees of
Federal contractors, and he continues to call for the passage of the
Paycheck Fairness Act, which would strengthen existing equal pay
protections, further combat discriminatory pay practices, and enhance
penalties for certain equal pay violations.

States have long been on the frontlines of fighting to close the gender
pay gap and, in the last few years, pay transparency efforts have
emerged as a critical tool to achieve equal pay. Eight states have now
enacted salary range transparency laws, which require employers to
disclose salary ranges to job applicants, either in job postings, during
the hiring process, or upon request. According to the National Women’s
Law Center, these states already cover 44.8 million people – 26.6% of
the U.S. labor force. Another 16 states and Puerto Rico have passed laws
that ban the use of prior salary history by employers in setting pay and
other pay transparency legislation—the Department of Labor’s
just-released [Issue Brief on Salary History
Bans](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WB/equalpay/WB_Brief_Equal_Pay_Salary_History_Bans_03072023.pdf)
provides an overview of state legislative efforts to limit the use of
salary history.

For today’s convening, the White House brought together state
legislators who have worked for years to eliminate the gender pay gap,
including many who have introduced pay transparency legislation this
session. More than a dozen states are currently considering bills to
require employers to disclose salary ranges in job postings or other
avenues.

White House officials thanked the legislators for their leadership and
affirmed the Administration’s support and partnership in the fight for
equal pay.  

Participating state legislative leaders included:

-   Wisconsin Senate Minority Leader Melissa Agard
-   California Senator Monique Limon
-   Colorado Representative Jennifer Bacon
-   Colorado Representative Serena Gonzalez-Gutierrez
-   Connecticut Representative Kate Farrar
-   Connecticut Representative Gary Turco
-   Maryland Delegate Pamela Queen
-   Maryland Delegate Jennifer White
-   Massachusetts Representative Brandy Fluker Oakley
-   South Dakota Representative Kameron Nelson
-   Vermont Representative Emma Mulvaney-Stanak
-   Virginia Delegate Michelle Maldonado
-   Virginia Senator Jennifer Boysko
-   Wisconsin Assemblywoman Christine Sinicki
