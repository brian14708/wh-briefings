title: "Readout of White\_House State Legislative Convening on Combatting Junk\_Fees"
---
 
Today, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Senior Advisor to the President and
Director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs,
Ambassador Susan Rice, Assistant to the President and Domestic Policy
Advisor, and Lael Brainard, Assistant to the President and National
Economic Council Director, convened hundreds of state legislative
leaders on state efforts to address junk fees. Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau Director Rohit Chopra also delivered remarks.  
   
Last year, President Biden announced his commitment to take on “junk
fees” – unfair, hidden fees that take real money out of the pockets of
American families. During the State of the Union, the President called
on Congress to pass the Junk Fee Prevention Act and crack down on some
of the most frustrating fees consumers face, including ticket service,
early termination, family seating, and resort fees. To date, federal
agencies have taken a range of steps to crack down on harmful and
deceptive fees, which have spurred additional private sector action,
including:

-   This week, after the President called upon Congress to ban family
    seating fees, the [Department of
    Transportation](https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/airline-customer-service-dashboard)
    (DOT) published a dashboard of airline policies on family seating,
    and several major airlines have now already changed their policies.
    DOT previously published a dashboard on when flights are
    delayed or cancelled due to issues under the airlines’
    control, resulting in up to ten airlines adopting more generous
    reimbursement policies.
-   In February 2023, the [Consumer Financial Protection
    Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-proposes-rule-to-rein-in-excessive-credit-card-late-fees/)
    (CFPB) announced a proposed rule to cut most credit card late fees
    to no more than $8, which would save consumers an estimated $9
    billion a year.
-   In November 2022, the [Federal Communications
    Commission](https://www.fcc.gov/broadbandlabels) (FCC) finalized a
    rule to require cable and internet providers to list fees and
    services up front with an easy-to-read consumer friendly label.
-   In September 2022, the [Department of
    Transportation](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/biden-harris-administration-announce-new-effort-save-americans-money-and-spur#:~:text=Under%20the%20Department%E2%80%99s%20proposal%2C%20U.S.%20air%20carriers%2C%20foreign,flights%20to%2C%20within%2C%20and%20from%20the%20United%20States.)
    (DOT) proposed a rule to require airlines and online booking
    services to show the full price of a plane ticket up front,
    including baggage and other fees.
-   In December 2021, the [Consumer Financial Protection
    Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/junk-fees/)
    (CFPB) released reports on the banking industry’s excessive and
    unfair reliance on banking junk fees. Since then, fifteen of the
    twenty largest banks have ended fees for bounced checks, and today
    they issued a new [Supervisory
    Highlights](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-uncovers-illegal-junk-fees-on-bank-accounts-mortgages-and-student-and-auto-loans/)
    finding that banks the CFPB has examined thus far will refund
    roughly $30 million to about 170,000 account holders who were
    assessed surprise overdraft fees.

While President Biden will continue to do everything he can to eliminate
junk fees, he knows that state leaders also play a critical role in
advancing this effort. To support state leaders, today the White House
released a new resource, a “[Guide for States: Cracking Down on Junk
Fees to Lower Costs for
Consumers](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/WH-Junk-Fees-Guide-for-States.pdf).”
Also today, Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary
Marcia Fudge released an [open
letter](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/PA/documents/Junk_Fees_Memo_SOHUD_signed.pdf)
to housing providers and state and local governments to encourage them
to adopt policies that promote greater fairness and transparency of fees
specifically faced by renters.  
  
As part of the convening, state legislators shared steps they are taking
to combat junk fees. New York has enacted legislation that requires live
event ticket retailers to display “all-in” ticket prices, and
legislation has been introduced in the Vermont legislature to prohibit
hotels from charging undisclosed resort fees and ensure that accurate
and fair descriptions of fees are included prominently up front. Just
this week, California legislators introduced a slate of [six
bills](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Background-Packet-for-CFC-Junk-Fees-Unveiling-Press-conference-3.6.23-FINAL.pdf)
tackling junk fees, including on resort fees, rental housing fees,
ticketing fees, and more. White House officials thanked the state
leaders for their work and ongoing partnership on behalf of American
families.
