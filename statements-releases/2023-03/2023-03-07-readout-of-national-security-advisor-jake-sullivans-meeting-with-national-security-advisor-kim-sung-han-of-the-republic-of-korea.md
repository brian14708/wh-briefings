National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met today with Kim Sung-han,
National Security Advisor of the Republic of Korea (ROK). They discussed
preparations for the upcoming State Visit by ROK President Yoon Suk Yeol
and First Lady Kim Keon Hee on April 26, 2023 to celebrate the 70th
anniversary of the U.S.-ROK alliance and deepen U.S.-ROK political,
economic, security, and people-to-people ties. Mr. Sullivan also
welcomed news of the historic breakthrough between the ROK and Japan to
resolve historical issues and open the door to increased cooperation
between these two key allies.  
   
The two discussed how to maintain close cooperation to further enhance
our security ties to respond to the changing threat environment in the
Indo-Pacific region. Mr. Sullivan reiterated the United States’ ironclad
commitment to the security of the ROK and the region and to providing
extended deterrence through the full range of U.S. defense capabilities.
The two condemned the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s (DPRK)
continued destabilizing activity and highlighted the need for the
international community, including our allies and partners at the United
Nations, to limit the DPRK’s ability to advance its unlawful WMD program
that threatens regional stability.  
   
They also spoke about the growing necessity for concerted efforts to
advance peace and stability globally. They condemned Russia’s war in
Ukraine and discussed the pressing need to continue to supply assistance
to the Ukrainian people. They also emphasized continued cooperation
to advance and protect our countries’ technology leadership, respond to
economic coercion, and address vulnerabilities in supply chains,
telecommunications infrastructure, and cyber networks to ensure the
continued prosperity of our allies and partners.
