On March 17, President Joe Biden will host Leo Varadkar, Taoiseach of
Ireland, for a bilateral meeting and St. Patrick’s Day Celebration at
the White House, continuing a longstanding St. Patrick’s Day tradition.
The leaders will reaffirm the close and historic partnership between the
United States and Ireland and the extraordinary bonds between our
people. They will discuss their countries’ shared commitment to continue
supporting Ukraine in the face of Russia’s brutal aggression, as well as
their cooperation on a range of other global issues. They will reaffirm
their steadfast support for the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement as we
approach its 25th anniversary and welcome the recent agreement between
the UK and EU on the Windsor Framework as an important step in
preserving the Agreement’s peace dividend. Vice President Kamala Harris
and Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff will host the Taoiseach and Mr.
Matthew Barrett for a breakfast at the Naval Observatory on March 17.
