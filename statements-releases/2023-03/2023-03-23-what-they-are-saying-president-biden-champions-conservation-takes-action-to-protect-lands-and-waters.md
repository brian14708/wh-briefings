Leaders across the country are celebrating President Biden’s [boldest
steps to

to protect the power and promise of America’s extraordinary natural
wonders. At the White House Conservation in Action Summit this week,
President Biden announced action to:

-   Establish two new national monuments, [Avi Kwa Ame National
    Monument](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=5e82ff759a&e=ce8fea7c33)
    in Nevada and [Castner Range National
    Monument](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=1518d19c4e&e=ce8fea7c33)
    in Texas, protecting over half a million acres of public lands and
    honoring Tribal Nations and military veterans.
-   Direct the Secretary of Commerce to immediately consider initiating
    a new National Marine Sanctuary designation to protect all U.S.
    waters around the Pacific Remote Islands, a region with a rich
    ancestral tie to many Native Hawaiian and Pacific Island
    communities.
-   Take a dozen other new steps to conserve, restore, and expand access
    to lands and waters across the country, including tens of millions
    of new investments in conservation efforts.

With these new actions, President Biden is further delivering on the
most ambitious land and water conservation agenda in American history
and working to meet the first-ever national conservation goal to
conserve at least 30% of U.S. lands and waters by 2030.  
  
*Leaders from across the country praised the announcements. Here’s what
they’re saying:*

 **<u>Tribal Leaders</u>**  
  
**Chairman Timothy Williams, Fort Mojave Indian Tribe:** “Since the
beginning of the Biden-Harris Administration, the President has
demonstrated the commitment to respect Tribal Nations and our
nation-to-nation relationship. Under his leadership we have a seat at
the table and we have seen an unprecedented era and opportunity for our
Tribal communities. And we are all grateful to the President for taking
historic action to combat the climate crisis and conserve and restore
our nation’s land and water.”
\[[Remarks](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=54c7b3feed&e=ce8fea7c33),
3/21/23\]  
  
**Ashley Hemmers, Tribal Administrator for Fort Mojave Tribe:** “For my
people, we believe that when you come to the Mojave and it speaks to
you, then you are automatically going to want to hold it in high regard
and so we’ve really taken the approach through our leadership to be able
to share that and facilitate that and work with anyone who shares that
same vision. When we think about protection, we think of it through a
lens of respect, and so if we can teach those things to people who are
now moving in this space, then it’s not just ours, the mountain isn’t
just for Mojave, it’s for everyone to protect.”
\[[Statement](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=a7ddfe8322&e=ce8fea7c33),
3/21/23\]  
  
**Shan Lewis, Vice Chairman, Fort Mojave Indian Tribe:** “Avi Kwa Ame is
significantly an important part of our community as it is where our
tribal creation story begins. Its protection is the equivalent to
protecting the existence of the Mojave people and culture itself. This
fight for protection has been a priority of our people for generations.
As leaders we carry the honor of fighting for the right to protect that
which is most sacred to the Mojave people. To be able to offer
protection under the status of a monument now not only protects this
sacred area but shares it with others in a respectable way.”
\[[Statement](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=72fd450a65&e=ce8fea7c33),
3/21/23\]  
  
**Colleen Garcia, Councilwoman, Fort Mojave Indian Tribe:** “Avi Kwa Ame
or Spirit Mountain is of utmost importance to our Community because it
is a sacred place where we believe our God Matevilye, his younger
brother Mastamho and the original people lived. The original people left
images and stories through petroglyphs on the rocks at Avi Kwa Ame.
Mastamho brought life to the world, as we know it now, by creating all
living things: animals, birds, the river, vegetation, etc. Avi Kwa Ame
has a physical and spiritual connection to our Community. Conceptually,
Avi Kwa Ame is comparable to Christianity’s most sacred and holy places.
For me, personally, Avi Kwa Ame is where my origin began, my roots. I am
a traditional Aha Macav (Mojave) elder whose ancestors were the original
people who lived at Avi Kwa Ame in the beginning of life on earth. Avi
Kwa Ame is the origin of my life yesterday, today and tomorrow. I am
connected to Avi Kwa Ame physically and spiritually.”
\[[Statement](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=4d71c6c2c1&e=ce8fea7c33),
3/21/23\]  
  
**Rafael “Shorty” Gómez, Councilman, Tigua Ysleta Pueblo del Sur:**
“Castner Range, a beautiful living oasis nested in our beautiful
Franklin mountains of our West Texas city of El Paso. This place that
means so much to so many, from those who no longer walk among us, to
those of us existing today and to those who will come tomorrow. May
these lands be protected for all to appreciate and be loved for
generations to come.” \[Statement, 3/21/23\]  
   
**<u>Conservation and Climate Advocates</u>**  
  
**Collin O’Mara, President & CEO, National Wildlife Federation**:
“National monument status for Avi Kwa Ame will benefit wildlife and
people alike as the lands they depend on will be conserved and restored
for future generations. In addition, sites of significance for a dozen
Tribes in the region will be permanently protected and opportunities for
outdoor recreation in Nevada will be expanded. For more than 50 years,
community groups in El Paso have fought for protections for Castner
Range so that wildlife migration corridors are safeguarded, historic
sites dating back 14,000 years preserved, and access to nature is
expanded for residents of El Paso and the surrounding area –
particularly for those who have traditionally lacked access.”
\[[Statement](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=f5f3d0526c&e=ce8fea7c33),
3/21/23\]  
  
**Mark Magaña, Founding President & CEO, GreenLatinos:** “Conserving
ecosystems in their natural state is the single most effective action
for addressing nature deprivation, climate disaster, and the massive
ongoing loss of species happening nationwide and globally. These
monuments will also provide jobs and associated economic benefits. Today
marks a day that President Biden is acting on his commitment to conserve
at least 30% of U.S. land and waters by 2030 so more Americans can
access the benefits of our natural world.” \[Statement, 3/21/23\]  
  
**Janessa Goldbeck, CEO, Vet Voice Foundation: “**We want to offer our
sincere thanks to President Biden, Secretary Haaland, and others in the
administration for today’s designations of Avi Kwa Ame and Castner Range
National Monuments. Protecting and expanding our nation’s public lands
is the duty of any patriot — veterans understand and military families
understand this, President Biden understands this. And we applaud the
President, a Blue Star father, for his actions today. We also want to
offer our most sincere appreciation for the steadfast support for these
campaigns from champions Congresswomen Veronica Escobar and Dina Titus,
along with Senators Rosen and Cortez Masto. Thanks to today’s
designation, these special places can be enjoyed by veterans and all
Americans for generations to come.”
\[[Statement](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=e0f6cd7dde&e=ce8fea7c33),
3/21/23\]  
  
**Gene Karpinski, President, League of Conservation Voters:** “President
Biden delivered for the communities who have worked for decades to
protect these landscapes and their natural and cultural significance all
while expanding access to nature. LCV applauds President Biden,
Secretary Haaland, and the entire administration for their commitment to
supporting locally led conservation efforts – a vital component of
addressing climate change. The Avi Kwa Ame landscape is sacred to 12
Tribes, home to rare wildlife and plants, and full of opportunities to
enjoy the outdoors. We celebrate with the coalition of Tribal Nations,
businesses, recreationists, gateway community residents, and local
leaders as well as Senators Cortez Masto and Rosen and Representatives
Titus and Lee. Castner Range, an incredible place with significance for
Indigenous people, veterans, and the world’s largest binational
community, and this monument designation will help ensure the community
has access to clean water, protect the area’s endemic rare and
endangered species, and preserve fragile lands already surrounded on
three sides by development. We celebrate with the community
organizations, religious leaders, veteran groups, and Rep. Escobar. We
are also pleased the President will initiate the public process to
expand the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument. If finalized
as envisioned, this designation will surpass the administration’s goals
to protect 30 percent of our waters by 2030. LCV looks forward to
working with partners across the country and the Biden-Harris
administration to strengthen protections for additional sites and
landscapes, including through the Ocean Climate Action Plan and the
guidance on wildlife corridors and connectivity, in the coming months.”
\[[Statement](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=ecb060c103&e=ce8fea7c33),
3/21/23\]  
  
**Adam Cramer, CEO, Outdoor Alliance**: “The Biden administration has
taken important steps to advance its conservation vision, and we’re
pleased to see the recognition that there’s more work to do. Alongside
historic investments in public lands and waters, new national monuments,
and an ambitious whole-of-government approach to climate, the
administration has evinced a new way of thinking about conservation.
People, communities, and equitable and sustainable access to the
outdoors has been central to the Biden administration’s approach to
conservation. We look forward to continuing to work alongside the
administration and leadership at the land management agencies to pursue
these critical conservation and recreation priorities.”
\[[Statement](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=8ef3c6969c&e=ce8fea7c33),
3/21/23\]  
  
**Anna Peterson, Executive Director, The Mountain Pact:** “We are
thrilled that President Biden will permanently protect both Avi Kwa Ame
and Castner Ranges’ landscapes’ natural, cultural, and historic values
by designating them national monuments. The Antiquities Act conserves
vital places so our stories can be told and experiences can be shared
for generations to come. We celebrate today and tomorrow we will
continue to urge President Biden to use his authority under the
Antiquities Act to protect more places with cultural and scientific
significance as national monuments.”
\[[Statement](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=83933572ae&e=ce8fea7c33),
3/21/23\]  
  
**Marcia Argust, Director of Pew’s U.S. Public Lands and Rivers
Conservation Project, Pew Charitable Trusts:** “We applaud President
Biden for establishing the Avi Kwa Ame and Castner Range national
monuments today. Indigenous leaders, local elected officials, community
organizations, veterans, and business leaders in Nevada and Texas came
together to support safeguards for these landscapes. President Biden’s
monument proclamations honor Indigenous connections to these landscapes,
provide communities with more equitable access to nature, celebrate
local history and culture, protect wildlife habitat and connectivity,
and will boost local economies.”
\[[Statement](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=40e550c23f&e=ce8fea7c33),
3/21/23\]  
  
**Patrick Gaspard, President & CEO, Center for American Progress:**
“Today, President Biden took major steps toward his commitment to
conserve our most treasured public lands and waters for the benefit of
current and future generations. By listening to and supporting community
leaders, the president is helping to jump-start the nationwide mission
he announced at the start of his presidency to conserve lands and ocean.
These two monument designations will help preserve more nature for the
benefit of historically underrepresented communities. Protecting both
Castner Range and Avi Kwa Ame addresses the problem of nature
deprivation that has disproportionately affected people of color and
low-income communities. The Avi Kwa Ame monument helps preserve the
history, culture, and stories of sacred lands in Nevada and, together
with other announcements today from the administration and external
partners, represents a major milestone in the Biden administration’s
work to support Indigenous-led conservation.”
\[[Statement](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=7c3603f5b7&e=ce8fea7c33),
3/21/23\]  
  
**Chris Hill, Our Wild America Campaign Senior Director, Sierra Club**:
“Avi Kwa Ame and Castner Range are spiritual, cultural, and natural
treasures with thousands of years worth of history and legacies worth
protecting. Since time immemorial, these two places have had deep
connections to the Indigenous peoples of Nevada and Texas, and have been
critical parts of the environmental landscapes of their regions. Today’s
designations will preserve them for generations to come and add to the
stories and legacies we commemorate through public lands, in addition to
protecting critical habitats and vulnerable species.”
\[[Statement](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c97630621baff8c44fe607661&id=fc0e5426d1&e=ce8fea7c33),

***Avi Kwa Ame National Monument***  
  
**Honor Avi Kwa Ame Coalition:** “Since President Biden’s announcement
at the Tribal Nations Summit, we have been eager to see the
administration follow through and issue an official designation of this
sacred land. The President’s action today will safeguard these hundreds
of thousands of acres in southern Nevada bearing great cultural,
ecological, and economic significance to our state. We are honored and
grateful to his leadership and are thrilled to be a part of this
historic day. Tribal leaders and members, monument supporters, and the
general public made their voices heard in unanimous support of this
proposal and the need to safeguard these resources for future
generations. Yuman-speaking Tribes believe the mountain is the spiritual
birthplace of the tribes – the place where ancient ancestors emerged
into this world… Finally, we again express our deepest thanks to
President Biden for taking action to protect this land as a new national
monument in southern Nevada. Our coalition looks forward to continuing
to educate our Nevada community, our elected officials, and the nation
about the importance of Avi Kwa Ame, the leadership of those who made
this designation possible, and the need for respecting and honoring
Indigenous history in the southwest.”

3/21/23\]  
  
**Taylor Patterson, Executive Director, Native Voters Alliance Nevada**:
“We thank President Biden for following through on his promise to
protect Avi Kwa Ame and for designating this sacred land. It feels good
to finally say ‘Avi Kwa Ame National Monument. This land is considered
sacred to Tribes who trace their creation story to this land and it
deserves to be protected and those Tribes have been involved in this
effort to protect Avi Kwa Ame for years. This is truly a historic day as
it signifies a change in posture towards Indigenous people from the
federal government than that which we are unfortunately used to by now.
It’s with great joy that I once again thank Congresswoman Dina Titus,
Congresswoman Susie Lee, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, Senator Jacky
Rosen, and Interior Secretary Deb Haaland for their support and efforts
bringing Avi Kwa Ame to the forefront of President Biden’s conservation
agenda. Of course, there are still many other special places with deep
significance to Tribal nations that deserve the protection Avi Kwa Ame
has been given today. But, here in Nevada, we are thrilled to see such a
long-fought struggle come to fruition with this new monument. We will
continue working alongside leaders in the Biden-Harris administration to
ensure sovereign Tribal nations are given a voice in matters that
concern their ancestral lands, as we celebrate this historic and
incredibly significant event this morning.”

3/21/23\]  
  
**Annette Magnus, Executive Director, Institute for a Progressive
Nevada.** “We are grateful to President Joe Biden for signing today’s
proclamation declaring Avi Kwa Ame a brand new national monument in
Nevada. Today highlights the importance of our elected leaders giving
recognition to Indigenous peoples whose land we now occupy, as well as
its environmental importance as a diverse desert plant and animal
habitat. Moreover, this designation is a vital measure to extend federal
protection for the desert plants and wildlife that blanket the hundreds
of thousands of acres comprising the monument, such as the desert
Bighorn Sheep, Desert Tortoise, Joshua Trees, and more. We are also
looking forward to both locals and tourists alike visiting southern
Nevada to recreate outdoors in this new monument, boosting our local
outdoor recreation economy, creating jobs, and supporting Nevada
communities like those in Searchlight, Boulder City, and Laughlin… With
this proclamation, President Biden’s administration has fulfilled a
promise to the Indigenous tribes in the region and honored their
requested boundaries — and we, and the more than 160,000 supporters who
signed the petition supporting the monument, thank him and his
administration for heeding the call. We’ll continue to work with Tribal
leadership, our coalition and stakeholders to uplift and center
indigenous voices in the protection of our public lands and look forward
to celebrating a brand new national monument in Nevada. Thanks to
President Biden, this is a historic day for the state of Nevada.”

**Camilla Simon, Executive Director, Hispanics Enjoying Camping,
Hunting, and the Outdoors**: “We are pleased that President Biden and
the Administration have listened to the request for the urgent
protection of Avi Kwa Ame, supported by the Fort Mojave Tribe, local
lawmakers, sports-men and women, and the Hispanic community, among many
others. This area is sacred to Indigenous Peoples and is vulnerable to
energy development proposals. Protecting Avi Kwa Ame means honoring that
sacred connection, and choosing a future that values the protection of
land, water, wildlife, history, and culture.”

**Jim Stanger, Director, Friends of Sloan Canyon**: “Protecting Avi Kwa
Ame helps ensure that areas such as Sloan Canyon National Conservation
Area do not become biological islands cut off from the wider ecology of
the eastern Mojave desert. In the face of future encroaching
development, populations such as desert bighorn sheep and others will
maintain more of their traditional habitat, traveling in and out of the
area with a greater chance to survive and thrive.” \[Statement,
3/21/23\]  
  
**Arevia Power**: “Arevia Power was a early supporter of the news that
Avi Kwa Ame would likely become a National Monument back in December of
2022. With this official declaration and through the leadership of
President Biden, Secretary Haaland, Senators Cortez Masto and Rosen,
Representatives Titus and Lee and the Fort Mojave Tribal Council, Avi
Kwa Ame’s incredible cultural, historical, and biological significance
will be recognized and protected. Arevia Power is proud of its history
of partnership with Tribal Nations across the West and believes
responsible energy developers have a positive role to play in these
critical issues.”  \[Statement, 3/21/23\]  
  
**Maite Acre, President & CEO, Hispanic Access Foundation**: “We applaud
President Biden for listening to Indigenous tribes and protecting Avi
Kwa Ame as a national monument. Located in southern Nevada, the 450,000
acres is the ancestral home of 10 Yuman-speaking tribes. The land is
rich in both its beauty and history, and now, it can be protected for
future generations to come. About [30

of Nevada’s population is made up of Latinos. Protecting this public
land increases access to nature for its nearby Latino communities, so
they can enjoy the benefits of the outdoors. A National Monument will
increase recreational opportunities like hiking, stargazing, bird
watching, etc. for everyone to enjoy… By establishing the Avi Kwa Ame
National Monument, we can ensure that future generations can enjoy and
learn from these special places, and more national monuments represent
the diverse communities that make this country great.”

Monument is a testimony to protecting and preserving lands with not just
our children and grandchildren in mind but for generations to come. Avi
Kwa Ame National Monument honors the Native Americans who have long
called for preservation of their cultural heritage, and we are grateful
to the President for taking historic action. Amid the worsening climate
crisis, the long-term health of Joshua trees and other plants and

**Jose Witt, Mojave Desert Landscape Director, The Wilderness Society**:
“We are excited to see the Biden administration prepare to follow
through on their promise to designate Avi Kwa Ame National Monument.
This monument will secure rich, diverse wildlife habitat, including that
of the threatened Desert Tortoise. Additionally, these protections will
expand wildlife connectivity within the region, helping other iconic
desert species, like bighorn sheep and mule deer, adapt to the
challenges of habitat fragmentation and climate change. We applaud the
administration for their continued commitment to protecting Nevada’s
wildlife for future generations.” \[Statement, 3/21/23\]

those who have for many years advocated to see Castner Range become a
National Monument. The challenges that our city has faced — poverty,
pollution, inequality, climate change — are the results of broken
relationships. The designation of Castner Range as a National Monument
adds to the healing process that our city needs in these times.
Protecting Castner Range is not only protecting our mountains and
wildlife, but it’s protecting our history, heritage and our legacy.

administration’s announcement today at the Conservation in Action Summit
that it will propose a new national marine sanctuary around the existing
Pacific Remote Islands National Marine Monument out to the limits of the
US Exclusive Economic Zone is an exciting and important decision for
several reasons. A new sanctuary covering the ocean around these islands
out to the 200-mile limit will provide protection for wondrous marine
life, large seabird populations, migrating and nesting sea turtles and
the numerous underwater seamounts found in these areas. The proposal
would also contribute to achieving the President’s goal of conserving
30% of US lands and waters by 2030. But to achieve the high level of
conservation needed to protect marine life and restore our ocean the
proposed sanctuary must provide a high level of protection and eliminate
commercial fishing in line with the existing marine national monument.
We have been working with NOAA and Fish and Wildlife Service for over a
decade to create a management plan for the Pacific Islands monument and
the addition of the Sanctuary program’s management expertise will create
a strong template to model protections for other marine sanctuaries in
US waters.”
