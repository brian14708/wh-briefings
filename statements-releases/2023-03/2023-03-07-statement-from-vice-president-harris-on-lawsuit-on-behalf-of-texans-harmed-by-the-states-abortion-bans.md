title: "Statement from Vice President Harris on Lawsuit on Behalf of Texans Harmed\
  \ by the State\u2019s Abortion\_Bans"
---
 
As the President and I have long made clear: taking away the right of
women to make their own reproductive health care decisions endangers
women’s health, with potentially life-threatening consequences. When I
convened health care providers at the White House in September 2021 in
wake of Texas SB 8, we discussed the harm that doctors and nurses feared
their patients would experience as a result of Texas’ extreme laws. Now,
multiple women impacted by these abortion bans announced a joint lawsuit
against the state of Texas, showing those fears have turned into
reality.  
   
The lawsuit includes devastating, first-hand accounts of women’s lives
almost lost after they were denied the health care they needed, because
of extreme efforts by Republican officials to control women’s bodies. I
am grateful to have met with one of the plaintiffs, Amanda Zurawski, who
continues to courageously share her story. After Amanda’s water broke
prematurely, she was repeatedly denied treatment because of Texas’s
abortion ban. Only after she developed sepsis, an infection that almost
killed her, did the hospital finally treat her.   
   
Many extremist “so-called” leaders espouse “freedom for all,” while
directly attacking the freedom to make one’s own health care decisions.
Like the overwhelming majority of Americans, the President and I believe
women – in consultation with their doctors – should be in charge of
their reproductive health care, not politicians.
