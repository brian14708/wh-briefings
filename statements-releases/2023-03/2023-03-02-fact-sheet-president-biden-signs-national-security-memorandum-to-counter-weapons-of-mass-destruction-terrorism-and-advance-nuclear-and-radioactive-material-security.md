title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Signs National Security Memorandum to Counter\
  \ Weapons of Mass Destruction Terrorism and Advance Nuclear and Radioactive Material\_\
  Security"
---
 
Today, President Biden signed National Security Memorandum (NSM) 19 to
Counter Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Terrorism and Advance Nuclear
and Radioactive Material Security worldwide. This comprehensive new
strategy advances several of President Biden’s most enduring national
security priorities: protecting our nation and the international
community from the existential threats posed by WMD terrorism and
preventing non-state actors from using chemical, biological,
radiological, and nuclear weapons.  
  
Although significant progress has been made in the reduction and
elimination of WMDs, and weapons usable materials around the world, we
must remain vigilant and drive further progress to mitigate the range of
challenges posed by WMD terrorism at home and abroad, including those
posed by new and emerging technologies. Reducing, eliminating, and
securing radioactive and nuclear materials are the most effective means
to prevent their acquisition and use, and through the implementation of
policies and priorities detailed in this NSM, the United States will
advance efforts to prevent WMD terrorism.  
  
This NSM integrates, in a systematic way, U.S. policies to counter the
use of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons by
non-state actors, sets out unified priorities for Departments and
Agencies across the Federal government, and affirms the Biden-Harris
Administration’s commitment to work with state, local, tribal,
international, and private sector partners on preventing, mitigating,
and responding to WMD terrorism threats. It establishes the first
comprehensive policy for securing radioactive materials, which present
continuing domestic and global risk, along with new domestic guidelines
for the management and security of nuclear material by prioritizing
efforts to protect and permanently dispose of weapons-usable materials
of greatest concern and transition from high-activity radioactive
sources to alternative technologies when technically and economically
feasible.  
  
In addition to addressing risks posed by existing weapons useable
materials, the policies in this NSM anticipate and proactively address
the emerging nature of threats and implications of
on‑and-over-the-horizon technologies that could be used to develop,
acquire, or employ WMD. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to
managing the benefits of emerging technology for future peaceful
applications with the proliferation risks of these technologies, and has
established forward-looking U.S. policies that support enduring clean
energy and nuclear material security goals while aggressively seeking to
reduce the future production and accumulation of weapons usable
materials worldwide.  
  
This policy outlines goals in three ambitious lines of effort:  
  
**Counter WMD Terrorism:** Combatting all stages of WMD terrorism
requires constant vigilance against an ever-changing threat landscape.
This NSM sets out a comprehensive plan for Departments and Agencies
across the Federal government to ensure that the U.S. Government is able
to prevent, mitigate, and respond to WMD terrorist attacks. This is one
of the most enduring challenges to our national security, and we cannot
take on this fight alone. To counter the use of chemical, biological,
radiological, or nuclear weapons by non-state actors at home and abroad,
it is necessary to involve the broadest range of partners—including
state, local, tribal, and territorial counterparts; private sector
partners; and foreign governments—in our work to defeat the threat of
WMD terrorism. This NSM also serves as our call to action to disrupt and
hold accountable those who provide material, financial, or other support
to non-state actors seeking WMD capabilities.  
  
To counter WMD terrorism in the United States and around the world, it
is the policy of the United States to:

1.  Prevent non-state actors from acquiring WMD and related materials;
2.  Detect and disrupt WMD terrorism threats;
3.  Deter and prevent actors from supporting WMD terrorism;
4.  Degrade and eliminate WMD-related capabilities of non-state actors;
5.  Enhance resilience and recovery from WMD terrorism events;
6.  Enhance capabilities to anticipate and manage emerging technology
    that could enable WMD terrorism threats;
7.  Build domestic partner capabilities to counter WMD terrorism; and
8.  Enhance international collaboration to counter WMD terrorism.

**Advance Nuclear Material Security:** The peaceful uses of nuclear
technology provide considerable economic, medical, and environmental
benefits. However, the storage, transportation, processing, and use of
highly enriched uranium, separated plutonium, and other weapons-usable
nuclear material globally present persistent national security risks to
the United States. Successful mitigation of nuclear risks requires an
integrated approach that combines efforts to eliminate weapons-usable
nuclear material through removal or disposition, the maintenance of
robust physical security and nuclear material accountancy for existing
materials, efforts to counter the theft, diversion, smuggling, and other
illicit use of nuclear materials, and an urgent focus on addressing the
challenges posed by emerging technologies that may add to the
accumulation of weapons usable nuclear materials globally.  
  
To improve nuclear material security and prevent any act of nuclear
terrorism, it is the policy of the United States to:

1.  Minimize the production and retention of weapons-usable nuclear
    materials to only those quantities required to support vital
    national security interests;
2.  Refrain from the use of weapons-usable nuclear material in new civil
    reactors or for other civil purposes unless that use supports vital
    U.S. national interests;
3.  Focus civil nuclear research and development on approaches that
    avoid producing and accumulating weapons-usable nuclear material and
    enable viable technologies to replace current civil uses of these
    materials;
4.  Dispose of nuclear material that is in excess to national security
    or civil needs in a safe and secure manner;
5.  Promote safe nuclear material management policies and best practices
    internationally and encourage adoption of analogous policies with
    international partners and organizations;
6.  Enable multilateral institutions’ nuclear material security
    activities so they are adequately supported and responsive; and
7.  Ensure national and international capabilities to identify,
    mitigate, and respond to nuclear material security threats. 

**Advance Radioactive Material Security:** As with nuclear materials and
technology, the peaceful uses of radioactive materials provide
considerable benefits, although the storage, transportation, processing,
and use of radioactive materials globally present a security risk that
must be addressed through collective and continuous efforts. Millions of
sources are in use worldwide every day, with thousands also disused and
in storage, many of which lack disposition options (including final
disposal, and other management options such as reuse, recycle, or return
to supplier) for disused sources, or lack safe and secure long-term
storage. Minimizing the use of these materials where technically and
economically feasible alternatives exist reduces risk in our collective
national security, health, and economic interest.  
  
In order to reduce the threat of radiological terrorism, it is the
policy of the United States to:

1.  Maintain robust security for all high-activity radioactive sources
    during their lifecycle for all sources that cannot be replaced;
2.  Encourage the replacement of source-based devices with
    non-radioisotopic alternative technologies, where technically and
    economically feasible, and continue support for research and
    development of alternative technologies;
3.  Permanently dispose of or recycle disused and unwanted high-activity
    radioactive sources;
4.  Maintain consistent standards for the transportation security of
    radioactive materials;
5.  In keeping with regulatory requirements, apply mitigation measures
    in case of physical security failures;
6.  Support and coordinate efforts to locate and secure lost or stolen
    radioactive materials and return them to regulatory control;
7.  Support improvements to state-level and end-user capacities for,
    commitment to, and implementation of long-term stewardship
    approaches that ensure these materials will be tracked and secured
    from theft or diversion; and
8.  Promote U.S. radioactive materials management policies and best
    practices internationally and encourage adoption of analogous
    policies, both with individual partner states and through
    multilateral organizations. 

Together with our domestic and international partnerships, these
policies will continue to advance longstanding efforts to prevent
proliferation and to counter and reduce threats of WMD terrorism at home
and abroad.
