title: "Statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Evan\_Gershkovich"
---
 
We are deeply concerned by the troubling reports that Evan Gershkovich,
an American citizen, has been detained in Russia.

Last night, White House and State Department Officials spoke with Mr.
Gershkovich’s employer, the Wall Street Journal. The Administration has
also been in contact with his family. Furthermore, the State Department
has been in direct touch with the Russian government on this matter,
including actively working to secure consular access to Mr. Gershkovich.

The targeting of American citizens by the Russian government is
unacceptable. We condemn the detention of Mr. Gershkovich in the
strongest terms.

We also condemn the Russian government’s continued targeting and
repression of journalists and freedom of the press.

I want to strongly reiterate that Americans should heed the U.S.
government’s warning to not travel to Russia. U.S. citizens residing or
traveling in Russia should depart immediately, as the State Department
continues to advise.
