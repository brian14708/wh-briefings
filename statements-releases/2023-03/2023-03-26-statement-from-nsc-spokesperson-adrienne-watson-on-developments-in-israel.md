title: "Statement from NSC Spokesperson Adrienne Watson on Developments in\_Israel"
---
 
We are deeply concerned by today’s developments out of Israel, which
further underscore the urgent need for compromise.  As the President
recently discussed with Prime Minister Netanyahu, democratic values have
always been, and must remain, a hallmark of the U.S.-Israel
relationship.  Democratic societies are strengthened by checks and
balances, and fundamental changes to a democratic system should be
pursued with the broadest possible base of popular support.  We continue
to strongly urge Israeli leaders to find a compromise as soon as
possible.  We believe that is the best path forward for Israel and all
of its citizens.  U.S. support for Israel’s security and democracy
remains ironclad.
