title: Statement by Vice President Harris on the 58th Anniversary of Bloody Sunday
---
 
Fifty-eight years ago, six hundred brave souls set out from Selma,
Alabama to secure one of our most sacred freedoms: the right to vote. On
the Edmund Pettus Bridge, their peaceful march was met with crushing
violence. The late congressman and civil rights leader John Lewis, then
only twenty-five, was beaten and suffered a fractured skull. Those brave
marchers were pushed back, but they continued to march forward.  
   
Their courage and their sacrifice inspired many to join the fight for
civil rights—to put an end to poll taxes, literacy tests, and other
forms of discrimination that blocked Black Americans’ access to the
ballot box. They achieved passage of the landmark Voting Rights Act of
1965, which enshrined critical protections for voting rights in federal
law.  
   
However, in 2013, the *Shelby County* Supreme Court decision weakened
the Voting Rights Act, making it harder to protect against
discrimination. As a result, in recent years, America has seen a new
assault on the freedom to vote. Extremists have worked to dismantle the
voting protections that generations of civil rights leaders and
advocates fought tirelessly to win. They have purged voters from the
rolls. They have closed polling places. They have made it a crime to
give water to people standing in line.  
   
We must redouble our efforts and renew our commitment to protecting the
freedom to vote. President Joe Biden and I continue to call on Congress
to pass federal legislation that protects voting rights, election
integrity, and our democracy. And we will continue to implement the
President’s Executive Order on Promoting Access to Voting, which
enhances the federal government’s efforts to advance voter
participation.  
   
If we are to truly honor the legacy of those who marched in Selma on
Bloody Sunday, we must continue to fight to secure and safeguard the
freedom to vote.
