*Biden Administration to barnstorm country to highlight how Biden’s
economic agenda is growing the economy from the middle-out and
bottom-up, not top down*

On Tuesday, March 28<sup>th</sup>, President Biden will travel to
Durham, North Carolina to kick off his Administration’s Investing in
America tour. The tour will highlight how President Biden’s Investing in
America agenda – including historic investments from the Inflation
Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law, and the American Rescue Plan – is unleashing a manufacturing boom,
helping rebuild our infrastructure and bring back supply chains,
lowering costs for hardworking families, and creating jobs that don’t
require a four-year degree across the country.

From shovels hitting the ground on new infrastructure projects made
possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, to new electric vehicle
manufacturing facilities as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, to
communities benefitting from high-speed internet because of the American
Rescue Plan, to new semiconductor fabs thanks to the CHIPS and Science
Act, the tour will highlight how the President’s Investing in America
agenda is growing the economy from the middle-out and bottom-up, not top
down.

Over the next three weeks, President Biden, Vice President Harris, First
Lady Jill Biden, Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff, members of the
Cabinet, and senior White House officials will visit over 20 states to
highlight the impact of the President’s Investing in America agenda.

Prior to the Investing in America tour, the White House will hold an
Investing in America Cabinet meeting on Monday, March 27, where Cabinet
Members from across the Administration will come together to discuss how
their agencies are working together to implement the President’s agenda
to expand economic opportunity in every state across the country, create
good-paying jobs, and lower costs for American families.

In the next week alone:

-   **President Biden will travel to Durham, North Carolina** to visit
    Wolfspeed, a semiconductor manufacturer, which recently announced a
    $5 billion investment to build its North Carolina facility and
    create 1,800 new jobs.
-   **Senior Advisor and Infrastructure Coordinator Mitch Landrieu will
    travel to Nashville, Tennessee** to highlight how the Investing in
    America agenda is creating safer, smarter transportation and
    expanding electric vehicle charging manufacturing.
-   **Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo will travel to North
    Carolina** to visit manufacturers producing fiber optic cable. As
    part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Administration is
    making high speed internet available across the country, and using
    American-made fiber optic cable in North Carolina to get it done.
-   **Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg will travel to
    Arkansas, Texas, and Oklahoma** to visit airports and air traffic
    control facilities that are making critical safety and
    infrastructure improvements. Investments from the Biden-Harris
    Administration are helping airports undertake a number of safety
    measures, from improved runway design to technology that can help
    warn pilots and air traffic control of potential risks.
-   **Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm will visit Puerto Rico** to
    discuss how the Administration is working with the island to
    modernize its power grid and provide clean, reliable power –
    improving Puerto Ricans’ daily lives, supporting the economy and
    small businesses, and strengthening the island’s resilience during
    severe weather events.
-   **Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland will travel to Houston,
    Texas** to visit an orphan well site that is being plugged to
    protect the health and wellbeing and environment in the community.

    America agenda is making historic investments to ensure all people
    and all communities have access to clean water.
