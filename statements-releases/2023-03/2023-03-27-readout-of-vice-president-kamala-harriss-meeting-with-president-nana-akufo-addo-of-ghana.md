Vice President Kamala Harris met with President Nana Akufo-Addo today in
Accra, Ghana.  The Vice President affirmed the strength of our bilateral
relationship, noting the deep historical, cultural, and economic ties
between the United States and Ghana.  Building on discussions during the
U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in December 2022, the two leaders consulted
on a number of global and regional issues.  The Vice President thanked
President Akufo-Addo for Ghana’s strong partnership at the United
Nations Security Council, including its firm defense of the UN Charter,
amid Russia’s war on Ukraine. 

The Vice President applauded President Akufo-Addo for his steadfast
leadership to defend and advance democracy in West Africa and to hold
anti-democratic governments accountable.  She reaffirmed the U.S.
commitment to support human rights and women’s empowerment.  The two
leaders discussed insecurity in the neighboring Sahel, including the
threat extremist groups pose to Coastal West Africa.  Vice President
Harris announced that the United States would provide more than $100
million to support stabilization in Ghana, Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea,
and Togo, including at least $86 million over the next three years in
support of the 10-year plan for implementing the U.S. Strategy to
Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability, which President Biden released
on March 24.  The Vice President underscored Ghana’s role as a security
leader in the region and our strong defense relationship, including
Ghana’s co-hosting of Exercise Flintlock earlier this month with Côte
d’Ivoire. 

Vice President Harris also welcomed Ghana’s commitment to reforming its
economy to deliver sustainable and inclusive growth.  She affirmed the
Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to international coordination
on debt relief and to continue to push for all official bilateral
creditors to provide a meaningful debt reduction for countries that need
it, including Ghana.  The two leaders discussed the strength of our
people-to-people ties, and Vice President Harris applauded President
Akufo-Addo’s leadership to elevate engagement with the African Diaspora.
