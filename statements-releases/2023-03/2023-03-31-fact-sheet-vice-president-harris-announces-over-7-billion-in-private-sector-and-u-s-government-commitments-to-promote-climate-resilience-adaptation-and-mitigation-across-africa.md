title: "FACT SHEET: Vice President Harris Announces Over $7 Billion in Private Sector\
  \ and U.S. Government Commitments to Promote Climate Resilience, Adaptation, and\
  \ Mitigation across\_Africa"
---
 
In Lusaka, Zambia, in response to Vice President Kamala Harris’s call
for the private sector to promote and enhance climate resilience,
adaptation and mitigation across Africa, the private sector made over
**$7 billion in new commitments**. Additionally, the U.S. Government is
announcing new federal funding and initiatives to expand access to
climate information services and enhance climate resilience and
adaptation. These new investments and initiatives will generate
significant economic benefits while addressing African nations’ pressing
needs resulting from the climate crisis, including food security
challenges, by helping to **lift-up over 116 million farmers** and
promote climate-smart agriculture. These announcements demonstrate
America’s commitment to partnering with African people and governments,
alongside the private sector, to help the continent meet its climate
adaptation and resilience, clean-energy access, and just energy
transition goals.  
   
African nations have historically contributed relatively little to the
climate crisis but are disproportionally harmed by its impacts. The
Biden-Harris Administration recognizes that to address the climate
crisis in Africa, we must work together, building new coalitions between
the U.S. government, African governments, civil society, and the private
sector.  
   
**<u>Private Sector Investments</u>**  
   
The Vice President, as part of her call for the private sector to
promote climate resilience, adaptation, and mitigation across Africa, is
announcing the following 27 private sector and philanthropic commitments
to support farmers, climate-smart agriculture, sustainability, clean
energy, and clean transportation.  
   
**Supporting Farmers and Climate-Smart Agriculture**  
 

-   **Pula**, an agricultural insurance and technology company, is
    responding to the President’s Emergency Plan for Adaptation and
    Resilience (PREPARE) Call to Action and has committed to **increase
    their coverage to** **100 million small holder farmers** across
    sub-Saharan Africa by providing up to $20 billion in insurance
    coverage by 2026. The smallholder farmers pay $20 for $200 dollars
    of insurance coverage. Insuring previously uninsured farmers can
    generate a direct positive impact for farming households across
    Africa, helping to secure their livelihoods by protecting them
    against the risk of financial losses due to climate-related
    events.  
     
-   **Mastercard**, a payment and technology company, is responding to
    the PREPARE Call to Action and has committed to **increase access of
    its Community Pass platform to a total of 15 million farmers** in
    Africa by 2027 to spur economic output and opportunity. Community
    Pass is a shared interoperable digital platform that provides a
    commercially sustainable approach to scaling service delivery and
    increasing access to critical services including healthcare,
    agriculture, and micro-commerce, for individuals in underserved,
    remote, and frequently offline communities. Community Pass enables
    farmers to command higher prices by facilitating increased access
    to buyers and creating greater price transparency. Community Pass
    also enables access to inputs, advisory, and other financial service
    providers. Together, these services improve a smallholder farmer’s
    agricultural practices, resulting in a more resilient, sustainable,
    and productive farming system.  
     
-   **SunCulture**, an Africa-focused solar irrigation company, commits
    to mobilizing **$100 million in private capital and $40 million in
    grant/subsidy funding to deploy smallholder farmer solar
    irrigation** to address food security in Kenya by 2028. SunCulture
    expects to install 274,000 solar irrigation systems on smallholder
    farms, reaching nearly 1.1 million direct beneficiaries, creating
    411,000 jobs, growing 7.1 million metric tons of food, and
    generating $5 billion of increased incomes for smallholder
    farmers.  
     
-   **One Acre Fund**, an agricultural service provider to support
    African smallholder farmers in partnership with local governments,
    has committed to raise and invest a **$100 million fund to help 1
    million farmers plant one billion trees** by 2030. Smallholder
    farmers plant trees to harvest branches and wood, improve the farm
    environment, and sequester carbon.  
     
-   **Touton SA**, an agro-industrial actor, is leading a consortium
    expected to commit **$79.2 million into sourcing sustainable cocoa**
    by 2025 and benefit an estimated 150,000 Ghanaians. They are
    supported by **Palladium** through the Partnership for Forests (P4F)
    project, and will develop and pilot a landscape-wide governance
    model in Juaboso-Bia landscape to promote sustainable and
    deforestation-free cocoa production while protecting forests
    earmarked as a hotspot intervention area.

    companies in East Africa, with more than 30,000 hectares of
    plantations in Uganda and Tanzania. The company also supports over
    6,000 smallholder farmers through the company’s outgrower program.
    All timber is Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified, and the
    plantations sequester significant volumes of carbon, which will
    increase further as the company and outgrower forestry stands
    mature.
