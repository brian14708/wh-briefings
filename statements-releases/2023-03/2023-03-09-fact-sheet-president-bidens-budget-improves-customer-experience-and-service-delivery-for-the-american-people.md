  \ Service Delivery for the American\_People"
---
 
During his first year in office, President Biden signed an [Executive
Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/12/13/executive-order-on-transforming-federal-customer-experience-and-service-delivery-to-rebuild-trust-in-government/)
directing a whole-of-government effort to design and deliver an
equitable, effective, and accountable Government that delivers results
for all Americans. Since then, more than 17 Federal agencies, through 35
High Impact Service Providers (HISPs), have taken actions to deliver
customer experiences that are more simple, seamless, and secure. The
President’s Budget builds on this work by proposing more than $500
million to modernize services, reduce administrative burdens, pilot new
online tools and technologies, and improve agency capacity to improve
service delivery. By centering the customer’s experience with Federal
services, these investments bring value to Americans’ everyday
interactions with the Federal government.

Specifically, the President’s Budget:

**MODERNIZES SERVICE DELIVERY IN KEY AREAS**

-   **Improves the airport security experience.** The Budget includes
    $2.7 million for TSA to pilot a Customer Experience Manager model at
    four airports focused on streamlining passenger screening,
    easy-to-understand signage, and better collection and review of
    customer feedback.  
-   **Modernizes Federal retirement services.** The Budget includes $6.6
    million for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to help reduce
    processing times and improve customer satisfaction, expand a pilot
    for online retirement application, and begin to fund additional IT
    modernization initiatives akin to a case management system.

<!-- -->

-   **Provides more services online.** The Budget includes $163 million
    for the Department of State to revamp the delivery of Passport
    Services so the public can access core services online. Most
    notably, this supports the delivery on the commitment outlined in
    the [Customer Experience Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/13/fact-sheet-putting-the-public-first-improving-customer-experience-and-service-delivery-for-the-american-people/)
    to enable Americans to renew their passport without having to go
    in-person and mail original documents.

<!-- -->

-   **Improves Access to Social Security Services.** The Budget makes
    investments in the Social Security Administration to decrease
    customer wait times, simplify the Supplemental Security Income
    application processes, and increase outreach to people who are
    difficult to reach. SSA would also continue to modernize its
    information technology systems to make more services available
    online and improve 800 Number access for those who call. 

<!-- -->

-   **Improves Taxpayer Experience and Supports a Fair and Equitable Tax
    System.** The Inflation Reduction Act addressed long-standing IRS
    funding deficiencies by providing $79.4 billion in stable, long-term
    funding through 2031 to improve tax compliance by finally cracking
    down on high-income individuals and corporations who too often
    avoided paying their lawfully owed taxes and improve service for the
    millions of Americans that do pay their taxes. The funding will
    allow the IRS to modernize IT infrastructure, administer new energy
    tax credits, and rebuild the administrative capacity of the agency.
    To realize these goals and ensure that taxpayers receive the highest
    quality customer service and that all Americans are treated fairly
    by the U.S. tax system, the Budget provides a total of $14.1 billion
    for the IRS, $1.8 billion, or 15 percent, above the 2023 enacted
    level. This includes an increase of $642 million to improve the
    taxpayer experience and expand customer service outreach to
    underserved communities and the entire taxpaying public.

<!-- -->

-   **Digitizes Federal Land Maps.** The Budget includes $1 million for
    the United States Forest Service to pilot increased access to
    digital maps of Federal lands on Recreation.gov, as part of
    implementing directives in the *Modernizing Access to our Public
    Land Act*. 

<!-- -->

-   **Invests in shared products, services, and standards.** The Budget
    includes $119 million to support GSA in continuing its work
    implementing priority programs such as the US Web Design System,
    Digital Analytics Program, Digital.gov, Search.gov, and
    Touchpoints/Feedback Analytics. These programs provide the
    foundational tools for Federal agencies to shape customer
    experience, especially where government websites are not user
    friendly and must better comply with the 21st Century Integrated
    Digital Experience Act— making them more accessible to all
    Americans.

**ADVANCES LIFE EXPERIENCE PILOT PROJECTS**

-   **Improves Federal data services for benefits delivery.** The Budget
    includes $11 million for the Department of Health and Human Services
    (HHS)—with cross-agency partners like SSA, USDA, Housing and Urban
    Development (HUD), and the General Services Administration (GSA)—to
    test ways to improve access to benefits for people facing financial
    shock by improving underlying eligibility data services and systems.
    Applicants and state staff often manually verify income to gain
    access to these programs, which can be burdensome and
    time-consuming. By improving eligibility verification services and
    the quality of data coverage, the Government can streamline the
    customer experience while maintaining complete verification
    requirements.

<!-- -->

-   **Helps states streamline access to benefits.** The Budget includes
    $15 million for the Administration for Children and Families
    (ACF)—with partner agencies—to continue and expand demonstrations to
    improve service delivery across multiple benefit programs. Funds
    also support the establishment of a delivery team to help states
    adopt leading practices and innovate in Federal benefits delivery to
    ease application burden, lower time to access benefits, and improve
    cross-enrollment rates.

<!-- -->

-   **Streamlines Medicare enrollment.** The Budget includes $9 million
    for HHS and SSA to jointly pilot efforts to improve the Medicare
    enrollment experience.

<!-- -->

-   **Adopts innovative, family-centered approaches when welcoming a
    child.** The Budget includes $40 million to expand the “Healthy
    Start Benefits Bundle” pilots at the Health Resources and Services
    Administration (HRSA) to connect low-income families welcoming a new
    baby with information about a bundle of supportive services (such as
    Medicaid, WIC, TANF) through convenient, personalized case
    management.

**EXPANDS AND STANDS UP DEPARTMENTAL CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE OFFERS**

-   **Builds agency capacity to improve customer experience.** The
    Budget makes investments at the Departments of Agriculture, Homeland
    Security, Interior, Labor, Treasury, Veterans Affairs, the Small
    Business Administration, the Social Security Administration, the
    Federal Emergency Management Agency, and Census Bureau to hire more
    than 120 new full-time employees with customer experience and
    digital product delivery experience. This will enhance capabilities
    to learn directly from the public and identify pain points, analyze
    customer feedback, and use that information to improve service
    delivery. These new hires will support cross-agency life experience
    projects, customer research, and service improvement activities at
    agencies considered High Impact Service Providers (HISPs).
