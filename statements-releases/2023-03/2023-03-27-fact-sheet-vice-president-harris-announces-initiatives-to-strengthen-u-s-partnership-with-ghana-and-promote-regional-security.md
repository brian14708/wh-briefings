title: "FACT SHEET: Vice President Harris Announces Initiatives to Strengthen U.S.\
  \ Partnership with Ghana and Promote Regional\_Security"
---
 
The United States and Ghana enjoy a strong bilateral relationship based
on deep historical, cultural, and economic ties, as well as shared
democratic values. The United States and Ghana partner closely to solve
common challenges, in West Africa and globally, and the United States is
committed to strengthening that partnership.  
  
The Vice President’s travel to Ghana reaffirms our relationship and
collaboration on a range of issues, including: supporting conflict
prevention and stabilization in Coastal West Africa; promoting inclusive
economic growth, innovation, and regional integration; investing in
women and youth; elevating engagement with the African Diaspora;
addressing shared health challenges; and partnering to build climate
resilience and steward our shared Atlantic Ocean. In support of the
breadth and depth of our bilateral engagement, the Administration
intends to provide $139 million in bilateral assistance for Ghana in
Fiscal Year 2024.  
  
As part of her visit to Accra, the Vice President is announcing the
following U.S. plans, working with Congress as appropriate. She will
also highlight additional resources requested in the FY 2024 President’s
Budget.  
  
**<u>Regional Efforts to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability</u>**  
  
On March 24, 2023, President Biden transmitted to Congress the 10-year
plan for implementing the U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote
Stability with the Coastal West African countries of Benin, Côte
d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, and Togo. Today, the Vice President announced
that the Biden-Harris Administration intends to invest more than $100
million to support conflict prevention and stabilization efforts in
Coastal West Africa, including at least $86 million in funding over
three years specifically dedicated to implementation of the new 10-year
plan. The plan is intended to address regional threats of violent
extremism and instability in Coastal West Africa and enable the U.S.
Government to work with Congress to marshal additional assistance to
support efforts in the region over the coming years.  
  
The United States supports the holistic approach being taken by Ghana,
Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, and Togo to address threats of violent
extremism and instability, combining security, development, and
peacebuilding. In support of these efforts, the U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID) and the Department of State have begun
implementing new programs to help strengthen economic development and
increase governance and resilience in at-risk communities, including in
northern Ghana. For example, USAID’s Africa Trade and Investment
program, which the Vice President launched during the U.S.-Africa
Leaders Summit Diaspora Forum, is working to increase regional trade and
provide access to finance to entrepreneurs. The United States is also
collaborating with international partners to bolster joint investments
in border governance to build unity of effort between local populations
and security actors. The Department of Defense complements these
programs with civil-military engagements and robust capacity building
and training for partner forces.  
  
**<u>Support for Ghana’s Economic Recovery and Debt Restructuring</u>**

-   **<u>Department of Treasury Technical Adviso</u>**r: The U.S.
    Department of the Treasury’s Office of Technical Assistance (OTA)
    will deploy a full-time resident advisor in 2023, to Accra to assist
    the Ministry of Finance in developing and executing medium- to long
    term reforms needed to improve debt sustainability and support a
    competitive, dynamic government debt market. The project will
    complement and build on the Government of Ghana’s debt restructuring
    efforts. This project is part of OTA’s ongoing engagement to
    strengthen public financial management and financial sector
    oversight across sub-Saharan Africa. For 2023, OTA will execute 25
    projects in 15 African countries. This includes eight new projects
    in Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Namibia, Tanzania, The
    Gambia, and Zambia in revenue policy and administration; budget and
    financial accountability; government debt issuance and
    infrastructure financing; banking and financial services; and
    economic crimes.

    The AfCFTA forms the world’s largest free trade area by connecting
    almost 1.3 billion people across 54 African countries into a single
    market for goods and services. The center aims to build the capacity
    of woman- and youth-owned small and medium enterprises by providing
    the training and skills necessary to grow their businesses, export,

    three years (Fiscal Years 2022-2024 funds), pending the availability
    of appropriations and final funding allocations, to strengthen
    Ghana’s ability to prevent, detect and respond to infectious disease
    outbreaks. The President’s FY 2024 Budget includes an additional $9
    million in USAID funding for this purpose, requested to be provided
    during this timeframe. Funding will support communities to identify
    and mitigate risks for the spread of infectious diseases between
