President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden will travel to Ottawa,
Canada from March 23-24. President Biden will reaffirm the United
States’ commitment to the U.S.-Canada partnership and promote our shared
security, shared prosperity, and shared values. During the visit,
President Biden will meet with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to discuss
defense cooperation and modernizing the North American Aerospace Defense
Command, strengthening supply chain resilience, taking bold action to
combat climate change and accelerate the clean energy transition, and
working together on regional challenges, including instability in Haiti.
They will also discuss ongoing efforts to support Ukraine, to increase
the costs to Russia and those supporting its war effort, and to counter
the negative impacts of the war on the rest of the world. The two
leaders will also discuss enhanced collaboration to address the
synthetic opioid crisis that has devastated both countries, and
irregular migration and forced displacement throughout the
region. President Biden will also address the Canadian Parliament to
highlight the importance of the United States-Canada bilateral
relationship.
