The President is announcing his intent to nominate four individuals to
federal district courts and two individuals to the District of Columbia
Superior Court—all of whom are extraordinarily qualified, experienced,
and devoted to the rule of law and our Constitution.  
  
These choices also continue to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure
that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our
greatest assets as a country—both in terms of personal and professional
backgrounds.  
  
This will be President Biden’s thirty-first round of nominees for
federal judicial positions, bringing the number of announced federal
judicial nominees to 161.  
  
The President is also announcing his intent to nominate two individuals
to serve as U.S. Attorneys. These are officials who will be
indispensable to upholding the rule of law as top federal law
enforcement officials.  
  
These individuals were chosen for their devotion to enforcing the law,
their professionalism, their experience and credentials, their
dedication to pursuing equal justice for all, and their commitment to
the independence of the Department of Justice.  
  
The President has now announced 70 nominees to serve as U.S. Attorneys.
