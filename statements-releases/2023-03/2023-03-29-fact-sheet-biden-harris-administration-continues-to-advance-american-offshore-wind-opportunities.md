*Two Years of Progress to Catalyze a New Clean Energy Industry, Deliver
for Workers and Communities, and Protect Biodiversity and Ocean Co-Use*

Two years ago today, President Biden [set a
goal](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/29/fact-sheet-biden-administration-jumpstarts-offshore-wind-energy-projects-to-create-jobs/)
of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind electricity generation by
2030—enough to power more than 10 million American homes with clean
energy, while creating good-paying jobs in the United States across
manufacturing, shipbuilding, port operations, construction, and other
sectors. Since then, the Biden-Harris Administration’s transformative
actions have jumpstarted the offshore wind industry across the
country.  
  
Today at the International Offshore Wind Partnering Forum in Baltimore,
White House National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi outlined ten ways the
Administration is making progress toward the 2030 goal, and is on a path
to 110 gigawatts by 2050. Building on two years of decisive action,
today the Administration is making
new [announcements](https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-releases-strategy-accelerate-and-expand-domestic-offshore-wind-deployment)
on offshore wind cost reduction pathways, innovation strategies, and
more. Last year alone, American offshore wind investments
[tripled](https://www.offshorewindus.org/2023/02/21/new-report-u-s-state-demand-for-offshore-wind-nearly-doubled-in-2022-despite-economic-headwinds/),
with an additional $10 billion that spans across the nation—from
factories in the heartland to coastal communities along the Atlantic,
Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico. Through the President’s Investing in
America agenda, more progress is ahead in the development of stronger
supply chains, upgraded infrastructure, and a growing clean energy
economy.    

In addition to expanding economic opportunities for American workers and
communities, offshore wind deployment will strengthen the nation’s
energy security, make the power grid more reliable while lowering costs,
and reduce dangerous climate pollution. The Biden-Harris Administration
is committed to delivering these benefits by advancing offshore wind
development responsibly, in partnership with states, Tribes, coastal
communities, and a wide range of stakeholders, with data-driven
decisions to protect marine ecosystems and promote ocean co-use.  
  
The Administration is supporting offshore wind through actions across
the Departments of the Interior, Energy, Commerce, Transportation, and
other federal agencies, including these ten key ways:

1.  **Wind Energy Areas off Every Coast:** The Department of the
    Interior (DOI) released a first-ever [offshore wind leasing
    strategy](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/secretary-haaland-outlines-ambitious-offshore-wind-leasing-strategy),
    which includes holding up to seven offshore wind lease sales
    by 2025. This strategy provides two crucial ingredients for success:
    more certainty for industry, and transparency for stakeholders and
    ocean users. As part of this strategy, DOI’s Bureau of Ocean Energy
    Management (BOEM) held historic offshore wind lease sales in the
    [New York
    Bight](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-sets-offshore-energy-records-437-billion-winning-bids-wind),
    [Carolina Long
    Bay](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-winners-carolina-long-bay-offshore-wind-energy),
    and northern and central
    [California](https://doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-winners-california-offshore-wind-energy-auction).
    In support of potential lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico, Central
    Atlantic, Gulf of Maine, and offshore Oregon, BOEM is partnering
    with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on
    [advanced spatial
    modeling](https://www.boem.gov/newsroom/notes-stakeholders/boem-enhances-its-processes-identify-future-offshore-wind-energy-areas)
    to identify sites with the fewest conflicts and environmental
    impacts. President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act provides
    opportunities for offshore wind lease sales off the coasts of
    Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and the U.S.
    Territories.  
2.  **Investing in Workers and Communities:** To advance renewable
    development of the outer continental shelf, DOI has introduced
    innovative provisions to support workforce training and union-built
    projects, domestic supply chain development, and community benefit
    agreements—including with Tribes and stakeholder groups. The
    Department of Energy (DOE) has charted a path to grow and train an
    [American
    workforce](https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/national-lab-study-charts-path-toward-significant-growth-offshore-wind-workforce)
    to fill tens of thousands of jobs across the offshore wind industry.
    Efforts to help more communities share in offshore wind
    opportunities include Department of Commerce [economic development
    grants](https://www.eda.gov/news/press-release/2022/08/03/us-department-commerce-invests-229-million-support-offshore-wind);
    BOEM
    [collaborations](https://www.boem.gov/sites/default/files/documents/renewable-energy/state-activities/BOEM%20NY%20NJ%20Shared%20Vision.pdf)
    to deliver benefits to disadvantaged communities; and DOE
    [funding](https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/articles/weto-releases-28-million-funding-opportunity-address-key-deployment-challenges)
    for social science and capacity building to help communities more
    effectively participate in and capture benefits from offshore wind
    energy development.  
3.  **Made in America Supply Chains:** The Administration is working to
    swiftly implement the Inflation Reduction Act’s historic suite of
    [clean energy tax
    credits](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/inflation-reduction-act-guidebook/),
    including a manufacturing tax credit to support U.S. production of
    offshore wind components such as blades, nacelles, towers, and
    foundations. To support specialized shipbuilding, the Department of
    Transportation’s Maritime Administration (MARAD)
    [designated](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/dot-joins-new-federal-state-partnership-expand-domestic-offshore-wind-supply-chain)
    offshore wind vessels as the first category to receive priority for
    review through the Federal Ship Financing Program. DOE is providing
    a range of financial support to the offshore wind supply chain,
    including through the [Loan Programs
    Office](https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/lpo-tech-talk-offshore-wind)
    and the [Advanced Materials and Manufacturing Technologies
    Office](https://www.energy.gov/articles/us-department-energy-announces-30-million-materials-and-manufacturing-lower-costs-large),
    and working with industry and state partners to fill key gaps
    identified by the [U.S. Offshore Wind Supply Chain
    Roadmap](https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/national-offshore-wind-research-and-development-consortium-announces-us-offshore-wind).  
4.  **Responsible and Efficient Permitting:** DOI approved the nation’s
    first large-scale offshore wind projects, [Vineyard
    Wind](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-approves-first-major-offshore-wind-project-us-waters)
    and [South Fork
    Wind](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-approves-second-major-offshore-wind-project-us-federal-waters),
    both now under construction and being built by union labor. DOI and
    BOEM are on track to complete reviews of at least 16 project plans
    by 2025, representing more than 27 gigawatts (GW) of clean energy,
    and has proposed reforms to
    [modernize](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-takes-steps-strengthen-offshore-clean-energy-development)
    this process and save $1 billion over 20 years. NOAA has
    [advanced](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/topic/offshore-wind-energy)
    a range of environmental reviews, regulatory authorizations, and
    consultations to ensure protection of coastal and marine resources.
    Offshore wind is also a focus of the Administration’s [Permitting
    Action
    Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-releases-permitting-action-plan-to-accelerate-and-deliver-infrastructure-projects-on-time-on-task-and-on-budget/),
    bringing together federal agencies, White House offices, and the
    Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council to promote efficient
    reviews guided by the best available science and Indigenous
    Knowledge.  
5.  **Transmission Planning and Buildout:** To support the
    infrastructure needed to connect projects to the grid, DOE and BOEM
    have developed [draft
    recommendations](https://www.energy.gov/gdo/events/march-22-atlantic-offshore-wind-transmission-stakeholder-workshop)
    for an action plan on [Atlantic offshore wind
    transmission](https://www.energy.gov/gdo/offshore-wind-transmission-federal-planning-support),
    following a series of stakeholder convenings. A full action plan
    will follow, informed by the Administration’s Atlantic Offshore Wind
    Transmission Study. Similar efforts are underway along the Pacific,
    with DOE using Inflation Reduction Act funds for a [West Coast
    Offshore Wind Transmission
    Study](https://www.energy.gov/articles/us-department-energy-announces-new-actions-accelerate-us-floating-offshore-wind-deployment).
    Both the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act
    provide funding for grid upgrades that can support the offshore wind
    industry.  
6.  **Port Infrastructure Upgrades:** With additional support from the
    Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, MARAD [awarded
    grants](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/biden-harris-administration-announces-more-703-million-improve-port-infrastructure)
    last year through the Port Infrastructure Development Program (PIDP)
    that included nearly $100 million for port projects that will
    advance offshore wind deployment—from staging and assembly
    facilities for turbine components to docks for specialized vessels.
    For Fiscal Year 2023, more than $660 million in PIDP funding is
    [available](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/usdot-announces-more-660-million-available-through-port-infrastructure-development)
    for port-related infrastructure projects, which can include support
    for a range of clean energy opportunities. DOE and the National
    Renewable Energy Laboratory are advancing a [West Coast Ports
    Strategy](https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/articles/doe-launches-west-coast-ports-strategy-study)
    to support strategic planning for a collaborative port network to
    support installation, operation, and maintenance activities.    
7.  **Floating Offshore Wind Targets: **Deep-water areas that require
    floating platforms are home to two-thirds of America’s offshore wind
    energy potential, including along the West Coast and in the Gulf of
    Maine. To seize these opportunities, DOE launched the [Floating
    Offshore Wind
    Shot](https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/floating-offshore-wind-shot)
    aiming to reduce costs by more than 70% by 2035. DOE, DOI, and the
    Departments of Commerce and Transportation hosted an inaugural
    [summit](https://www.energy.gov/articles/icymi-biden-harris-administrations-inaugural-offshore-wind-shot-summit-demonstrates)
    convening federal, state, Tribal, labor, industry, and community
    leaders to advance U.S. leadership, and DOE is advancing
    [foundational
    science](https://www.energy.gov/science/articles/department-energy-announces-150-million-research-science-foundations-energy)
    and [prize
    competitions](https://americanmadechallenges.org/challenges/flowin/)
    to accelerate breakthroughs. DOI set a
    [goal](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/15/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-expand-u-s-offshore-wind-energy/)
    to deploy 15 GW of floating offshore wind capacity by 2035—enough to
    power over five million American homes.  
8.  **Federal-State Offshore Wind Implementation Partnership:**
    President Biden brought together eleven East Coast governors to
    [launch](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/23/fact-sheet-biden-administration-launches-new-federal-state-offshore-wind-partnership-to-grow-american-made-clean-energy/)
    the Federal-State Offshore Wind Implementation Partnership, with
    states working alongside the Administration to maximize the benefits
    of offshore wind development for workers and communities. With
    offshore wind leasing advancing beyond the Atlantic, both California
    and Louisiana
    [joined](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/22/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-actions-to-expand-offshore-wind-nationally-and-harness-more-reliable-affordable-clean-energy/)
    the Partnership to collaborate with federal agencies and other
    states on priorities including building an American supply chain and
    skilled workforce for offshore wind.  
9.  **Innovation and Research:** DOE, in partnership with other
    agencies, is supporting next-generation offshore wind technologies
    (including for [advanced turbine
    manufacturing](https://www.energy.gov/eere/amo/2023-large-wind-turbine-materials-and-manufacturing-funding-opportunity)
    and project [operations and
    maintenance](https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/articles/new-offshore-wind-operations-and-maintenance-road-map-works)),
    advancing innovative approaches to [environmental
    monitoring](https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-announces-135-million-sustainable-development-offshore-wind)
    and [ocean
    co-use](https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/sea-grant-doe-noaa-fisheries-fund-six-projects-coexistence-offshore-energy-northeast),
    and
    [more](https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/offshore-wind-research-and-development).
    These research, development, demonstration, and deployment efforts
    are a key part of DOE’s new [Department-wide
    strategy](https://www.energy.gov/eere/us-department-energys-strategy-advance-offshore-wind-energy-united-states)
    to support the Administration’s offshore wind goals, building on
    last year’s [Offshore Wind Energy Strategies
    Report](https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/doe-releases-report-detailing-strategies-expand-offshore-wind-deployment)
    outlining initiatives to accelerate cost-effective, reliable U.S.
    offshore wind deployment.  
10. **Cross-Cutting Efforts for Responsible Deployment:** The
    Biden-Harris Administration is taking a holistic approach to
    advancing offshore wind in concert with other priorities. These
    cross-cutting efforts include the nation’s first [Ocean Climate
    Action
    Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Ocean-Climate-Action-Plan_Final.pdf),
    detailing offshore wind actions that are part of broader efforts to
    ensure a robust and sustainable ocean economy; the NOAA-BOEM draft
    joint strategy to protect and promote recovery of [North Atlantic
    right
    whales](https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-and-boem-announce-draft-offshore-wind-north-atlantic-right-whale-strategy)
    while responsibly developing offshore wind energy; and a NOAA-BOEM
    joint strategy to mitigate impacts of offshore wind on [NOAA
    Fisheries
    surveys](https://www.boem.gov/newsroom/press-releases/boem-and-noaa-announce-joint-strategy-fisheries-surveys)
    in collaboration with other ocean users, including fishermen’s local
    ecological knowledge and Indigenous Knowledge.
