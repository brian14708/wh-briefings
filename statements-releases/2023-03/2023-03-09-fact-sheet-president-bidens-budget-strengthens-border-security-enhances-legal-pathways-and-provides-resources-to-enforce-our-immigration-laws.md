title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden\u2019s Budget Strengthens Border Security, Enhances\
  \ Legal Pathways, and Provides Resources to Enforce Our Immigration\_Laws"
---
 
President Biden has taken historic steps to secure our border and
rebuild a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system that was gutted
by the previous Administration. Over the past two years, the
Biden-Harris Administration has secured more resources for border
security than any of the presidents who preceded him, deployed the most
agents ever—more than 23,000—to address the situation at the border,
prevented record levels of illicit fentanyl from entering our country,
and brought together world leaders on a framework to deal with changing
migration patterns that are impacting the entire Western Hemisphere. The
Administration has also put in place new measures to enhance security at
the border and reduce the number of individuals crossing unlawfully
between ports of entry while expanding and expediting legal pathways for
orderly migration for individuals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and
Venezuela. The President also outlined new consequences for those who
fail to use these new legal pathways.

The President’s Budget includes billions of dollars to keep America’s
borders secure and enforce our immigration laws, while expanding legal
pathways for migrants seeking asylum. Funding will be used to modernize
border facilities, invest in technology, ensure the safe and humane
treatment of migrants in Department of Homeland Security (DHS) custody,
and reduce the backlog of immigration cases. Unlike some Congressional
Republican officials who are playing political games and obstructing
real solutions to fix our broken immigration system, President Biden has
a plan and is taking action. The Budget:

-   **Enhances Border Security and Immigration Enforcement.**
    Strengthening border security and providing safe, lawful pathways
    for migration remain top priorities for the Administration. The
    Budget includes nearly $25 billion for U.S. Customs and Border
    Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an
    increase of almost $800 million over the 2023 enacted level when
    controlling for border management amounts. The Budget includes funds
    for CBP to hire an additional 350 Border Patrol Agents, $535 million
    for border security technology at and between ports of entry, $40
    million to combat fentanyl trafficking and disrupt transnational
    criminal organizations, and funds to hire an additional 460
    processing assistants at CBP and ICE.

<!-- -->

-   **Supports a Fair, Orderly, and Humane Immigration System.** The
    Administration is committed to improving the Nation’s immigration
    system and safeguarding its integrity and promise by efficiently and
    fairly adjudicating requests for immigration benefits. The Budget
    includes $865 million for United States Citizenship and Immigration
    Services (USCIS) to process the increasing asylum caseloads, reduce
    the historically high immigration benefit request backlog, support
    the Citizenship and Integration Grant Program, and improve refugee
    processing to achieve the Administration’s goal of admitting up to
    125,000 refugees.

-   **Addresses the Situation at the Southwest Border.** Given elevated
    southwest border encounter levels experienced since 2019, the Budget
    proposes a new $4.7 billion contingency fund to aid the Department
    of Homeland Security (DHS) and its components when responding to
    migration surges along the southwest border. Each fiscal year the
    fund would receive appropriations incrementally, and above the base
    appropriation, as southwest border encounters reach pre-identified
    levels. DHS would be limited to obligating funds for surge-related
    functions, and would transfer funds to CBP, ICE, and FEMA accounts
    with valid surge-related responsibilities.

<!-- -->

-   **Improves Immigration Courts.** Providing resources to support
    legal representation in the immigration system would help make the
    system fairer and more equitable, while allowing for greater
    efficiencies in case processing.The Budget invests more than $1.5
    billion in the Executive Ofﬁce for Immigration Review (EOIR) both to
    manage and mitigate the backlog of over 1.8 million cases currently
    pending in the immigration courts that this Administration largely
    inherited from its predecessor. This funding supports 150 new
    immigration judge teams, which includes the support personnel
    required to help optimize the operation of the immigration court
    system. The Budget would also invest new resources in legal access
    programming, including $150 million in discretionary resources to
    provide access to representation for adults and families in
    immigration proceedings.

<!-- -->

-   **Supports America’s Promise to Refugees.** The Budget provides $7.3
    billion to the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) to help rebuild
    the Nation’s refugee resettlement infrastructure and respond to the
    needs of unaccompanied children. The funding would support the
    resettlement of up to 125,000 refugees in Fiscal Year 2024 and allow
    ORR to reinforce and expand on the programmatic improvements this
    Administration has made in the unaccompanied children program,
    including expanding access to counsel to help children navigate
    complex immigration court proceedings and enhancing case management
    and post-release services. In addition, the Budget includes an
    emergency contingency fund that would provide additional resources,
    beyond the $7.3 billion, when there are unanticipated increases in
    the number of unaccompanied children or other humanitarian entrants,
    building on the contingency fund enacted for 2023.

<!-- -->

-   **Creates Opportunities in Central America and Haiti.** The Budget
    requests more than $1 billion to advance the President’s commitment
    to work with Congress to provide $4 billion over four years to
    address the root causes of migration and help the people of the
    region create safer, more stable futures in their home communities.
    Assistance would bolster localization efforts, enhance the rule of
    law, and support economic growth for all segments of society.
    Further, in response to deteriorating conditions and widespread
    violence in Haiti, the Budget invests $291 million to strengthen
    Haiti’s recovery from political, health, and economic shocks, such
    as strengthening the capacity of the Haitian National Police,
    combating corruption, strengthening the capacity of civil society,
    responding to health emergencies and health needs, and supporting
    services for marginalized populations.

<!-- -->

-   **Bolsters Hemispheric Economic Investment and Migration Management
    Efforts.** In support of the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration
    and Protection, the Budget invests $430 million for hemispheric
    migration management. This assistance would bolster stability for
    affected communities, enhance legal pathways and protection in the
    hemisphere, and strengthen humane border management throughout the
    region. The Budget proposes more than $50 million for a new regional
    economic opportunity fund, the Americas Partnership Opportunity
    Fund, to support partner countries in the region hosting large
    populations of refugees and migrant. The budget requests up to $40
    million for the Global Concessional Financing Facility to support
    programs aimed at improving the lives of migrants and refugees in
    the Western Hemisphere. The Budget also includes $75 million for the
    Inter-American Development Bank’s IDB Invest to increase private
    sector investment in the Americas.
