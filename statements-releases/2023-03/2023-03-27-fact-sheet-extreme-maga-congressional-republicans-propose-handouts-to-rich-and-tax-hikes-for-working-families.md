*President Biden Asks the Super-Wealthy to Pay Their Fair Share and Cuts
Taxes for Hardworking Families*

  
The President’s economic vision is to invest in America and grow the
economy from the bottom up and middle out, not the top down. As part of
his plan to cut costs for Americans and give families more breathing
room, **the
President’s **[**Budget**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/)** cuts
taxes for working people and families with children by almost $800
billion over the next 10 years**. Like the rest of the Budget’s
investments, these tax cuts are more than paid for by ensuring wealthy
people and large corporations pay their fair share in taxes and by
cutting spending on special interests, without raising taxes on anyone
with income below $400,000 per year.  
  
Congressional Republicans have instead offered a set of top-down tax
proposals. Their agenda would add [over $3 trillion to the
debt](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/15/fact-sheet-the-congressional-republican-agenda-to-increase-the-debt-by-over-3-trillion/) with
tax cuts and other giveaways skewed to the wealthy and large
corporations. Remarkably, even as they have put forward trillions in tax
cuts, they have also advanced proposals that would *raise* taxes on
millions of middle-class and working Americans. And now, MAGA
Republicans
are [demanding](https://twitter.com/freedomcaucus/status/1634205313623572480)
[massive
cuts](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/21/five-alarm-fire-the-house-freedom-caucus-extreme-budget-proposal-raises-costs-for-families/) to
programs middle-class and working families, seniors, and students rely
on — from [public
safety](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/20/five-alarm-fire-the-house-freedom-caucus-extreme-budget-proposal-endangers-public-safety/) to
health care to education —
while [reportedly](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-house-republicans-working-term-sheet-debt-ceiling-vote-arrington-2023-03-23/) declining
to put forward a budget, which would show how much of these cuts are
going to pay for their tax cuts, rather than reduce the debt.  
  
**<span style="text-decoration: underline">Who would see a tax
cut?</span>**  
  
***<u>Under the President’s Plan</u>*: *Families with Children, Working
Households, People Buying Health Insurance, and Families Adopting a
Child***

-   **<u>39 million families with children</u>.** By increasing and
    improving the Child Tax Credit, the President would cut taxes by an
    average **of $2,600 for 39 million families **that include **62
    million children.** That includes **18 million children in
    low-income families** who would be newly eligible for the full
    credit, helping to continue historic reductions in child poverty.  
     
-   **<u>19 million working individuals or couples</u>.** By increasing
    and improving the Earned Income Tax Credit, the President’s plan
    would cut taxes by an average of **$800 for 19 million working
    individuals or couples.** That includes **2 million older
    workers** age 65 and older and **5 million young adults** age 18 to
    24 newly eligible for the credit.  
     
-   **<u>14.8 million people getting help purchasing health
    insurance</u>**. The President’s plan would make permanent his
    improvements to Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium tax credits, which
    are saving **14.8 million people an average of about $800** this
    year  
     
-   **<u>70,000 families adopting a child</u>.** By improving and
    expanding eligibility for the Adoption Tax Credit, the President’s
    plan would cut taxes by thousands of dollars on average for 70,000
    families adopting a child, reducing the financial burden on low- and
    moderate-income families pursuing adoption, as well as for families
    who opt for legal guardianship.

***<u>Under Congressional Republican Proposals</u>**: Huge Corporations,
Multi-Millionaires, Wealthy Tax Cheats***

-   **<u>About</u>** [**150 large, profitable
    businesses**](https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/CAMT%20JCT%20Data.pdf)**<u> that
    could go back to paying less than 15% of income in
    taxes</u>. **Congressional Republicans want to cut taxes for an
    estimated 150 large and profitable companies, firms with over $1
    billion in profits. In
    2020, [55 ](https://itep.org/55-profitable-corporations-zero-corporate-tax/)of
    the largest, most profitable corporations paid $0 in taxes.  
     
-   [**120,000
    households**](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/make-individual-income-tax-and-estate-tax-provisions-2017-tax-act-permanent-1)**<u> with
    incomes over $4 million per year</u>.** [Extreme MAGA House
    Republican](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/3832344-key-republicans-oppose-house-gop-bill-to-abolish-tax-code/) [leaders](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/10/17/republicans-tax-trump-biden/) have
    also introduced legislation to extend the expiring Trump tax cuts,
    including the large share that flow to the highest income Americans.
    That would deliver an average tax cut of $**175,000** — over 2.5
    times a typical family’s annual income — to the **120,000** highest
    income American households.  
     
-   **<u>Wealthy people and businesses who cheat on their
    taxes</u>.** While working people
    pay [99%](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1415.pdf) of taxes on
    their wage and salary income, the top [1% hides about
    20%](https://www.taxnotes.com/tax-notes-federal/compliance/tax-noncompliance-and-measures-income-inequality/2020/02/17/2c3y5) of
    their income from tax, including by funneling it through offshore
    accounts and tax havens that do not report earnings. As their very
    first piece of legislation, House Republicans passed the Tax Cheats
    Protection Act to let wealthy people and businesses to keep cheating
    on [over $100
    billion](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2023-01/hr23_IRS.pdf) in
    taxes they owe.

**<span style="text-decoration: underline">Who would pay
more?</span>**  
  
***<u>Under the President’s Plan</u>: Billionaires Who Now Pay Virtually
Nothing, Huge Corporations Sheltering Income in Tax Havens, and
Businesses Splurging on Stock Buybacks***  
  
Under the President’s plan, there are **no tax increases at all for
anyone making less than $400,000 per year**. But taxes would go up for:

-   **<u>Billionaires and multi-millionaires currently paying less tax
    than many middle-class families</u>. **The President’s plan includes
    a 25% minimum tax on the wealthiest 0.01%, those with wealth of more
    than $100 million. Because billionaires make their money in ways
    that are taxed at lower rates, and sometimes not taxed at all, many
    of the wealthiest Americans are able pay an average income tax rate
    of just [8
    percent](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2021/09/23/what-is-the-average-federal-individual-income-tax-rate-on-the-wealthiest-americans/) on
    their full incomes — a lower rate than many firefighters or
    teachers.  
     
-   **<u>Multinational corporations that use loopholes and tax havens to
    pay less in tax than many middle-class families</u>.** The
    President’s plan proposes to reform the international tax system to
    reduce incentives to shelter profits in tax havens and raise the tax
    rate on U.S. multinationals’ foreign earnings to 21%.  
     
-   **<u>Corporations with massive stock buybacks</u>. **President Biden
    signed into law a surcharge on corporate stock buybacks, which
    reduces the differential tax treatment between buybacks and
    dividends. This encourages businesses to invest in their growth and
    productivity as opposed to paying out corporate executives or
    funneling tax-preferred profits to foreign shareholders. The
    President’s Budget proposes quadrupling the stock buybacks tax to 4
    percent to address the continued tax advantage for buybacks and
    encourage long-term investment over handouts to executives and
    shareholders.  
     

***<u>Under Congressional Republican Proposals</u>**: Middle Class and
Working Families and Seniors***

-   **<u>14.8 million middle-class and low-income Americans getting help
    purchasing health insurance</u>. **Extreme MAGA House Republicans
    have
    introduced [legislation](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/812) to
    immediately repeal President Biden’s improvements to ACA tax credits
    for people buying health insurance. Among those who would be
    particularly hard hit are:  
     
-   Middle-income older people with high health insurance costs: A
    typical 60-year-old earning $60,000 per year would face a tax
    increase of over $6,000 for 2023. In areas with high health
    insurance premiums, the impact would be even greater.  
     
-   Self-employed people and small business owners who don’t get health
    insurance through their jobs. In 2021, self-employed people and
    small business owners accounted for [25
    percent](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/36e5e989516728adcc63e398b3e3d23d/aspe-marketplace-coverage-economic-benefits.pdf) of
    working-age people with ACA marketplace coverage.  
     
-   **<u>Working families and middle-class retirees</u>. **Some
    Congressional Republicans [continue to
    push](https://twitter.com/RepBuddyCarter/status/1632076524839895041) a
    national retail sales
    tax [bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/25) that
    would repeal most existing taxes and impose a new 30% sales tax on
    American families. That legislation would increase the debt
    by [trillions of
    dollars](https://www.brookings.edu/2023/03/01/proposed-fairtax-rate-would-add-trillions-to-deficits-over-10-years/) and
    deliver massive tax cuts to the well-off — while [increasing
    taxes](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-fair-tax-act-would-radically-restructure-the-nations-tax-system-in-favor-of-the-wealthy/) by
    $7,000 for a retired couple with $60,000 in Social Security income
    and by $6,000 for a single mom making $38,000 a year.
