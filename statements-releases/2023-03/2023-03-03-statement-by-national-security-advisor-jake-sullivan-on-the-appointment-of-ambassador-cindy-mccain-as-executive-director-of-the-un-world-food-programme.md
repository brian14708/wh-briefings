The United States welcomes the appointment of Ambassador Cindy McCain as
the next Executive Director of the United Nations World Food Programme.
With decades of humanitarian and business experience, Ambassador McCain
will bring her strong leadership to one of the largest humanitarian
organizations in the world. Her appointment comes at a critical period
as the world continues to experience record levels of acute food
insecurity, with war and climate change threatening the lives and
livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people. The Biden-Harris
Administration has made addressing global food insecurity a top
priority, and as the leading donor to WFP we look forward to continued
close collaboration with Ambassador McCain and the tens of thousands of
personnel she will lead. We also want to recognize the immense
contributions of outgoing Executive Director David Beasley and his
tireless efforts to mobilize international attention and resources to
ensure life-saving support reaches the world’s most vulnerable.
