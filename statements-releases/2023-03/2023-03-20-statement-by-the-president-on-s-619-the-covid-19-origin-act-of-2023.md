     Today, I am pleased to sign into law S. 619, the “COVID-19 Origin
Act of 2023.”  I share the Congress’s goal of releasing as much
information as possible about the origin of Coronavirus Disease 2019
(COVID–19).  In 2021, I directed the Intelligence Community to use every
tool at its disposal to investigate the origin of COVID-19, and that
work is ongoing.  We need to get to the bottom of COVID-19’s origins to
help ensure we can better prevent future pandemics.  My Administration
will continue to review all classified information relating to
COVID–19’s origins, including potential links to the Wuhan Institute of
Virology.  In implementing this legislation, my Administration will
declassify and share as much of that information as possible, consistent
with my constitutional authority to protect against the disclosure of
information that would harm national security.  

                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

  
THE WHITE HOUSE,  
    March 20, 2023.
