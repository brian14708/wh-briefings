title: "FACT SHEET: Vice President Harris Announces Initiatives to Deepen the U.S.\
  \ Partnership with\_Tanzania"
---
 
The partnership between the United States and Tanzania is rooted in more
than six decades of economic, development, health, and security
cooperation.  The United States and Tanzania stand together as friends
and partners, based on the principle of mutual respect and aspirations
for a more peaceful and prosperous future.  The United States firmly
supports Tanzania’s democratic reform agenda and shares Tanzania’s
democratic values.    
   
The Vice President’s travel to Tanzania affirms the partnership between
our two countries and will advance cooperation on commercial engagement,
digital connectivity, investing in women and youth, fostering democratic
values, food security, marine conservation, and health.  In support of
the breadth and depth of our bilateral engagement, the Administration
intends to provide $560 million in bilateral assistance in fiscal year
(FY) 2024 for Tanzania.  
   
As part of her visit to Dar es Salaam, the Vice President is announcing
the following U.S. plans, working with Congress as appropriate.  She
will also highlight additional resources requested in the FY 2024
President’s Budget.  
   
**<u>Strengthening Commercial Engagement</u>**  

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">U.S. EXIM-Tanzania
    Memorandum of Understanding (MOU):</span>  The Export-Import Bank of
    the United States (EXIM) and the Government of Tanzania will sign an
    MOU to expand U.S.-Tanzania commercial engagement by empowering U.S.
    businesses to export quality, innovative goods and services to
    Tanzania.  The MOU, which will facilitate up to $500 million in U.S.
    export financing to Tanzania, will support exports in a variety of
    sectors, particularly:  infrastructure, transportation, digital
    technology, climate and energy security, and power generation and
    distribution projects.  The MOU will support jobs in both Tanzania
    and the United States, and builds on EXIM’s Congressional mandate to
    increase U.S. exporters’ relationships in sub-Saharan Africa.

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Life Zone Metals
    Project:</span>  The United States, through the Partnership for
    Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), the Administration’s
    signature G7+ effort to enable transformative infrastructure
    development, has helped facilitate a strategic partnership between
    Life Zone Metals and TechMet, a leading critical metals company
    part-owned by the U.S. Government through the U.S. International
    Development Finance Corporation (DFC).  Life Zone Metals entered
    into a Framework Agreement with the Tanzanian government to open a
    new multi-metals processing facility that will use innovative,
    low-emission technology to process nickel and other critical
    minerals mined in Tanzania, targeting delivery of battery grade
    nickel to the U.S. and the global market as soon as 2026.  The
    partnership will also work to identify additional opportunities
    across the region for critical mineral inputs to the new facility.
     These efforts are aimed at building and expanding resilient,
    transparent supply chains for clean energy technology that are based
    on extensive local engagement, respect for the environment and
    conservation, and safe, high-integrity labor practices.

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Fiber Backbone and Access
    Network Expansion in East and Central Africa: </span> The U.S. Trade
    and Development Agency (USTDA) will support the expansion of
    affordable broadband access to thousands of people across East and
    Central Africa through a $1 million feasibility study grant to help
    develop new fiber backbone and access network infrastructure in
    Tanzania, Kenya, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Uganda.

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Partnership on 5G Security
    and Cyber Cooperation:  </span>The United States and Tanzania signed
    an MOU on March 27 establishing a partnership to build capacity and
    collaborate on 5G, cybersecurity, and related regulatory policies
    and frameworks.  During their April 2022 bilateral meeting,
    President Samia and Vice President Harris committed to focus on
    strengthening the U.S.-Tanzania partnership on cybersecurity and
    information and communications technology (ICT).  Since then, the
    United States has worked closely with the Government of Tanzania to
    conduct a regional workshop on ICT; provided technical assistance on
    5G, cybersecurity, and combatting cybercrime; and facilitated
    greater U.S. investment in Tanzania’s ICT sector. 

   
**<u>Investing in Democracy, Good Governance, and Development</u>**  
 

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">U.S.-Tanzania Bilateral
    Development Partnership:  </span>The U.S. Agency for International
    Development (USAID) and the Government of Tanzania signed a
    five-year, approximately $1.1 billion assistance agreement on March
    29.  Under the agreement, USAID will work in close collaboration
    with the Government of Tanzania to provide assistance in the areas
    of economic growth, health, education, and democracy and
    governance.  The agreement underscores the U.S. government’s
    commitment to help advance the Government of Tanzania’s development
    priorities.

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Strengthening Democratic
    Rights and Governance:  </span>In its FY 2024 Budget, the
    Biden-Harris Administration requested approximately $16.4 million in
    funding for democracy, rights, and governance programming for
    Tanzania, a significant increase that will support Tanzanian-led
    efforts in this space.  USAID additionally selected Tanzania as a
    focus country for its Advancing Women’s and Girls’ Civic and
    Political Leadership Initiative, which would provide up to an
    additional approximately $1 million in funds for programs starting
    this year.  

<!-- -->

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Advancing Freedom of
    Expression in Tanzania:</span>  The U.S. Department of State plans
    to provide $1 million for projects that encourage lifting
    restrictions on freedom of expression for the Tanzanian public and
    media.

<!-- -->

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Tanzania Center for
    Democracy Programming:</span>  In support of the Government of
    Tanzania’s stated democratic commitments, particularly in the lead
    up to the 2024 and 2025 elections, the United States will provide
    $400,000 to support the work of the Tanzania Centre for Democracy to
    bring together stakeholders to discuss further democratic and
    legislative reforms, while also building youth capacity in the
    political sphere.

   
**<u>Fostering Biodiversity and Food Security</u>**  
 

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Heshimu Bahari (Respect the
    Ocean) Program:</span>  USAID intends to provide $8.4 million to
    launch the Heshimu Bahari program, a five-year effort to enhance the
    ecological resilience and productivity of Tanzania’s marine
    ecosystems.  This funding will be the centerpiece of
    USAID/Tanzania’s $25 million investment in marine conservation and
    sustainable fisheries efforts.  Tanzania is a global hotspot of
    marine biodiversity that supports fishery and tourism livelihoods
    and is critical to the well-being of coastal communities throughout
    Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania.

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Kilimo Tija (Agricultural
    Productivity) Launch:  </span>USAID intends to provide $16 million
    to launch Kilimo Tija, an initiative to support Tanzanian farmers
    with a focus on women and youth, and respond to the global food
    security crisis.  Kilimo Tija is intended to equip Tanzanian farmers
    with the supplies, resources, and skills needed to increase yields
    and enhance the horticultural supply chain to get their goods to
    domestic and international markets.  Through climate smart seeds and
    targeted technological improvements, U.S. Government investments are
    intended to help mitigate the impacts of climate change while
    increasing production of highly nutritious horticultural goods. 
    USAID plans to provide an additional $10 million from Ukraine
    supplemental funding to further respond to the global food security
    crisis.  
     

**<u>Promoting Education, Youth Engagement, and Women’s Economic
Empowerment </u>**

    Entrepreneurs Conference:  </span>Approximately 100 Academy for
    Women Entrepreneurs (AWE) alumni from several African countries will
    convene in Tanzania in July to share best practices on growing a
    business, expanding export capacity, promoting inclusive gender
    policies, and building a strong international network of women in
    business.  This is the first AWE alumni conference in Africa to
    discuss entrepreneurship, access to capital, business and financial
    management, and marketing.

    on Food Security:  </span>The Department of State will convene
    alumni of the Humphrey Fellowship, a Fulbright Exchange Program, in
    Dar es Salaam on April 28, 2023 for a solutions-focused conference
    and dialogue on promoting food security and resilient food systems
    in Africa.  Informed by key takeaways from the U.S.-Africa Leaders
    Summit, alumni will chair roundtables on sustainable land and water
    management, agricultural technology, and related issues.  The
    conference will showcase the contributions and importance of
    Humphrey Alumni from several African countries in addressing complex
    regional and global challenges.  

   
**<u>Advancing Health Cooperation</u>**  
 

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Partnering on Marburg
    Response: </span> The U.S. Government is engaged with the Government
    of Tanzania and partners at all levels to support Tanzania’s
    response effort to the recent outbreak of Marburg virus.  Building
    on our long-standing collaboration in health, the U.S. Government,
    through the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is
    providing technical support in epidemic management.  In addition,
    USAID plans to provide $1.3 million for key prevention activities
    and critical response interventions to WHO and UNICEF, and the
    United States is providing Personal Protective Equipment to help
    Tanzanian responders.  

<!-- -->

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Continuing PEPFAR
    Investments: </span> The President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief
    (PEPFAR) program celebrated its 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary this
    year.  In recognition of the tremendous strides of the PEPFAR
    program in Tanzania, the United States plans to invest $433 million
    in appropriated resources over the next two years, and has requested
    an additional $395 million in the President’s FY 2024 Budget,
    subject to the availability of appropriation.  Tanzania is one of 12
    countries participating in a Global Alliance to End AIDS in
    Children, spearheaded by UNAIDS and the Office of the Global AIDS
    Coordinator.  In partnership with the Government of Tanzania, PEPFAR
    is supporting the adoption of health policies that will strengthen
    HIV program activities for children.  PEPFAR is also supporting
    Tanzania to expand a minimum package of prevention activities for
    adolescent girls and young women who bear a disproportionate burden
    of HIV infections in Tanzania.

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Malaria Investments through
    PMI:  </span>The U.S. President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) plans to
    invest $39 million over the next year in partnership with the
    Government of Tanzania to deploy lifesaving interventions proven to
    fight malaria, including bed nets, fast acting malaria medicines,
    rapid diagnostic tests, and preventative treatments in pregnancy.
     These funds are intended to support stronger, more resilient health
    systems by training health workers, strengthening supply chains, and
    improving data monitoring.

<!-- -->

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Health Electrification and
    Telecommunications Alliance: </span> Through Power Africa, USAID
    intends to provide $600,000 to work with private sector
    telecommunications and technology companies and the Government of
    Tanzania to expand clean energy services and provide electricity for
    as many as 100 health facilities in western, central, and southern
    Tanzania.  Powered by clean energy, telecommunications companies
    would build and enhance data services allowing health facilities to
    reliably access and utilize essential digital platforms.  As a
    result, health facilities would be able to more reliably track
    inventory; communicate and manage emergencies; and report on key
    patient care metrics.  Access to a clean, reliable energy source
    would improve basic health care and provide light and power for
    people and businesses to more efficiently and effectively conduct
    commerce and daily life.

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Global Health
    Security:</span>  As part of U.S. government global health security
    efforts and in support of the National Biodefense Strategy target to
    support at least 50 countries to improve their health security
    capacities, USAID and CDC plan to provide approximately $26 million
    over the next three years (Fiscal Years 2022-2024), pending the
    availability of appropriations and final allocations, to strengthen
    Tanzania’s ability to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious
    disease outbreaks.  The President’s FY 2024 Budget includes an
    additional $9 million in USAID funding for this purpose, requested
    to be provided during this timeframe.  USAID and CDC will strengthen
    their partnership with the Government of Tanzania to address
    critical needs of health care facilities, health care workers, and
    patients to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks by
    strengthening laboratories and disease surveillance, including
    zoonotic diseases and antimicrobial resistance surveillance;
    improving infection prevention and control; increasing
    rapid-response capacity; improving biosafety and biosecurity; and
    providing reliable information to the public on emerging pandemic
    threats and other infectious disease outbreaks in Tanzania.

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">COVID-19 support:
    </span> Tanzania is one of the 11 Global VAX surge countries.  The
    U.S. Government partnership with countries, including through the
    Global VAX initiative, has driven dramatic results. Vaccination
    rates in Tanzania skyrocketed from 15 percent (in June 2022) to 98.9
    percent (as of December 2022) of the eligible population.  With
    support from the Global VAX initiative, community leaders encouraged
    people to get vaccinated, and health workers went door to door to
    vaccinate those hardest to reach.
