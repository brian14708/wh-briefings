title: "FIVE-ALARM FIRE: The House Freedom Caucus\u2019 Extreme Budget Proposal Weakens\
  \ Our National\_Security"
---
 
The extreme MAGA Republican House Freedom Caucus has made their
priorities clear: imposing [devastating
cuts](https://twitter.com/freedomcaucus/status/1634205313623572480) that
would weaken national security and increasing costs for working- and
middle-class families, all to protect and extend tax breaks skewed to
the wealthy and big corporations. In fact, their tax cuts would be [so
expensive](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/15/fact-sheet-the-congressional-republican-agenda-to-increase-the-debt-by-over-3-trillion/) that
their deep and harmful cuts **would not reduce the deficit**.  
  
That’s in sharp contrast with the President’s Budget, which invests in
America, lowers costs for families, protects and strengthens Medicare
and Social Security, and reduces the deficit by $3 trillion over 10
years, while ensuring no one making less than $400,000 per year pays a
penny more in new taxes.  
  
Combined with other commitments extreme MAGA House Republicans have
already made, **the extreme Freedom Caucus proposal will be a disaster
for families in at least five key ways**: endangering public safety,
raising costs for families, shipping manufacturing jobs overseas and
undermining American workers, weakening national security, and hurting
seniors.  
  
Last week, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office
(CBO) [confirmed](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2023-03/58984-spendings.pdf) that
Congressional Republicans’ budget math doesn’t add up. CBO found that—in
order to meet Congressional Republicans’ [stated
commitment](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-15/republicans-balanced-budget-aim-clashes-with-fiscal-realities#xj4y7vzkg) to
balancing the budget in 10 years without raising taxes on the wealthy or
corporations, and without cutting Social Security, Medicare, defense,
and some veterans’ benefits—Congressional Republicans would need
to *eliminate everything in the rest of the Federal budget*.

**The extreme MAGA Republican House Freedom Caucus proposal will be a
five-alarm fire for families—including by weakening our national
security with drastic cuts. Their proposals will:**

-   **Undermine Military Readiness.** The extreme MAGA Republican House
    Freedom Caucus proposes to turn back the clock on defense funding
    and impose inflation-adjusted cuts each year going forward. Their
    proposal could amount to a roughly $600 billion reduction in funding
    for national defense over just the next five years compared to the
    President’s Budget—undermining military readiness, weakening our
    deterrence against China, and impeding our ability to meet pressing
    global challenges, both now and in the future.  
     
-   **Damage Efforts to Deter China**. The extreme MAGA Republican House
    Freedom Caucus plan would degrade and delay the Department of
    Defense’s efforts to increase capabilities, infrastructure,
    influence and deterrence in the Indo-Pacific theater. The House
    Freedom Caucus’s cuts, when applied to defense, would jeopardize
    crucial elements of the Department’s strategy in the region,
    including investments in the Pacific Deterrence Initiative and the
    development and procurement of critical munitions like the Long
    Range Anti-Ship Missile and the Standard Missle-6.  
     
-   **Set Back the Navy and the Air Force**. Funding for the Department
    of Defense at the levels implied by the extreme MAGA Republican
    House Freedom Caucus plan could force the Navy to cut at least two
    capital ships, eliminating a new Virginia class submarine and a new
    DDG-51 destroyer. The cuts would likely cause significant disruption
    and delays to the B-21 bomber program, which is now starting to
    enter production.   
     
-   **Weaken Our Economic Competitiveness with China.** The President
    believes future technology should be invented in America and
    manufactured in America. The extreme MAGA Republican House Freedom
    Caucus proposal would mean the future is invented and developed
    overseas, putting America behind other countries like China at a
    time when the United States has fallen to ninth in the world in
    investments in research and development while China has risen to
    second. The extreme MAGA Republican House Freedom Caucus proposal
    would cut innovation funding authorized in the bipartisan CHIPS and
    Science Act, resulting in 2,200 fewer research awards from the
    National Science Foundation alone in technologies critical to
    economic competitiveness and national security like advanced
    manufacturing, semiconductors, biotechnologies, and artificial
    intelligence. This would cut support to more than 31,000
    researchers, students, and others—undermining our national security
    and global competitiveness at a moment when America’s competitors
    continue to increase investment in these technologies.
