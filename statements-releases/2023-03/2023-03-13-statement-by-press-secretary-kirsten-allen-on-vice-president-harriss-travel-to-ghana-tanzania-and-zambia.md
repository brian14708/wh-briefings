Vice President Kamala Harris and Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff will
travel to Accra, Ghana; Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; and Lusaka, Zambia from
March 25 to April 2. The Vice President’s visit will build on the recent
U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit that President Biden hosted in Washington in
December 2022. The trip will strengthen the United States’ partnerships
throughout Africa and advance our shared efforts on security and
economic prosperity. Throughout the trip, in partnership with African
governments and the private sector, the Vice President will advance
efforts to expand access to the digital economy, support climate
adaptation and resilience, and strengthen business ties and investment,
including through innovation, entrepreneurship, and the economic
empowerment of women. The Vice President will meet with President Nana
Akufo-Addo of Ghana, President Samia Hassan of Tanzania, and President
Hakainde Hichilema of Zambia to discuss regional and global priorities,
including our shared commitment to democracy, inclusive and sustainable
economic growth, food security, and the effects of Russia’s unprovoked
war in Ukraine, among other issues. The Vice President will strengthen
people-to-people ties and engage with civil society, including young
leaders, business representatives, entrepreneurs, and members of the
African Diaspora.
