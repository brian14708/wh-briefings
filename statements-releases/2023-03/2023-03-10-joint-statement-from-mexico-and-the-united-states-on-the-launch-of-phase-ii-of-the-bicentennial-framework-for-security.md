At the North American Leaders’ Summit on January 9-10, President López
Obrador, President Biden, and Prime Minister Trudeau instructed their
Cabinets to intensify efforts to address the synthetic opioid epidemic
that is ravaging communities across North America. The three leaders
committed to intensify and expand coordinated efforts to prosecute drug
traffickers, dismantle criminal networks, disrupt the supply of
precursor chemicals used to make illicit fentanyl, and prevent the
trafficking of drugs, firearms, and people across our shared border.  
   
To follow through on this commitment, President Andrés Manuel López
Obrador welcomed a high-level U.S. delegation led by White House
Homeland Security Advisor Dr. Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall. Senior U.S.
and Mexican officials recognized the success of the Bicentennial
Framework for Security, Public Health, and Safe Communities as a
mechanism to coordinate security actions between both countries,
focusing particularly on countering the scourge of fentanyl. Mexico and
the United States reaffirmed their commitment to deepen law enforcement
cooperation and improve citizen security through the Bicentennial
Framework, a long-term and dynamic partnership based on shared
responsibility and respect for each country’s sovereignty.   
   
At the high-level meeting hosted by President López Obrador that took
place on March 9, 2023 in Mexico’s National Palace*,* the two
delegations committed to launching the second phase of the Bicentennial
Framework to further increase cooperation to combat illicit fentanyl
production, the trafficking of high-caliber weapons and ammunition into
Mexico, and transnational organized crime. The two sides discussed a
program to improve U.S. and Mexican interagency coordination and
bilateral sharing of criminal intelligence to target key nodes in the
synthetic drug supply chain.  Mexico and the U.S. will also begin a new
comprehensive binational public health campaign to prevent and reduce
the risks of consuming fentanyl and other drugs. The two governments
noted recent successes, including Mexico’s arrest of Lupe Tapia, one of
the largest producers of U.S.-bound synthetic drugs, and Ovidio “El
Raton” Guzman Lopez, a key driver of fentanyl production for the Sinaloa
Cartel.    
   
President López Obrador announced that Secretary of Security and Civil
Protection, Rosa Icela Rodríguez, will be the counterpart for leadership
of the counter-Fentanyl effort with Dr. Sherwood-Randall. This
appointment will ensure the effective coordination of the two countries’
security and public health agencies to implement this second phase of
the Framework. Authorities from Mexico and the United States will meet
again within two months in Washington, D.C. to further review and
analyze the effectiveness of the enhanced policies and improve
intelligence and information sharing on transnational criminal
organizations.  
   
President López Obrador welcomed the unprecedented location, recovery,
and return to the federal government of Mexico of approximately $25
million in funds that had been stolen by criminal actors from the
Mexican government through embezzlement and fraud, and seized and
forfeited by the U.S. Department of Justice. The United States and
Mexico determined that the funds will be remitted in the spirit of, and
will be used to advance the goals of, the Bicentennial Framework.  
   
The U.S. delegation and Mexican government officials also discussed the
recent kidnapping of four U.S. citizens in Matamoros, which resulted in
one Mexican and two U.S. citizens losing their lives. The first priority
of President Biden and President Lopez Obrador is to protect the lives
of U.S. and Mexican citizens and the law enforcement agencies of the two
governments committed to do everything in their power to identify, find,
and hold accountable those responsible for this deadly attack. The
United States and Mexico will bring all of their resources to bear
against the cartels and transnational criminal organizations that kill
and exploit citizens for enormous profits. The United States and Mexico
stand firm in the commitment to disrupt these criminal networks that are
impacting both countries.  
   
The Mexican high-level delegation included Foreign Secretary Marcelo
Ebrard; Secretary of Security Rosa Icela Rodríguez; Secretary of Defense
General Luis Cresencio Sandoval; Secretary of the Navy José Rafael
Ojeda, and Chief Officer for North America, Roberto Velasco.   
   
Dr. Sherwood-Randall’s high-level delegation included White House
Director of National Drug Control Policy Dr. Rahul Gupta; Deputy
Attorney General Lisa Monaco; Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security John
Tien; U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Ken Salazar; Deputy Assistant Secretary
of State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs
Charisse Phillips; and Senior Directors on President Biden’s National
Security Council Juan González and Katie Tobin.
