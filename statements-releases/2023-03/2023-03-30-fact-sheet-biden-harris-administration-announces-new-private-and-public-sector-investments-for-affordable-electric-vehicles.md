title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Announces New Private and Public\
  \ Sector Investments for Affordable Electric\_Vehicles"
---
 
*President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda is Unleashing a
Manufacturing and Clean Energy Boom and Accelerating the Production of
Affordable Electric Vehicles*

As part of President Biden’s goal of having 50 percent of all new
vehicle sales be electric by 2030, the White House is announcing the
first set of public and private commitments to support America’s
historic transition to electric vehicles (EV) under the EV Acceleration
Challenge. These commitments are part of President Biden’s [Investing in
America](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/invest/) agenda to spur domestic
manufacturing, strengthen supply chains, boost U.S. competitiveness and
create good-paying jobs. Because of President Biden’s leadership and
historic investments, electric vehicle sales have tripled and the number
of publicly available charging ports has grown by over 40 percent since
he took office. There are now more than three million EVs on the road
and over 132,000 public EV chargers across the country.  

President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act adds and expands tax credits
for purchases of new and used EVs—helping bring the benefits of clean
energy to communities across the nation. The law also provides
incentives to electrify heavy-duty vehicles like clean school buses, and
includes support for the installation of residential, commercial, and
municipal EV charging infrastructure. These incentives complement
investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and other federal
initiatives that are spurring the domestic manufacturing of EVs and
batteries and the development of a national EV charging network that
provides access to low income and disadvantaged communities.  

These incentives will lower the cost of EVs and EV charging
infrastructure; increase consumer demand and competition; promote equity
and inclusion; and accelerate the growth of the EV market. The White
House announced the [EV Acceleration
Challenge](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/cleanenergy/ev-acceleration-challenge/)
to bring a clean, safe, affordable, and reliable transportation future
to Americans even faster.

Today, the Federal Government, as well as a number of companies and
nonprofits including Prologis, First Student, Hertz, Amazon, Google,
Rewiring America, and others, are announcing new commitments to expand
EV fleets, increase consumer education, and grow the availability of EV
charging.  

Today, the Federal Government is announcing: 

-   Federal agencies have already acquired 13,000 light- and medium-duty
    zero emission vehicles (ZEVs) in FY23—about four times the number of
    ZEVs acquired in FY22. President Biden’s Federal Sustainability Plan
    requires federal agencies to transition the largest fleet in the
    world to all electric by acquiring 100 percent light-duty ZEVs
    annually by 2027 and acquiring 100 percent medium- and heavy-duty
    ZEVs annually by 2035.  
-   Federal agencies are committing to deploy an additional 24,000
    charging stations at Federal facilities by the next fiscal year,
    adding to the more than 5,000 charging stations already installed at
    Federal facilities nationwide. 
-   [Station Locator

    that will help consumers charge their EVs quickly, affordably and
    conveniently. The tool will soon offer:
    -   Charging cost: The cost to charge an EV at an individual
        charging station.
    -   Charging speed: The charging speed or power output at the
        charger port level. 

**ACCELERATING THE EV TRANSITION   
 **  
The Biden-Harris Administration’s Investing in America agenda has
spurred public and private sector commitments to accelerate the
transition to electric vehicles. State and local governments are also
leveraging federal funds to expand electrification of their vehicle
fleets. These announcements build on the EV charging network expansion
