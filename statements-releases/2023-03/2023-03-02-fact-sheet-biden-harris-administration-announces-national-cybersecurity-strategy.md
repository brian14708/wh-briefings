***<u>[Read the full strategy

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration released the National
Cybersecurity Strategy to secure the full benefits of a safe and secure
digital ecosystem for all Americans. In this decisive decade, the United
States will reimagine cyberspace as a tool to achieve our goals in a way
that reflects our values: economic security and prosperity; respect for
human rights and fundamental freedoms; trust in our democracy and
democratic institutions; and an equitable and diverse society. To
realize this vision, we must make fundamental shifts in how the United
States allocates roles, responsibilities, and resources in cyberspace.

1.  We must **rebalance the responsibility to defend cyberspace** by
    shifting the burden for cybersecurity away from individuals, small
    businesses, and local governments, and onto the organizations that
    are most capable and best-positioned to reduce risks for all of
    us.  
     
2.  We must **realign incentives to favor long-term investments** by
    striking a careful balance between defending ourselves against
    urgent threats today and simultaneously strategically planning for
    and investing in a resilient future.

The Strategy recognizes that government must use all tools of national
power in a coordinated manner to protect our national security, public
safety, and economic prosperity.  
  
**VISION**

Our rapidly evolving world demands a more intentional, more coordinated,
and more well-resourced approach to cyber defense. We face a complex
threat environment, with state and non-state actors developing and
executing novel campaigns to threaten our interests. At the same time,
next-generation technologies are reaching maturity at an accelerating
pace, creating new pathways for innovation while increasing digital
interdependencies.

This Strategy sets out a path to address these threats and secure the
promise of our digital future. Its implementation will protect our
investments in rebuilding America’s infrastructure, developing our clean
energy sector, and re-shoring America’s technology and manufacturing
base. Together with our allies and partners, the United States will make
our digital ecosystem:

-   **Defensible,** where cyber defense is overwhelmingly easier,
    cheaper, and more effective;
-   **Resilient,** where cyber incidents and errors have little
    widespread or lasting impact; and,
-   **Values-aligned,** where our most cherished values shape—and are in
    turn reinforced by— our digital world.

The Administration has already taken steps to secure cyberspace and our
digital ecosystem, including the National Security Strategy, Executive
Order 14028 (Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity), National Security
Memorandum 5 (Improving Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure
Control Systems), M-22-09 (Moving the U.S. Government Toward Zero-Trust
Cybersecurity Principles), and National Security Memorandum 10
(Promoting United States Leadership in Quantum Computing While
Mitigating Risks to Vulnerable Cryptographic Systems). Expanding on
these efforts, the Strategy recognizes that cyberspace does not exist
for its own end but as a tool to pursue our highest aspirations.

**APPROACH**

This Strategy seeks to build and enhance collaboration around five
pillars:

**1. Defend Critical Infrastructure** – We will give the American people
confidence in the availability and resilience of our critical
infrastructure and the essential services it provides, including by:

-   Expanding the use of minimum cybersecurity requirements in critical
    sectors to ensure national security and public safety and
    harmonizing regulations to reduce the burden of compliance;
-   Enabling public-private collaboration at the speed and scale
    necessary to defend critical infrastructure and essential services;
    and,
-   Defending and modernizing Federal networks and updating Federal
    incident response policy

**2. Disrupt and Dismantle Threat Actors** – Using all instruments of
national power, we will make malicious cyber actors incapable of
threatening the national security or public safety of the United States,
including by:

-   Strategically employing all tools of national power to disrupt
    adversaries; 
-   Engaging the private sector in disruption activities through
    scalable mechanisms; and, 
-   Addressing the ransomware threat through a comprehensive Federal
    approach and in lockstep with our international partners.

**3. Shape Market Forces to Drive Security and Resilience –** We will
place responsibility on those within our digital ecosystem that are best
positioned to reduce risk and shift the consequences of poor
cybersecurity away from the most vulnerable in order to make our digital
ecosystem more trustworthy, including by:

-   Promoting privacy and the security of personal data;
-   Shifting liability for software products and services to promote
    secure development practices; and,
-   Ensuring that Federal grant programs promote investments in new
    infrastructure that are secure and resilient.

**4. Invest in a Resilient Future –** Through strategic investments and
coordinated, collaborative action, the United States will continue to
lead the world in the innovation of secure and resilient next-generation
technologies and infrastructure, including by:

-   Reducing systemic technical vulnerabilities in the foundation of the
    Internet and across the digital ecosystem while making it more
    resilient against transnational digital repression;
-   Prioritizing cybersecurity R&D for next-generation technologies such
    as postquantum encryption, digital identity solutions, and clean
    energy infrastructure; and,
-    Developing a diverse and robust national cyber workforce

**5. Forge International Partnerships to Pursue Shared Goals** – The
United States seeks a world where responsible state behavior in
cyberspace is expected and reinforced and where irresponsible behavior
is isolating and costly, including by:

-   Leveraging international coalitions and partnerships among
    like-minded nations to counter threats to our digital ecosystem
    through joint preparedness, response, and cost imposition;
-   Increasing the capacity of our partners to defend themselves against
    cyber threats, both in peacetime and in crisis; and,
-   Working with our allies and partners to make secure, reliable, and
    trustworthy global supply chains for information and communications
    technology and operational technology products and services.

Coordinated by the Office of the National Cyber Director, the
Administration’s implementation of this Strategy is already underway.
