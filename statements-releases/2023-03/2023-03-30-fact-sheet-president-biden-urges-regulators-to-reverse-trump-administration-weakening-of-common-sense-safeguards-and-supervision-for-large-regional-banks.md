title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Urges Regulators to Reverse Trump Administration\
  \ Weakening of Common-Sense Safeguards and Supervision for Large Regional\_Banks"
---
 
President Biden believes that resilient community and regional banks
provide vital services to small businesses, workers, and families around
the country. The Biden-Harris Administration has taken decisive action
to ensure the stability of the banking system without putting taxpayer
dollars at risk. As we have demonstrated, the administration has the
tools to act quickly to prevent contagion and is committed to taking
strong action if needed. Americans should have confidence that their
deposits will be there when they need them.  
  
As the President said when his administration announced actions to
stabilize the banking system, he is committed to “continuing our efforts
to strengthen oversight and regulation of larger banks so that we are
not in this position again.” The Obama-Biden Administration put in place
strong requirements – primarily through the Dodd-Frank Act and
subsequent regulations and supervision – to reduce the risk of future
banking crises. Unfortunately, Trump Administration regulators weakened
many important common-sense requirements and supervision for large
regional banks like Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose recent
failure led to contagion.  
  
**The President believes that the weakening of common-sense bank
safeguards and supervision during the Trump Administration for large
regional banks should be reversed in order to strengthen the banking
system and protect American jobs and small businesses.**  
  
Specifically, the President urges the federal banking agencies, in
consultation with the Treasury Department, to consider a set of reforms
that will reduce the risk of future banking crises, including:

-   **Reinstating rules that were rolled back in the previous
    Administration for banks** **with assets between $100 and $250
    billion, including:**  
    -   **Liquidity requirements and enhanced liquidity stress
        testing.** Liquidity rules originally created under the
        Dodd-Frank Act required banks with between $100 and $250 billion
        in assets to hold sufficient high-quality liquid assets to cover
        expected net outflows during a stress period. The Trump
        Administration eliminated these rules for banks below $250
        billion in assets. A [recent
        analysis](https://som.yale.edu/story/2023/lessons-applying-liquidity-coverage-ratio-silicon-valley-bank)
        found that, as of the end of 2022, Silicon Valley Bank was well
        below the liquidity threshold that would have applied had the
        Trump Administration not exempted the bank from those rules. As
        we just saw, Silicon Valley Bank’s liquidity stress contributed
        to its failure and quickly transmitted to other banks. Bank
        regulators are encouraged to consider reinstating these
        requirements and using rigorous liquidity stress tests that
        factor in the risks of faster withdrawals in an always-on online
        environment.  
    -   **Annual supervisory capital stress tests.** Federal banking
        authorities have undertaken comprehensive capital stress tests
        to evaluate a range of risks that could face banks and to
        require that banks clearly have enough capital to withstand the
        potential losses associated with those risks. Under the Trump
        Administration, regulators reduced the obligation for banks like
        Silicon Valley Bank to undergo these stress tests from once a
        year to once every two years. As a result, when Silicon Valley
        Bank failed, it had never undergone a comprehensive capital
        stress test even though it had more than $200 billion in assets.
        Concerns about the bank’s capital levels contributed to a loss
        of confidence and withdrawal of deposits.  
    -   **Comprehensive resolution plans (also known as “living
        wills”).** Trump Administration regulators removed the
        requirement for bank holding companies in the $100 to $250
        billion size range, like Silicon Valley Bank’s parent company,
        to submit comprehensive resolution plans and asserted that the
        failure of these banks would not threaten the financial system.
        But the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank have
        now demonstrated clearly that failures of banks in this size
        range can pose systemic risk. As such, banks and bank holding
        companies of this size should have to submit plans describing
        how they could be wound down without transmitting stress to the
        rest of the banking system.  
    -   **Strong capital requirements for banks, at an appropriate time
        after a considerable transition period.** Americans should be
        confident that banks have sufficient capital cushions to absorb
        potential losses during stress events like the ones experienced
        by Silicon Valley Bank. At their point of failure, Signature
        Bank and Silicon Valley Bank had large unrealized losses on
        securities exceeding the capital available to absorb these
        losses. During the Trump Administration, regulators changed the
        rules to weaken a variety of capital requirements for some
        regional banks. These rules should be strengthened, to
        incorporate some of the requirements that already apply to the
        largest banks. In addition to revising these rules, there is
        remaining work to fully implement post-financial crisis capital
        rules.  
-   **Taking steps to once again ensure strong supervision.**  
    -   **Reduce the transition periods for applying common-sense
        safeguards to growing banks that are projected to exceed the
        $100 billion threshold.** The Trump Administration not only
        extended stress-testing cycles but also allowed lengthy
        transition periods that delayed capital stress tests after banks
        first reached $100 billion in assets. These changes let Silicon
        Valley Bank avoid a supervisory capital stress test for three
        years after clearing that threshold. Regulators should, as
        appropriate, consider shortening the transition periods for
        common-sense safeguards like stress testing, and supervisors
        should consider making sure rapidly growing banks prepare for
        them even as they approach the asset threshold. In addition,
        regulators should consider other measures to address risks
        associated with banks’ rapid growth.  
    -   **Strengthen supervisory tools, including stress testing, to
        make sure banks can withstand high interest rates and other
        stresses.** Rising interest rates are an obvious risk that any
        bank must manage. Regulators and supervisors are urged to
        consider using stress tests and other tools to ensure banks with
        $100 billion or more in assets have enough capital to withstand
        rising interest rates. They should also use their tools to
        assess liquidity for accelerated outflows of concentrated
        depositors and related liquidity shocks.  
-   **Expanding long-term debt requirements to a broader range of
    banks.** Currently, regulators require the largest banks to issue
    minimum amounts of long-term debt, which, in the event of failure,
    can serve as a loss-absorbing buffer to better protect depositors.
    Last year, regulators began the
    [process](https://www.fdic.gov/news/board-matters/2022/2022-10-18-notice-dis-b-fr.pdf)
    of updating these rules to, among other things, apply to a larger
    swath of banks. The regulators are encouraged to move forward
    expeditiously in proposing new rules.  
-   **Ensuring that the costs of replenishing the Deposit Insurance Fund
    after these recent bank failures are not borne by community banks.**
    The FDIC relied on the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) – a fund made up
    entirely of fees paid by banks – to help ensure that all depositors
    at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank had full access to their
    deposits. Current law requires the FDIC to levy a special assessment
    on banks to recover losses to the DIF and gives the FDIC discretion
    on how to implement the assessment.

Each of these items can be accomplished under existing law, and they
build upon regulatory reforms already on this Administration’s agenda,
like completion of the executive compensation rule for bank executives
authorized under Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act. It is important to
put in place common-sense safeguards to reverse the Trump
Administration’s harmful weakening of bank safeguards and supervision
and help ensure that community and regional banks remain resilient and
continue supporting small businesses and jobs.
