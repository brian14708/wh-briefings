title: "FACT SHEET: The President\u2019s Budget: Extending Medicare Solvency by 25\
  \ Years or More, Strengthening Medicare, and Lowering Health Care\_Costs"
---
 
The President’s FY 2024 Budget will lay out President Biden’s plan to
invest in America, lower costs for families, protect and strengthen
Social Security and Medicare, and reduce the deficit.

Millions of Americans have been working their whole lives, paying into
Medicare with every working day, and want to know that they can count on
Medicare to be there for them when they turn 65. The President’s Budget
extends the life of the Medicare Trust Fund by at least 25 years. It
achieves these gains with no benefit cuts—indeed, while lowering costs
for Medicare beneficiaries.

**Extending Medicare Solvency**

The proposals in the President’s Budget would extend the solvency of
Medicare’s Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund by at least 25 years, the
Medicare Office of the Chief Actuary estimates. While the most recent
Medicare Trustees Report projected that the HI Trust Fund would be
insolvent in 2028, the President’s Budget would extend solvency at least
into the 2050s.

The Budget extends the life of Medicare by:

-   **Modestly increasing the Medicare tax rate on income above
    $400,000. **The Budget proposes to increase the Medicare tax rate on
    earned and unearned income above $400,000 from 3.8 percent to 5
    percent. Since Medicare was passed, income and wealth inequality in
    the United States have increased dramatically. By asking those with
    the highest incomes to contribute modestly more, we can keep the
    Medicare program strong for decades to come.  
-   **Closing loopholes in existing Medicare taxes and dedicating the
    Medicare net investment income tax to the HI Trust
    Fund. **High-income people are supposed to pay a 3.8 percent
    Medicare tax on all of their income, but some high-paid
    professionals and other wealthy business owners have managed to
    shield some of their income from tax by claiming it is neither
    earned income nor investment income. The Budget would ensure that
    Medicare taxes apply to incomes over $400,000 per year, without
    loopholes. It would also dedicate the revenue from the Medicare net
    investment income tax to the HI Trust Fund, as originally
    intended.  
-   **Crediting savings from prescription drug reforms to the HI Trust
    Fund. **Building on the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which gave
    Medicare the authority to negotiate prices for high-cost drugs, the
    Budget strengthens this newly-established negotiation power by
    allowing Medicare to negotiate prices for more drugs and bringing
    drugs into negotiation sooner after they launch. It also strengthens
    the IRA requirement that drug companies pay rebates to Medicare when
    they increase prices faster than inflation by extending this rule to
    commercial health insurance. The Budget credits the savings from
    these additional prescription drug reforms, amounting to $200
    billion over 10 years, to the HI Trust Fund.

**Lowering Costs for Beneficiaries**

Not only does the President’s Budget extend the life of the Medicare
Trust Fund without benefit cuts, it does so while lowering costs for
beneficiaries in key areas.

-   **Lower out-of-pocket costs for drugs subject to negotiation. **By
    reducing prices for high-cost drugs, the Budget’s expansion of
    Medicare drug negotiations will not only save money for the federal
    government, it will also cut beneficiary’s out-of-pocket costs by
    billions of dollars.  
-   **$2 cost-sharing for generic drugs for chronic conditions. **The
    Budget proposes capping Part D cost-sharing on certain generic
    drugs, such as those used to treat chronic conditions like
    hypertension and high cholesterol, to $2 per prescription per
    month.  
-   **Lowering behavioral health care costs in Medicare.** The Budget
    eliminates cost-sharing for three mental health or other behavioral
    health visits per year and requires parity between physical health
    and mental health coverage in Medicare. It also requires coverage
    and payment for new types of Medicare providers, such as peer
    support workers and certified addiction counselors, and
    evidence-based digital applications and platforms that facilitate
    delivery of mental health services, while removing unnecessary
    limitations on beneficiary access to psychiatric hospitals.
