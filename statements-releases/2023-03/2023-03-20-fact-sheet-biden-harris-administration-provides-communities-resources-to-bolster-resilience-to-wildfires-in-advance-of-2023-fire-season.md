title: "FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Provides Communities Resources\
  \ to Bolster Resilience to Wildfires in Advance of 2023 Fire\_Season"
---
 
*U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of the Interior, and
other agencies continue government-wide effort to protect communities
from the threat of wildfires*  
 

Today, Vice President Harris, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, and
White House Senior Advisor and Infrastructure Coordinator Mitch Landrieu
announced **$197 million** in funding awards to make communities more
resilient to wildfires and strengthen the federal, state and local
response.  The funding comes from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s
new Community Wildfire Defense Grant program – a $1 billion new
initiative funded under the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
and derived from legislation the Vice President authored in the
Senate.  
  
These funds will help over 100 at-risk communities in 22 states and
seven Tribes develop and implement plans to protect themselves from
wildfires. Activities funded include developing or updating a
community’s Wildfire Protection Plan or implementing projects outlined
in a community’s existing plan – such as removing overgrown weeds or
dead vegetation from around homes, properly marking evacuation routes in
preparation for smoky conditions, identifying invasive species that
create fire risk like invasive bamboo, or clearing brush from around
power poles.  
  
As the President noted in the State of the Union last month, the
changing climate has caused an increase in the number of wildfires that
burn across the American West each year – often devastating
disadvantaged communities in high-risk areas. In 2022, nearly 70,000
fires burned over 7.5 million acres. In response, the Biden-Harris
Administration has directed the federal investments from the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act to target the
communities at greatest risk. 86 of the 100 grants announced for
communities today are also going to areas considered underserved –
in-line with the Administration’s commitment to Justice40.  
  
This announcement follows the **Department of the Interior’s** (DOI)
release of **$50 million** in new Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding
on March 17<sup>th</sup> for wildfire management and hazardous fuels
treatments this year, which will help limit the severity of wildfires in
at-risk areas. This funding will advance collaborative wildfire risk
management efforts with private landowners, Tribes, states and local
governments, help communities acquire slip-on tank units, support
special pay supplements for federal wildland firefighters, and expand
remote sensing for wildfire detection. These investments build on the
$228 million in [fiscal year 2023
funding](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=f2d97443f8&e=0ca263633c)
allocated in December by the Department and $180 million allocated in
fiscal year 2022.    
  
These combined announcements from the DOI and USDA – in addition to the
Administration’s efforts to identify priority landscapes for hazardous
fuels removal, raise wildland firefighter pay, invest in new
technologies through the **National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration** (NOAA) to better detect and stop wildfires, and
strengthen our federal, state, and local capacity to respond to
wildfires and remove hazardous materials – are making the communities
safer in advance of this fire season. Last year DOI and USDA coordinated
to treat over **3.5 million** **acres** in high-risk areas – in line
with a [5- and 10-year national
strategy](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=432079f2f9&e=0ca263633c)
– to limit the threat of wildfires to communities. With help from state,
local, and Tribal partners, they are on-pace to do even more this
year.  
  
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act included
over **$7 billion** in funding for the USDA, DOI, and NOAA to enhance
our ability to mitigate and respond to wildfires.   
  
**Wildland Fire Resilience & Response a Priority in the President’s
Budget**  
The Biden-Harris Administration remains intensely focused on limiting
the damage wildfires have on communities this fire season – and will use
all available resources to protect homes, our economy, and the
environment from climate-induced natural hazards. As part of the
President’s 2024 budget request, he called on Congress to:

-   **Permanently increase pay for wildland firefighters** – initially
    supplemented for 2 years through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law –
    and provide them with the health – including mental health –
    resources that they need to do dangerous jobs. These first
    responders save lives, protect communities, and serve on the
    frontlines of our nation’s wildfire crisis;
-   **Provide housing for wildland fire personnel**, who often struggle
    to find affordable housing options in hard to reach locations where
    they fight fires to protect communities;
-   **Increase funding for hazardous fuels treatment at the U.S. Forest
    Service** by 28% above 2023 enacted levels; and,  
-   **Increase the Department of the Interior’s wildland fire and
    hazardous fuels management funding** 21% above 2023 enacted levels.

Year Strategy to Confront the Wildfire
Crisis](https://whitehouse.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0ae7f75ebacfaef55ba39fcdb&id=eb44ddb9a8&e=0ca263633c)
– made possible through the fund provided in the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act.  
  
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also created the Wildland Fire
Mitigation and Management Commission and charged it with making
recommendations to improve federal policies related to the mitigation,
suppression, and management of wildland fires in the United States, as
well as the rehabilitation of lands devastated by wildland fire. Learn
