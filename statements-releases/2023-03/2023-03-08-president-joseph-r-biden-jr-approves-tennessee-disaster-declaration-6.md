certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for
emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by
the severe winter storm in Cocke, Coffee, Davidson, Greene, Henderson,
Knox, Maury, Perry, Putnam, Shelby, and Washington Counties.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard
mitigation measures statewide.
