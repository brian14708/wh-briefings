title: "Readout of National Security\_Council\_Event Recognizing the Contributions\
  \ of Veterans and Volunteers to Operation Allies Welcome"

National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Principal Deputy National
Security Advisor Jon Finer, and Homeland Security Advisor Liz
Sherwood-Randall yesterday hosted veterans, volunteers, and Afghan
newcomers to honor their contributions to Operation Allies Welcome
(OAW), through which the U.S. government welcomed tens of thousands of
our Afghan allies to America. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro
Mayorkas, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough, Deputy
Secretary Defense Kathleen Hicks, Deputy Secretary of Health and Human
Services Andrea Palm, and Acting Deputy Secretary of State for
Management and Resources John Bass represented the range of federal
departments and agencies that have been involved in the Biden-Harris
Administration’s efforts to support our Afghan allies.    
   
Mr. Sullivan thanked all of those who have volunteered for their
tireless support for newcomers and reaffirmed the Biden-Harris
Administration’s commitment to continuing to resettle our Afghan
allies over the coming years, which is an ongoing effort through a
program called Enduring Welcome. Secretary McDonough reflected on the
strength of U.S. Veterans and servicemembers—and their families—who are
now welcoming the partners who stood shoulder to shoulder with them in
Afghanistan.  Secretary Mayorkas recounted the whole-of-government
effort, led by DHS, to welcome approximately 100,000 Afghan newcomers,
and the critical role of partnerships in supporting our allies as they
rebuild their lives in their new communities.
