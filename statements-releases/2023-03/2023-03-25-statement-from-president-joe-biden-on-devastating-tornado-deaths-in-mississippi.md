title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Devastating Tornado Deaths in\_Mississippi"
---
 
Jill and I are praying for those who have lost loved ones in the
devastating tornadoes in Mississippi and for those whose loved ones are
missing.

The images from across Mississippi are heartbreaking. While we are still
assessing the full extent of the damage, we know that many of our fellow
Americans are not only grieving for family and friends, they’ve lost
their homes and businesses.  
   
Today, I reached out to Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves, and
have spoken to Senator Wicker, Senator Hyde-Smith, and Congressman
Bennie Thompson to express my condolences and offer full federal
support as communities recover from the effects of this storm. I also
spoke to FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell, who has already deployed
emergency response personnel and resources to support search-and-rescue
teams, assess the damage, and focus our federal support where it is
needed most quickly.

To those impacted by these devastating storms, and to the first
responders and emergency personnel working to help their fellow
Americans: we will do everything we can to help. We will be there as
long as it takes. We will work together to deliver the support you need
to recover.
