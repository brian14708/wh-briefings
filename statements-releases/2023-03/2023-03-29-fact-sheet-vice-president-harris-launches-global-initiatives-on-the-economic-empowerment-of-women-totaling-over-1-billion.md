title: "Fact Sheet: Vice President Harris Launches Global Initiatives on the Economic\
  \ Empowerment of Women, Totaling over $1\_Billion"
---
 
Promoting gender equity and equality is a cornerstone of U.S. foreign
policy in Africa and around the world. Advancing the economic status of
women and girls is not only a matter of human rights, justice, and
fairness—it is also a strategic imperative that reduces poverty and
promotes sustainable economic growth, increases access to education,
improves health outcomes, advances political stability, and fosters
democracy.

In particular, the digital gender gap undermines women’s full
participation in the 21st century economy. Globally, approximately 260
million more men than women were using the internet in 2022—and this gap
has increased by 20 million in the last three years. The gap is
especially acute across Africa, where International Telecommunication
Union data show that sixty-six percent of women do not use the internet.

To address this disparity, the Biden-Harris Administration will continue
to work with other governments, private sector, foundations, and
multilateral organizations to help close the digital divide, improve
meaningful access to equitable digital finance and other online
services, and address social norms that prevent women from participating
fully in the digital economy. More broadly, the Biden-Harris
Administration will continue to promote the economic empowerment of
women.

In support of these goals, in Accra, Ghana, the Vice President is
announcing a series of investments and initiatives—from the U.S.
government, and in response to her call for investment from the private
sector, and philanthropic community. The Vice President is also making a
series of announcements on behalf of the Biden-Harris Administration to
foster women’s political, economic, and social inclusion in Africa,
building upon initiatives launched at the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in
December 2022, including the Digital Transformation with Africa (DTA)
Initiative.

    Agency for International Development and the Bill & Melinda Gates
    Foundation are announcing a new fund to accelerate closing the
    gender digital divide, with a combined investment of $60 million, at
    least half of which will focus on Africa.
-   **Nearly $400M in Private Sector Commitments to Support Closing the
    Gender Digital Divide:** These commitments, totaling nearly $400
    million, support the key pillars guiding the work of the U.S.
    government to close the Gender Digital Divide.
-   **$528M in Private Sector Commitments to Support of Women’s Economic
    Empowerment in Africa:** These commitments, totaling over $528

    U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in December 2022.

**Women in the Digital Economy Fund**

The U.S. Agency for International Development and the Bill & Melinda
Gates Foundation are announcing the Women in the Digital Economy Fund, a
joint effort toward closing the gender digital divide. USAID will commit
$50 million and the Gates Foundation will commit $10 million
respectively by 2026, with at least half of these resources focused on
Africa.

This new Fund will accelerate progress to close the gender digital
divide by scaling evidence-based, proven solutions that improve women’s
livelihoods, economic security, and resilience. The Fund will support
programs that advance digital access and affordability; develop relevant
products and tools; provide digital literacy and skills training;
promote online safety and security; and invest in gender-disaggregated
data and research.

USAID will mobilize its commitment to this effort, subject to the
availability of funds, alongside additional U.S. government initiatives
focused on advancing gender equality and digital connectivity in Africa
as part of the DTA.

**Additional Private Sector and Philanthropic Commitments to Support

    program will expand to Chad, Mali, Morocco, Senegal, South Sudan,
    and Uganda within the next 10 years.

<!-- -->

-   **The Pfizer Foundation** has committed an additional $100,000 to
    support Living Goods in Kenya to use digital technology to empower
    frontline community health workers—with women at the center, as both
    healthcare providers and recipients of care. Living Goods’ Smart
    Health app equips community health workers to deliver on-demand,

    ability to learn about cancers, treatments, and ultimately living
    with cancer.

<!-- -->

-   **Microsoft Corporation** has committed to train and certify at
    least 1 million women across Africa by June 2025 through its Skills
    for Jobs program. To achieve this goal, Microsoft Corporation and
    the International Labor Organization have committed, through the

    Africa–with in-demand digital skills training, business coaching and
    mentorship, and stipend funding to pursue jobs and livelihood
    opportunities in the digital economy. In addition, Microsoft
    Corporation, together with Africa Tikkun, a South African non-profit

    for example, Liquid Intelligent Technologies and ViaSat joining with
    Microsoft to invest in gender equity programming in their ongoing
    effort to provide internet access to 25 million underserved people
    across Africa by the end of 2025.

<!-- -->

-   Towards the Microsoft Corporation’s commitment to catalyze internet
    access for 100 million people in Africa, **Microsoft Corporation and
    Mawingu Networks **have committed to expand their partnership in
    Kenya and enter new markets in Tanzania and Uganda, in order to

    million people across Africa, including women in underserved and
    remote communities, increasing their access to digital commerce,
    agricultural markets, healthcare services, and humanitarian
    benefits, by providing digital identities and a digital acceptance
    network. Recognizing that across Africa, women smallholder farmers
    systematically produce less output than their male counterparts
    because they have less access to inputs, credit, and other critical
    services, Community Pass connects these farmers to service providers
    to help make farming a more sustainable livelihood.

<!-- -->

-   **HP **has committed to accelerate digital equity for 2.5 million
    people in Africa in 2023, with a focus on those most likely to

    scale their efforts to advance social and economic equality in their
    local communities through a Digital Equity Accelerator, which
    provides funding, hardware solutions, and capacity-building support.

<!-- -->

-   **Procter & Gamble **has made a commitment to increase its annual
    spend with women-owned businesses in Sub-Saharan Africa by 30
    percent by the year 2025. This will build on P&G’s work with its
    partners to lead annual conferences and workshops across Africa
    focused on upskilling women-led businesses and equipping them with
    the right skills and strategies needed to become part of
    multinational’s supply chains.

<!-- -->

-   **The World Economic Forum’s** EDISON Alliance is committed to
    expanding its Lighthouse Network—which aims to close the digital
    divide, particularly for women—by bringing on three new countries in
    Africa by the end of this year, to support its goal of improving the
    lives of 1 billion people through affordable access to digital
    services by 2025. This includes increased attention to addressing
    the barriers women face in accessing and using digital connectivity.
    Launched in 2022, with Bahrain, Bangladesh, and Rwanda, the
    Lighthouse Network provides a platform for countries to showcase
    success stories, facilitate peer to peer exchange, and crowd in the
    partners and resources needed to meet their national digital
    inclusion goals, including on digital gender equality.

-   **myAgro,** a mobile layaway platform for agriculture, has committed
    to provide 500,000 West African women farmers by 2025 support in
    using mobile phones to access its digital savings tool in order to
    purchase seeds, fertilizers, and modern agricultural training.
    Through its platform, myAgro expects women farmers to invest $70

***Economic Participation***

-   **Supporting Women Entrepreneurs through Digital Finance.** In
    Lesotho, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is partnering
    with the World Bank to launch the Digital Innovation to Improve
    Access to Finance for Women Entrepreneurs initiative, working with
    local financial institutions to pilot gender-responsive digital
    finance products for small business owners. By reducing the reliance
    on fixed-asset collateral, the pilots will address a key constraint
    for female business owners. The most effective products will be
    scaled up as part of a $25 million investment in women entrepreneurs
    through the Health and Horticulture Compact, signed by MCC and the
    Government of Lesotho in 2022.

<!-- -->

-   **Promoting Women’s Land Rights. **MCC announced the Government of
    Morocco’s December 2022 establishment of the Centre d’Inclusion des
    Femmes au Foncier (CIFF) Center for Women’s Inclusion in Land
    Rights, which was developed with support from MCC’s Morocco
    Employability and Land Compact, including an investment of $1
    million for the Center. This Center will collect and disseminate
    data on land and women’s land use, support women to exercise their
    land rights, and strengthen land policy. Women comprise nearly half
    (41%) of title holders of land titled through the compact to date,
    in contrast to the roughly 1% that would have been eligible without
    claiming their inheritance rights.

<!-- -->

-   **Advancing African Women’s Trade and Investment.** USAID is
    committing $2 million in Gender Equity and Equality Action (GEEA)
    Fund resources to partner with agro-processing and garment firms in
    Kenya through the Imarisha Women’s Initiative, which helps women
    advance in their careers, improve their skill sets, and increase
    their income while creating more flexible and supportive workplaces.
    Part of the Africa Trade and Investment program, USAID’s signature
    effort to support the Prosper Africa initiative, and in partnership
    with the African Women’s Trade and Investment Project, this program
    promotes women’s participation in leadership and management
    positions in trade-related industries and sectors across Africa.  
     
-   **Promoting Women-Owned SMEs**. USAID announced $3 million in GEEA
    Fund resources for Ethical Apparel Africa (EAA) to accelerate the
    export capabilities of nine apparel manufacturers—primarily
    women-owned—in Benin, Ghana and Togo, through factory training,
    market facilitation via the African Growth and Opportunity Act,
    finance facilitation, and export capacity development. Over the next
    year, EAA firms will book a minimum of $10 million export orders
    through USAID support. EAA has pre-selected five Ghanaian firms that
    they will support over this one-year engagement, each of which are
    women-owned and employ majority women.

<!-- -->

-   **Supporting Women Farmers.** The U.S. International Development
    Finance Corporation (DFC) has committed to loan $10 million to
    Kentegra Biotechnology to support the construction of a new facility
    to scale up production capacity of pale refined pyrethrum extract
    (PRE), a key ingredient in organic pesticides which is made from the
    pyrethrum flower sourced by Kentegra from Kenyan farmers. Kentegra
    currently works with 9,200 farmers—almost half of whom are women and
    Kentegra plans to increase the percentage of women it works with
    over the next five years —and DFC’s loan will provide women farmers
    with more predictable income, higher prices than alternative crop
    options, as well as training to implement best farming practices and
    financial planning tools to fully benefit from the increased incomes
    resulting from pyrethrum cultivation.

***Environmental Stewardship***

-   **Boosting Women’s Access to Electricity. **USAID will invest $3
    million in GEEA Fund resources to support the establishment of
    women-owned or managed cooperatives to expand electricity access
    across Zambia through the Zambia Electric Cooperatives Development
    Project. This project will address gender gaps in the energy sector
    and in sustainable electrification expansion by directly engaging
    rural households, particularly women, in the ownership of their
    local electric service provider, and enhance the economic
    empowerment of rural women by delivering affordable energy-efficient
    services and technologies for entrepreneurial activities.

<!-- -->

-   **Advancing Women’s Engagement in the Energy Sector.** Drawing on
    funding previously announced during the United Nations Framework
    Convention on Climate Change (COP27), USAID will invest $1 million
    in GEEA Fund resources to advance gender equality through efficient
    energy use in East Africa by scaling up productive energy use
    projects, building communities of practice, and increasing women’s
    access to financing for efficient appliances. USAID will also
    advance women’s leadership in the rapidly evolving electric power
    sector by educating the next generation of science and engineering
    experts through curriculum development, internships and fellowships,
    and leadership and empowerment training. The initiative helps
    increase economic opportunities for women while increasing
    productive energy use in East Africa and globally and is training
    the next generation of women in the complex skills needed in the
    rapidly evolving power sector.

***Health***

-   **Promoting Adolescent Health and Wellbeing.** The Peace Corps is
    investing $750,000 per year for the next two years to expand its
    youth-related programming to tackle global health issues, including
    HIV prevention and care, malaria prevention and treatment,
    gender-based violence, sexual and reproductive health and rights,
    and economic empowerment. The program will run in a total of
    eighteen countries, the majority of which are in Africa, and will
    predominately serve adolescent girls and young women.

<!-- -->

-   USAID will invest $400,000 in its Youth Excel program in Tanzania,
    which educates adolescent boys and young men on positive gender
    norms, gender equitable and healthy relationships, economic
    productivity, and positive reproductive health for themselves and
    their partners through educational sessions delivered by positive
    male role models. The curriculum covers gender, violence prevention,
    addiction and alcohol abuse, soft skills, financial literacy, and
    puberty and reproductive health.

***Gender-Based Violence***

-   **Addressing Gender-Based Violence in Rural Communities.** USAID is
    investing over $780,000 in GEEA Fund resources to address
    gender-based violence through the Resilient, Inclusive and
    Sustainable Environments (RISE) grants challenge. In Zambia, the
    RISE challenge will establish Community-Based Fisheries Resources
    Management Committees, in which rural women will enhance their
    leadership, advocacy, and conflict management skills to address
    gender-based violence in the fisheries sector. In Kenya, the funds
    will support work to prevent gender-based violence and promote
    gender equality in conservancies.
