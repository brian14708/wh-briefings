The United States and Canada celebrate our progress under the Roadmap
for a Renewed U.S.-Canada Partnership over the past two years and
reaffirm our historic alliance, steadfast friendship, and commitment to
overcome the daunting challenges of today and realize the full potential
of the relationship in the future.  Our enduring partnership is based on
a mutual commitment to shared security, shared prosperity, and shared
democratic values, including the importance of fighting climate change
and an abiding respect for human rights and the rule of law.  As the
closest of friends and allies, we remain committed to making life better
for people on both sides of our shared border and to building a more
free, equitable, secure, and prosperous world.  
   
To that end, the United States and Canada will work together to:  
  
**1. Catalyze Clean Energy and Create Good Jobs:  **Deepening economic
integration, accelerating the deployment of clean technologies, and
workforce development are essential to building a more sustainable and
globally competitive economy for American and Canadian workers,
including through continued implementation of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada
Agreement.

-   President Biden and Prime Minister Trudeau highlighted the U.S.
    Inflation Reduction Act and Canada’s Emissions Reduction Plan as
    foundational elements to leading the clean energy future through
    robust clean energy industrial policies that help mobilize
    technological innovation, bolster resilient supply chains,
    strengthen our respective economies and expand the middle class,
    while keeping our environment healthy for future generations. 
    Canada is moving forward with an enhanced plan to support a clean
    economy future, including with a new investment tax credit for clean
    technology manufacturing in addition to tax measures that support
    clean hydrogen and clean technology adoption.  As the implementation
    of these plans proceed, the United States and Canada will work
    together toward an integrated North American approach that benefits
    U.S. and Canadian workers, suppliers, and products.   
-   The United States and Canada launched a one-year **Energy
    Transformation Task Force** chaired by the U.S. Special Presidential
    Coordinator for Global Infrastructure and Canada’s Deputy Prime
    Minister to work across the spectrum of the clean economy.  The task
    force will accelerate cooperation on critical clean energy
    opportunities and supply chains, including but not limited to,
    securing and strengthening renewable energy and electric vehicle
    supply chains, critical minerals and rare earths, grid integration
    and resilience, advanced and conventional nuclear energy and other
    areas that advance our collective energy security, and to avoid and
    reduce disruptions to our integrated and mutually supportive supply
    chains.  
-   The United States and Canada have built the world’s largest
    market-based energy trading relationship, which provides a firm
    foundation as we strive to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. 
    Both countries will work to harmonize charging standards and develop
    cross-border alternative fuel corridors, drawing on USD $7.5 billion
    in the U.S. Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and CAD $1.2 billion in
    Canadian funding to build a network of electric vehicle fast
    chargers and community charging options on both sides of the
    border.   
-   Building on Canadian and U.S. commitments to achieve net-zero power
    grids by 2035 and to accelerate efforts to phase down new, unabated
    coal power generation facilities, both countries intend to propose
    regulations before this fall that will reduce greenhouse gas
    emissions from their respective sectors.  The United States and
    Canada also intend to work with other major energy importers and
    exporters to develop an internationally aligned approach to
    measurement, monitoring, reporting, and verification for lifecycle
    methane and CO2 emissions across the fossil energy value chain.  
-   The United States and Canada will work together to address the
    climate impact of goods, promote North American trade of
    low-emissions goods, including the promotion of common approaches
    for trade in low emissions goods, including green steel and
    aluminum.  
-   On civil nuclear engagement, Canada will join the Foundational
    Infrastructure for Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor
    Technology (FIRST) program, providing funding and in-kind support. 
    The United States and Canada will also coordinate efforts to develop
    secure and reliable North American nuclear fuel supply chains and
    build broader partnerships with longstanding allies and partners,
    both of which will help to ensure access to low enriched uranium,
    including High-Assay Low Enriched Uranium.

**2. Strengthen Resilience of Critical Mineral and Semiconductor Supply
Chains:  **The United States and Canada will work together to create a
strong, environmentally responsible, and resilient North American
critical minerals supply chain.  We are committed to identifying,
securing, and developing critical minerals extraction, processing,
manufacturing, and recycling opportunities in both countries to
diversify supply chains essential to clean energy, electric vehicles,
semiconductors, aerospace, and defense, among other sectors, that meet
strong environmental, sustainability, worker, health and safety,
Indigenous and Tribal consultation and partnership, and community
engagement standards. 

-   Canada and the United States are taking a significant step toward
    the creation of reliable and sustainable critical mineral supply
    chains that are vital to our economic and national security and
    demonstrate the commitment of the United States to support Canadian
    companies in the energy economy.  
-   Last year, the United States announced USD $250 million of Defense
    Production Act Title III funding for U.S. and Canadian companies to
    mine and process critical minerals for electric vehicle and
    stationary storage batteries, with awards to U.S. and Canadian
    companies to be announced this spring.   
-   The Canadian Critical Minerals Infrastructure Fund will make CAD
    $1.5 billion available to support clean energy and transportation
    infrastructure projects necessary to accelerate critical minerals
    production and an additional CAD $1.5 billion through the Strategic
    Innovation Fund to support advanced manufacturing, processing, and
    recycling.   
-   With the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act, the United States and
    Canada will facilitate investment to promote secure and resilient
    semiconductor supply chains, creating jobs in both countries.  Both
    countries will advance a cross-border packaging corridor, beginning
    with Canada and IBM providing a significant investment to develop
    new and expanded packaging and testing capabilities at its Bromont
    facility as part of a Memorandum of Understanding.    
-   To strengthen advanced packaging for semiconductors and printed
    circuit boards in North America, the United States announced an
    additional USD $50 million in Defense Production Act funding for
    U.S. and Canadian companies to advance packaging for semiconductors
    and printed circuit boards, with Canada to provide up to CAD $250
    million for semiconductor projects from the Strategic Innovation
    Fund in the near term.  We are also establishing an Advanced
    Technology Data and Security Dialogue and intend to deepen our
    collaboration on shared priorities in quantum information science
    and technology. 

**3. Protecting Our Shared Waters and the Arctic:  **The United States
and Canada committed to fight climate change and build net-zero
economies, conserve biodiversity, and protect fragile ecosystems,
including in transboundary waters and the Arctic. 

-   Recognizing the vulnerability of the unique, shared Arctic
    ecosystem, Canada and the United States committed to advancing
    conservation, environmental protection and resilience in partnership
    and consultation with the Indigenous peoples and populations, and
    furthering work under agreements and treaties established around the
    movement of shared species  
-   The United States and Canada further committed to initiating
    dialogue with other Arctic Nations and Indigenous peoples to advance
    conservation and sustainable economic development in the Central
    Arctic Ocean, and recognized the need to conserve and protect Arctic
    ecosystems and reduce localized emissions of carbon dioxide,
    methane, and black carbon in the Arctic to complement our global
    mitigation efforts.  The two countries will collaborate to prepare
    for, prevent, and respond to oil spills and other environmental
    disasters in the Arctic.  
-   The United States and Canada announced a renewed commitment to
    preserving and restoring our shared national treasure, the Great
    Lakes.  The United States welcomed Canada’s announcement of a new,
    historic investment of CAD $420 million over the next decade as part
    of this shared responsibility to protect and restore the world’s
    largest freshwater ecosystem.  The U.S. Bipartisan Infrastructure
    Law provided the largest single investment in the Great Lakes in
    history, with USD $1 billion for cleanup and restoration
    activities.   
-   The United States and Canada will intensify their work over the
    coming months toward agreement on a modernized treaty regime that
    will support a healthy and prosperous Columbia River Basin.  We will
    focus on flood risk management, power generation, and environmental
    benefits that are shared equitably by both countries and the
    Indigenous peoples and Tribal nations, communities, and stakeholders
    in this watershed.  The Columbia River is a vital shared resource
    that underpins many lives and industries on both sides of the border
    and the watershed requires our attention and prompt coordination.
       
-   The United States and Canada also intend to reach an agreement in
    principle by this summer to reduce and mitigate the impacts of water
    pollution in the Elk-Kootenai watershed, in partnership with Tribal
    Nations and Indigenous Peoples, and in order to protect the people
    and species that depend on this vital river system. 

**4. Advancing Diversity and Inclusion:** Recognizing the central
importance of inclusion and equal opportunity to our democracies, Canada
and the United States will continue to work toward fair and inclusive
policies that benefit all citizens, regardless of sex, gender, or sexual
orientation; race, ethnicity, or religion; age; disability; or
geography. 

-   Building on previous bilateral and North American commitments, the
    Leaders reaffirmed their shared determination to promote equality
    and ensuring everyone lives free from discrimination, harassment, or
    violence.  Canada and the United States remain committed to ensuring
    the full, equal, and meaningful participation of marginalized
    communities in our societies.  
-   The Leaders reaffirmed their shared commitment to promoting gender
    equality and empowering women and girls as essential for achieving a
    more peaceful, inclusive, and prosperous world. They underscored the
    importance of continued cooperation on the advancement of gender
    equity, including with respect to child benefits, early learning and
    childcare, pay equity, and women’s entrepreneurship, among other
    issues.   

**5. Bolster Global Alliances:** The United States and Canada are
committed to the security of our treaty allies, including through the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and to supporting our
partners around the world.  We are even stronger through our
collaboration at and with the United Nations and other international
organizations, alliances, and groups, including the G7, G20, the Five
Eyes, and the Organization of American States.

-   We condemn Russia for its illegal, unjustifiable, and unprovoked war
    against Ukraine, and will continue imposing economic costs on
    Russia, while maintaining our unwavering support for Ukraine for as
    long as it takes.   
-   Canada and the United States acknowledge the serious long-term
    challenge to the international order posed by the People’s Republic
    of China, including disruptive actions such as economic coercion,
    non-market policies and practices, and human rights abuses.  While
    we will cooperate with China in areas of mutual interest, such as on
    climate change, we remain committed to ensuring our ability to
    compete effectively with China on a level playing field. Canada and
    the United States will also continue to cooperate on countering
    foreign interference in our societies in a manner that reflects our
    shared democratic values.   
-   We emphasize that our basic positions on Taiwan remain unchanged,
    and reiterate the importance of maintaining peace and stability
    across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of security and
    prosperity in the international community.  We encourage the
    peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues.   
-   The President and Prime Minister reaffirmed their commitment to the
    Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, and welcomed the first
    U.S.-Canada Indo-Pacific Strategic Dialogue on March 10 and will
    cooperate to promote a free, open, prosperous, secure, and resilient
    Indo-Pacific.  
-   The United States and Canada are working together to support
    countries around the world as they develop their economies to
    deliver inclusive and resilient growth, while fostering sustainable
    pathways to net zero emissions. Through the G7 Partnership for
    Global Infrastructure and Investment, we are collaborating to unlock
    public and private capital for quality infrastructure to create
    lasting positive impacts for low- and middle-income countries and
    support sustainable development, as well as benefit partners’
    economic security and global supply chains. We are also advancing an
    ambitious agenda to evolve the multilateral development banks,
    starting with the World Bank, to better respond to global
    challenges, while also enhancing their work on poverty alleviation
    and meeting the Sustainable Development Goals.   
-   The United States and Canada also remain concerned about
    deteriorating security in Haiti, committed to increasing
    international support for the Haitian people, including through
    security and humanitarian assistance, enhanced support for the
    Haitian National Police, and by holding accountable those who
    undermine Haiti’s stability. 

**6. Invest in Our Collective Defense and Security:  ** Our highest
priority is to protect our citizens and our sovereign territory.  We
will invest in the modernization of the North American Aerospace Defense
Command (NORAD), including specifically

-   As part of a CAD $6.96 billion investment in surveillance system
    modernization, procuring and fielding two next generation
    Over-the-Horizon Radar (OTHR) systems covering the Arctic and Polar
    approaches, the first by 2028 to enhance early warning and domain
    awareness of North American approaches;  
-   CAD $7.3 billion in investments in the northern forward operating
    locations to support 5th generation aircraft and mobility/refueling
    assets, which capabilities should be in place prior to the arrival
    of the F-35 aircraft, including airfield improvements to accommodate
    aircraft personnel, fuel, and munitions, to ensure NORAD’s ability
    to deter and defend against emerging threats to our air and sea
    space and compete with China and Russia for years to come.  
-   The Prime Minister confirmed that the funding for these investments
    would come from Canada’s planned investments in defense
    infrastructure.  These U.S. and Canadian efforts will bolster
    NORAD’s ability to detect threats earlier and more precisely and
    respond effectively.  In the face of global threats, the Leaders
    acknowledged the importance of investment in modern, ready, and
    capable forces in line with their commitments to NATO under the 2014
    Wales Summit Defence Investment Pledge.  Such investments enable
    effective contributions to NATO, United Nations, and other global
    missions.  
-   The Leaders recognized the need to work in close collaboration to
    combat all criminal activity in our combined jurisdiction.  The
    Cross-Border Crime Forum is key to the safety of both countries, by
    facilitating cooperation to reduce violent extremism, child sex
    exploitation, cross-border smuggling, and firearms violence on both
    sides of the border.  
-   Cyber threats can impact both Americans and Canadians, particularly
    when directed at cross-border systems on which we all rely.   
-   To better protect against these threats, we will deepen our
    cooperation on driving improvements to the cybersecurity and
    resiliency of our critical infrastructure.   
-   We will focus on two key sectors – pipelines and electricity –
    due to their criticality to our economies and their cross border
    nature.  Further, we reiterate that in each of our countries, should
    an adversary choose to target critical infrastructure systems, we
    will both respond.

**7. Disrupt the Illicit Production and Distribution of Synthetic
Opioids:** The opioid overdose crisis is having devastating health and
economic consequences in our societies.  We are united in our resolve to
disrupt the illicit production and distribution of synthetic opioids
like fentanyl and its precursor chemicals while augmenting our public
health response.

-   Canada and the United States will expand multi-agency cooperation to
    improve intelligence sharing on cross-border fentanyl and precursor
    chemical trafficking to support interdictions and investigations, as
    part of our effort to bolster cooperation under U.S.-Canada Opioids
    Action Plan.  
     
-   Canada will join the United States as it builds a global coalition
    against synthetic drugs, underscoring U.S. and Canadian leadership
    in response to this shared security and public health challenge. 
    The United States and Canada reaffirm their commitment from the
    tenth North American Leaders’ Summit to work with Mexico
    trilaterally to defeat the synthetic opioid crisis. 

**8. Manage Migration Collaboratively:  **The Los Angeles Declaration on
Migration and Protection enshrines our belief that irregular migration
requires a regional approach centered on expanding legal pathways and
humane border management and recognizes that we must address the
underlying economic and security drivers of migration.  The United
States and Canada remain committed partners in advancing the principles
of the Declaration.  

-   As part of its commitment to these principles, Canada will welcome
    an additional 15,000 migrants on a humanitarian basis from the
    Western Hemisphere over the course of the year to continue expanding
    safe, regular pathways offered throughout the hemisphere as an
    alternative to irregular migration, with a path to economic
    opportunities  
     
-   Additionally, U.S. and Canadian officials are now poised to
    implement an agreement to apply the terms of the Safe Third Country
    Agreement to asylum seekers who cross between ports of entry, which
    we anticipate will deter irregular migration at our shared border.
    We will remain in close coordination as we work to implement this
    new agreement.
