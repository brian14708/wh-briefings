President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met today with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak
of the United Kingdom in San Diego, California. The leaders underscored
their shared commitment to promote regional security through the
Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) trilateral partnership
and continued close defense cooperation. The leaders exchanged views on
a range of global issues, including the challenges posed by the People’s
Republic of China and our shared commitment to supporting peace and
stability in the Indo-Pacific region. They also underscored their
continued support for Ukraine in the face of Russia’s ongoing
aggression, including the provision of security, economic, and
humanitarian assistance to Ukraine as well as the imposition of economic
measures to counter Moscow’s ability to wage war. In addition, they
reaffirmed their shared and steadfast commitment to the Belfast/Good
Friday Agreement, and welcomed the Windsor Framework as an important
step in preserving the peace and progress in Northern Ireland brought by
the Agreement.  
   
The President and Prime Minister discussed the importance of continuing
to deepen the strong, enduring economic relationship between the United
Kingdom and the United States. President Biden invited Prime Minister
Sunak to visit Washington in June to continue this conversation. The
United States and United Kingdom will work and invest together to drive
the clean energy transition, foster the industries of the future, and
bolster our economies’ resilience to a range of shocks. The two
countries will explore ways to deepen our trade and investment
relationship and confront the shared economic and national security
challenges we face. The leaders directed their economic teams to work
intensively to advance this agenda, making progress ahead of the G7
Summit. As part of these efforts, the United States and United Kingdom
will work within the G7, with other international partners, and
bilaterally to strengthen and diversify critical supply chains,
including for critical minerals.
