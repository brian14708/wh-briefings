President Joe Biden looks forward to welcoming President Ursula von der
Leyen of the European Commission to the White House on Friday, March 10,
2023.  The leaders will review the strong cooperation between the United
States and the European Union to support Ukraine as it defends its
sovereignty and democracy and to impose costs on Russia for its
aggression.  They will also discuss U.S.-EU coordination to combat the
climate crisis through investing in clean technology based on secure
supply chains.  The leaders will take stock of the joint Task Force on
Europe’s Energy Security that they established one year ago, which has
helped the EU reduce its dependence on Russian fossil fuels and
accelerate its green transition. They will also discuss other
international security challenges, including our work together to
address the challenges posed by the People’s Republic of China.
