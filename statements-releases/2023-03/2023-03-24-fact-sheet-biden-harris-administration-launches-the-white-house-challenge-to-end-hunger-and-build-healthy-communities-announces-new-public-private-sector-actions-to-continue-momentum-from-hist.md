  \ Actions to Continue Momentum from Historic Hunger, Nutrition, and Health\_Conference"
---
 
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing the White House
Challenge to End Hunger and Build Healthy Communities.
The [Challenge](https://health.gov/our-work/nutrition-physical-activity/white-house-conference-hunger-nutrition-and-health/make-commitment) is
a nationwide call-to-action to stakeholders across all of society to
make bold commitments to advance President Biden’s goal to end hunger
and reduce diet-related diseases by 2030—all while reducing disparities.
Several organizations and companies are already participating in the
Challenge by announcing new commitments today. The Challenge builds on
the success of the $8 billion package of private and public sector
commitments that the
Administration [announced](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/28/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administration-announces-more-than-8-billion-in-new-commitments-as-part-of-call-to-action-for-white-house-conference-on-hunger-nutrition-and-health/) as
part of the historic White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and
Health in September 2022, and complements the Biden-Harris
Administration’s work to implement the [National Strategy on Hunger,
Nutrition, and
Health](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/White-House-National-Strategy-on-Hunger-Nutrition-and-Health-FINAL.pdf).  
  
Today, the Biden-Harris Administration will also announce two new
actions it is taking under the Strategy. The Administration will issue
draft guidance that offers food manufacturers recommendations on how and
when they can use Dietary Guidance Statements on food labels to help
inform consumers about their products and how they can contribute to a
nutritious diet. It will also issue a proposed rule that, if finalized,
would help reduce sodium in the food supply. The rule would provide
flexibility for food manufacturers to use safe and suitable salt
substitutes in foods like cheese and canned vegetables—many foods
already can and do use salt substitutes.  
  
**White House Challenge to End Hunger and Build Healthy Communities**  
To help secure a healthier future for all Americans, the Biden-Harris
Administration launched the White House Challenge to End Hunger and
Build Healthy Communities. Organizations—big or small, public or
private—and communities are encouraged to participate by making bold and
impactful commitments in one or more of the following areas across the
five pillars of the National Strategy.

-   **PILLAR 1: Improve food access and affordability** by supporting
    school food programs; ensuring kids have access to nutritious meals
    in the summer; and reducing barriers to participation and involving
    community members in the design and implementation of federal
    assistance programs.
-   **PILLAR 2**: **Integrate nutrition and health **by investing in
    health-related social needs, including conducting more screenings
    for food insecurity and offering nutrition services; and better
    educating health professionals about how to help their patients make
    healthy food choices and be more physically active.
-   **PILLAR 3: Empower all consumers to make and have access to
    healthier choices **by creating environments that support healthier
    choices and bolstering local food procurement.
-   **PILLAR 4: Support physical activity for all **by offering more
    opportunities to be physically active in communities and supporting
    comprehensive physical activity programs in schools.
-   **PILLAR 5: Enhance nutrition and food security research **by
    filling nutrition research gaps to continue supporting the *Dietary
    Guidelines for Americans* and building the evidence-base to improve
    federal assistance programs.

The Administration will work with the President’s Council on Sports,
Fitness, and Nutrition, co-chaired by Chef José Andrés and Elena Delle
Donne, to help cultivate commitments, and will announce Challenge
participants in the fall of 2023. Several companies, non-profits,
philanthropic groups, and local elected-officials are already stepping
up:

-   **DOHMEN COMPANY FOUNDATION: **Dohmen Company Foundation will invest
    $60 million to create and launch the Dohmen Impact Investment Fund
    to accelerate the growth and impact of five to ten for-profit social
    enterprises advancing proven food solutions that improve human
    health with the goal of making healthy eating ubiquitous. The Fund’s
    profits will go to charitable giving and public awareness campaigns
    to strengthen the food and nutrition ecosystem and accelerate a
    national movement to eliminate diet-related disease.
-   **DOORDASH: **By 2025, DoorDash will make healthy choices easier by
    growing the availability of produce in its marketplace by partnering
    with local, regional and national grocers across the U.S. and
    increasing the amount of healthy products available in DashMarts.
    DoorDash will also help keep healthy options at the top of mind for
    consumers by promoting and highlighting healthy products on its
    platform such as through tags, filters, and more options.
    Additionally, DoorDash will work with USDA to offer access to SNAP
    EBT grocery delivery in all 50 states, D.C., and Puerto Rico by
    2025.
-   **EAT.LEARN.PLAY: **Eat.Learn.Play, in partnership with KABOOM!,
    will remodel 6 schoolyards in 2023 at Oakland Unified School
    District campuses that also serve surrounding neighborhoods.
    Eat.Learn.Play. is ensuring Oakland students and families have safe
    and high-quality schoolyards for active play, working with Sport
    Court to create state-of-the-art multi-sport courts, and building
    kid-designed play structures, garden beds, outdoor classrooms,
    reading areas, murals, and more.
-   **INSTACART: **In the next six months, Instacart will:
    -   Partner with Boston Children’s Hospital and at least four other
        major health care providers across the U.S. to create virtual
        food pharmacies and other food is medicine interventions using
        Instacart Health products. Instacart will also offer to build
        custom virtual store fronts for any hospital or health system in
        the country to help providers educate and inspire patients to
        make better food choices.
    -   Introduce an industry-first online advertising capability to
        enable advertisements of fresh produce that is sold by weight
        (e.g., fresh oranges, bananas, and broccoli). This will allow
        fresh, weighted produce to be prominently placed front and
        center on the digital grocery platform and help consumers
        discover more fresh and nutritious options.
    -   Launch four new studies with researchers at Mount Sinai
        Hospital; University of Kentucky; University at Buffalo; and the
        Stanford Cancer Institute, Food for Health Equity Lab at
        Stanford Medicine, and the University of California, San
        Francisco’s Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center to
        study the impact of nutrition security interventions and food is
        medicine services on different patient groups, including
        individuals living with low incomes.
-   **KABOOM!**: KABOOM! will work with at least one new funding partner
    to form a multi-year partnership to build at least 30 additional
    playgrounds over the next three years in communities that
    disproportionally have less access to playspaces, including
    communities of color that are more likely to experience
    disinvestment in infrastructure and community spaces.
-   **MAYOR GILES (MESA, AZ), MAYOR NIRENBERG, (SAN ANTONIO, TX), and
    MAYOR COGNETTI (SCRANTON, PA): **Mayors Giles, Nirenberg, and
    Cognetti will each create and launch a Task Force in their city by
    end of summer 2023 to focus on implementing the goals of the
    National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health. The Task Forces
    will identify opportunities for local action in alignment with the
    National Strategy, encourage state and county participation when
    warranted, and develop a Blueprint to end hunger and increase
    healthy eating and physical activity by 2030 for each city by
    incorporating a breadth of input from leaders across sectors.  
      
    **Actions to End Hunger and Reduce Diet-related Diseases**  
       
    The Challenge builds on the Biden-Harris Administration’s success
    over the last six months in [implementing the National Strategy on
    Hunger, Nutrition and
    Health](https://hg-review.communicatehealth.com/our-work/nutrition-physical-activity/white-house-conference-hunger-nutrition-and-health/implementing-national-strategy).
    In addition to today’s actions, the Administration has:
-   Secured a permanent, nationwide Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer
    (EBT) program and non-congregate meal options for children in rural
    areas in the Fiscal Year 2023 omnibus budget agreement. As the first
    new major child nutrition program to be permanently authorized in
    almost 50 years, Summer EBT represents a significant expansion of
    federal efforts to meet the nutritional needs of children in the
    summer.
-   Approved ground-breaking Medicaid section 1115 demonstration
    initiatives in Massachusetts, Oregon, Arizona, and Arkansas to test
    coverage of services such as evidenced-based nutritional assistance
    and medically tailored meals.
-   Issued proposed rules to make school meals even healthier and expand
    access to free meals to more students; remove barriers to use WIC
    online and update nutrition standards for the WIC food package; and
    update when a food package can claim it is “healthy.”
-   Awarded over $1 billion through grants and cooperative agreements
    across federal agencies to fund nearly 800 projects nationwide to
    help improve access to food, promote healthy choices, and increase
    physical activity. We have also announced nearly $1 billion in
    additional funding to be awarded in the near future.
-   The President’s Fiscal Year 2024 budget builds on this progress by
    proposing to expand free, healthy school meals to 9 million more
    children; expand and enhance Medicare and Medicaid coverage of
    nutrition and obesity counseling; bolster nutrition and food
    labeling work to empower consumers to make healthy food choices;
    invest in CDC’s State Physical Activity and Nutrition Program
    nationwide; and build the foundation for evidence-based policies
    through nutrition research.  
      
    Achieving President Biden’s goals of ending hunger and reducing
    diet-related diseases by 2030 will require more than just the
    resources of the federal government. Many of the business, civic,
    academic, and philanthropic leaders that stepped up with commitments
    at the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health are
    also making strong progress in implementing their actions. Since
    September 2022, these leaders have reported serving over 9.4 million
    meals, investing $2.4 million directly into communities, and raising
    nearly $40 million to support bringing their commitments to
    fruition. For example:
-   **BENEFITS DATA TRUST **released
    their [toolkit](https://bdtrust.org/highered-toolkit-1/) to help
    higher education institutions identify college students eligible for
    public benefit programs like SNAP, Medicaid, and the new Affordable
    Connectivity Program.
-   **BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER** invested $1.4 million to open a local,
    minority-owned, healthy food market in a new affordable housing
    development this spring.
-   **MEIJER** enabled over 820,000 SNAP beneficiaries to purchase
    fruits and vegetables at a 10% discount.
-   **NATIONAL GROCERS ASSOCIATION FOUNDATION** received a $5 million
    grant to help grocers participate in SNAP online which will greatly
    accelerate their work toward increasing online SNAP participation
    for retailers.
-   **SHIPT **launched their innovative new accelerator program,
    LadderUp, to provide 10 local retailers with capital, e-commerce
    focused technical assistance, and education from industry leaders,
    with program participation aiming for at least 50% being in the
    food, beverage, and grocery categories, and 50% of businesses being
    owned by people of color and LGBTQI+ people.
