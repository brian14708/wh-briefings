title: "FACT SHEET: Implementing the United\_States Strategy on Countering Corruption:\
  \ Accomplishments and Renewed Commitment in the Year of\_Action"
---
 
On December 6, 2021, President Biden issued the first [United States
Strategy on Countering
Corruption](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/United-States-Strategy-on-Countering-Corruption.pdf) to
meet the grave threat transnational corruption poses to U.S. national
security.  The Strategy resulted from an interagency study the President
mandated when he made combating corruption a core U.S. priority in his
first [National Security Study
Memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/03/memorandum-on-establishing-the-fight-against-corruption-as-a-core-united-states-national-security-interest/). 
Organized in five pillars, the Strategy establishes specific lines of
work to support people and institutions that fight corruption, direct
action against corrupt actors, and impede corrupt actors’ abuse of our
financial system.  Some of the many steps taken under the Strategy are
outlined below.      
  
**Pillar One: Modernizing, Coordinating, and Resourcing U.S. Efforts to
Fight Corruption**  
We have taken significant action to align U.S. government authorities
and policy and to increase intra- and inter-agency coordination to
counter corruption threats.  Efforts have included:

-   The Department of State appointed its first Coordinator on Global
    Anti-Corruption and created a senior-level Anti-Corruption Policy
    Board to mainstream and prioritize anti-corruption in foreign
    policy.  The Departments of the Treasury and of Commerce, and the
    U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), have each set up
    or used existing coordinating bodies to enhance anti-corruption
    efforts internally and externally, and the Development Finance
    Corporation added a senior integrity and anti-corruption advisor.   
     
-   USAID issued its first [Anti-Corruption
    Policy](https://www.usaid.gov/anti-corruption/policy) to prioritize
    anti-corruption across programs, redirect efforts toward the most
    damaging forms of corruption, forge new partnerships and coalitions,
    and safeguard assistance resources. USAID held an Anti-Corruption
    and Evidence Learning week and issued new guidance and resources to
    staff and partners, including a [*Dekleptification
    Guide*](https://www.usaid.gov/anti-corruption/dekleptification) targeting
    entrenched corruption, a [*Guide to Countering Corruption Across
    Sectors*](https://www.usaid.gov/documents/usaid-guide-countering-corruption-across-sectors),
    and
    a [handbook ](https://www.usaid.gov/documents/usaid-global-health-anti-corruption-integration-handbook)on
    countering corruption in the global health sector.  
     
-   The State Department and USAID made anti-corruption a resource and
    personnel priority in the 2022-2026 Joint Strategic Plan; increased
    staff dedicated to anti-corruption initiatives; and invested in
    capacity building, including through expert training and guidance to
    staff.  
     
-   The Department of Justice, in its 2022-2026 Strategic Plan,
    prioritized combating corporate corruption and advancing
    international anti-corruption efforts and partnerships with foreign
    authorities.  Justice Department operational offices and the Federal
    Bureau of Investigation deployed dedicated resources to investigate
    and prosecute domestic and foreign corruption.  
     
-   The Commerce Department trained over 100 U.S. and Foreign Commercial
    Service and other International Trade Administration (ITA) staff on
    the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and related instruments, and on
    anti-corruption in international trade law.  
     
-   The Departments of State and Defense established an interagency
    Security Sector Governance Working Group to better integrate
    security sector governance standards into security cooperation and
    assistance planning processes and to strengthen protocols for
    assessing and mitigating corruption risk.

*Looking ahead*, further action will include efforts to direct and
integrate resources by refining context-specific, inclusive goals and
identifying strengths and gaps. USAID will create a Bureau for
Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance with a dedicated Anti-Corruption
Center.

**Pillar Two: Curbing Illicit Finance**  
We have acted to address vulnerabilities in the U.S. and international
financial systems that corrupt actors exploit to launder and hide
corrupt payments and proceeds.  Efforts have included:

-   The Treasury Department advanced efforts to implement the Corporate
    Transparency Act (CTA) and prevent criminals from using shell and
    front companies to launder illicit proceeds by issuing a [final
    rule](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-issues-final-rule-beneficial-ownership-reporting-support-law-enforcement) that
    requires certain entities to report information about their
    beneficial owners—the person(s) who ultimately own or control
    them—to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN); as well
    as a [proposed
    rule](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-issues-notice-proposed-rulemaking-regarding-access-beneficial-ownership) on
    disclosure of that information to federal agencies, state, local,
    tribal and foreign governments, and financial institutions.    
     
-   FinCEN issued
    an [advisory](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-issues-advisory-kleptocracy-and-foreign-public-corruption) on
    kleptocracy and foreign corruption to help U.S. financial
    institutions better identify and report possible corruption-related
    transactions.  
     
-   The State Department and USAID, with civil society, launched a
    multi-stakeholder Financial Transparency and Integrity “democracy
    cohort” under the Summit for Democracy to spur action and encourage
    implementation of commitments to prevent corruption.  
     
-   The Justice and State Departments and federal law enforcement have
    reinforced cross-border partnerships, including through
    international asset recovery networks and the U.N. Global
    Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities
    (GlobE). 

*Looking ahead, *curbing illicit finance will remain a priority. Further
actions will include continued Treasury Department efforts to implement
the CTA, enhance the transparency of the U.S. real estate sector, and
assess the illicit finance risks associated with key financial
gatekeepers, such as investment advisors, lawyers, and accountants. 
Also, through foreign assistance, the United States will further expand
partners’ capacity against illicit finance.

**Pillar Three: Holding Corrupt Actors Accountable**  
We have taken decisive measures to hold corrupt actors accountable
through both independent and coordinated action with our international
partners.  This line of effort has included:

-   The Treasury Department designated dozens of individuals and
    entities for their involvement in corruption, including current or
    former officials in Central America, Africa, the Western Balkans,
    and Eastern Europe.  Further, the State Department publicly imposed
    visa restrictions on over 80 current and former foreign officials
    and immediate family members generally rendering them ineligible for
    U.S. entry based on significant corruption, and others under the
    Northern Triangle-United States Enhanced Engagement Act.  To expand
    the impact of these tools, we coordinated with foreign partners
    through initiatives like the Democracies Against Safe Havens (DASH)
    Initiative, and advised foreign governments on adopting similar
    authorities.    
     
-   Justice Department, federal law enforcement, Securities and Exchange
    Commission, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission enforcement
    actions involving international bribery resulted in guilty pleas by
    multinationals or subsidiaries, penalties and forfeitures of over a
    billion dollars, and imposition of compliance monitors.  Other
    notable convictions in foreign corruption and money laundering cases
    included a former Goldman Sachs officer in a multi-billion-dollar
    scheme, and a former Venezuelan national treasurer and her husband
    in a billion-dollar scheme.  The Justice Department repatriated to
    Nigeria $20 million of forfeited corruption funds and initiated
    other civil actions to recover foreign kleptocracy proceeds.   
     
-   Justice Department and federal law enforcement peer-to-peer
    advisors, and State Department and USAID technical assistance
    programs, helped other countries strengthen their anti-corruption
    systems or adopt an anti-corruption strategy and legislation.  These
    foreign authorities have secured landmark convictions, recovered
    millions of dollars’ worth of stolen assets, and produced
    high-quality investigations and prosecutions, among other results.  
     
-   The United States, in coordination with foreign partners, launched
    the Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs (REPO) Task Force to hold
    accountable those responsible for and benefitting from Russia’s
    brutal war on Ukraine.  REPO member governments have frozen more
    than $30 billion in assets beneficially owned by sanctioned Russian
    parties.    
     
-   The Justice Department and federal law enforcement also launched the
    interagency Task Force KleptoCapture, which investigates violations
    of sanctions, export restrictions, and economic countermeasures
    imposed in response to Russia’s unjustified war.  The Task Force has
    obtained over 30 indictments against oligarchs, facilitators, and
    professional enablers, as well as against smuggling networks
    attempting to illegally ship sensitive technologies to Russia. 
    Working with international partners, the Task Force has seized over
    $500 million in assets, including investment accounts, real estate,
    and yachts.  In February 2023, the Task Force forfeited $5.4 million
    tied to a Russian oligarch that the Attorney General has since
    authorized be transferred to the State Department to be used for
    remediation in Ukraine.  
     
-   The Treasury Department, in coordination with the Justice and State
    Departments, launched the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Rewards
    Program, which offers to pay up to $5 million for information
    leading to the restraint or recovery of certain assets linked to
    foreign corruption. 

*Looking ahead, *we will continue to use financial sanctions, visa
restrictions, and, where appropriate, criminal, civil, or administrative
enforcement actions against corrupt actors; and we will strengthen
coordination with international partners and civil society to maximize
our impact in countering kleptocracy, state capture, and strategic
corruption. 

**Pillar Four: Preserving and Strengthening the Multilateral
Anti-Corruption Architecture**  
We have forged alliances with like-minded governments to strengthen the
multilateral infrastructure necessary to counter corruption across
borders.  Examples from the year include:

-   The United States secured consensus of the 189 parties to the United
    Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) to host the
    10<sup>th</sup> Conference of States Parties (COSP) in 2023.  
     
-   The United States cohosted the biennial International
    Anti-Corruption Conference with Transparency International,
    fostering global exchange and partnership among more than 2200
    participants from government, civil society, and business in over 80
    focused sessions.  
     
-   The United States launched a process to establish an Indo-Pacific
    Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) with support among all 14
    countries for a pillar on tax and anti-corruption, including
    measures to prevent and combat corruption and to enhance
    transparency in real estate transactions and beneficial
    ownership.   
     
-   The United States continued robust participation as a member state
    of the Group of European States Against Corruption (GRECO),
    including by increasing financial support following Russia’s
    expulsion and by offering subject matter experts to serve on
    evaluation teams.   
     
-   The United States joined 43 partners to issue a [*Revised
    Recommendation for Further Combating Bribery of Foreign Public
    Officials in International Business
    Transactions*](https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/en/instruments/OECD-LEGAL-0378) in
    the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
    Working Group on Bribery, and promoted ethical business practices in
    the Asia-Pacific through the APEC Business Ethics for Small and
    Medium Enterprises Forum.  
     
-   The United States launched its 5<sup>th</sup> National Action Plan
    in the Open Government Partnership (OGP) to advance transparency,
    accountability, and public participation, and was recently elected
    to the OGP Steering Committee where it will further promote these
    principles abroad.  USAID and the State Department also supported
    foreign and international multi-stakeholder initiatives, such as OGP
    and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).  
     
-   The Departments of State and Defense increased collaboration with
    the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Building Integrity
    program and have begun identifying opportunities to assist Allies
    and partners to devise mechanisms to increase transparency within
    their defense sectors.  Other Department of Defense programming has
    enhanced accountability in partner defense resource management.  
     
-   The United States and its partners in the Financial Action Task
    Force (FATF) included commitments to combat corruption in the
    2022 [FATF Ministerial
    Declaration](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/FATF-Ministerial-Declaration-April-2022.pdf),
    and the FATF agreed to undertake projects to promote implementation
    of the UNCAC and address corrupt actors’ misuse of
    citizenship-by-investment programs and poorly-regulated gatekeepers.

*Looking ahead, *the United States will continue to forge multilateral
alliances against corruption, including as a host of the Second Summit
for Democracy and the 2023 UNCAC COSP; will support updated EITI
Standards on beneficial ownership and transparent revenue disclosure;
and will undergo a GRECO evaluation of U.S. anti-corruption systems in
2023; among other actions.

**Pillar Five: Improving Diplomatic Engagement and Leveraging Foreign
Assistance**  
We have scaled up assistance and diplomacy to fortify foreign
governments against corruption; increased collaboration among
governments, civil society and business; and invested in protecting
those who work to expose corruption.  Examples include:

-   USAID launched Reporters Shield, an insurance product to defend
    journalists, media outlets and organizations from spurious lawsuits,
    as well as the Strengthening Transparency and Accountability through
    Investigative Reporting program to support investigative journalism
    networks and safety.  The State Department fostered journalist and
    civil society collaboration by increasing investment in the Global
    Anti-Corruption Consortium, supported budget transparency through a
    Fiscal Transparency Innovation Fund, and recognized courageous
    leaders through the Anti-Corruption Champions Award program.  
     
-   The State and Treasury Departments, to spark innovation, developed
    an Anti-Corruption Solutions through Emerging Technologies
    initiative, launched in a multi-day [Global Anti-Corruption Tech
    Sprint](https://www.anticorruptiontechsprint.org/), and also hosted
    local TechCamps in South Africa, Argentina and Indonesia.  USAID
    launched the [*Countering Transnational Corruption Grand Challenge
    for
    Development*](https://www.usaid.gov/anti-corruption/countering-transnational-corruption-grand-challenge),
    including its [*Powering a Just Energy Transition Green Minerals
    Challenge*](https://www.challenge.gov/?challenge=jetmineralschallenge).  
     
-   The State Department developed the Global Initiative to Galvanize
    the Private Sector as Partners in Combating Corruption (GPS) to
    advance public-private dialogue and action.  
     
-   The State and Justice Departments deployed a rapid response program
    for U.S. government experts to advise justice-sector counterparts,
    including through assessments and development of anti-corruption
    workplans in Czechia, Namibia, and the Democratic Republic of the
    Congo (DRC).  USAID’s Anti-Corruption Response Fund piloted new
    assistance approaches in the Dominican Republic and the DRC.  The
    State Department funded regional Anti-Corruption Hubs to promote
    practices in line with international standards and UNCAC.  
     
-   The Defense Department increased its investment in Institutional
    Capacity Building (ICB) programming that contributes to
    anti-corruption objectives.  The State Department’s Global Defense
    Reform Program has provided ICB partners with strategic-level
    advisory support to enhance partner security sector governance, such
    as to Kosovo’s Ministry of Defense.  
     
-   The State and Justice Departments, and federal law enforcement
    agencies participated in worldwide anti-corruption trainings that
    facilitate law enforcement partnerships, cooperation, and
    information-sharing among countries around the world.

*Looking ahead, *diplomatic and foreign assistance efforts will include
working in partnership with foreign partners to advance the Blue Dot
Network in order to increase transparency, reduce corruption, and
mobilize private capital for infrastructure investment in emerging
economies; issuance of a Reference Guide to USAID Anti-Corruption
Operational Safeguards that will highlight measures to ensure integrity
in U.S. foreign assistance; and other initiatives.
