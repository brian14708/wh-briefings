title: "FIVE-ALARM FIRE: The House Freedom Caucus\u2019 Extreme Budget Proposal Hurts\_\
  Seniors"
---
 
The extreme MAGA Republican House Freedom Caucus has made their
priorities clear: imposing [devastating
cuts](https://twitter.com/freedomcaucus/status/1634205313623572480) that
would hurt seniors and increasing costs for working- and middle-class
families, all to protect and extend tax breaks skewed to the wealthy and
big corporations. In fact, their tax cuts would be [so
expensive](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/15/fact-sheet-the-congressional-republican-agenda-to-increase-the-debt-by-over-3-trillion/)
that their deep and harmful cuts **would not reduce the deficit**.  
  
That’s in sharp contrast with the President’s Budget, which invests in
America, lowers costs for families, protects and strengthens Medicare
and Social Security, and reduces the deficit by $3 trillion over 10
years, while ensuring no one making less than $400,000 per year pays a
penny more in new taxes.  
  
Combined with other commitments extreme MAGA House Republicans have
already made, **the extreme Freedom Caucus proposal will be a disaster
for families in at least five key ways**: endangering public safety,
raising costs for families, shipping manufacturing jobs overseas and
undermining American workers, weakening national security, and hurting
seniors.  
  
Last week, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
[confirmed](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2023-03/58984-spendings.pdf)
that Congressional Republicans’ budget math doesn’t add up. CBO found
that—in order to meet Congressional Republicans’ [stated
commitment](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-15/republicans-balanced-budget-aim-clashes-with-fiscal-realities#xj4y7vzkg)
to balancing the budget in 10 years without raising taxes on the wealthy
or corporations, and without cutting Social Security, Medicare, defense,
and some veterans’ benefits— Congressional Republicans would need to
*eliminate everything in the rest of the Federal budget*.  
  
**<u>The extreme MAGA Republican House Freedom Caucus proposal will be a
five-alarm fire for</u>** **<u>families—including by hurting
seniors.</u>** As the President has made clear, if extreme MAGA
Republicans in the House try to cut Social Security, Medicare, or
Medicaid, he will stop them—and his Budget protects these bedrock
programs while investing in the health and well-being of America’s
seniors.  
  
**The extreme MAGA Republican House Freedom Caucus proposals will:** 

-   **Make the Largest Medicare Benefit Cut in Decades.** Extreme MAGA
    Republicans in the House have signed onto a bill to repeal the
    Inflation Reduction Act. That will eliminate access to $35 insulin
    for more than 3 million Medicare beneficiaries, eliminate the $2,000
    out of pocket cap on prescription drugs for seniors, increase prices
    of prescription drugs for seniors, and eliminate free vaccines that
    are saving 3.4 million seniors on average $70 per year—all to give
    Big Pharma a bigger taxpayer handout.
-   **Worsen Social Security and Medicare Wait Times.** Under the
    extreme MAGA Republican House Freedom Caucus proposal, people
    applying for disability benefits would have to wait at least two
    months longer for a decision. With fewer staff available, seniors
    would also be forced to endure longer wait times when they call for
    assistance for both Social Security and Medicare, and as many as 240
    Social Security field offices could be forced to close or shorten
    the hours they are open to the public.
-   **Rob Seniors of Healthy Meals.** The extreme MAGA Republican House
    Freedom Caucus proposal would take away nutrition services, such as
    Meals on Wheels, for more than 1 million seniors. For many of these
    seniors, these programs provide the only healthy meal they receive
    on any given day.
-   **Cuts Housing for Seniors.** The extreme MAGA Republican House
    Freedom Caucus proposal would eliminate funding for Housing Choice
    Vouchers for as many as 100,000 households headed by seniors,
    putting seniors across the country at greater risk of homelessness.
