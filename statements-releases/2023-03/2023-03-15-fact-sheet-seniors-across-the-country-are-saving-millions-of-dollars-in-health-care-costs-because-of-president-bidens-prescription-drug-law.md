  \ Care Costs Because of President\_Biden\u2019s Prescription Drug\_Law"

*New data from the Department of Health and Human Services shows how
much seniors in every state could save because of cost-saving provisions
of the Inflation Reduction Act*

Today, the Biden-Harris Administration released new data showing how
President Biden’s prescription drug law is lowering health care costs
and prescription drug prices for seniors across the country. Americans
pay [two to three
times](https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/trends-prescription-drug-spending)
more for prescription drugs than citizens in other countries and the
President and Congressional Democrats took on special interests to
finally lower prices for Americans. Last August, President Biden signed
into law the Inflation Reduction Act, which for the first time allows
Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices for seniors, caps
the cost of insulin at $35, makes recommended vaccines free for Medicare
beneficiaries, and requires prescription drug companies to pay rebates
to Medicare if they raise their prices faster than inflation.  
  
Already, millions of seniors are saving hundreds of dollars each per
year because of the Biden Administration’s actions, and President Biden
is fighting to expand these cost savings to all Americans. Last week, he
released his FY2024 budget which proposes expanding Medicare’s
negotiation authority to increase the number of drugs selected for
negotiation sooner after they launch, making manufacturers pay rebates
if they raise drug prices faster than inflation in the commercial
market, and capping the price of insulin at $35 per month for everyone–
not just seniors. Already, two of the three largest producers of insulin
in the country – Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk – announced they’re meeting
President Biden’s call and lowering insulin costs.  
  
New data and actions released today show that the Administration is
delivering on its promise to lower health care costs for the American
people:

**New Report Suggests 3.4 Million Seniors and People with Disabilities
Could Save An Average of $70 Per Year Because of Free Recommended
Vaccines**  
  
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released a new report
today showing the savings people with Medicare will now enjoy because
President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act makes recommended Part D
vaccines free for beneficiaries. The report finds that 3.4 million
people with Medicare would have saved $234 million in out-of-pocket
costs in 2021 – an average of $70 per person – had the Inflation
Reduction Act been in effect then. HHS expects the actual number of
people who will benefit from these cost savings in 2023 will be larger
than the 2021 figures because removing out-of-pocket costs will make the
vaccines more affordable for the 51 million Medicare beneficiaries
enrolled in a Part D plan. A state-by-state breakdown of cost-savings
that Medicare beneficiaries would have experienced in 2021 can be found
below.  
  
HHS released data earlier this year that show that 1.5 million seniors
and others on Medicare with diabetes would have saved, on average, $500
each per year on insulin if the Inflation Reduction Act’s $35 cap on a
month’s supply of insulin had been in effect in 2020. To view a
state-by-state breakdown of number of Medicare enrollees who are
benefitting from President Biden’s $35 cap on insulin visit [HHS’s

**HHS Announces First Set of Prescription Drugs Subject to Inflation
Rebates, Putting Money Back into Seniors’ Pockets Starting in April**

Today HHS also announced the first set of Part B prescription drugs that
will be subject to Medicare inflation rebates because they raised their
prices faster than inflation. President Biden’s prescription drug law
includes critical checks to ensure that prescription drug companies have
to pay back Medicare if they raise prices on seniors at a higher rate
than inflation. Starting in April, some Medicare beneficiaries will have
lower coinsurance for the 27 prescription drugs that raised prices
faster than inflation in the last quarter of 2022. Seniors may see their
out-of-pocket costs for these drugs decrease by $2 to as high as $390
per average dose starting April 1st.  
  
In addition to making drug companies pay Medicare back for increasing
their prices faster than inflation, this provision of the Inflation
Reduction Act discourages other companies from doing the same, with the
goal of reining in excessive drug price hikes year-over-year. According
to a [recent
report](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/09/30/new-hhs-reports-illustrate-potential-positive-impact-inflation-reduction-act-prescription-drug-prices.html)
from HHS, 1,200 prescription drugs increased their prices faster than
inflation in 2021 – the year before Congressional Democrats passed and
President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act.  
  
The 27 drugs subject to Medicare inflation rebates and the coinsurance
adjustment rates are below:

**Biden Administration to Take Critical Step in Allowing Medicare to
Negotiate Down the Price of Prescription Drugs**

For decades, leaders have tried to take on Big Pharma and allow Medicare
to negotiate lower prescription drug costs for seniors and failed.
President Biden and Congressional Democrats finally got it done with the
Inflation Reduction Act. Later this year, Medicare will begin
negotiating lower prescription drug prices for its beneficiaries, and
today, the Biden Administration will take a critical step in that
process. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) within HHS
will release initial guidance on its drug price negotiation process,
which will outline how the agency will select drugs for negotiation and
how those negotiations will be conducted.  
  
The ability to negotiate lower prescription drug prices is one of the
most powerful tools Medicare has to lower health care costs for American
seniors and families. To that end, President Biden last week called for
expanding Medicare’s negotiating authority to cover more drugs, sooner
after they launch, when he released his FY2024 budget.
