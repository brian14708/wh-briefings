title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden Submits to Congress 10-Year Plans to Implement\
  \ the U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote\_Stability"
---
 
The U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability is a
long-term initiative to redefine how the United States prevents violence
and advances stability in areas vulnerable to conflict.  Under the
bipartisan Global Fragility Act, the U.S. government is implementing
this Strategy through 10-year plans developed with extensive
consultations with local stakeholders in our priority partner countries
and region: Haiti, Libya, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea, and the Coastal
West Africa countries of Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, and Togo. 
The U.S. government is investing resources, including through the
Prevention and Stabilization Fund, to bolster these country and
region-specific plans.   
  
In line with the vision and goals of this landmark Act, the Strategy and
resulting plans seek to break the costly cycle of instability and
promote peaceful, resilient nations that become strong economic and
security partners.  The work ahead focuses on four goals:  prevention,
stabilization, partnerships, and management.  These plans embody an
integrated, whole-of-government approach that seeks to harness the full
range of U.S. tools across new and existing diplomatic, defense, and
development programs.  Through partnerships, analysis, and adaptive
learning, the Strategy and these plans aim to address drivers of
conflict with a long-term view to support partner countries’ efforts to
forge a more peaceful future. 

-   **Partnerships: ** The Strategy and these plans reflect a commitment
    to innovate how the U.S. government works with partners to advance
    shared interests in conflict prevention and stabilization.  They
    were developed through leadership from the field and emphasize
    forging partnerships at the national and local levels.
-   **Analysis:**  In the development of these plans, the United States
    recognized and assessed a diverse set of resiliencies and
    challenges.  The plans outline an initial assessment of complex and
    multifaceted drivers of violence and instability and will rely on
    data-informed analysis throughout their implementation.
-   **Learning:**  Over the long term, the United States will utilize
    rigorous monitoring and evaluation to document lessons learned and
    guide decisions.  The tools used will provide information to further
    assess progress towards key milestones while informing programmatic
    changes and strategic pivots.

**Country and Region Partnerships**  
The United States is advancing this Strategy through increased
engagement and partnerships in the priority partner countries and
region.  U.S. government interagency teams conducted broad-ranging
consultations with national and local leaders, including women, youth,
and civil society members, to guide these planned partnerships.  On
March 24, 2023, President Biden transmitted to Congress 10-year plans
for advancing our joint efforts, including by aligning and expanding
resources for conflict prevention and stabilization.  Specifically:

-   In **Coastal West Africa**, the United States aims to work with
    partners at all levels to prevent the destabilizing expansion of
    terrorism and violent extremism.  The United States is pursuing an
    integrated approach to governance and security in support of
    African-led initiatives and aligning our efforts with the plans of
    national governments, which take a holistic approach to mitigating
    conflict risks and vulnerabilities and strengthening social
    cohesion.
-   In **Haiti**, the United States aims to foster stabilization in
    communities impacted by violence while systematically addressing
    underlying drivers of conflict over time and mitigating the impact
    of future climate shocks.  The United States aims to build on
    mechanisms for consultations with a broad range of Haitian
    stakeholders to support locally driven peace and stability.
-   In **Libya**, the United States is focusing on laying the groundwork
    for an elected national government capable of governing, providing
    services, and maintaining security throughout the country.  The
    United States is pursuing a flexible, adaptive approach focused on
    community-level programs that can be scaled up as opportunities
    arise to support national elections; access to security, justice,
    accountability, and reconciliation; and pre-disarmament,
    demobilization, and reintegration efforts. 
-   In **Mozambique**, the United States supports the national
    government’s plans to promote reconciliation, inclusive and
    sustainable development, and resilience in historically marginalized
    and conflict-affected areas.  This includes efforts to counter
    vulnerabilities to terrorism, bolster recovery from its impacts, and
    address the root causes of instability in the north.  The United
    States aims to help the government and local partners foster
    pathways for inclusive economic growth to increase employment,
    especially among young Mozambicans.
-   In **Papua New Guinea**, U.S. efforts will reinforce our growing
    Pacific partnerships with a key country of the Pacific Islands.  We
    will seek to strengthen communities’ capacity to prevent and respond
    to chronic violence and conflict; support inclusive, sustainable,
    and equitable economic growth; improve justice systems; and
    professionalize the security forces.  This includes a focus on
    helping Papua New Guinean partners advance gender equity and
    equality, prevent and respond to gender-based violence, and elevate
    women peacebuilders.

Across these efforts, the U.S. government is investing heavily in
monitoring, evaluation, learning, and adaptation.  U.S. government
departments and agencies are better integrating U.S. diplomatic,
development, and defense tools and enabling more effective, accountable
partnerships.  Through these plans, the U.S. government will deepen
engagement with key stakeholders in partner countries, as well as with
civil society, multilateral and regional organizations, the private
sector, and likeminded countries that are also engaged in addressing
drivers of conflict in these priority countries and region.

*“These plans represent a meaningful, long-term commitment by the United
States to building the political and economic resilience of partner
societies by making strategic investments in prevention to mitigate the
underlying vulnerabilities that can lead to conflict and violence and
are critical to achieving lasting peace.”*

– President Joseph R. Biden, Jr.
