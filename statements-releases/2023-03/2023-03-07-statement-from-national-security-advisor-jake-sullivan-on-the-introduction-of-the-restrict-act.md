title: "Statement from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on the Introduction\
  \ of the RESTRICT\_Act"
---
 
We applaud the bipartisan group of Senators, led by Senators Warner and
Thune, who today introduced the Restricting the Emergence of Security
Threats that Risk Information and Communications Technology (RESTRICT)
Act. This legislation would empower the United States government to
prevent certain foreign governments from exploiting technology services
operating in the United States in a way that poses risks to Americans’
sensitive data and our national security.   
   
The information and communications technology products and services
supply chain is integral to the lives of Americans and the functioning
of U.S. businesses. This bill presents a systematic framework for
addressing technology-based threats to the security and safety of
Americans. This legislation would provide the U.S. government with new
mechanisms to mitigate the national security risks posed by high-risk
technology businesses operating in the United States. Critically, it
would strengthen our ability to address discrete risks posed by
individual transactions, and systemic risks posed by certain classes of
transactions involving countries of concern in sensitive technology
sectors. This will help us address the threats we face today, and also
prevent such risks from arising in the future.   
   
We look forward to continue working with both Democrats and Republicans
on this bill, and urge Congress to act quickly to send it to the
President’s desk.
