title: "President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. to Award the Medal of\_Honor"
---
 
On March 3, 2023, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., will award the Medal
of Honor to Colonel Paris D. Davis, United States Army, Retired, for
conspicuous gallantry.     
   
Then-Captain Paris D. Davis distinguished himself by acts of gallantry
and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty while serving as
Commander of Detachment A-321, 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne), 1st
Special Forces, during combat operations against an armed enemy in the
vicinity of Bong Son, Republic of Vietnam, June 17-18, 1965.  Captain
Davis, commanding an inexperienced South Vietnamese regional raiding
force, learned that a vastly superior North Vietnamese enemy force was
operating in the area. Through surprise and leadership, he gained the
tactical advantage, personally engaging and killing several enemy
soldiers.  Wounded while leading the initial assault, Captain Davis
continued moving forward, personally engaging the enemy in hand-to-hand
combat.  Launching a counterattack, the superior enemy force separated
Captain Davis from his main Regional Force Company.  Charging under the
intense enemy fire, Captain Davis personally led four others in the
destruction of enemy gun emplacements and captured more enemy personnel.
 Afterwards, Captain Davis moved to regroup his forces and break contact
with the enemy to allow his expertly guided tactical air and artillery
fire to obliterate the foe.  However, the enemy again counter-attacked
in superior numbers and Captain Davis was struck by automatic weapons
fire.  So close was the charging enemy soldier that shot him, Captain
Davis engaged him in close-quarter combat and was again wounded in the
process of defeating this soldier.  Captain Davis then led his men to
reorganize into abandoned enemy fighting positions as he continued to
call for artillery and air support. Realizing two of his fellow
Americans were incapacitated and unable to move while trapped by enemy
fire, Captain Davis located their positions and moved to suppress enemy
guns and personally rescue each to the safety of the friendly Company
position.  While enacting the rescue of the first American, Captain
Davis was shot in the leg.  In great pain he continued forward and
dragged him to the Company perimeter. Captain Davis then exposed himself
again to the intense enemy fire to rescue the second American, crawling
150 yards to complete the rescue while being hit by enemy grenade
fragments.  After rescuing the second fellow American, Captain Davis
then personally directed the helicopter extraction for the wounded, but
refused medical extraction for himself.  Captain Davis continued to
engage the enemy until all members of his Company were extracted.  He
remained on the battlefield to continue personal coordination of
tactical air and artillery fire, ensuring the destruction of the enemy
force.   
   
   
**PERSONAL BACKGROUND**:  
   
Paris Davis was commissioned a Reserve Component officer on June 1,
1959, and received Airborne and Ranger qualifications in 1960, and
Special Forces qualification in 1962.  His initial overseas tours
included Korea, Vietnam (1962-1963), and Okinawa, Japan.  Then-Captain
Davis performed multiple heroic acts during his second tour in Vietnam
(April 1965 to October 1965), during which he received the Silver Star,
Bronze Star Medal with “V” device, Purple Heart with one Bronze Oak Leaf
Cluster, and the Air Medal with “V” device.  He received a Master of
Science degree from Southern Illinois University in 1973, and a Master
of Public Administration and Doctorate from Northern Virginia University
in 1977.  After retiring from military service July 30, 1985, he went on
to publish a small newspaper in Virginia.  A resident of Arlington
County, Virginia, Colonel Davis was inducted into the Ranger Hall of
Fame in 2019.
