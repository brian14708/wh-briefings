title: "FACT SHEET: White\_House Honors Transgender Day of\_Visibility"
---
 
Today, in honor of Transgender Day of Visibility, the Biden-Harris
Administration is uplifting transgender communities—and especially
transgender kids and their families—by celebrating their resilience in
the face of hateful anti-transgender laws being advanced across the
country. Since President Biden’s first day in office, the Administration
has taken historic steps to advance equality, dignity, and safety for
transgender Americans, and he is the first President in history to
discuss the importance of expanding equality and combating attacks on
the rights of transgender Americans in every State of the Union or joint
session of Congress address. While transgender Americans have an
unwavering champion in the President, conservative politicians have
advanced hundreds of anti-transgender laws in states across the country
so far this year, putting the fundamental rights and freedoms of trans
Americans at risk. As President Biden has said, transgender Americans
are some of the bravest people he knows, but nobody should have to be
brave to be themselves.  
  
Over half of transgender youth say they have seriously considered
suicide in the last year because of the discrimination and rejection
they face. In the face of these challenges, research shows that, when
transgender youth are affirmed and supported, they thrive. Today, to
hear directly about the joys, hopes, and challenges that transgender
children are experiencing, the White House will host a Roundtable on
Affirming Transgender Kids. Transgender kids and their parents shared
their experiences living in states that have attacked their rights,
discussed how these laws have impacted their mental health, and
highlighted how parents are protecting their children.  
  
Today, the Biden Administration is announcing additional steps to
support transgender Americans:

-   **Issuing a landmark report on ways to support and affirm LGBTQI+
    youth, especially transgender youth.** Today, the Substance Abuse
    and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is releasing a
    [new
    report](https://store.samhsa.gov/product/moving-beyond-change-efforts/pep22-03-12-001)
    providing the latest scientific research on supporting the mental
    health of LGBTQI+ youth. With the release of today’s report, SAMHSA
    is providing new resources to parents, teachers, and mental health
    providers to help them use evidence-based practices to affirm and
    support transgender and LGBTQI+ youth and their families. SAMHSA
    finds that:  
    -   There is conclusive scientific evidence that affirming a
        transgender or LGBTQI+ child’s identity is vital to protecting
        their mental health.  
    -   When transgender children have access to affirming environments,
        at home and at school, that are free from discrimination,
        rejection, and bullying, they are resilient and can thrive. When
        transgender children can access gender-affirming care – which
        includes counseling and mental health supports – their wellbeing
        improves.  
    -   In spite of the overwhelming scientific evidence that affirming
        an LGBTQI+ child is in their best interest, LGBTQI+ children –
        especially transgender children – face a nationwide mental
        health crisis because of the harassment, rejection, bullying,
        and discrimination they face. LGBTQI+ youth are at significantly
        increased risk of suicide when they face rejection and trauma.  
    -   State-level policies that stigmatize transgender children, for
        example by denying them access to medically necessary health
        care or banning schools from using LGBTQI+ inclusive curriculum,
        contribute to worse mental health outcomes for children and put
        them at increased risk of bullying and attempted suicide.  
    -   There is a clear consensus view among mental health experts that
        attempts to suppress or change a child’s sexual orientation or
        gender identity – often referred to as so-called “conversion
        therapy” – are harmful, not supported by credible evidence, and
        should never be practiced.  
-   **Issuing guidance on gender identity inclusion for public
    servants.** The Federal government most effectively delivers for the
    American people when our public servants draw from the diversity of
    the communities they serve. Today, the Office of Personnel
    Management released an update
    to [guidance](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility/reference-materials/guidance-regarding-gender-identity-and-inclusion-in-the-federal-workplace.pdf)
    on gender inclusion in the federal workplace to help ensure agencies
    fully follow existing federal policies and antidiscrimination laws,
    and to help agencies adopt inclusive practices to foster a welcoming
    and supportive workplace for applicants and employees of all gender
    identities across the Federal government. 

**Today’s announcements build on the Biden-Harris Administration’s
historic work to advance equality for transgender Americans since taking
office, including:**  
  
**Supporting transgender kids and their parents, and responding to state
attacks on their rights.** As the President has said to transgender kids
at each of his State of the Union addresses, he is standing up for
transgender kids and their families by:

-   **Signing a historic Executive Order to advance equality for LGBTQI+
    people, especially children and families.** President Biden signed a
    historic [Executive Order on Advancing Equality LGBTQI+
    Individuals,](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/06/15/executive-order-on-advancing-equality-for-lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender-queer-and-intersex-individuals/)
    establishing that it is the Administration’s policy to defend the
    rights and safety of LGBTQI+ individuals. In the Executive Order,
    the President directs relevant agencies to: address the dangerous
    and discredited practice of so-called “conversion therapy”; end
    disparities that LGBTQI+ children and parents face in the child
    welfare and foster care system; ensure that federal benefits
    programs are equitably accessible to LGBTQI+ households; address the
    overrepresentation of LGBTQI+ youth and households among those
    experiencing homelessness; and increase federal support for programs
    that offer family counseling and support to reduce the risk of
    family rejection of LGBTQI+ youth.  
-   **Intervening legally when states violate the rights of transgender
    youth and their families.** The Department of Justice (DOJ) has
    filed multiple statements of interest and amicus briefs supporting
    litigation against state laws that restrict the rights of
    transgender youth. For example, DOJ is challenging an Alabama law
    that denies necessary medical care to transgender youth based solely
    on who they are. DOJ also filed statements of interest in support of
    litigation challenging laws in
    [Arkansas](https://www.justice.gov/file/1405411/download) and [West
    Virginia](https://www.justice.gov/crt/case-document/file/1405541/download)
    that ban transgender children from accessing necessary health care
    and playing on sports teams, respectively, as unlawful. DOJ also
    filed *amicus* briefs supporting the rights of transgender
    individuals in federal courts of appeals cases involving matters in
    [Alabama](https://www.justice.gov/crt/case-document/file/1423426/download),
    [Arkansas](https://www.justice.gov/crt/case-document/file/1468236/download),
    [Georgia](https://www.justice.gov/crt/case-document/file/1556831/download),
    and
    [Indiana](https://www.justice.gov/crt/case-document/file/1447706/download). 
    In addition, DOJ reaffirmed that transgender youth in all states
    have federal constitutional and statutory protections, including in
    access to gender-affirming health care.  
-   **Expanding mental health resources for transgender youth.** The
    Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)
    launched a pilot program to add dedicated services for LGBTQI+ youth
    to the national 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, the nationwide
    suicide prevention and crisis hotline. The pilot helps LGBTQI+
    youth, including transgender youth, experiencing a behavioral health
    crisis to connect with a counselor specifically focused on meeting
    the needs of LGBTQI+ youth and young adults.  
-   **Clarifying that LGBTQI+ youth are entitled to support and
    affirmation in the child welfare system.** In response to at least
    one state launching child abuse investigations into the loving
    families of transgender children, President Biden
    [condemned](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/02/statement-by-president-biden-on-texas-attacks-on-transgender-youth/)
    these investigations as callous government overreach that threatens
    families. In addition, the Department of Health and Human Services
    released guidance to state child welfare agencies through
    an [Information
    Memorandum.](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/cb/policy-guidance/im-22-01)
    This memorandum makes clear that states cannot weaponize their child
    welfare systems against loving families, and should instead use
    their child welfare systems to advance safety and support for
    LGBTQI+ youth, which importantly can include access to
    gender-affirming care. Finally, HHS worked with partners to launch
    [a web
    portal](https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/systemwide/diverse-populations/lgbtq/equity-eo/)
    of resources for child welfare personnel to support families of
    children who identify as LGBTQI+.  
-   **Supporting transgender students in our nation’s schools.**
    President Biden signed an [Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/08/executive-order-on-guaranteeing-an-educational-environment-free-from-discrimination-on-the-basis-of-sex-including-sexual-orientation-or-gender-identity/) recommitting
    the Federal Government to fully abide by federal laws that guarantee
    educational environments free from sex discrimination, including
    discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender
    identity. The Department of Education has affirmed that federal
    civil rights laws protect all students, including transgender and
    other LGBTQI+ students, from discrimination, and reaffirmed its
    commitment to vigorously enforcing those laws. The Department of
    Justice, Department of Education, and Department of Health and Human
    Services issued a joint
    [message](https://www.justice.gov/opa/video/back-school-message-transgender-students-us-department-justice-us-department-education-and) for
    transgender students about their rights.

**Strengthening civil rights protections.** The Biden-Harris
Administration has strengthened civil rights protections for transgender
Americans by:

-   **Directing agencies to strengthen LGBTQI+ rights.** Within hours of
    taking office, President Biden signed an [Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-preventing-and-combating-discrimination-on-basis-of-gender-identity-or-sexual-orientation/) establishing
    that it is the official policy of the Biden-Harris Administration to
    prevent and combat discrimination against LGBTQI+ individuals. As a
    result of that Executive Order, federal agencies  committed to
    enforcing civil rights protections for LGBTQI+ Americans in
    federally funded housing, health care, education, employment, credit
    and lending, nutrition, and criminal justice programs.  
-   **Signing the Respect for Marriage Act.** President Biden championed
    and signed the Respect for Marriage Act into law, requiring that
    same-sex and interracial marriages be recognized as legal in every
    state in the nation.  
-   **Fighting for passage of the Equality Act.** President
    Biden [continues to
    call](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/25/fact-sheet-the-equality-act-will-provide-long-overdue-civil-rights-protections-for-millions-of-americans/) on
    Congress to pass the Equality Act, legislation which will confirm
    long overdue explicit federal civil rights protections to LGBTQI+
    Americans and their families.

**Ensuring transgender Americans can access accurate IDs and vital
government services.** The Biden-Harris Administration is working to
ensure that transgender Americans have equal access to important
government services by:

-   **Offering U.S. passports with a gender-neutral marker.** U.S.
    citizens can [now
    select](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/need-passport/selecting-your-gender-marker.html)
    an “X” as their gender marker on U.S. passports, providing accurate
    identification for all Americans regardless of their gender
    identity, and supporting transgender and non-binary Americans who
    live in states with restrictive ID laws.  
-   **Improving the travel experience for transgender people.** The
    Department of Homeland Security implemented several [important
    reforms](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2022/03/31/dhs-announces-new-measures-better-serve-transgender-non-binary-and-gender-non)
    to improve safety, privacy, and dignity for transgender travelers in
    U.S. airports.  
-   **Ensuring transgender Americans can access their retirement
    savings.** The Social Security Administration
    [removed](https://blog.ssa.gov/self-attestation-is-the-right-step-for-the-social-security-administration/)
    the requirement that transgender people show proof of identity, such
    as doctor’s notes, in order to update their gender information in
    their social security record, adopting a policy of self-attestation
    of gender.  
-   **Helping nonbinary workers who file employment discrimination
    complaints.** The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
    (EEOC)
    [implemented](https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/eeoc-adds-x-gender-marker-voluntary-questions-during-charge-intake-process)
    changes to make it easier for non-binary workers to accurately
    identify their gender identity when filing a charge of workplace
    discrimination.

**Supporting transgender service members and veterans.** President Biden
has restored and strengthened protections for transgender service
members and veterans by:

-   **Reversing the discriminatory ban on transgender
    servicemembers.** In his first week in office, President Biden
    [reversed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/25/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-executive-order-enabling-all-qualified-americans-to-serve-their-country-in-uniform/)
    the ban on transgender servicemembers serving openly in the Armed
    Forces, enabling all qualified Americans to proudly serve their
    country in uniform.  
-   **Supporting transgender veterans.** The Department of Veterans
    Affairs (VA) launched an [agency-wide
    review](https://blogs.va.gov/VAntage/85152/secretary-orders-review-vas-transgender-policies/) of
    its policies and practices to ensure that transgender veterans do
    not face barriers in VA programs because of their gender identity or
    expression. The VA intends to remove restrictions that prevent
    transgender veterans from accessing gender-affirming care.  
-   **Ending restrictions for service members living with HIV.** The
    Department of Defense
    [updated](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3055795/department-of-defense-updates-policy-on-hiv-positive-service-members/)
    its policy on service members living with HIV, ending the long-time
    ban on their ability to deploy and commission.

**Addressing the crisis of homelessness among transgender Americans.**
The Biden-Harris Administration is working to ensure that all people,
regardless of gender identity, can access safe and affordable housing
by:

-   **Enforcing fair housing protections that prohibit discrimination on
    the basis of sex, including gender identity.** The Department of
    Housing and Urban Development
    (HUD) [clarified](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/PA/documents/HUD_Memo_EO13988.pdf)
    that it would administer and enforce the Fair Housing Act to
    prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, including gender
    identity and sexual orientation. HUD is actively enforcing the Fair
    Housing Act. For example, HUD
    [announced](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_22_160)
    that it entered into a Consent Order with a housing owner and
    property manager to resolve allegations of gender identity
    discrimination made by a transgender tenant.  
-   **Promoting safe and equal access to housing and shelter for
    transgender people.**  HUD’s [Equal Access
    Rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2012/02/03/2012-2343/equal-access-to-housing-in-hud-programs-regardless-of-sexual-orientation-or-gender-identity)
    requires equal access to HUD housing programs – including HUD-funded
    homeless shelters, housing providers and housing subject to
    HUD-insured mortgages – regardless of a person’s sexual orientation,
    gender identity, or marital status. HUD has released
    [materials](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/housing_discrimination_and_persons_identifying_lgbtq)
    to help people know their rights, and help [housing and shelter
    providers](https://files.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/Equal-Access-for-Transgender-People-Supporting-Inclusive-Housing-and-Shelters.pdf)
    ensure that transgender and gender non-conforming people are able to
    safely access shelter and housing.

**Advancing health equity and expanding access to gender-affirming
health care.** The Biden-Harris Administration is advancing health
equity for transgender Americans by:

-   **Protecting transgender patients from health care
    discrimination.** The Department of Health and Human Services is
    working to ensure that section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act—which
    prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex—is interpreted and
    enforced in a way that protects LGBTQI+ Americans from
    discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. The
    Department is working to finalize implementing regulations to codify
    these protections.  
-   **Bolstering access to gender-affirming care**. The Centers for
    Medicare and Medicaid Services
    (CMS) [approved](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/10/12/biden-harris-administration-greenlights-coverage-of-lgbtqplus-care-as-an-essential-health-benefit-in-colorado.html) Colorado’s
    efforts to enhance access to comprehensive gender-affirming care in
    the state’s essential health benefit benchmark plan under the
    Affordable Care Act. The Health Resources and Services
    Administration [released a
    letter](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/03/25/icymi-hrsa-promotes-access-gender-affirming-care-and-treatment-in-ryan-white-hiv-aids-program.html) encouraging
    Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program service providers to provide access to
    gender-affirming care and treatment services to transgender and
    gender diverse individuals with HIV.  
-   **Combatting HIV among transgender and gender diverse
    communities.** The White House Office of National AIDS Policy
    launched a revised [National HIV/AIDS
    Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/National-HIV-AIDS-Strategy.pdf) and
    includes transgender and gender diverse communities as a priority
    population in the federal government’s strategy to end the HIV
    epidemic. And the Health Resources and Services Administration
    [released a
    letter](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hhs.gov%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2022%2F03%2F25%2Ficymi-hrsa-promotes-access-gender-affirming-care-and-treatment-in-ryan-white-hiv-aids-program.html&data=05%7C01%7CSteven.Lopez%40hhs.gov%7C7432a03750f54301904508db2fcb54c7%7Cd58addea50534a808499ba4d944910df%7C0%7C0%7C638156322592281695%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=bZN8%2B2A%2Fe6HrhbUDWfpqONBiSXLIlq69PWjb5dKVCfQ%3D&reserved=0) encouraging
    Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program service providers to provide access to
    gender affirming care and treatment services to transgender and
    gender diverse individuals with HIV.  
-   **Partnering with transgender communities to end the mpox
    outbreak.** To end the mpox outbreak, the White House National Mpox
    Response Team partnered with transgender-led organizations to
    improve access to services and vaccines for transgender and other
    gender diverse communities. The Administration also utilized
    flexibilities in HIV treatment and prevention, sexual health, mental
    health, and housing programs that increased access to mpox treatment
    and prevention for transgender people where they seek care and
    services.  
-   **Ensuring transgender patients can access birth control and other
    reproductive health care, including cancer screenings and treatment
    for HIV and other STIs.** The Department of Health and Human
    Services strengthened the Title X family planning program by issuing
    new rules that requires family planning projects to provide
    inclusive care to LGBTQI+ persons, and prohibits discrimination
    against any client based on their sex, sexual orientation, gender
    identity, sex characteristics, or marital status.  
-   **Providing health resources for transgender youth and their
    parents.** The Department of Health and Human Services has issued
    new resources to support the health of transgender youth, including
    by providing a [resource
    guide](https://opa.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/2022-03/gender-affirming-care-young-people-march-2022.pdf)
    on gender-affirming care for youth and launching a [new
    website](http://www.hhs.gov/lgbtqi) that offers resources for
    transgender and LGBTQI+ youth, their parents, and providers.

**Addressing anti-transgender violence.** The Biden-Harris
Administration is working to end the crisis of violence against
transgender Americans – which disproportionately impacts transgender
women and girls of color – by:

-   **Establishing a White House-led interagency working group on
    anti-transgender violence.** The White House established the first
    Interagency Working Group on Safety, Opportunity, and Inclusion for
    Transgender and Gender Diverse Individuals, which released a
    [roadmap](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Report_Memorializing-Transgender-Day-of-Remembrance_FINAL-002.pdf) highlighting
    45 key actions the Biden-Harris Administration is taking to address
    the root causes of anti-transgender violence, discrimination, and
    denial of economic opportunity.  
-   **Increasing services for LGBTQI+ survivors of domestic violence.**
    The President championed and signed into law the reauthorization of
    the Violence Against Women Act, which [increases
    services](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/16/fact-sheet-reauthorization-of-the-violence-against-women-act-vawa/)
    specifically for LGBTQ+ survivors of domestic violence, dating
    violence, sexual assault and stalking.  
-   **Department of Justice civil rights enforcement actions.**  In
    addition to the Alabama litigation reference above, the Department
    of Justice announced that it was launching a statewide civil
    investigation into conditions of confinement of prisoners held in
    Georgia’s prisons, including an investigation of the prisons’
    efforts to protect transgender and intersex prisoners from sexual
    abuse by other prisoners and staff.  
-   **Ensuring non-discrimination protections in community safety
    programs.** The Department of Justice announced new steps to ensure
    that prohibitions against sex discrimination contained in key
    community safety programs, including the Safe Streets Act, the
    Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, and the Victims of
    Crime Act also protect transgender individuals from discrimination
    based on their gender identity.  
-   **Strengthening protections for transgender individuals who are
    incarcerated.** The Bureau of Prisons revised its [manual on serving
    transgender
    offenders](https://www.bop.gov/policy/progstat/5200-08-cn-1.pdf),
    improving access to gender-affirming care and access to facility
    placements that align with an inmate’s gender identity.  
-   **Addressing online harassment and abuse against transgender
    people.** President Biden established a White House Task Force to
    Address Online Harassment and Abuse to
    [coordinate](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/03/executive-summary-initial-blueprint-for-the-white-house-task-force-to-address-online-harassment-and-abuse/)
    a federal response to address the online threats and harms that
    disproportionately impact women, girls, and LGBTQI+ people –
    including LGBTQI+ youth.  
-   **Advancing safety and justice for transgender and Two-Spirit
    Indigenous people.** President Biden signed an [Executive
    Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/11/15/executive-order-on-improving-public-safety-and-criminal-justice-for-native-americans-and-addressing-the-crisis-of-missing-or-murdered-indigenous-people/) to
    address the crisis of Missing or Murdered Indigenous People,
    including LGBTQI+ and Two-Spirit Native Americans.  
-   **Honoring transgender Americans lost to violence.** President Biden
    [established](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/06/25/remarks-by-president-biden-in-bill-signing-of-h-r-49-to-designate-the-national-pulse-memorial-into-law/)
    the National Pulse Memorial to honor the lives lost, including
    transgender Americans, at the Pulse nightclub shooting and to raise
    awareness about the impact of gun violence on LGBTQI+ communities.
    The Administration also hosted a first ever
    [vigil](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/20/biden-harris-administration-memorializes-transgender-day-of-remembrance/)
    at the White House to honor the lives of transgender and gender
    diverse people lost to anti-trans violence.

**Advancing transgender equality at home and around the world.** The
Biden-Harris Administration has made LGBTQI+ equality a cornerstone of
the U.S. government’s foreign policy priorities by:

-   **Advancing transgender equality in U.S. foreign policy and foreign
    assistance.** President Biden signed a [Presidential Memorandum on
    Advancing the Human Rights of LGBTQI+ Persons Around the
    World](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/04/memorandum-advancing-the-human-rights-of-lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender-queer-and-intersex-persons-around-the-world/),
    directing agencies engaged abroad to ensure that United States
    diplomacy and foreign assistance promote and protect the human
    rights of LGBTQI+ people.   
-   **Ensuring that the U.S. global response to gender-based violence is
    trans-inclusive.** The Department of State and the U.S. Agency for
    International Development released the 2022 U.S. Strategy to Prevent
    and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally, directing U.S.
    foreign policy and assistance to address the factors that increase
    the risks of gender-based violence and undermine access to services
    and safety, and to address the unique ways that LGBTQI+ people, and
    especially transgender people, are at risk of gender-based
    violence.  
-   **Releasing a USAID Gender Policy that is inclusive of transgender
    and gender diverse communities.**  USAID released its [2023 Gender
    Equality and Women’s Empowerment
    Policy](https://www.usaid.gov/gender-policy#:~:text=USAID%20affirms%20that%20gender%20equality,effective%20and%20sustainable%20development%20outcomes.),
    which provides the vision for USAID’s work to advance gender
    equality and women’s empowerment around the world.  The policy
    recognizes women and girls in all their diversity and that
    transgender women, gender diverse individuals, and the entire
    LGBTQI+ community experience multiple forms of discrimination.  
-   **Supporting trans-led organizations and individuals.**  USAID
    launched the [Alliance for Global
    Equality](https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/Alliance-for-Global-Equality-Fact-Sheet_1.pdf)
    to respond to the economic devastation from COVID-19 and build the
    capacity of social leaders to engage in democratic processes. 
    Twenty-five percent of all grants issued by the Alliance will go to
    trans- and intersex-led organizations.   
-   **Hosting the UN Independent Expert on Sexual Orientation and Gender
    Identity for an Official Visit to the United States.** The United
    States hosted the UN Independent Expert on Sexual Orientation and
    Gender Identity for an official visit to the United States to
    address discrimination and violence against the LGBTQI+ community. 

**Supporting transgender public servants.** The Biden-Harris
Administration is ensuring that transgender Americans are leaders at all
levels of our government by:

-   **Supporting a federal workplace where all employees’ gender
    identities and expressions are affirmed and respected without fear
    of discrimination, retribution or disadvantage.** In June
    2021, President Biden signed an [Executive
    Order](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.whitehouse.gov%2Fbriefing-room%2Fpresidential-actions%2F2021%2F06%2F25%2Fexecutive-order-on-diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility-in-the-federal-workforce%2F&data=05%7C01%7CMahri.Monson%40opm.gov%7C568ae86a0c6f4b78878b08db2f98ddcc%7C844ef9977b6348f0882a7dc8162e363b%7C0%7C0%7C638156105858034600%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=tWfRs3hkoAwKhFjIIdYAWp1xOblHRNYiyMSbm7at3w8%3D&reserved=0) directing historic
    new steps to ensure the Federal government is a model employer for
    all Americans and individuals of all gender identities, including
    transgender, gender non-conforming, and non-binary employees.  
-   **Appointing historic transgender leaders.** The Biden-Harris
    Administration includes barrier-breaking transgender leaders,
    including the two first openly transgender people to ever be
    confirmed by the U.S. Senate: Assistant Secretary for Health Dr.
    Rachel Levine, and Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness
    Shawn Skelly.

**Ensuring transgender Americans are counted in federal data.** The
Biden-Harris Administration is improving the collection of data on
gender identity and sexual orientation – while respecting the privacy
and safety of transgender Americans – by:

-   **Releasing a roadmap to improve LGBTQI+ data collection.** The
    Administration
    [released ](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Federal-Evidence-Agenda-on-LGBTQI-Equity.pdf)the
    first-ever [Federal Evidence
    Agenda](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2023/01/24/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-releases-first-ever-federal-evidence-agenda-on-lgbtqi-equity/)
    on LGBTQI+ Equity, a roadmap that federal agencies will use to
    ensure they are collecting the data and evidence they need to
    improve the lives of transgender and other LGBTQI+ Americans.  
-   **Adding gender identity questions to vital surveys.** The
    Administration has increased funding to add sexual orientation and
    gender identity questions to the Census Bureau’s American Community
    Survey, one of our nation’s largest and most important surveys of
    American households.

**Promoting visibility and inclusion for transgender Americans.**
President Biden became the first U.S. President to issue
a [proclamation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/31/a-proclamation-on-transgender-day-of-visibility-2021/) commemorating
Transgender Day of Visibility. The White House has consistently uplifted
the voices and stories of transgender Americans. The White House Press
Secretary hosted a first-of-its-kind [national
conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WsnZUAXJLA) on equality
with transgender, gender non-conforming, and non-binary Americans, and
the White House released a
[toolkit](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Trans-Equality-Toolkit_REFORMAT-2_WHCO-fix.pdf) with
best practices for advancing inclusion, opportunity, and safety for
transgender Americans. In 2022, Ashton Mota, a teenager and advocate for
transgender rights, introduced President Biden at the White House’s
Pride celebration.
