  \ Partnership with\_Zambia"
---
 
The United States and Zambia maintain a strong relationship based on
shared democratic values, growing commercial engagement, longstanding
health cooperation, and enduring people-to-people ties.  The United
States applauds Zambia’s leadership in the region toward transparent and
accountable governance as the recent African co-host of President
Biden’s Second Summit for Democracy.   
   
The Vice President’s travel to Lusaka demonstrates the United States’
commitment to advancing our cooperation with Zambia.  This includes a
renewed focus on economic transformation; increased investments in
democracy and governance programming; expanded global health efforts;
and innovations in climate solutions.  In support of this important
bilateral relationship, the Administration intends to provide more than
$505 million in fiscal year (FY) 2024 bilateral assistance.    
   
As part of her visit, the Vice President is announcing the following
U.S. plans, working with Congress as appropriate.  She will also
highlight additional resources requested in the FY 2024 President’s
Budget.  
   
**<u>Strengthening Commercial Engagement</u>**

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">U.S.-Zambia MOU on
    Commercial Development:</span>  On April 3, Zambia’s Ministry of
    Commerce, Trade and Industry and the U.S. Department of Commerce
    intend to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to develop and
    implement commercial projects of strategic priority.  This MOU
    outlines the intentions of each respective government, contains
    commitments from departments and agencies across the U.S.
    government, and will lead to the development of a roadmap for
    business climate improvements and a project list for increasing
    U.S.-Zambia trade.  The Department of Commerce currently maintains
    such MOUs with five other African countries:  Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana,
    Kenya, Mozambique, and Tunisia.

  
**<u>Investing in Democratic Institutions and Good Governance</u>**

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Partnership for Democratic
    Development: </span> The U.S. Agency for International Development
    (USAID) plans to provide $10 million to support the Government of
    the Republic of Zambia and non-government stakeholder efforts to
    promote democratic and accountable local governance.  This program
    will advance anti-corruption and transparency through expanded
    support to local governments—in line with Zambia’s decentralization
    implementation plan.

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Political Accountability
    and Leadership Project:  </span>USAID plans to provide $3.5 million
    to support Zambian civil society to implement reforms and oversight
    activities that will deepen Zambia’s democratic processes and
    support women’s political participation.  The program will promote
    electoral integrity by fostering greater independence, transparency,
    and effectiveness for the Electoral Commission of Zambia and improve
    the enabling environment for women in politics.

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Strengthening Good
    Financial Governance: </span> USAID plans to participate in a new
    four-year Strengthening Good Financial Governance project with the
    Government of the Republic of Zambia to strengthen its financial
    management systems.  The United States will contribute $3 million to
    this program.

  
**<u>Bolstering Health Cooperation</u>**

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Continuing PEPFAR
    Investments: </span> The President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief
    (PEPFAR) program celebrated its 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary this
    year.  The U.S. government has provided over $5.2 billion to support
    Zambia’s national HIV response since 2002.  These investments have
    helped increase Zambia’s average life expectancy by 20 years and
    currently provide nearly 90 percent of the funding for the Zambian
    national HIV response, including for the provision of life-saving
    HIV medication to over 1.2 million Zambians.  Over the next two
    years, the United States plans to deploy more than $372.1 million in
    appropriated funding and has requested an additional $387.9 million
    in the President’s FY2024 Budget to be provided during this
    timeframe to continue this support, subject to the availability of
    appropriations.  In addition, the U.S. Government plans to support
    the Zambian healthcare system by providing equitable access to
    high-quality, client-centered, integrated health services.

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Malaria Investments through
    the U.S. President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI): </span> PMI plans to
    invest $28 million over the next year in partnership with the
    Government of Zambia to deploy lifesaving interventions proven to
    fight malaria, including bed nets, fast acting malaria medicines,
    rapid diagnostic tests, and preventative treatments in pregnancy.
    These funds will also support stronger, more resilient health
    systems by training health workers, strengthening supply chains, and
    improving data monitoring.

<!-- -->

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Global Health Security:
    </span> Through the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and USAID, the
    U.S. Government intends to provide approximately $17 million over
    the next three years (Fiscal Years 2022-2024 funds), pending the
    availability of appropriations and final allocations, to support
    efforts to enhance global health security and pandemic preparedness.
    The President’s FY 2024 Budget includes an additional $8 million in
    USAID funding for this purpose, requested to be provided during this
    timeframe.  Zambia is a new U.S. Government global health security
    intensive support country with activities beginning with FY 2022
    funds.  This effort will support Zambia to implement effective risk
    communication for public awareness of pandemic threats and prevent,
    detect, and respond to zoonotic disease pathogens.  Funding will
    support communities to identify and mitigate risks for the spread of
    infectious diseases between animals and humans; improve community
    surveillance systems to quickly identify and respond to emerging
    health threats, and strengthen laboratory capacity to safely,
    accurately, and quickly detect prioritized infectious diseases.

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Inclusive COVID-19 Response
    and Recovery: </span> The Department of State will launch the
    “Mobilizing Disability and Human Rights Leaders for Inclusive
    COVID-19 Response and Recovery” initiative with a $1 million
    investment.  This initiative will promote diversity within political
    organizing efforts, reinforce accountability for COVID-19 responses,
    and facilitate inclusive policymaking and crisis prevention in
    Africa.  The project works with local partners in Kenya, Malawi,
    Nigeria, and Zambia to empower organizations of people with
    disabilities, including organizations led by women leaders with
    disabilities.  It also helps participants to build relationships
    with the broader human rights community, define common priorities,
    and develop their advocacy and organizing skills to take collective
    action.

  
**<u>Promoting Innovative Food Security, Energy, and Climate
Solutions</u>**

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Launch of Fertilizer
    Fund:</span>  USAID and Prosper Africa’s flagship Africa Trade and
    Investment (ATI) project plan to provide $1.5 million to launch a
    new Fertilizer Fund in Zambia to address the impacts of Russia’s war
    in Ukraine and the global food security crisis by helping farmers
    access alternatives to Russian-sourced fertilizer.  This Fertilizer
    Fund would also help to facilitate the movement of foodstuffs across
    borders in southern and East Africa, while responding to the global
    food crisis and increased fuel, fertilizer, and food costs across
    Africa.

<!-- -->

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline">Renewable Energy
    Infrastructure:</span>  The U.S. Trade and Development Agency
    (USTDA) will support the expansion and reliability of Zambia’s
    renewable energy infrastructure through more than $1 million in
    grant funding for a feasibility study that will help develop a
    utility-scale battery energy storage system.  USTDA’s grant would
    advance the efforts of Africa GreenCo Group, a renewable energy
    trader, to develop a 400 megawatt-hour battery energy storage system
    portfolio that would be one of the largest in Africa
