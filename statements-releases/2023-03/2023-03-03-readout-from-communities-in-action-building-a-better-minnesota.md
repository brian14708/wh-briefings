title: 'Readout from Communities in Action: Building A Better Minnesota'
---
 
On Wednesday, the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and
the Office of Public Engagement hosted over 50 state and local elected
officials and community leaders from across Minnesota at a “Communities
in Action: Building a Better Minnesota” event. This was the thirteenth
state highlighted in a series of “Communities in Action” events that the
White House hosts with state, local and Tribal leaders to demonstrate
how the Biden-Harris Administration is delivering results for the
American people.

During the half-day forum, participants heard from Biden-Harris
Administration officials – including Department of Veteran’s Affairs
Secretary Denis McDonough, Chair of the Council on Economic Quality
Brenda Mallory, White House Infrastructure Coordinator Mitch Landrieu,
White House American Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene Sperling, Senior
Advisor and Director of Public Engagement Keisha Lance Bottoms, Director
of the Domestic Policy Council Susan Rice, and Senior Advisor and
Director of Intergovernmental Affairs Julie Chavez Rodriguez – about the
benefits and impact of President Biden’s American Rescue Plan,
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act, and the CHIPS
and Science Act for working families in Minnesota. Minnesota Governor
Tim Walz provided video remarks and White House officials heard from
participants on the positive impact of these legislative
accomplishments. They also discussed how the Biden-Harris Administration
will continue to work with states and local governments, labor leaders,
businesses, non-profits, education and health care leaders to leverage
these historic investments to create and expand opportunities for
working families.
