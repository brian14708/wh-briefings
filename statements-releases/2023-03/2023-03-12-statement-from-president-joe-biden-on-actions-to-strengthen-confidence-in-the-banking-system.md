title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Actions to Strengthen Confidence in\
  \ the Banking\_System"
---
 
Over the weekend, and at my direction, the Treasury Secretary and my
National Economic Council Director worked diligently with the banking
regulators to address problems at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature
Bank. I am pleased that they reached a prompt solution that protects
American workers and small businesses, and keeps our financial system
safe. The solution also ensures that taxpayer dollars are not put at
risk.  
   
The American people and American businesses can have confidence that
their bank deposits will be there when they need them.  
   
I am firmly committed to holding those responsible for this mess fully
accountable and to continuing our efforts to strengthen oversight and
regulation of larger banks so that we are not in this position again.  
   
Tomorrow morning, I will deliver remarks on how we will maintain a
resilient banking system to protect our historic economic recovery.
