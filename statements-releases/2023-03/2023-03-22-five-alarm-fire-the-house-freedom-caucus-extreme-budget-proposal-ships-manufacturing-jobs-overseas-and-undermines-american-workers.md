title: "FIVE-ALARM FIRE: The House Freedom Caucus\u2019 Extreme Budget Proposal Ships\
  \ Manufacturing Jobs Overseas and Undermines American\_Workers"
---
 
The extreme MAGA Republican House Freedom Caucus has made their
priorities clear: imposing [devastating
cuts](https://twitter.com/freedomcaucus/status/1634205313623572480) and
increasing costs for working- and middle-class families, all to protect
and extend tax breaks skewed to the wealthy and big corporations. In
fact, their tax cuts would be [so
expensive](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/15/fact-sheet-the-congressional-republican-agenda-to-increase-the-debt-by-over-3-trillion/)
that their deep and harmful cuts **would not reduce the deficit**.  
  
That’s in sharp contrast with the President’s Budget, which invests in
America, lowers costs for families, protects and strengthens Medicare
and Social Security, and reduces the deficit by $3 trillion over 10
years, while ensuring no one making less than $400,000 per year pays a
penny more in new taxes.  
  
Combined with other commitments extreme MAGA House Republicans have
already made, **the extreme Freedom Caucus proposal will be a disaster
for families in at least five key ways**: endangering public safety,
raising costs for families, shipping manufacturing jobs overseas and
undermining American workers, weakening national security, and hurting
seniors.  
  
Last week, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
[confirmed](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2023-03/58984-spendings.pdf)
that Congressional Republicans’ budget math doesn’t add up. CBO found
that—in order to meet Congressional Republicans’ [stated
commitment](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-15/republicans-balanced-budget-aim-clashes-with-fiscal-realities#xj4y7vzkg)
to balancing the budget in 10 years without raising taxes on the wealthy
or corporations, and without cutting Social Security, Medicare, defense,
and some veterans’ benefits—Congressional Republicans would need to
*eliminate everything in the rest of the Federal budget*.  
  
**<u>The extreme MAGA Republican House Freedom Caucus proposal will be a
five-alarm fire for families—including by shipping manufacturing jobs
overseas and undermining workers.</u>** Not only would their extreme
proposal cost manufacturing jobs in communities across the country, but
it would hurt workers by making deep cuts to job training services and
preventing workers from recouping back pay that they are owed.
Meanwhile, President Biden’s economic strategy is bringing new, leading
edge supply chains to America, supporting workers and small businesses,
investing in American innovation and industries that will define the
future, and fueling a manufacturing boom that is strengthening parts of
the country that have long been left behind.  
  
**<u>The extreme MAGA Republican House Freedom Caucus proposals
will:</u>**

-   **Offshore Manufacturing Jobs.** Extreme MAGA Republicans in the
    House will send manufacturing jobs overseas, reversing the progress
    the President and Congressional Democrats have made revitalizing
    manufacturing across the country. During the President’s
    Administration, the private sector has invested more than $300
    billion in manufacturing in clean energy and semi-conductors.
    Outside estimates calculate that the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean
    energy provisions will create millions of jobs over the next ten
    years, and shovels are already hitting the ground for hundreds of
    billions in private sector investments the law has attracted. The
    MAGA House Republican plan would kill those jobs and move them
    overseas.  
-   **Undercut American Workers**. The extreme MAGA Republican House
    Freedom Caucus proposal will deny 750,000 American workers job
    training and employment services and result in 100,000 fewer workers
    gaining the opportunity of a Registered Apprenticeship.  
-   **Rob Workers of Back Pay.** Recovered wages make a real difference
    for workers struggling to pay rent, buy food, pay for child care, or
    cover gas or transportation costs to get to their jobs. By reducing
    investigations and targeted inspections, the extreme MAGA Republican
    House Freedom Caucus proposal would mean that 135,000 workers would
    lose an average of $1,000 in back wages that they are owed and would
    tilt the playing field against employers who follow the law.
