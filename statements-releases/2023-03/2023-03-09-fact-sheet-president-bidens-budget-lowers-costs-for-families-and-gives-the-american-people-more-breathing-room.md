title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden\u2019s Budget Lowers Costs for Families and Gives\
  \ the American People More Breathing\_Room"
---
 
As our economy transitions from a historically strong recovery to stable
and steady growth, the Biden-Harris Administration has remained
laser-focused on continuing to lower costs for families and giving them
more breathing room, without giving up the historic economic gains we’ve
made. While more work remains—and there could be setbacks along the
way—the United States faces the challenge of global inflation from a
position of strength and there are clear signs that the Administration’s
strategy is working. Annual inflation is lower than it was seven months
ago. Gas prices are down $1.60 since their peak last summer. And
unemployment remains at its lowest level in 54 years while take home pay
has gone up.

At the same time, the strength of America’s jobs recovery—along with the
Administration’s policies that are designed to support workers and
families—has left families more economically secure than they were
before the pandemic. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, households are now
less likely to be delinquent on their credit card bills and mortgages,
and more likely to have health insurance. A record-setting 16.3 million
people signed up for Affordable Care Act coverage this year, and the
national uninsured rate hit an all-time low last year. Families are
facing fewer evictions and foreclosures than they were before the
pandemic, and bankruptcy rates are lower as well. This economic security
is giving families peace of mind and breathing room that they didn’t
have before the pandemic. 

Thanks to the President’s Inflation Reduction Act, the Administration is
lowering costs for prescription drugs, health care, and energy for tens
of millions of Americans—all while lowering the deficit by more than
$200 billion over the next decade. And the Administration has taken a
range of significant actions to give families more breathing
room—eliminating junk fees that make it harder for families to make ends
meet, unsnarling pandemic-driven supply chain bottlenecks that increased
prices, promoting greater competition across the economy, and creating
hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs that will help rebuild our
country’s supply chains and further lower costs.

Meanwhile, Congressional Republicans have proposed actions that would
raise costs for working- and middle-class families while showering
benefits on the wealthy and big corporations. Some Congressional
Republicans have proposed repealing the Inflation Reduction Act, which
would worsen inflation, deliver billions in handouts to Big Pharma, and
increase the deficit. And they have threatened to raise costs for
seniors and families by threatening cuts to Medicare, Social Security,
and other critical programs that the American people count on—all while
proposing policies that would add $3 trillion to the debt over the next
decade.

The President’s Budget takes a very different approach—building on the
progress we’ve already made giving families more breathing room by
proposing a package of policies to lower everyday costs for the American
people, including for health insurance, prescription drugs, higher
education, child care, utilities, and more.

**LOWERS PRESCRIPTION DRUG AND HEALTH CARE COSTS**

-   **Lowers Health Care Costs.** The President believes that healthcare
    should be a right, not a privilege. With enrollment in affordable
    health coverage at an all-time high, the Budget builds on the
    remarkable success of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), by making
    permanent the average $800 per year premium cuts through expanded
    premium tax credits that the Inflation Reduction Act extended. It
    also provides Medicaid-like coverage to individuals in States that
    have not adopted Medicaid expansion under the ACA, paired with
    financial incentives to ensure States maintain their existing
    expansions. 
-   **Reduces Prescription Drug Costs for All Americans.** The Budget
    builds upon the Inflation Reduction Act to continue lowering the
    cost of prescription drugs. For Medicare, this includes further
    strengthening the newly established negotiation power by extending
    it to more drugs and bringing drugs into negotiation sooner after
    they launch. The Budget also proposes to limit Medicare Part D
    cost-sharing for high-value generic drugs for certain chronic
    conditions to no more than $2. For Medicaid, the Budget includes
    proposals to ensure Medicaid and CHIP programs are prudent
    purchasers of prescription drugs, authorizing HHS to negotiate
    supplemental drug rebates on behalf of interested States in order to
    pool purchasing power. For the commercial market, the Budget
    includes proposals to curb inflation in prescription drug prices and
    cap the prices of insulin products at $35 for a monthly
    prescription.

    it to more drugs and bringing drugs into negotiation sooner after
    they launch. The Budget also proposes to limit Medicare Part D
    cost-sharing for high-value generic drugs used for certain chronic
    conditions like hypertension and high cholesterol to no more than
    $2. For Medicaid, the Budget includes proposals to ensure Medicaid
    and CHIP programs are prudent purchasers of prescription drugs,
    authorizing HHS to negotiate supplemental drug rebates on behalf of
    interested States in order to pool purchasing power. For the
    commercial market, the Budget includes proposals to curb inflation
    in prescription drug prices and cap the prices of insulin products
    at $35 for a monthly prescription. 

**CUTS THE COSTS OF QUALITY CHILD CARE AND EDUCATION**

-   **Cuts Child Care Costs.** When families can access affordable,
    high-quality child care and free, high-quality preschool, it helps
    children learn, gives families breathing room, and grows the
    economy. The President’s Budget includes a new proposal to enable
    States to increase child care options for more than 16 million young
    children and lowers costs so that parents can afford to send their
    children to high-quality child care. The Budget also provides $9
    billion for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, an increase
    of nearly $1 billion, to expand access to quality, affordable child
    care for families across the Nation. In addition, the Budget expands
    a tax credit to encourage businesses to provide child care benefits
    to their employees.

-   **Expands Access to Free, High-Quality Preschool.** Too many
    families across America cannot access high-quality, affordable child
    care—preventing parents from working and holding back our entire
    economy. The Budget also funds a Federal-State partnership that
    provides high-quality, universal, free preschool to support healthy
    child development and ensure children enter kindergarten ready to
    succeed. Through this partnership, the Budget would dramatically
    expand access to high-quality preschool, making it available to all
    of the approximately four million four-year-old children in the
    United States. In addition, the Budget helps young children enter
    kindergarten ready to learn by providing $13.1 billion for Head
    Start, an increase of $1.1 billion over the 2023 enacted level,
    including funding to boost wages for Head Start personnel to help
    address staff shortages and prevent classroom closures. Finally, the
    Budget includes $500 million for demonstration grants to create or
    expand free, high-quality preschool in school or community-based
    settings for children in high poverty areas.

**ADDRESSES PRICE PRESSURES FOR OWNERS AND RENTERS**

-   **Increases Affordable Housing Supply to Reduce Costs.** To address
    the critical shortage of affordable housing in communities
    throughout the Nation, the Budget includes $59 billion in mandatory
    funding and tax incentives aimed at increasing the affordable
    housing supply. The Budget also includes $10 billion in mandatory
    funding to incentivize State, local, and regional jurisdictions to
    make progress in removing barriers to affordable housing
    developments, such as restrictive zoning. By expanding the supply of
    housing, the Budget would help curb cost growth across the broader
    housing market. 
-   **Reduces Costs for New Homeowners and Expands Access to
    Homeownership.** To make homeownership more affordable for
    first-time, minority, and other underserved borrowers, including
    first time borrowers and borrowers of color, the Federal Housing
    Administration (FHA) is reducing the annual mortgage insurance
    premiums new borrowers will pay by about one-third, saving the
    average FHA borrower approximately $800 in the first year of their
    mortgage loan and providing continued savings for the duration of
    the loan. The Budget also reflects a reduction in mortgage insurance
    fees for Native American borrowers in the Indian Housing Loan
    Guarantee Program, which will save borrowers over $500 on average in
    their first year. The Budget also includes $10 billion in mandatory
    funding for a new First-Generation Down Payment Assistance program
    to help address racial and ethnic homeownership and wealth gaps for
    underserved communities, as well as $100 million for a HOME down
    payment assistance pilot to expand homeownership opportunities for
    first-generation and/or low-wealth first-time homebuyers and $15
    million to increase the availability of FHA small balance mortgages.

-   **Expands Access to Affordable Rent.** The Housing Choice Voucher
    (HCV) program currently provides 2.3 million low-income families
    with rental assistance to obtain housing in the private market. The
    Budget provides $32.7 billion to maintain services for all currently
    assisted families and expand assistance to an additional 50,000
    households, particularly those who are experiencing homelessness or
    fleeing, or attempting to flee, domestic violence or other forms of
    gender-based violence. The Budget further expands assistance to
    another 130,000 households with funding from HCV program reserves.
    To further ensure that more households have access to safe and
    affordable housing, the Budget includes mandatory funding to support
    two populations that are particularly vulnerable to
    homelessness—youth aging out of foster care and extremely low-income
    (ELI) veterans. The Budget provides $9 billion to establish a
    housing voucher program for all 20,000 youth aging out of foster
    care annually and $13 billion to incrementally expand rental
    assistance for 450,000 ELI veteran families, paving a path to
    guaranteed assistance for all who have served the Nation and are in
    need.  In all, the Budget proposes to expand assistance to well over
    200,000 additional households.

-   **Lowers Home Energy and Water Costs.** The Budget provides $4.1
    billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP),
    building on the $13 billion provided in the Inflation Reduction Act
    to reduce energy bills for families, expand clean energy, transform
    rural power production, and create thousands of good-paying jobs for
    people across rural America. Since the Low Income Household Water
    Assistance Program (LIHWAP) expires at the end of 2023, the Budget
    proposes to expand LIHEAP funding and allow States the option to use
    a portion of their LIHEAP funds to provide water bill assistance to
    low-income households.

**REDUCES THE COST OF COLLEGE**

-   **Improves College Affordability.** To help low- and middle-income
    students overcome financial barriers to postsecondary education, the
    Budget proposes to increase the discretionary maximum Pell Grant by
    $500, providing over 6.8 million students with money for college.
    This request builds on successful bipartisan efforts to increase the
    maximum Pell Grant award by $900 over the past two years, and lays
    out a path to double the award by 2029.
-   **Expands Free Community College.** The Budget invests mandatory
    funding to expand free community college across the Nation. To lay
    the groundwork for this program, the Budget includes $500 million in
    a new discretionary grant program to provide two-years of free
    community college for students enrolled in high-quality programs
    that lead to a four-year degree or good paying jobs. In addition,
    the Budget provides mandatory funding for two years of subsidized
    tuition for students from families earning less than $125,000
    enrolled in a four-year Historically Black College and University
    (HBCU), Tribal College and University (TCCU), or Minority-Serving
    Institution (MSI).

**LOWERS COSTS ON EVERYDAY GOODS BY STRENGTHENING SUPPLY CHAINS**

-   **Moves Goods More Quickly through the Nation’s Ports and
    Waterways.** The Budget continues support for modernizing America’s
    port and waterway infrastructure initiated under the Bipartisan
    Infrastructure Law—helping further address cost pressures. The
    Budget includes $230 million for the Port Infrastructure Development
    Program to strengthen maritime freight capacity.  In addition to
    keeping the Nation’s supply chain moving by improving efficiency,
    DOT would prioritize projects that also lower emissions—reducing
    environmental impact in and around the Nation’s ports.
-   **Builds and Protects a Fair and Resilient Food Supply Chain.** The
    Budget supports ongoing actions to develop more diverse, robust, and
    resilient local and regional supply chains by targeting funding to
    increase the production capacity among smaller producers, including
    continuing overtime user fee relief for small and very small meat
    and poultry establishments as established in the American Rescue
    Plan. The Budget complements these targeted investments by
    strengthening market oversight through the Agricultural Marketing
    Service to support fair markets and competitive meat and poultry
    product prices for American families and increasing safeguards
    against invasive pests and zoonotic diseases through the Animal and
    Plant Health Inspection Service.

**INCREASE FOOD SECURITY**

-   **Provides Critical Nutrition Assistance.** As called for in the
    National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition and Health, the Budget
    provides over $15 billion to allow more States and schools to
    leverage participation in the Community Eligibility Program and
    provide healthy and free school meals to an additional 9 million
    children. The Budget also includes $6.3 billion to support the 6.5
    million individuals expected to participate in the Special
    Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children
    (WIC).
