title: "Readout of the President\u2019s National Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC)\
  \ Quarterly\_Meeting"
---
 
This week, the President’s National Infrastructure Advisory Council
(NIAC) held its Quarterly Business Meeting. They were welcomed by White
House Homeland Security Advisor Dr. Liz Sherwood-Randall.  Following
their examination of cross-cutting critical infrastructure policy
challenges, members discussed and adopted a forthcoming report to the
President that identifies barriers to collaboration between critical
infrastructure sectors on matters of security and resilience,
and made several recommendations to address them.  Among the
recommendations, the report identifies the need for outcome-based goals
and mandatory standards governing the security and resilience of
critical infrastructure assets. Additionally, recognizing that failures
to critical infrastructure disproportionately impact our nation’s most
vulnerable populations, the NIAC recommended deliberately including
these vulnerable communities in planning and recovery.  Members also
highlighted the need for targeted drills and exercises to improve
incident response across interdependent infrastructure sectors and
supply chains.  The NIAC is currently comprised of 25 executive leaders
from the private sector and state, local, and tribal governments who
advise the President on how to reduce physical and cyber risks and
improve the security and resilience of the nation’s critical
infrastructure.
