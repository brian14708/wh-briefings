  s Historic Purchase of Boeing\_Aircraft"

President Biden ran for office determined to make the United States the
global leader once again in manufacturing.  Last month, Boeing completed
its second largest commercial transaction in history for over 200
aircraft to support an expansion of Air India’s commercial fleet. 
Today, Boeing completed two deals with Saudi Arabia to manufacture up to
121 Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft equipped with General Electric’s most
advanced GEnex engines.  These landmark deals with Saudi Arabia – one to
anchor a new airline and another to expand an existing fleet – are
valued at nearly $37 billion.  In a period of weeks, Boeing has closed
two of its largest transactions in the history of the company. 
Together, these deals will support over one million American jobs in the
aerospace supply chain across 44 states.  The most recent deals with
Saudi Arabia alone support more than 140,000 American jobs, many of
which do not require a four year college degree.  We are particularly
pleased that Boeing was able to finally conclude these deals with Saudi
Arabia after years of discussions, and intensive negotiations over
recent months.  Today’s announcement ensures that Boeing and General
Electric will anchor Saudi Arabia’s new international airline together
with support for a new international airport.  This partnership is
another milestone in eight decades of cooperation between Saudi Arabia
and American industry.  Our administration looks forward to working with
Saudi Arabia and all partners in the Middle East to support a more
prosperous, secure, and integrated region, which ultimately benefits the
American people.
