title: "Readout of White\_House State Legislative Convening on Child Care Access &\_\
  Affordability"
---
 
Today, Jennifer Klein, Assistant to the President and Director of the
Gender Policy Council and Zayn Siddique, Deputy Assistant to the
President for Economic Mobility, convened state legislators working to
improve child care access and affordability across the country.  
  
High-quality, affordable child care is critical to supporting working
families, cutting costs, and driving economic growth. The vast majority
of families, however, cannot access the high-quality child care they
need. In 2019, more than three in four households reported difficulty
finding adequate care for their young children, and the same share of
center-based child care providers turned families away because they
lacked enough child care slots. Despite this demand and the critical
importance of the services they provide, child care workers—who are
disproportionately women and women of color—are among the lowest-paid in
the country and are often without employer-provided benefits.  
  
Even when families can find child care, it is too often unaffordable.
Child care expenditures represent a significant, and increasing, share
of families’ budgets, with child care prices growing by 26 percent over
the last decade. According to
[analysis](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WB/NDCP/508_WB_IssueBrief-NDCP-20230213.pdf)
from the Department of Labor Women’s Bureau, median child care prices
ranged from $5,357 to $17,171 in 2022 dollars, which is between 8% to
19.3% of median family income.  
  
President Biden knows how critical child care is for families’ economic
security and for the country’s economic prosperity. That’s why his
budget for this fiscal year includes an investment of $600 billion in
early care and education that would fund states to provide universal
preschool for four-year-olds and subsidize high-quality child care from
birth to age five for families earning up to $200,000. The lowest income
families would pay nothing out-of-pocket and most families would pay no
more than $10 a day per child. Most American families would save more
than half on their child care expenses while accessing higher-quality,
more reliable care. The Administration also recently announced the
Department of Commerce will require some grant recipients of CHIPS and
Science Act funding to ensure access to affordable, reliable,
high-quality child care for their workers with young children.  
  
States are taking important action to tackle child care access and
affordability, including by increasing supply, shoring up the workforce,
and expanding eligibility for child care assistance. Many of these
efforts are supported through
[investments](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/occ/National_ARP_Child_Care_Stabilization_Fact_Sheet.pdf)
secured by President Biden as a part of the American Rescue Plan. For
example, states are using these funds to implement payment rate
increases for child care providers to stabilize their program operations
and help increase supply. States are also investing in their workforce
through bonuses, loan repayment, and scholarships. And states are
reducing or planning to reduce copayments for working families that
receive child care assistance.  
  
White House officials thanked the legislators for their leadership and
affirmed the Administration’s support and partnership in expanding child
care access and affordability at the state level.
