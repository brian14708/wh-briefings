title: "Statement from President Joe\_Biden on Japan-ROK\_Announcement"
---
 
Today’s announcements between the Republic of Korea and Japan mark a
groundbreaking new chapter of cooperation and partnership between two of
the United States’ closest allies. With two historic foreign ministerial
statements, President Yoon and Prime Minister Kishida are taking a
critical step to forge a future for the Korean and Japanese people that
is safer, more secure, and more prosperous.  
   
The United States will continue to support the leaders of Japan and the
Republic of Korea as they take steps to translate this new understanding
into enduring progress. When fully realized, their steps will help us to
uphold and advance our shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific.  
   
As we move ahead, I look forward to continuing to strengthen and enhance
the trilateral ties between the Republic of Korea, Japan, and the United
States. As today’s announcements remind us, our countries are
stronger—and the world is safer and more prosperous—when we stand
together.
