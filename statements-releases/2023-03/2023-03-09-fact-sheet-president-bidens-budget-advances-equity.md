title: "FACT SHEET: President\_Biden\u2019s Budget Advances\_Equity"
---
 
On his first day in office, the President signed a sweeping executive
order directing the entire Federal government to advance an ambitious
equity and racial justice agenda—not as a one-year project, but as part
of a sustained commitment to make the promise of America real for every
American, including rural communities, communities of color, women and
girls, Tribal communities, LGBTQI+ individuals, people with
disabilities, and communities impacted by persistent poverty. Since
then, the Biden-Harris Administration has made significant progress
advancing equity across the Federal Government, including by releasing a
second executive order in February 2023 that strengthens the
government’s ability to create opportunities for communities and
populations that have been historically underserved, and continues to
build an America in which all can participate, prosper, and reach their
full potential.

The President’s Budget builds on that progress by making historic
investments to support underserved communities and combat racial
disparities across the Nation, including in health, education, and
economic opportunity.

**ADDRESSES INEQUITY IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM**

-   **Advances Maternal Health and Health Equity.** The United States
    has the highest maternal mortality rate among developed nations, and
    rates are disproportionately high for Black and American Indian and
    Alaska Native women. The Budget includes $471 million to support
    implementation of the [White House Blueprint for Addressing the
    Maternal Health
    Crisis](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Maternal-Health-Blueprint.pdf)
    to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity rates and address
    persistent disparities; expand maternal health initiatives in rural
    communities; implement implicit bias training for healthcare
    providers; create pregnancy medical home demonstration projects; and
    address the highest rates of perinatal health disparities, including
    by supporting the perinatal health workforce. In addition, the
    Budget requires all States to provide continuous Medicaid coverage
    for 12 months postpartum, eliminating gaps in health insurance at a
    critical time.

<!-- -->

-   **Expands Access to Quality, Affordable Health Care.** The Budget
    invests $150 billion over 10 years to improve and expand Medicaid
    home and community-based services, such as personal care services,
    which would allow older Americans and individuals with disabilities
    to remain in their homes and stay active in their communities as
    well as improve the quality of jobs for home care workers. And
    because community health centers—which provide comprehensive
    services regardless of ability to pay—serve one in three people
    living in poverty and one in five rural residents, the Budget puts
    the Health Center Program on a path to double its size and expand
    its reach. To bolster the health care workforce, the Budget provides
    a total of $966 million in 2024 to expand the National Health
    Service Corps, which provides loan repayment and scholarships to
    healthcare professionals in exchange for practicing in underserved
    areas, and a total of $350 million to expand programs that train and
    support the nursing workforce.  

<!-- -->

-   **Supports Survivors of Domestic Violence and Other Forms of
    Gender-Based Violence.** The Budget proposes significant increases
    to support and protect survivors of gender-based violence, including
    $519 million for the Family Violence Prevention and Services (FVPSA)
    program to support domestic violence survivors—double the 2023
    enacted level. This amount continues funding availability for
    FVPSA-funded resource centers, including those that support the
    LGBTQI+ community. The Budget would provide additional funding for
    domestic violence hotlines and cash assistance for survivors of
    domestic violence, as well as funding to support a project
    evaluating services for survivors at the intersection of housing
    instability, substance use coercion, and child welfare. In addition,
    the Budget would provide over $66 million for victims of human
    trafficking and survivors of torture, an increase of nearly $17
    million from the 2023 enacted level.

<!-- -->

-   **Guarantees Adequate and Stable Funding for IHS.** The
    Administration is committed to upholding the United States’ trust
    responsibility to Tribal nations by addressing the historical
    underfunding of the Indian Health Service. The enactment of an
    advance appropriation for 2024 for IHS was a historic and welcome
    step towards the goal of securing adequate and stable funding to
    improve the overall health status of American Indians and Alaska
    Natives. Building on the advance appropriation, the Budget requests
    an additional $3 billion in 2024 for a total of $8.1 billion in
    discretionary resources.  The Budget proposes all IHS resources as
    mandatory beginning in 2025. 

<!-- -->

-   **Supports Rural Health.** Rural America faces persistent
    disparities in access to health care, including higher rates of
    uninsured people, limited health care provider availability, and
    rural hospital closures. Including federal funding to provide
    Medicaid-like coverage to individuals in States that have not
    adopted Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, as the
    Budget proposes, is critical for rural communities. The Budget also
    includes investments to improve the health of rural communities,
    including by helping rural hospitals stay open, expanding the
    pipeline of rural health care workers, and facilitating access to
    quality care.

<!-- -->

-   **Invests in the Treatment and Prevention of Infectious Diseases.**
    A critical component of the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment
    to addressing health equity is addressing the disproportionate
    impact of infectious diseases on racial minorities and the LGBTQI+
    communities. The Budget invests $850 million in the Ending the HIV
    Epidemic Initiative across HHS to aggressively reduce new HIV cases,
    increase access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (also known as PrEP),
    and ensure equitable access to services and supports for those
    living with HIV.  The Budget also reduces Medicaid costs by
    eliminating barriers to accessing PrEP for Medicaid beneficiaries
    and proposes a new mandatory program to guarantee PrEP at no cost
    for all uninsured and underinsured individuals, provide essential
    wrap-around services through States, IHS, Tribal entities, and
    localities, and establish a network of community providers to reach
    underserved areas and populations. The Budget also includes a new
    mandatory proposal for a national program to significantly increase
    access to curative medications, and expand implementation of
    complementary efforts such as screening, testing, and provider
    capacity with a specific focus on high-risk populations.

**REDRESSES INEQUITY IN HOUSING**

-   **Advances Equity by Preventing and Redressing Housing
    Discrimination.** The Budget provides $90 million to support State
    and local fair housing enforcement organizations and to further
    education, outreach, and training on rights and responsibilities
    under Federal fair housing laws. The Budget also invests in HUD
    staff and technical assistance to affirmatively further fair housing
    and reduce barriers that restrict housing and neighborhood choice.

<!-- -->

-   **Expands Access to Affordable Rent through the Housing Choice
    Voucher Program.** The Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program
    currently provides 2.3 million low-income families with rental
    assistance to obtain housing in the private market. The Budget
    provides $32.7 billion, an increase of $2.4 billion over the 2023
    enacted level, to maintain services for all currently assisted
    families and—together with HCV program reserves—to expand assistance
    to an additional 180,000 households, particularly those who are
    experiencing homelessness or fleeing domestic violence.  To further
    ensure that more households have access to safe and affordable
    housing, the Budget provides $9 billion in mandatory funding to
    establish a housing voucher program for all 20,000 youth aging out
    of foster care annually; and provides $13 billion to incrementally
    expand rental assistance for 450,000 extremely low-income veteran
    families, paving a path to guaranteed assistance for all who have
    served the Nation and are in need.

<!-- -->

-   **Advances Efforts to End Homelessness.** To prevent and reduce
    homelessness, the Budget provides $3.7 billion, an increase of $116
    million over the 2023 enacted level, for HUD Homeless Assistance
    Grants to meet renewal needs and expand assistance to approximately
    25,000 additional households, including survivors of domestic
    violence and homeless youth. These targeted resources would support
    the Administration’s recently released Federal Strategic Plan to End
    Homelessness. The Budget also provides $505 million for Housing
    Opportunities for Persons with AIDS, serving a population with a
    disproportionately high rate of homelessness and providing a
    critical link to services.

<!-- -->

-   **Prevents Evictions.** To assist renters in accessing resources to
    avoid eviction, make the legal process during eviction proceedings
    fairer, and mitigate future housing instability, the Budget provides
    $3 billion in mandatory spending for competitive grants to promote
    and solidify State and local efforts to reform eviction policies by
    providing access to legal counsel, emergency rental assistance, and
    other forms of rent relief.

**ADVANCES EDUCATIONAL EQUITY AND PATHWAYS TO OPPORTUNITY**

-   **Invests in High-Poverty Schools.** To help ensure that every
    student receives a high-quality education, the Budget provides $20.5
    billion for Title I, which would continue historic progress in
    increasing Title I funding over the past two years. Title I provides
    critical funding to 90 percent of school districts across the
    Nation, helping them to provide students in low-income communities
    the academic opportunities and support they need to succeed. This
    funding addresses chronic funding gaps between high-poverty
    schools—which disproportionately serve students of color—and their
    wealthier counterparts.

<!-- -->

-   **Bolsters Support for Children with Disabilities.** Every child
    with a disability should have access to the high-quality early
    intervention, special education services, and personnel needed to
    thrive in school and graduate ready for college or a career. The
    Budget invests $16.8 billion in Individuals with Disabilities
    Education Act (IDEA) grants to support special education and related
    services for more than seven million students with disabilities in
    grades Pre-K through 12, an increase of $2.1 billion above the 2023
    enacted level. The Budget also invests $932 million in IDEA Part C
    grants that support early intervention services for infants and
    families with disabilities that are critical to supporting
    children’s developmental and academic outcomes. Increased funding
    would support States in implementing important reforms to expand
    enrollment of underserved children, including children of color,
    children from low-income families, and children living in rural
    areas. 

<!-- -->

-   **Expands Access to Affordable, High-Quality Early Child Care and
    Learning.** Too many families across America cannot access
    high-quality, affordable child care—preventing parents from working
    and holding back our entire economy. The President’s Budget enables
    states to increase child care options for more than 16 million young
    children and lowers costs so that parents can afford to send their
    children to high-quality child care. The Budget also funds a
    Federal-State partnership that provides high-quality, universal,
    free preschool to support healthy child development and ensure
    children enter kindergarten ready to succeed. The Budget provides
    $22.1 billion for HHS’s existing early care and education programs,
    an increase of $2.1 billion over the 2023 enacted level, which
    includes $9 billion for the Child Care and Development Block Grant
    to expand access to quality, affordable child care for families
    across the Nation. In addition, the Budget helps young children
    enter kindergarten ready to learn by providing $13.1 billion for
    Head Start, an increase of $1.1 billion over the 2023 enacted
    level. 

**EXPANDS JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY**

-   **Expands Workforce Training and Career-Connected Learning that
    Provide Pathways to Good Jobs**. The Budget invests in
    evidence-based training models to ensure all students and
    workers—including women, workers of color, and workers in rural
    areas—have the skills they need for the good jobs being created by
    the President’s historic legislative accomplishments. The Budget
    provides mandatory funding to expand free community college, and
    includes a $500 million discretionary program focused on free
    tuition for in-demand job training programs. The Budget invests $335
    million in Registered Apprenticeship to provide debt-free pathways
    to careers in construction, clean energy, semiconductor
    manufacturing, and other in-demand industries. The Budget also
    provides $200 million for the new Sectoral Employment through Career
    Training for Occupational Readiness (SECTOR) program, which will
    support development and expansion of public-private partnerships to
    equitably deliver high-quality training in growing industries, and
    invests $100 million to help community colleges partner with
    employers and the public workforce system to design and deliver
    effective training models in communities across the Nation. Finally,
    the Budget provides $200 million to better connect high schools to
    employers and community colleges through dual enrollment, work-based
    learning, and career advising.

<!-- -->

-   **Supports Minority-Owned Business to Narrow Racial Wealth Gaps.**
    The Budget increases the capacity of the Minority Business
    Development Agency by providing the full $110 million authorized in
    the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which would bolster services
    provided to minority-owned, including women of color-owned,
    enterprises by expanding the Business Center program, funding Rural
    Business Centers, opening new regional offices, and supporting
    innovative initiatives to foster economic resiliency.

<!-- -->

-   **Expands Access to Credit.** The Budget provides $341 million for
    the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund, an
    increase of $17 million, or 5 percent, above the 2023 enacted level,
    which provides historically underserved and often low-income
    communities access to credit, capital, and financial support to grow
    businesses, increase affordable housing, and reinforce healthy
    neighborhood development. To better address the shortage of
    long-term affordable credit for development projects in
    disadvantaged communities and unlock up to $500 million in financing
    support, the Budget also includes a $10 million subsidy for the CDFI
    Fund’s Bond Guarantee Program. 

<!-- -->

-   **Supports Economic Opportunity in Rural and Tribal Communities.**
    The Budget provides $32 million to expand the Rural Partners Network
    (RPN), an all-of-government program led by the U.S. Department of
    Agriculture that partners with rural and Tribal communities to
    access resources and funding to create local jobs, build
    infrastructure, and support long-term economic stability on their
    own terms. Through RPN, USDA is hiring new full-time federal staff
    who are from the region to work hand in hand with RPN community
    leaders. This investment will also support Rural.gov, a
    one-stop-shop for all rural communities to access Federal resources.

**ADVANCES ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE**

-   **Bolsters Climate Resilience.** The Budget invests more than $24
    billion to help build communities’ resilience to floods, wildfires,
    storms, extreme heat, and drought brought on by climate change,
    expand conservation and ecosystem management, strengthen America’s
    natural disaster response capabilities, increase the resilience of
    rural housing to the impacts of climate change while reducing rent
    burdens, and ensure the resilience of our nation’s defense to
    climate change.

<!-- -->

-   **Advances Equity and Environmental Justice.** The Administration
    continues to prioritize efforts to deliver environmental justice in
    communities across the United States, including meeting the
    President’s Justice40 commitment to ensure at least 40 percent of
    the benefits of Federal investments in climate and clean energy
    reach disadvantaged communities, including rural and Tribal
    communities. The Budget bolsters these efforts by investing nearly
    $1.8 billion across EPA to support creating high-quality jobs,
    cleaning up pollution, implementing the Justice40 Initiative,
    advancing racial equity, and securing environmental justice for
    communities that bear the brunt of toxic pollution and impacts of
    climate change, including the increased health risks. The Budget
    also ensures Federal agencies will have the staff and resources they
    need to advance racial equity and to promote environmental, health,
    and civil rights protection for communities nationwide, to fulfill
    the Administration’s whole-of-government equity and environmental
    justice objectives.  

<!-- -->

-   **Supports the President’s Goal of Accelerating the Replacement of
    All Lead Pipes and Upgrades the Nation’s Drinking Water and
    Wastewater Infrastructure.** The Budget includes $219 million to
    remediate lead contamination in water and updates the
    cross-Government Lead Pipe Replacement Funding Inventory that was
    published for the first time with the 2023 President’s Budget. The
    Budget also provides EPA more than $4 billion for water
    infrastructure to advance efforts to upgrade drinking water and
    wastewater infrastructure nationwide, with a focus on decreasing
    health disparities in underserved and rural communities that have
    historically been overlooked.

<!-- -->

-   **Reduces Health and Environmental Hazards for At-Risk
    Communities.** The Budget includes nearly $8.5 billion for DOE to
    support the cleanup of communities used during the Manhattan Project
    and Cold War for nuclear weapons production and ensure cleanup
    remedies protect human health and the environment. The Budget also
    provides approximately $356 million for EPA’s Superfund program to
    continue cleaning up some of the Nation’s most contaminated land and
    respond to environmental emergencies and natural disasters as part
    of a cancer prevention strategy. In addition, an estimated $2.5
    billion in Superfund tax revenue will be available to EPA in 2024.
    The Administration will ensure investments for the cleanup of legacy
    pollution advance the Justice40 Initiative and benefit disadvantaged
    communities.

**STRENGTHENS THE CARE ECONOMY**

-   **Provides National, Comprehensive Paid Family and Medical Leave.**
    The vast majority of America’s workers do not have access to paid
    family leave, including three out of four private sector workers.
    Among the lowest-paid workers, who are predominately women and
    workers of color, 92 percent have no access to paid family leave
    through their employers. The Budget proposes to establish a
    national, comprehensive paid family and medical leave program,
    providing up to 12 weeks of leave to allow eligible workers to take
    time off to care for and bond with a new child; care for a seriously
    ill loved one; heal from their own serious illness; address
    circumstances arising from a loved one’s military deployment; or
    find safety from domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking.

<!-- -->

-   **Calls for Paid Sick Leave for All Workers.** Millions of workers
    in America have to choose between a needed paycheck and taking care
    of a family member or themselves when they’re sick. Workers without
    paid sick days are more likely to go to work when sick, send their
    child to school when sick, and do without the healthcare they need
    to get better. Paid sick days are good for business, leading to
    lower employee turnover and increased productivity, and reducing the
    spread of contagious diseases. The President calls on the Congress
    to require employers to provide seven job-protected paid sick days
    each year to all workers and ensure that employers cannot penalize
    workers for taking time off to address their health needs, the
    health needs of their families or to seek safety from domestic
    violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.

<!-- -->

-   **Advances Equity in the Child Welfare System.** Improving the child
    welfare system will benefit all Americans, including the Black and
    Native American families who are overrepresented in, and too often
    failed by, the current system. The Budget proposes to expand and
    incentivize the use of evidence-based foster care prevention
    services to keep families safely together and reduce the number of
    children entering foster care. The Budget provides States with
    support and incentives to place more foster children with relatives
    or other adults who have an existing emotional bond with the
    children and fewer children in group homes and institutions, while
    also providing additional funding to support youth who age out of
    care without a permanent caregiver. The Budget proposes to nearly
    double flexible funding for States through the Promoting Safe and
    Stable Families program, and proposes new provisions to expand
    access to legal representation for children and families in the
    child welfare system. In addition, the Budget proposes to make the
    adoption tax credit refundable and to extend the credit to legal
    guardianships, which would reduce the financial burden on low- and
    moderate-income families wishing to pursue adoption as well as for
    families who opt for legal guardianship.

**COMMITS TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND INVESTS IN CIVIL RIGHTS**

-   **Invests in Federal Law Enforcement, Public Safety, Community
    Violence Interventions, and Prevention to Combat Gun Violence and
    Other Violent Crime.** The Budget makes robust investments to
    bolster Federal law enforcement capacity. The Budget includes $17.8
    billion for DOJ law enforcement, including a total of nearly $2
    billion for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives
    (ATF) to expand multijurisdictional gun trafﬁcking strike forces
    with additional personnel, increase regulation of the ﬁrearms
    industry, and implement the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. The
    Budget also includes $1.9 billion for the U.S. Marshals Service to
    support personnel dedicated to ﬁghting violent crime, including
    through fugitive apprehension and enforcement operations. And the
    Budget provides $51 million to the Federal Bureau of Investigation
    (FBI) to support the continued implementation of enhanced background
    checks required by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and provides
    the U.S. Attorneys with an additional $16.7 million to add 130 new
    personnel to support the prosecution of violent crimes. The Budget
    also continues to fund the President’s comprehensive Safer America
    Plan, including funding to put 100,000 additional police officers on
    our streets for accountable, community-oriented policing.

<!-- -->

-   **Supports Effective and Accountable State, Local, and Tribal Law
    Enforcement and Public Safety.** The Budget provides DOJ $4.9
    billion in discretionary resources for State and local grants to
    enhance public safety, including $537 million for the COPS Hiring
    Program, and $30 billion in mandatory resources to fully fund
    President Biden’s Safer America Plan, a comprehensive blueprint to
    protect the safety of our communities through evidence-based
    strategies that promote effective and accountable crime prevention.
    As part of the Safer America plan, the Budget includes funding to
    put 100,00 additional police officers on the street for accountable
    community policing. The officers will be recruited, trained, hired,
    and supervised — consistent with the standards in the President’s
    Executive Order — in order to enhance trust and public safety. The
    Budget requests $19.4 billion over 10 years for crime prevention
    strategies and affirms the President’s goal to provide $5 billion
    over 10 years for community violence interventions. The Budget also
    includes $717 million, an $86 million increase, in Tribal public
    safety and justice funding at the Department of the Interior.

<!-- -->

-   **Reinvigorates Federal Civil Rights Enforcement.** In order to
    address longstanding inequities and strengthen civil rights
    protections, the Budget invests $252 million, an increase of $62
    million over the 2023 enacted level, in the DOJ Civil Rights
    Division. These resources would support police reform via
    pattern-or-practice investigations, the prosecution of hate crimes,
    enforcement of voting rights, and efforts to provide equitable
    access to justice. 

<!-- -->

-   **Prioritizes Efforts to End Gender-Based Violence.** The Budget
    proposes $1 billion to support implementation of programs through
    the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (VAWA), which was recently
    reauthorized and strengthened in 2022. This is a $300 million or
    43-percent increase over the 2023 enacted level, which was the
    highest funding level in history. The Budget funds new VAWA programs
    to address online abuse, and provides substantial increases for
    longstanding VAWA programs, including key investments in legal
    assistance for victims, transitional housing, and sexual assault
    services. In addition, the Budget provides $120 million, an increase
    of $65 million above the 2023 enacted level, to the Ofﬁce of Justice
    Programs for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative to address the rape
    kit backlog, and for the Regional Sexual Assault Investigative
    Training Academies Program.

<!-- -->

-   **Improves Public Safety and Fairness in Criminal and Juvenile
    Justice Systems.** The Budget advances and invests in comprehensive,
    evidence-informed, and high-impact initiatives to enhance public
    safety and advance equity in the criminal and juvenile justice
    systems. The Budget supports key investments to provide
    comprehensive, intensive, and market-driven workforce development
    services and reentry to people in the Federal prison system. The
    Budget also invests $300 million to support the first year of a new
    ten-year Accelerating Justice System Reform program as part of the
    President’s Safer America Plan, with a total of $14.7 billion in
    mandatory funding requested over the following nine years, which
    will provide state, local, and tribal governments with additional
    resources they need to advance evidence-based strategies that will
    prevent violence and ease the burden on law enforcement and the
    court system in cases that do not merit their intervention. Doing so
    not only enhances public safety, but also delivers evidence-based
    criminal justice reform that advances equity. The Budget also
    proposes $760 million for juvenile justice programs, an increase of
    $360 million over the 2023 enacted level, to bolster diversionary
    juvenile justice strategies.

**PROMOTES EQUITY ACROSS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES**

-   **Improves Language Access.** The Budget proposes funding for
    multiple agencies, including HHS, DOJ, and DOL, to strengthen
    language access services to promote meaningful access to government
    programs, services, and benefits for individuals with limited
    English proficiency (LEP).

<!-- -->

-   **Enables the Census to Reach Historically Undercounted
    Populations.** The Budget provides resources for the Census Bureau
    within the Department of Commerce for research and design work on
    the 2030 Census focused on better reaching and engaging historically
    undercounted populations, such as the Latino and Black populations,
    and the American Indian and Alaskan Native communities who live on
    reservations.

<!-- -->

-   **Helps Underserved Communities Navigate Federal Funding
    Opportunities.** The Budget proposes $20 million for the Economic
    Development Administration within DOC to advance the Department’s
    commitment to increase outreach and support for Indigenous
    communities, with a particular focus on supporting awareness and
    technical assistance for financial assistance opportunities.

<!-- -->

-   **Improves Access to Social Security Services.** The Administration
    is committed to making it easier for people to access the services
    they rely on, including individuals experiencing homelessness,
    children with disabilities, and people with mental and intellectual
    disabilities.  The Budget makes investments in the Social Security
    Administration to decrease customer wait times, simplify the
    Supplemental Security Income application processes, and increase
    outreach to people who are difficult to reach. SSA would also
    continue to modernize its information technology systems to make
    more services available online and improve 800 Number access for
    those who call.
